12 Ch. 6. Workmen's Compensation 6 & 7 Geo. 6

Act, 1943.

the tribunal shall disregard those earnings, either wholly or to such extent as the tribunal thinks proper, and accordingly may treat the widow as wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the workman at the time of his death.

(2) Where, in any such case, a female member of the workman's family other than his widow claims compensation as aforesaid, the tribunal by whom the claim is dealt with shall treat her, for the purposes of the last foregoing subsection, as if she were the widow of the workman, if the tribunal is satisfied that—

(a) she was acting as housekeeper to the workman at the

time of his death (otherwise than in a temporary capacity by reason of the accident); or

(b) she was acting as housekeeper to the workman at the

time when she entered into the employment in question and would have been so acting at the time of the workman's death if she had not entered into the said employment.

(3) In this section, any reference to the tribunal by whom a claim is dealt with shall be construed as a reference to the county court judge, arbitrator, committee or board by whom the claim is settled or to the registrar or county court judge exercising powers under section twenty-five of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1925, in relation to any agreement for the settlement of the claim, and the expression “ the war” means any war in which His Majesty is engaged.

(4) This section shall not apply to any deaths taking place before the passing of this Act, and shall expire on such date as His Majesty may by Order in Council appoint, but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.

(b) any supplementary allowances payable in respect of any

such weekly payment or the total amount of the supplementary allowances payable in respect of any such weekly payment,

the average weekly earnings of the workman before the accident shall, if and whenever a change occurs after the date of the accident in the rates of remuneration obtaining in the class of employment in which the workman was employed during the relevant period before the accident, be deemed, so long as the changed rates obtain without further change, to be the average

1943-

weekly earnings which he would have earned during that period if the changed rates had obtained throughout that period.

(2) For the purpose of calculating any such weekly payment or supplementary allowances as aforesaid, the average weekly earnings of the workman before the accident shall, if any change or changes occurred in the relevant period before the accident in the rates of remuneration obtaining in the class of employment in which the workman was employed during that period, be deemed, subject to the last foregoing subsection, to be the average weekly earnings which he would have earned during that period if the rates obtaining at the date of the accident had obtained throughout that period.

(3) Where any such weekly payment has been increased under subsection (2) of section eleven of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1925, or under that subsection as applied by any such scheme as aforesaid, and, on any subsequent review of the weekly payment, it appears to the tribunal that any material change in rates of remuneration has occurred since the date when the weekly payment was so increased or (if it has been varied under this subsection) since the date of the last such variation, and that the amount of the weekly payment would have been fixed at that date at a higher or lower figure if the rates of remuneration obtaining at the date of the subsequent review had obtained at the date aforesaid, the tribunal may (subject to the maximum provided in section nine of the said Act) make such increase or reduction of the weekly payment and of any supplementary allowances payable in respect thereof as, having regard to the said change in rates of remuneration and any other material change of circumstances, the tribunal thinks proper.

(4) In this section the expression “the relevant period” means, in relation to any accident, the period before the accident by reference to which the average weekly earnings of the workman are calculated under sections nine and ten of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1925, and the expression " the tribunal ” means, in relation to any weekly payment, the county court judge, arbitrator, committee or board by whom any review of the payment is, in default of agreement, carried out.

(5) This section shall extend to cases where the accident took place before the passing of this Act and to changes in rates of remuneration occurring before the passing of this Act:

Provided that this section shall not affect the amount of any weekly payment payable in respect of any week commencing before the passing of this Act. 6 *

(6) Subsection (3) of section eleven of the Workmen’s Compen-

(a) In the case of a developed hereditament, the payment shall be a payment of cost of works unless the damage involves total loss, that is to say, is such that the proper cost (as defined in subsection (3) of section three of this Act, with the substitution for the reference therein to the time when works are executed of a reference to the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine) of such works as would be required for reinstating the hereditament in the form in which it existed immediately before the occurrence of the damage would be likely to be more than the difference between the amounts respectively which the fee simple in the hereditament might have been expected to realise—

(i) on a sale thereof in the state in which it would be after the execution of those works, and

(ii) on a sale thereof as a site and with the damage not made good,

being in each case a sale made on the said thirty-first day of March, and being in each case a sale in the open market with vacant possession, subject to any right or restriction such as is mentioned in subsection (5) of section three of this Act to which the hereditament was subject at the time immediately after the occurrence of the damage, but free from any other incumbrance (or, in the case of a hereditament in Scotland, from any ground annual or other incumbrance and any liability to pay feuduty) and without regard to any liability of the hereditament to become subject after that time to any restriction by virtue of any enactment:

Provided that, in the case of hereditaments consisting of or comprising premises of a kind not normally the subject of sales in the open market, provision may be made by regulations made by the Treasury for substituting in this paragraph, for the references to the amounts respectively therein mentioned, references to values ascertained by reference to such matters as may be specified in the regulations.

2. In paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section six of the principal Act (which confers a right of appeal to a referee), the following words shall be substituted for the words from the beginning of the paragraph to the word “Act", namely, “ as to the amount which the fee simple in a hereditament might have been expected to realise in the circumstances specified in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section four of this Act or as to the value of a hereditament the value of which is to be ascertained under the regulations therein mentioned ".

3. Paragraph 2 of the Third Schedule to the principal Act shall be amended by substituting the following words for the words from the beginning of that paragraph to the beginning of the proviso thereto and for the sub-paragraph inserted at the end of that paragraph by the Fourth Schedule to the amending Act, that is to say—

" Where a developed hereditament, being or including a developed hereditament which has already sustained (whether on a single occasion or on two or more occasions) war damage not being such that a value payment is to be made in respect thereof, sustains on a subsequent occasion war damage such that, on a determination taken in relation to all the war damage under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section four of this Act (with the substitution for the reference therein to the time immediately before the occurrence of the damage of a reference to the time immediately before the earliest occasion, and for the references therein to the time immediately after the occurrence of the damage of references to the time immediately after the said subsequent occasion) a value payment would fall to be made, the Commission may determine that a single value payment shall be made in respect of all the war damage as if it had all occurred on the earliest occasion, to the exclusion of any other payment in respect of any of it."

4. In sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of the First Schedule to the amending Act (which relates to the valuation of licensed premises) after the words “the value of the premises or of any interest therein " there shall be inserted the words “or the amount which the premises or any interest therein might have been expected to realise ".

(4) The last foregoing subsection shall not be taken as requiring all the persons so affected to be made parties to the application, and rules made under this Act shall make provision for the persons who are to be made parties to any such application, and may provide that, in such cases as may be prescribed by the rules, and in particular in cases where the mortgagor has died and no person has taken out representation in respect of the property, the application may be made ex parte.

hereditament, the payment shall be a value payment unless the permissible amount of a payment of cost of works, determined by reference to proper cost ascertained as at the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, would be likely to be less than the amount of a value payment in respect of the damage.

(2) War damage to a developed hereditament shall be deemed to involve total loss if, and only if, it is such that the proper cost, ascertained as at the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, of such works as would be required for reinstating the hereditament in the form in which it existed immediately before the occurrence of the damage would be likely to be more than the difference between the amounts respectively, ascertained by reference to prices current at that day, which the fee simple in the hereditament might have been expected to realise—

(a) on a sale thereof in the state in which it would be after

the execution of those works, and

(b) on a sale thereof as a site and with the damage not made

good,

being in each case a sale such as is specified in paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to this Act made on that day :

Where the appropriate payment in respect of war damage to a hereditament would apart from this provision be a value payment, if it appears to the Commission to be expedient so to do having regard to the effect that the making good of the damage would have in relation to the value of another hereditament, they may make in respect of the damage either—

(a) a payment of cost of works; or

(b) payments as specified in paragraphs (a) and ( ) respec-

tively of subsection (1) of section thirteen of this Act, but limited as respects the payment to be made under the said paragraph (a) to works appearing to the Commission to be expedient having regard to their effect on the value of that other hereditament.

16. —(1) Where a developed hereditament, being or including a developed hereditament which has already sustained (whether on a single occasion or on two or more occasions) war damage not being such that a value payment is to be made in respect thereof, sustains on a subsequent occasion war damage such that a value payment would fall to be made if a determination were taken

Provided that—

(a) subsection (2) of section six of this Act shall have effect both in relation to such'temporary works as are therein mentioned, and also in relation to any works appearing to the Commission to have been reasonably executed for making good any of the damage sustained on an occasion earlier than the said subsequent occasion notwithstanding that they may not have been of a temporary character;

(b) any payment of cost of works, or any part of any such

payment, made in respect of any of the damage shall not be recoverable, but shall be taken into account in determining the amount, if any, to be paid under the preceding proviso;

(c) if the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was

immediately after the damage sustained on the said subsequent occasion is less by any amount that it would otherwise have been by reason of any physical change therein not directly attributable to war damage (other than ordinary wear and tear) occurring between the earliest occasion and the said subsequent occasion, the amount of the single value payment shall be reduced by that amount;

(d) the interest on the single value payment shall accrue from

the said subsequent occasion; and

(e) the material time shall be the time immediately before the occurrence of the war damage sustained on the said subsequent occasion.

(2) Where a value payment is to be made in respect of war damage sustained (whether on a single occasion or on two or more occasions) by a developed hereditament, any war damage sustained by the hereditament on a subsequent occasion shall be taken into account in determining the amount of that payment as if that damage had occurred on the earliest occasion, and no separate payment shall be made in respect thereof.

(3) The Commission may determine that war damage sustained by a hereditament other than a developed hereditament on any two or more occasions shall be taken into account together for the

cont. earliest occasion, and shall be the subject of a single value payment

or payment of cost of works accordingly:

Provided that, where the single payment in respect of that damage is a value payment, the provisos to subsection (1) of this section shall have effect in relation thereto as they have effect in relation to a single value payment to be made under that subsection, with the substitution, for each reference therein to the subsequent occasion therein mentioned, of a reference to such one of the occasions of damage taken into account under this subsection as the Commission may determine.

(4) Subject as aforesaid the references in sections seven, eight and ten of this Act to war damage shall be construed as references to war damage occurring on a single occasion, and accordingly the nature and amount of the payment to be made in respect of war damage occurring on each of two or more occasions shall, subject as aforesaid, be determined separately.

(5) In this section references to war damage sustained, or occurring, on any occasion include references to war damage that results subsequently from the taking on that occasion of such action or measures as are specified in section two of this Act.

Amount of 17.

Provided that, in the case of a person who has incurred such cost as aforesaid in relation to war damage sustained by the same hereditament on two or more occasions, or in executing works on two or more developed hereditaments in the same locality, the whole of such cost shall be taken into account together for the purposes of this subsection.

In this subsection the expression " locality ” means, in relation to England, the area of a local authority for the purposes of Part II of the Housing Act, 1936, in relation to Scotland a county 26 Geo. 5. & or burgh, and in relation to Northern Ireland the district of 1 Edw- 8. c. 51. a local authority for the purposes of Part II of the Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1939.

(2) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this Part of this Act, the Commission shall not be required to entertain a claim for a payment in respect of war damage to a hereditament not being a developed hereditament, being damage in respect of which the appropriate payment is a value payment, if the total amount of the depreciation in the value of the hereditament caused by the war damage, and of the cost of executing works on the hereditament in relation to such war damage which apart from this provision would be the subject of a temporary works payment, is less than five pounds :

Provided that, in the case of such a hereditament which sustains war damage on two or more occasions, the said depreciation and cost attributable to the war damage occurring on those occasions respectively shall be taken into account together for the purposes of this subsection, and, if the hereditament also sustains war damage in respect of which a payment of cost of works is the appropriate payment, the amount of that payment shall be included in the said total for those purposes.

and of the interest thereon as is attributable to that proprietaiy interest shall vest in the mortgagee, and the mortgagee shall be liable to account therefor as if so much of the payment and of the interest thereon as he is entitled to receive had been respectively proceeds of sale of that proprietary interest arising under a power of sale exercised by the mortgagee at the material time and interest on such proceeds, except that the mortgagee shall not be entitled to credit for any costs incurred by him in connection with the claiming, ascertainment, apportionment or making of the payment :

Provided that—

(a) if at the time when the payment is made the debt secured

by a mortgage (other than any part thereof representing costs for which the mortagee would not be entitled to credit) has been paid in full, the payment shall be disposed of as if the proprietary interest had not been subject to that mortgage;

(b) if the proprietary interest was subject to two or more

successive mortgages, this subsection shall have effect with the substitution for references to the mortgagee of references to the first mortgagee, or, if the preceding paragraph has effect in relation to his mortgage, to the second mortgagee, and so on; and

(a) that the amount of the rentcharge so far as attributable to land in the hereditament then subject thereto (in this Act referred to as " the charged land in the hereditament ”) exceeded the available annual value of that land as depreciated by the war damage; and

H 2

that at the time when the question whether this condition is satisfied falls to be determined no building sufficient to make good the excess has been carried out, or, having regard to all the circumstances (including any undertaking required under paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of section twenty of this Act), is likely to be carried out within a reasonable period after the time when the discharge of the value payment becomes permissible;

a right to receive a part of .the value payment shall vest in the person who was the owner of the rentcharge at the material time, and, where the said right is exercised, effect shall be given thereto out of so much of the value payment as is attributable to the proprietary interest out of which the rentcharge was created in the charged land in the hereditament.

(2) Where the said right is exercised—

(a) the part of the value payment to be paid in respect of the rentcharge shall be an amount equal to the capital equivalent of the excess mentioned in the preceding subsection, so however that, if the amount of the rentcharge so far as attributable to the charged land in the hereditament was at the material time greater by any sum than the available annual value of that land apart from any war damage, the part of the value payment to be paid in respect of the rentcharge shall be computed as if the said excess had been reduced by that sum; and

(b) so much of the rentcharge as is equal to the said excess shall be extinguished on the date on which the part of the value payment to be paid in respect of the rentcharge is paid, and, as between the persons interested in the charged land in the hereditament on the one hand and in any other land subject to the rentcharge on the other hand, the proper share of the persons interested in the charged land in the hereditament of the liability for the residue of the rentcharge in respect of any period after the extinguishment shall be treated as being an amount per annum equal to the available annual value of the charged land in the hereditament as depreciated by the war damage.

(3) Where the said right is exercised—

(a) if the right to receive so much of the value payment as is attributable to the proprietary interest out of which the rentcharge was created in the charged land in the hereditament is vested under the last preceding section in a mortgagee of that interest, then, if the mortgage had priority to the rentcharge, effect shall be given to the right conferred by this section on the owner of the

(6) if the rentcharge was itself subject to a mortgage at the material time, the last preceding section shall have effect in relation to the part of the value payment to be paid in respect of the rentcharge as it has effect in relation to so much of a value payment as is attributable to a mortgaged proprietary interest, with the substitution for references therein to such an interest of references to the rentcharge.

(4) Regulations may be made by the Treasury as to the exercise of the right conferred by this section on the owner of a rentcharge and the manner in which effect is to be given to the said right where exercised, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by this subsection, regulations so made may make provision as to the matters aforesaid in cases in which the charged land in a hereditament is a part only of the hereditament, or was in divided ownership at the material time, or in which a proprietary interest or rentcharge was subject to a mortgage at that time.

The provisions of section thirty-one of this Act which have effect in relation to regulations made under that section shall have effect in relation to regulations made under this section.

(5) As regards cases in which the title to a rentcharge, or to land subject thereto, is registered under the Land Registration Act, 1925, such provision may, without prejudice to the generality of section one hundred and forty-four of that Act, be made by rules under that section as may be expedient in consequence of the provisions of this section, and in particular for securing (by the imposition of conditions as to the exercise of the said right thereby conferred or otherwise) that the extinguishment of any of a rentcharge by virtue of this section shall not take effect without notice thereof being entered on the register.

Provided that where the land is comprised in more than one contributory property—

(a) if the same person is not the direct contributor for all the contributory properties comprising the land, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, in consultation with the rating authority for the area in which those properties are situated, shall apportion to each property or group of properties having a separate direct contributor such part of the instalment in respect of the rights as, having regard to the contributory values of the properties, they may determine;

(b) the said Commissioners, in consultation with the authority aforesaid, shall, on the application of any person interested as, or as a mortgagee of, a direct or indirect contributor for any of the properties, certify the part of the instalment in respect of the rights which, having regard to the contributory values of the properties, is apportionable to the property in question,

(4) Subject to the provisions of the two last preceding subsections, an instalment of contribution in respect of a contributory property consisting of such rights as aforesaid shall be payable notwithstanding that at the relevant date the rights no longer subsist, or, in the case of such rights as are mentioned in section six of the Rating Act, 1874, are no longer severed from the occupation of the land.

(5) Nothing in the preceding provisions of this section shall be construed as affecting any liability for an instalment of contribution in respect of a property which was the subject of a valuation for rating purposes by virtue of the occupation of land.

(6) In the application of this section to Scotland, for any reference to rights mentioned in section six of the Rating Act, 1874, there shall be substituted a reference to shooting or fishings other than salmon, oyster or mussel fishings; and subsection (3) and the last preceding subsection shall not have effect. 7

2. The “ capital equivalent ” of the excess of the amount of the rentcharge so far as attributable to the charged land in the hereditament over the available annual value of that land as depreciated by the war damage shall be taken to be that excess multiplied by the number of years purchase which the rentcharge might have been expected to realise on a sale thereof made in the open market on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, if on that day the rent-charge had been subsisting with the like incidents in all respects as it had at the material time, and the hereditament had been in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the war damage thereto, and the annual value of any land outside the hereditament subject to the rentcharge had been its annual value apart from any war damage.

3. The “ annual value of the charged land in the hereditament as depreciated by the war damage ” shall—

6. The “ amount attributable ’* to any land of a rentcharge, or of rent reserved by a lease, shall, where at the material time that land was the only land subject to the rentcharge, or out of which the rent issued, be taken to be the whole amount of the rentcharge payable, or of the rent reserved, for the year in which that time fell, and, where it was nof, shall be determined by apportioning or allocating to that land so much (if any) of that whole amount as may be appropriate, having regard—

(a) primarily, to any apportionment or allocation of that rent-charge or rent which may have been made' otherwise than so as to be binding on the owner of that rentcharge or on the landlord, as the case may be, before the occurrence of any war damage to any of the land subject to that rent-charge or rent; and

(i) if the Commissioners think fit, the direction may apportion

the said sum among all or any of the persons who would otherwise be jointly and severally liable as aforesaid, and where a part of the said sum is apportioned to more than one of the said persons, that portion of the said sum shall be a joint and several liability of the particular persons to whom it is apportioned and not of any other persons; and

(ii) where any person has (apart from this section) obtained financial benefits as aforesaid but only by reason of the transfer by him of shares which he did not obtain under any such transaction as aforesaid and he has not, apart from that transfer, been concerned in any such transaction as aforesaid, the direction shall apportion the said sum so that there is apportioned to him no greater part thereof than is equal to the amount by which he is, under subsection (4) of this section, deemed to have (apart from this section) financially benefited.

(b) if they did not obtain the shares under any such trans-

action as aforesaid, to the extent by which the con-' sideration which they obtained for the shares is greater than it might have been expected to be if the stock had been sold by the company immediately before the transfer in such circumstances that the full tax became payable by or in respect of the company.

(5) For the purposes of this section, a barrister, solicitor or accountant shall not be treated as having obtained financial benefits by reason only that he received in the ordinary course of his profession remuneration in respect of ordinary professional services rendered in connection with any such transaction as aforesaid at a rate not greater than that customary in the profession for services of such a character, a person who carries on a banking business shall not be treated as having obtained financial benefits by reason only that he received interest at not more than the normal rate on a loan made by him in connection with any such transaction as aforesaid, and a person who carries on a business which includes dealing in stock of the kind to which a direction under subsection (1) of this section relates shall not be treated as having obtained financial benefits by reason only that he bought some or all of the stock in question at a price representing the full market value thereof and disposed thereof at a profit.

(6) A direction under this section may be given notwithstanding that a direction in relation to the transactions in question or some of them has been given or might have been given under section thirty-five of the Finance Act, 1941, and any direction given under

An Act to bring under planning control land which is not subject to a scheme or resolution under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, to secure more effective control of development pending the coming into operation of planning schemes, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[22nd July 1943.]

BE it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Application of planning resolutions to land not already subject to planning schemes or resolutions.

1.—(1) After the expiration of the period of three months beginning with the date of the commencement of this £ct, all land which is not already the subject of a scheme in force under the principal Act or any enactment thereby repealed, or of a resolution in force under that Act to prepare or adopt such a scheme, shall be subject to a resolution to prepare a scheme under that Act, which shall be deemed to have been duly passed by the local authority for the district in which the land is situated and to have been approved by the Minister and to have taken effect accordingly at the expiration of that period:

Provided that the Minister may, by order made at any time before the expiration of the said period, direct that this section

1943- Town and Country PlanCh. 29. 285

(Interim Development) Act, 1943.

shall have effect in relation to any land specified in the order as if for the reference to the local authority for the district in which the land is situated there were substituted a reference to such other local authority or such county council or joint committee as may be so specified.

(2) It shall not be necessary to publish or serve upon any person notice of a resolution to prepare a scheme which takes effect by virtue of this section, or to compile a register for the purposes of the scheme to be made in pursuance thereof, and accordingly the provisions of section seven of the principal Act shall not apply in relation to any such resolution.

2.—(1) The proviso to subsection (3) of section ten of the Refusal and principal Act (which requires that applications for permission postponement to develop land made under an interim development order must “terim in certain cases be granted or granted unconditionally) shall appii2S»ns. cease to have effect.

(2) An interim development authority may, by a notice of postponement served in the prescribed manner on the applicant, postpone the consideration of any interim development application either generally or during such period as may be specified in the notice, unless the applicant shows to their satisfaction that the proposed development would be carried out immediately if the application were granted :

Provided that—

(a) the applicant may appeal against any such notice to a

court of summary jurisdiction for the petty sessional division or place within which the land or building to which the application relates is situated, by means of a notice served on the clerk of the court and on the interim development authority within twenty-eight days after the date of the service on the applicant of the notice of postponement, and the court, if satisfied that the development would be carried out immediately if the application were granted, shall by order cancel the notice of postponement;

(b) if with respect to any interim development application

it appears to the Minister that there are exceptional reasons requiring the immediate determination thereof, he may, without prejudice to his power to require the application to be referred to him for decision in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this Act, give directions requiring the interim development authority to determine the application, and, where a notice of postponement has been served with respect thereto, may by order cancel the notice.

(3) So much of subsection (3) of section ten of the principal Act as provides that any application for permission to develop land

• Ch. 29.

mTown and Country Planning 6 & 7 Geo. 6.

- (Interim Development) , 1943.

made under an interim development order shall be deemed to be granted unless it is refused within the period specified in that subsection shall cease to have effect, and any such application shall be deemed to be refused at the expiration of two months from the date of the receipt thereof unless within that period—

(a) notice has been given to the applicant that the application has been determined by that authority or has been referred to the Minister for decision in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this Act; or

(b) the consideration of the application has been postponed by a notice of postponement under the last foregoing subsection;

and any such application of which the consideration has been so postponed for any period shall be deemed to be refused at the expiration of two months from the end of that period unless within those two months notice has been given to the applicant as aforesaid or its consideration has again been postponed by virtue of a further notice of postponement:

Provided that—

(i) any such period of two months may, at any time before

the expiration thereof, be extended by agreement in writing made between the interim development authority and the applicant;

(ii) where a notice of postponement served with respect to any application is cancelled by an order made by the Minister or in proceedings instituted before a court of summary jurisdiction under this section, this subsection shall have effect in relation to the application as if for the reference therein to the date of the receipt of the application there were substituted a reference to the date of the order of the Minister, or, as the case may be, to the date of the final determination of the proceedings.

(4) In relation to any application which, under the provisions of this section, is deemed to be refused at the expiration of any period, the provisions of subsection (5) of section ten of the principal Act (which relates to appeals to the Minister) shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the date on which the applicant received notice of the decision of the authority there were substituted a reference to the expiration of that period.

(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the duty of an interim development authority—

(a) to take into consideration with reasonable dispatch all interim'development applications made to them, other than applications the consideration of which is postponed under the provisions of this section or which are referred

1943-

Town and Country Planning

[Interim Development) Act, 1943.

Ch. 29.

287

to the Minister for decision in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this Act; and

(b) to give notice to the applicant of their decision upon the consideration of any such application, including, where the application is refused or granted subject to conditions, a statement of the reasons for their decision.

3.—(1) Where, on an interim development application, permission for the erection, construction or carrying out of any building or work, or for any use of any building or land, has been granted, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, for a limited period only, then, subject to the provisions of this section, the building, work or use shall not hi deemed for the purposes of a scheme under the principal Act to be an existing building, an existing work or an existing use, as the case may be, by reason only of that permission.

(2) Where the period for which any such permission was granted has not expired on the date on which the scheme comes into operation, then, during the remainder of that period—

(a) subsections (3) and (6) of section thirteen of the principal

Act, and subsection (2) of section twenty of that Act (which make special provision, in the case of existing buildings, works, and uses, with respect to the time for service of notice of action proposed to be taken under the said section thirteen, the recovery of expenses incurred in taking such action, and the payment of compensation in respect of any such action); and

(b) any provision included in the scheme in accordance with

paragraph (ii) of subsection (2) of section nineteen of the principal Act (which relates to the maintenance, alteration and replacement of existing buildings and the continuation of the existing use of such buildings),

shall apply in relation to the building, work, or use, as the case may be, as those provisions apply in relation to existing buildings, existing works, or existing uses respectively:

Provided that, in calculating any compensation payable under the principal Act in respect of any exercise of the powers of the responsible authority under the said section thirteen in relation to the building, work or use, regard shall be had to the power of the responsible authority to take the like action, without payment of compensation, after the expiration of the said period.

(3) Where, in the exercise of any right conferred by a scheme as amended by the last foregoing subsection, a building is substituted for a building to which subsection (1) of this section applies, the foregoing provisions of this section shall have effect in relation to the substituted building as if it were the building for which it was substituted.

Temporary permissions for interim development.

288 Ch. 29. 7\w» an Country Planning 6 & 7 Geo. 6.

(Interim Development) Act, 1943.

(4) The period for which any such permission was granted as aforesaid may be extended by the interim development authority on application made at any time before the expiration thereof; and the provisions of section six of this Act and of subsection (5) of section ten of the principal Act (which relates to appeals to the Minister) shall apply to any such application as they apply to interim development applications.

(5) For the purposes of this Act, where permission for the erection, construction or carrying out of any building or work, or for any use of any building or land, has been granted subject to any condition or agreement for securing the subsequent removal of the building or work, or the subsequent discontinuance of the use, the permi§sion shall be deemed to have been granted for a limited period only; but permission shall not be deemed to have been so granted by reason only of the imposition of conditions requiring any building or work to be begun or completed within a specified period.

Revocation 4.—(1) If at any time before a scheme under the principal

and modifi- Act comes into operation it appears to an interim development cation of authority that it is expedient, having regard to the provisions

forintSSn8 then proposed to be.included in that scheme, that any develop-

development. ment for which permission has been granted on an interim development application should not be carried out or completed, or should not be carried out or completed to the extent or in the manner allowed by the permission, they may, by order made with the consent of the Minister, revoke or modify the permission to such extent as appears to them to be necessary in that behalf.

(2) The Minister may give directions to any interim development authority requiring them to submit to him for his consent under the foregoing subsection an order for the revocation of any permission specified in the directions, or for the modification thereof in such manner as may be so specified; and if any such directions are not complied with within the time specified therein, the Minister may himself make the order on behalf of the authority.

(3) Where an interim development authority propose or are directed to exercise their powers under this section, they shall serve notice in the prescribed manner on the owner and on the occupier of the building or land affected, and on any other person who in their opinion will be affected by the order; and the Minister, before consenting to or making the order, shall, if either the authority or any such person so desire, afford them an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed by the Minister for the purpose.

(4) Where any permission for the development of land is revoked or modified under this section, the interim development authority may pay to any person whose property is injuriously affected thereby any such contribution as might have been

1943- Town and Country Planning Ch. 29. 289

(Interim Development) Act, 1943.

made by them under subsection (4) of section ten of the principal Act if a fresh application for such permission had been made by that person; and the provisions of subsections (6) and (7) of that section (which respectively enable an applicant whose appeal to the Minister is dismissed to require his land to be purchased by the interim development authority in certain cases, and provide for compensation for abortive expenditure incurred for the purpose of complying with conditions confirmed or imposed by the Minister on appeal) and of subsection (2) of section eighteen of that Act (which provides in certain cases for compensation under a scheme in respect of additional injurious affection caused by the refusal on appeal to the Minister of an interim development application or the imposition of conditions by the Minister on the grant thereof) shall apply as if the Minister had refused on appeal to grant such an application, or had imposed conditions upon the grant thereof, as the case may be.

5.—(1) If while a resolution to prepare or adopt a scheme Power to under the principal Act is in force with respect to any area, ?nfor5* any development of land within that area is carried out after the devel^ment commencement of this Act otherwise than in accordance with control, the terms of the interim development order or of permission granted under that order, then, subject to the provisions of this section, the interim development authority may, if they are satisfied tljat it is necessary or expedient so to do having regard to the provisions then proposed to be included in the scheme—

(a) where the development consists of the erection, construction or carrying out of any building or work or any part of a building or work, remove or pull down the building, work or part;

(b) where the development consists of any use of the land or

any building thereon, by order prohibit that use, and, where necessary, reinstate the land:

Provided that where it is reasonably practicable, by means of alterations or of the execution of any other works, to bring any such building or work into compliance with any permission granted as aforesaid, the interim development authority shall, instead of removing or pulling down the building or work, carry out those alterations or works so far as appears to them to be necessary or expedient as aforesaid.

(2) The provisions of subsections (2) to (5) of section thirteen of the principal Act (which provide for an appeal to a court of summary junsdiction against action proposed to be taken under that section) shall apply as set out with modifications in the First Schedule to this Act in relation to any action proposed to be taken under this section.

(3) The Minister may give general or special directions for controlling the exercise by interim development authorities of

T

290 Ch. 29. Town and Country Planning 6 & 7 Geo. 6.

(Interim Development) Act, 1943.

their powers under this section, and may give to any such authority directions requiring them to exercise the said powers as respects any development specified in the directions in such manner as may be so specified.; and any such directions requiring an interim development authority to exercise their powers shall be enforceable, on the application of the Minister, by mandamus.

(4) Any expenses reasonably incurred by an interim development authority in taking action under this section in respect of any development may be recovered summarily as a civil debt from the person by whom the development was carried out, and if that person, having been entitled to appeal against that action under the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act, failed so to do, he shall not be entitled in the proceedings under this subsection to dispute the validity of that action.

(5) If any person uses any land or building in a manner prohibited by an order under this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, and if the use is continued after the conviction he shall be guilty of a further offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds for every day on which the use is so continued.

(a) a substantial part of the business of the lessee or the said person, as the case may be, consisted at the vesting date of getting (whether by underground or surface working) and carrying away minerals or substances, other than coal, in or under land; and (b) no claim for compensation in respect of the interests so arising has been made under section seven of the principal Act.

2,.—(1) Where in any lease of or comprising a mine of coal and subsisting on the vesting date there is contained a provision to the effect that—

(a) rent shall be payable thereunder in respect of coal carried away through the mine after being got from land not comprised in the lease; or

(b) the amount of any rent payable thereunder, whether or not in respect of such coal as aforesaid, shall be ascertained wholly or partly by reference to the amount of such coal as ’aforesaid;

but being a provision applying only in relation to coal got from land for the time being- in a different ownership from the mine, then, as respects coal got after the vesting date, the lease shall have effect as if the provision applied in relation to coal so carried away which has been got from all such land not comprised in the lease as was in a different ownership from the mine immediately before the vesting date.

(2) For the purposes of this section, a provision contained in a document varying, or supplementing a lease shall be treated as if it were contained in the lease.

(3) This section shall be deemed to have had effect as from the vesting date.

3. The proviso to subsection (3) of section eleven of the principal Act (which provides that the arbitrator or the Court may direct that the Commission shall not be liable to pay costs in connection with the severance of a lease incurred by a person who appears to the Court to have been unreasonable or guilty of negligence or default) shall have effect as if for the words “who appears to the Court ” there were substituted the words “who appears to the arbitrator or the Court.”

4. —(1) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to a lease (hereafter in this Act referred to as a “ freeholder’s lease ”) under section thirteen of the principal Act (which entitles persons carrying on the business of coal mining to leases of coal or mines of coal owned by them immediately before the vesting date):—

(a) no freeholder’s lease shall be granted except in considera-

tion of the payment to the Commission of an amount equal to the compensation payable under section six of the principal Act for the premises thereby demised;

(b) subsection (2) of the said section thirteen shall cease to have effect, and the lease shall—■

(i) be a lease at a peppercorn rent;

(ii) be granted for such term, commencing on the vesting date, as the person entitled to the lease may

1943- Coo/ Act, 1943. Ch. 38.

require, not being longer as regards the coal comprised therein than may be reasonably requisite for enabling that coal to be worked out;

(iii) be subject to such conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection, as will, having regard to those provisions, be not more onerous to the lessee than the conditions to which a person not entitled to the benefit of the said section thirteen might reasonably have been expected to agree if taking a lease of the same premises for the same term at the same rent in consideration of a premium representing the capitalized value of the best rent that could reasonably be obtained by the lessor without any fine or premium ;.

(c) notwithstanding anything in any enactment—

(i) no person having any interest arising ui^cler the lease in the premises thereby demised shall be entitled against the Commission to any statutory right of contribution or indemnity in respect of any statutory liability imposed in respect of the said premises;

(ii) the lessee for the time being under the lease shall be bound to indemnify the Commission against any statutory liability imposed in respect of the said premises other than a liability for costs under the principal Act;

and the conditions to which the lease is to be subject under the last foregoing paragraph shall in all cases include a provision conferring on the Commission power to re-enter on the said premises in the event of .the failure of the lessee for the time being to indemnify the Commission as required by this paragraph;

(d) for the purpose of mineral rights duty and royalties welfare levy, the lessee for the time being under the lease shall be deemed to be the prpprietor of the premises thereby demised and not to be a lessee of those premises, and the said duty and levy shall be assessed, charged, paid and recovered accordingly;

(e) the last two foregoing paragraphs shall be deemed to

have had effect as from the date of the commencement of the term granted by the lease, and, as respects any period between that date and the date of the granting of the lease, those paragraphs shall apply as if any person working under a licence granted by the Commission coal comprised in the lease, or using under such a licence a mine of coal so comprised, were the lessee for the time being under the lease and accordingly had an interest arising thereunder in the premises thereby demised.

(b) in any other case, as a reference to the compensation in

respect of the holding constituted by or comprising the fee simple in the demised coal or mine.

(4) Any application for a freeholder’s lease may be withdrawn by the person entitled to the lease by giving to the Commission notice in writing of the withdrawal at any time before the expiration of one month from the date on which the certificate of value relating to the premises to be demised becomes conclusive under paragraph 17 of the Third Schedule to the principal Act.

(5) On the withdrawal of an application for a freeholder’s‘lease as aforesaid—

(6) the provisions of Part II of the First Schedule to this Act shall, save as otherwise agreed after the commencement of this Act, have effect in a case where, pending the grant of the lease, a licence (in the said Part II referred to as a " working licence ”) has been granted by the Commission to work coal to be compfised in the lease or to use for a coal mining purpose a mine of coal to be so comprised;

and in the said Schedule the expression “ date of withdrawal” means the date on which notice of withdrawal of the application for the lease is given to the Commission under the last foregoing subsection.

1.—(1) Where any claim in respect of the disablement of any person made under any such Royal Warrant, Order in Council or Order of His Majesty as is administered by the Minister is rejected by the Minister on the ground that the injury on which the claim is based—

(a) is not attributable to war service; and

(b) does not fulfil the following conditions, namely, that it

existed before or arose during war service and has been and remains aggravated thereby;

1943- Pensions Appeal Tribunals Ch. 39. 425

Act, 1943.

the Minister shall notify the claimant of his decision, specifying that it is made on that ground, and thereupon an appeal shall lie to a Pensions Appeal Tribunal constituted under this Act (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the Tribunal ”) on the issue whether the claim was rightly rejected on that ground.

(2) Where, for the purposes of any such claim as aforesaid, the injury on which the claim is based is accepted by the Minister as fulfilling the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of the last foregoing subsection but not as attributable to war service, the Minister shall notify the claimant of his decision, specifying that the injury is so accepted, and thereupon an appear shall lie to the Tribunal on the issue whether the injury was attributable to such service.

(3) Where any claim in respect of the death of any person made under any such Royal Warrant, Order in Council or Order of His Majesty as aforesaid is rejected by the Minister on the ground that neither of the following conditions is fulfilled, namely—

{a) that the death of that person was due to or hastened by an injury which was attributable to war service;

(6) that the death was due to or hastened by the aggravation by war service of an injury which existed before or arose during war service;

the Minister shall notify the claimant of his decision, specifying that it is made on that ground, and thereupon an appeal shall lie to the Tribunal on the issue whether the claim was rightly rejected on that ground.

(4) Where, in connection with the determination, for the purposes of any such claim as is referred to in the foregoing provisions of this section, of—

1.—(1) Where a contract governed by English law has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated, and the parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract; the following provisions of this section shall, subject to the provisions of section two of this Act, have effect in relation thereto.

(2) All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged (in this Act referred to as “ the time of discharge ") shalfr, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid, and, in the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable :

Provided that, if the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case maybe, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred. 3

(3) Where any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which the last foregoing subsection applies) before the time of discharge, there shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular,—

(a) the amount of any expenses incurred before the time of

discharge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by that party under the last foregoing subsection, and

(b) the effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circum-

stances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.

(4) In estimating, for the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this section, the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract, the court may, without prejudice to the generality of the said provisions, include such sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.

(5) In considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under the foregoing provisions of this section by any party to the contract, the court shall not take into account any sums which have, by reason of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract, become payable to that party under any contract ‘Of insurance unless there was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.

(6) Where any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not, the court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so, treat for the purposes of subsection (3) of this section any benefit so conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the obligations as aforesaid.

2.—(1) This Act shall apply to contracts, whether made before Provision or after the commencement of this Act, as respects which the time M of discharge is on or after th6 first day of July, nineteen hundred of thi^Act and forty-three, but not to contracts as respects which the time of discharge is before the said date.

(2) This Act shall apply to contracts to which the Crown is a party in like manner as to contracts between subjects.

(3) Where any contract to which this Act applies contains any provision which, upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect whether such circumstances arise or not, the court shall give effect to the said provision and shall only give effect to the foregoing section of this Act to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said provision.

(4) Where it appears to the court that a part of any contract to which this Act applies can properly be severed from the remainder of the contract, being a part wholly performed before the time of discharge, or so performed except for the payment in respect of that part of the contract of sums which are or can be ascertained under the contract, the court shall treat that part of the contract as if it were a separate contract and had not been frustrated and shall treat the foregoing section of this Act as only applicable to the remainder of that contract.

CHAPTER 42.

An Act to amend the law as to the delegation of royal functions to Counsellors of State.

[nth November 1943.]

WHEREAS Your Majesty, by Your Majesty's Royal Message to ’both Houses of Parliament, has recommended that Parliament should review the provision made for the delegation of royal functions to Counsellors of State in the event of the Sovereign's illness or absence or intended absence from the United Kingdom, and should consider whether it be not expedient to make provision for including among such Counsellors the person who is the heir apparent or heir presumptive to the Throne if that person, although not of full age, is of such age that his accession would not necessitate a Regency:

And whereas. Your Majesty in the same Message has recommended that Parliament should also consider whether it be not expedient to make provision for enabling persons who are absent or intend to be absent from the United Kingdom to be excepted from among the number of Counsellors of State:

Now, therefore, we, Your Majesty's Most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in Parliament assembled do most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,

442

Ch. 42, 43. Regency Act, 1943. 6 & 7 Geo. 6.

in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: —

Amendment 1. For subsection (2) of section six of the Regency Act & ^Geo’lT ? I937* (which makes provision as to the persons who are to c. 16. s. 6. be the Counsellors of State to whom royal functions may be delegated in accordance with the provisions of that section) there shall be substituted the following subsections: —

" (2) Subject as hereinafter provided, the Counsellors of State shall be the wife or husband of the Sovereign (if the Sovereign is married), and the four persons who, excluding any persons disqualified under this sectioi], are next in the line of succession to the Crown, or if the number of such persons next in the' line of succession is less than four, then all such persons:

Provided that, if it.appears to the Sovereign that any person who, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection, would be required to be in- -eluded among the Counsellors of State to whom royal functions are to be delegated, is absent from the United Kingdom or intends to be so absent during the whole or any part of the period of such delegation, the Letters Patent may make provision for excepting that person from among the number of Counsellors of State during the period of such' absence.

(2a) The heir apparent or heir presumptive to the Throne if not under the age of eighteen years shall not be disqualified from being a Counsellor of State by reason only of his not being of full age, but save as aforesaid any person disqualified under this Act from being Regent shall be disqualified from being a Counsellor of State.0

Short title and 2. This Act may be cited as the Regency Act 1943, and citation. this Act and the Regency Act 1937 may be cited together as the Regency Acts 1937 and 1943.

Provided that—

(a) the applicant may appeal against any such notice to

the Secretary of State by giving notice of appeal within twenty-eight days from the date of the service on the applicant of the notice of postponement, and the Secretary of State, if satisfied that the development would be carried out immediately if the application were granted, shall by order cancel the notice of postponement;

referred to the Secretary of State for decision in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this Act; or

(b) the consideration of the application has been postponed by a notice of postponement under the last foregoing subsection;

and any such application of which the consideration has been so postponed for any period shall be deemed to be refused at the expiration of two months from the end of that period unless within those two months notice has been giv^n to the applicant as aforesaid or its consideration has again been postponed by virtue of a further notice of postponement':

Provided that—

(i) any such period of two months may, at any time before

(4) In relation to any application which, under the provisions of this section, is deemed to be refused at the expiration of any period, the provisions of subsection (5) of section ten of the principal Act (which relates to appeals to the Secretary of State) shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the date on which the applicant received notice of the decision of the authority there were substituted a reference to the expiration of that period.

(Interim Development) (Scotland) Act, 1943.

granted, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, for a limited period only, then, subject to the provisions of this section, the building, work or use shall not be deemed for the purposes of a scheme under the principal Act to be an existing building, an existing work or an existing use, as the case may be, by reason only of that permission.

(2) Where the period for which any such permission was granted has not expired on the date on which the scheme comes into operation, then, during the remainder of that period—

(a) subsections *(3) and (6) of section thirteen of the principal

Act, and subsection (2) of section twenty of that Act (which make special provision, in the case of existing buildings, works and uses, with respect to the time for service of notice of action proposed to be taken under the said section thirteen, the recovery of expenses incurred in taking such action, and the payment of compensation in respect of any such action); and

(b) any provision included in the scheme in accordance with

paragraph (ii) of subsection (2) of section nineteen of the principal Act (which relates to the maintenance, alteration and replacement of existing buildings and the continuation of the existing use of such buildings),

shall apply in relation to the building, work or use, as the case may be, as those provisions apply in relation to existing buildings, existing works, or existing uses respectively :

Provided that, in calculating any compensation payable under the principal Act in respect of any exercise of the powers of the responsible authority under the s?ud section thirteen in relation to the building, work or use, regard shall be had to the power of . the responsible authority to take the like action, without payment of compensation, after the expiration of the said period.

(4) The period for which any such permission was granted as aforesaid may be extended by the interim development authority on application made at any time before the expiration thereof; and the provisions of section six of this Act and of subsection (5) of section ten of the principal Act (which relates to appeals to the Secretary of State) shall apply to any such application as they apply to interim development applications.

1943-

J'own and Country Planning Ch. 43, 447

(Interim Development) (Scotland) Act, 1943.

any condition or agreement for securing the subsequent removal of the building or work, or the subsequent discontinuance of the use, the permission shall be deemed to have been granted for a limited period only; but permission shall not be deemed to have been so granted by reason only of the imposition of conditions requiring any building or work to be begun or completed within a specified period.

4.—(1) If at any time before a scheme under the principal Revocation Act comes into operation it appears to an interim development an<? modifi-authority that it is expedient, having regard to the provisions cation then proposed to be included in that scheme, that any develop-ment for which permission has been granted on an interim development, development application should not be carried out or completed, or should not be carried out or completed to the extent or in the manner allowed by the permission, they may, by order made with the consent of the Secretary of State, revoke or modify the permission to such extent as appears to them to be necessary in that behalf.

(4) Where any permission for the development of land is revoked or modified under this section, the interim development authority may pay to any person whose property is injuriously affected thereby any such contribution as might have been made by them under subsection (4) of section ten of the principal Act if a fresh application for such permission had been made by that person; and the provisions of subsections (6) and (7) of that section (which respectively enable an applicant whose appeal to the Secretary of State is dismissed to require his land to be purchased by the interim development authority in certain cases, and provide for compensation for abortive expenditure incurred for the purpose of complying with conditions confirmed or imposed by the Secretary of State on appeal) and of subsection

448 Ch. 43. Town and Country Planning* 6 & 7 Geo. 6.

(Interim Development) (Scotland) Act, 1943.

(2) of section eighteen of that Act (which provides iivcertain cases for compensation under a scheme in respect of additional injurious affection caused by the refusal on appeal to the Secretary of State of an interim development application or the imposition of conditions by the Secretary of State on the grant thereof) shall apply as if the Secretary of State had refused on appeal to grant such an application, or had imposed conditions upon the grant thereof, as the case may be.

(7) For the purpose of this section and of section ten of the principal Act, the use of any land for the deposit of waste materials or refuse shall be deemed to constitute development of the land, notwithstanding that it is comprised in a site which is already being used for that purpose, if the effect of the further use is to extend the superficial area of the deposit.

6.—(1) If it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expe- powers of dient, having regard to considerations affecting the public interest, Secretary of whether generally or in the locality concerned, that any interim State with development application, or any class or description of such [^terim applications, should be referred to him for decision, he may give development directions to the interim development authority requiring that applications, application, or applications of that class or description, to be so referred, and any decision of the Secretary of State on an application so referred to him shall be deemed for the purposes of subsection (4) of section ten of the principal Act to be a decision given by the interim development authority, and for all other purposes of that Act to be a decision given by him on appeal from the decision of the interim development authority :

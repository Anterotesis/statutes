CHAPTER 16

An Act to extinguish any right of navigation on the Forth and Clyde Canal, and the obligations upon the British Transport Commission to keep that canal open and to maintain it for purposes of navigation.

[29th March, 1962]

WHEREAS the waterway now known as the Forth and Clyde Canal (in this Act referred to as the Canal) was constructed in pursuance of various Acts consolidated by the Act chapter lv of the fourth and fifth years of the reign of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, and has been kept open and maintained for the purpose of navigation between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde in accordance with the provisions of that Act and of the Caledonian Railway and Forth and Clyde Navigation Companies Act, 1867, and the Regulation of Railways Act, 1873:

And whereas the British Transport Commission (in this Act referred to as the Commission) established by the Transport Act, 1947, are the owners of the Canal by virtue of that Act:

And whereas the Commission are charged under the said Act of 1947 as amended by the Transport Act, 1953, to provide, in such places and to such extent as may appear to the Commission to be expedient, facilities for traffic on inland waterways:

And whereas freight traffic has ceased to pass along the Canal which is now used for navigation mainly by fishing boats and pleasure craft:

{Extinguishment of Rights of Navigation) Act, 1962

And whereas, owing to the increase in the volume and weight of road traffic across the Canal, new bridges are needed and existing bridges require to be strengthened or replaced:

And whereas the cost of providing, operating, maintaining and replacing opening bridges or of providing bridges with navigable headroom over the Canal greatly exceeds the like costs for fixed bridges of low level and for causeways piped for the passage of water, and the provision of such fixed bridges and causeways would be consistent with the maintenance of the Canal for purposes other than navigation:

And whereas it is expedient that the Secretary of State and other authorities responsible for the bridges should be relieved for the future of the excess cost as aforesaid:

And whereas it is expedient therefore that rights of navigation of the Canal should be extinguished, and the Commission relieved of their obligations to maintain it for navigation:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled and by the authority of the same as follows:—

1. On the first day of January, nineteen hundred and sixty-three Extinguish-there shall be extinguished in relation to the Canal as described of , in the Schedule to this Act- “toting

(a) any right of navigation thereon, and to navigation.

(b) any obligation upon the Commission (whether statutory or otherwise) to keep it open and to maintain it for purposes of navigation, or to do anything for the furtherance of those purposes.

cases and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the scheme, rebates from those rents; and a rents scheme may provide as aforesaid in relation to rents generally or to particular rents.

(a) any reference in the said subsection (3) to the time

limited by the default order for compliance shall be construed as a reference to the time during which the direction to comply with the rents scheme is in force, and

(b) any reference to the functions in respect of which there

has been default shall be construed as a reference to the duty to manage the houses in question in accordance with the rents scheme.

(7) Section three hundred and seventy-two of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947 (which relates to the revocation of, and other matters concerning, certain orders, including default orders), shall apply to a supplementary order as it applies to a default order, and the power conferred by that section to alter an order shall include power to alter a rents scheme to which an order relates.

(2) In the case of an acquisition or sale in pursuance of a notice to treat served, or contract made, on or after the thirtieth day of October, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, the amount to be deducted, as mentioned in the preceding subsection, shall be the amount (if any) by which the compensation payable, or amount included in the purchase price, as therein mentioned exceeds or exceeded the compensation which would have been so payable, or the amount which would have been so included, if the extent of the damage sustained in respect of the other land in question had fallen to be ascertained on the assumption that planning permission would not be granted for any new development of that land, but would be granted for any development thereof other than new development.

(3) The following provisions of this section shall have effect with respect to any such acquisition or sale as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, being an acquisition or sale in pursuance of a notice to treat served, or contract made, before the thirtieth day of October, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight; and any such acquisition or sale is hereinafter referred to as an acquisition or sale to which this subsection applies.

(4) No such deduction as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section shall be made in the case of an acquisition or sale to which the last preceding subsection applies unless—

question was held with the relevant land.

(5) Subject to the last preceding subsection, the amount to be deducted as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, in the case of an acquisition or sale to which subsection (3) of this section applies, shall be the amount by which the sum paid for severance or injurious affection exceeded the loss of immediate value of the interest affected.

after the acquisition or sale, the land in which the interest affected subsisted or any part thereof had or has an unexpended balance of established development value (whether or not that land or any part thereof would apart from this subsection have had an original unexpended balance of established development value) a claim holding with an area consisting of that land and a value equal to seven-eights of the amount of the difference shall be deemed to have subsisted immediately after the time when the adjustment of claim holdings was completed.

“ the loss of immediate value ” means the amount (if any) by which the difference in the value of the interest affected, immediately before and immediately after the acquisition or sale, exceeded the loss of development value;

“ the loss of development value ” means the amount (if any) by which the value of the interest affected immediately before the acquisition or sale, if calculated on the assumption that, until such time as the land in which that interest subsisted might reasonably be expected to become ripe for new development, no use whatever could be made of that land, would have exceeded the value of that interest immediately after the acquisition or sale if calculated on the like assumption;

“the depreciation in restricted value” means the amount (if any) by which the value of the interest affected.

(2) Where in accordance with any of the preceding provisions of this Part of this Act an amount is required to be deducted from the original unexpended balance of established development value of any land, there shall be attributed to the various parts of that land so much of that amount as might reasonably be expected to have been attributed thereto if the authority determining the amount had been required to apportion it between those parts in accordance with the same principles as applied to its determination.

(3) Where two or more acts or events occur or have occurred in relation to the same land (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) such that, in accordance with any of the preceding provisions of this Part of this Act, an amount is required to be deducted from the original unexpended balance of established development value of that land or any part thereof, those provisions shall apply cumulatively, and the requisite deduction from the original unexpended balance of established development value of that land shall be made by reference to each of those acts or events.

section one hundred and fifty-nine of this Act whereby planning permission to develop operational land of those undertakers is refused or is granted subject to conditions;

(b) in respect of any decision made by a government depart-

ment in respect of any such land, either refusing an authorisation as mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section one hundred and sixty of this Act, or directing that planning permission shall be deemed to be granted subject to conditions as mentioned in paragraph ( b) of that subsection;

(c) in respect of any order under section twenty-seven of

this Act, as modified by section one hundred and sixty-one thereof, whereby planning permission, granted on the application of those undertakers for the development of any such land, is revoked or modified.

(2) Where, by virtue of section one hundred and sixty-four of this Act, any right vested in or belonging to statutory undertakers is extinguished, or any requirement is imposed on statutory undertakers, those undertakers shall be entitled to compensation from the acquiring or appropriating authority at whose instance the right was extinguished or the requirement imposed.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, if the decision or order in question relates to land acquired by the statutory undertakers after the seventh day of January, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and the Minister and the appropriate Minister are satisfied, having regard to the nature, situation and existing development of the land and of any neighbouring land, and to any other material considerations, that it is unreasonable that compensation should be recovered in respect of that decision or order, they may include therein a direction that subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to that decision or order:

Provided that the power conferred by this subsection shall not be exercisable in relation to a decision falling within paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section, if the land in question

1962

Town and Country Planning Act, 1962

Ch. 38

577

was acquired by the statutory undertakers (whether compulsorily or by agreement) for the purposes of the development to which the decision relates, and was so acquired with the consent or authority of a government department.

171.—(1) Where statutory undertakers are entitled to compensation—

(a) as mentioned in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of the

last preceding section, or

(b) under the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-

four in respect of an order made under section twenty-eight of this Act as modified by section one hundred and sixty-two thereof, or

(c) in respect of a compulsory acquisition of land which

has been acquired by those undertakers for the purposes of their undertaking, where the first-mentioned acquisition is effected under a compulsory purchase order confirmed or made without the appropriate Minister’s certificate,

the amount of the compensation shall (subject to the next following section) be an amount calculated in accordance with the following provisions of this section.

(2) The said amount, subject to the next following subsection, shall be the aggregate of the following amounts, that is to say—

(a) the amount of any expenditure reasonably incurred in acquiring land, providing apparatus, erecting buildings or doing work for the purpose of any adjustment of the carrying on of the undertaking rendered necessary by the proceeding giving rise to compensation;

lb) whichever of the following is applicable, namely—

(i) where such an adjustment is made, the estimated amount of any decrease in net receipts from the carrying on of the undertaking pending the adjustment, in so far as the decrease is directly attributable to the proceeding giving rise to compensation, together with such amount as appears reasonable compensation for any estimated decrease in net receipts from the carrying on of the undertaking in the period after the adjustment has been completed, in so far as the decrease is directly attributable to the adjustment;

(ii) where no such adjustment is made, such amount as appears reasonable compensation for any estimated decrease in net receipts from the carrying on of the undertaking which is directly attributable to the proceeding giving rise to compensation;

Part X

Town and Country Planning 10 & 11 Eliz. 2

Act, 1962

(c) where the compensation is under subsection (2) of the last preceding section, and is in respect of the imposition of a requirement to remove apparatus, the amount of any expenditure reasonably incurred by the statutory undertakers in complying with the requirement, reduced by the value after removal of the apparatus removed.

(3) Where any such adjustment as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of the last preceding subsection is made, the aggregate amount mentioned in that subsection shall be reduced by such amount (if any) as appears to the Lands Tribunal to be appropriate to offset—

(a) the estimated value of any property (whether moveable

or immoveable) belonging to the statutory undertakers and used for the carrying on of their undertaking which, in consequence of the adjustment, ceases to be so used, in so far as the value of the property has not been taken into account under paragraph (c) of the last preceding subsection, and

(b) the estimated amount of any increase in net receipts

from the carrying on of the undertaking in the period after the adjustment has been completed, in so far as that amount has not been taken into account under paragraph (b) of the last preceding subsection and is direatly attributable to the adjustment,

and by any further amount which appears to the Lands Tribunal to be appropriate, having regard to any increase in the capital value of immoveable property belonging to the statutory undertakers which is directly attributable to the adjustment, allowance being made for any reduction made under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

(4) References in this section to a decrease in net receipts shall be construed as references to the amount by which a balance of receipts over expenditure is decreased, or a balance of expenditure over receipts is increased, or, where a balance of receipts over expenditure is converted into a balance of expenditure over receipts, as references to the aggregate of the two balances; and references to an increase in net receipts shall be construed accordingly.

(5) In this section “ proceeding giving rise to compensation ” means the particular action (that is to say, the decision, order, extinguishment of a right, imposition of a requirement, or acquisition) in respect of which compensation falls to be assessed, as distinct from any development or project in connection with which that action may have been taken, and “ the appropriate Minister’s certificate ” has the same meaning as in section one hundred and sixty-three of this Act.

Such authority is presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.

Article II

If an actual carrier performs- the whole or part of carriage which, according to the agreement referred to in Article I, paragraph ( ), is governed by the Warsaw Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in this Convention, be subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, the latter solely for the carriage which he performs.

Article III

2. The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier.

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent he is unless it is proved that he acted in a manner which, under the Warsaw Convention, prevents the limits of liability from being invoked.

Article VI

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the aotual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to him.

Article VII

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately.

Articlb IX

1. Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Convention or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole agreement, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.

12.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, any acquisition of an interest or right in or over assets (whether it continues after or ceases on the acquisition), or any disposal of such an interest or right (whether it subsists before or is created by the disposal), shall be deemed for purposes of Case VII to be an acquisition or a disposal of the assets, and (except in so far as the context otherwise requires) the expression “ acquire ” and the expression “ dispose of ” shall be construed accordingly.

(2) For purposes of Case VII, where a contract is made to acquire or dispose of an asset (including an asset not in existence or not ascertained at the time of the contract), the contract shall be deemed to be the acquisition or disposal of the asset (for the consideration provided for by the contract), and the conveyance or transfer of an asset or of an interest or right in or over an asset in pursuance of a contract previously made shall not be deemed to be an acquisition or disposal of the asset

(3) Subject to subsection (4) below and to the Ninth Schedule to this Act a person's acquisition of any asset, and the disposal of it to him, shall for purposes of Case VII be deemed to be for a consideration equal to the market value of the asset or of the interest or right in or over it received by him—

(a) where he acquires the asset otherwise than by way of a

bargain made at arm's length, and in particular where he acquires it by way of gift, or by way of distribution from a company in respect of shares in the company; or

(b) where he acquires the asset wholly or partly for a con-

sideration that cannot be valued, or in connection with his own or another's loss of office or employment or diminution of emoluments, or otherwise in consideration for or recognition of his or another's services or past services in any office or employment or of any other services rendered or to be rendered by him or another; or

(c) where he acquires the asset as trustee for creditors of the

person making the disposal.

(4) Where, on a person's acquisition of an asset, the asset or the interest or right in or over it received by him falls to be taken into account for purposes of tax as a receipt of an income nature (whether as his receipt or another’s), or would fall to be so taken into account if he (or, as the case may be, that other) were chargeable to tax in respect of the whole of his income, his acquisition shall for purposes of Case VII be deemed to be for a consideration equal to the amount or value attributed to the asset for that purpose.

(5) In relation to assets held by a person as nominee for another person, or as trustee for another person absolutely entitled as against the trustee (or for two or more persons jointly so entitled), this Chapter shall apply as if the property were vested in, and the acts of the nominee or trustee in relation to the assets were the acts of, the person or persons for whom he is nominee or trustee (acquisitions from or disposals to him by that person or persons being disregarded accordingly).

(6) In relation to settled property, the trustees of the settlement shall for purposes of Case VII be treated as being a single and continuing body of persons (distinct from the persons who may from time to time be the trustees), and that body shall be treated as being resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom unless the general administration of the trusts is ordinarily carried on outside the United Kingdom and the trustees or a majority of them for the time being are not resident or not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom:

Provided that a body corporate carrying on a business which consists of or includes the management of trusts, and acting as trustee of a trust in the course of that business, shall be treated in ieitotion to that trust as not resident in the United Kingdom if die whole of the settled property consists of or derives from property provided by a person not at the time (or, in the case of a trust arising under a testamentary disposition or on an intestacy or partial intestacy, at his death) domiciled, resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.

For the purposes of this subsection, where part of the property comprised in a settlement is vested in one trustee or set of trustees and part in another (and in particular where settled land within the meaning of the Settled Land Act, 1925, is vested in the tenant for life and investments representing capital money are vested in the trustees of the settlement), they shall be treated as together constituting and, in so far as they act separately, as acting on behalf of a single body of trustees.

(7) Subsection (6) above shall apply in relation to property forming part of the estate of a deceased person and to his personal representatives as it applies in relation to settled property and to trustees of a settlement, but personal representatives shall not be chargeable to tax in respect of an acquisition and disposal by reference to the vesting of the property of the deceased in them.

(8) A person acquiring assets as legatee shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal by reference to that acquisition, except as provided by section fourteen of this Act; nor, in the case of settled property, shall a person be chargeable voider Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal of a beneficial interest under the settlement

Part 11 (9) The conveyance or transfer by way of security of an asset

or of an interest or right in or over it, or transfer of a subsisting interest or right by way of security in or over an asset (including a retransfer on redemption of the security), shall not be treated for purposes of Case VII as involving any acquisition or disposal of the asset; and, without prejudice to die generality of the foregoing, this Chapter shall have effect in relation to any right to money secured on land (including periodical payments issuing out of land, where the right to the payments is not incident to an estate or interest in the land), as it has effect in relation to assets other than land, and not as it has effect in relation to land.

(10) Where a person entitied to an asset by way of security or to the benefit of a charge or incumbrance on an asset deals with the asset for the purpose of enforcing or giving effect to the security, charge or incumbrance, his dealings with it shall be treated for purposes of Case VII as if they were done through him as nominee by the person entitied to it subject to the security, charge or incumbrance; and this subsection shall apply to the dealings of any person appointed to enforce or give effect to the security, charge or incumbrance as receiver, receiver and manager or judicial factor as it applies to the dealings of the person entitied as aforesaid.

(11) Except as provided by section thirteen of this Act, a person disposing of land by letting it for a term of less than twenty-one years shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal by reference to that disposal, unless the letting is accompanied by another letting or agreement for another letting such that the combined terms amount to twenty-one years or over, or by an agreement to dispose of the land otherwise than by letting it.

Computation 13.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter the gain

of gains. accruing to a person from his acquisition and disposal of any

asset shall be computed for purposes of Case VII in the like manner as it would fall to be computed for purposes of Case I of Schedule D if the acquisition and disposal (together with anything done by him to or in relation to the asset in connection with the acquisition and disposal or with a view to the disposal) had been an adventure in the nature of trade (but so that no dividend or interest in respect of which tax has been borne by deduction or otherwise shall be brought into the computation as a receipt).

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not be treated as applying for purposes of Case VII any provision as to the period of computation of profits for purposes of Case I, but the gain accruing on any disposal of an asset shall be computed in one sum as from the relevant acquisition (or first relevant acquisition).

(3) Subject to the following subsections, the adventure by reference to which the gain on an acquisition and disposal is to be computed—

(a) shall not be treated as relating to any assets not included

in the disposal or to any interest not so included in assets which are so included, whether or not the assets or interest not so included were or was included in a relevant acquisition of the assets disposed of;

(b) shall not be treated as relating to assets included in the

disposal which either are not chargeable assets or were not included in a relevant acquisition ;

(c) subject to paragraph ( above, shall be treated as relating—

(i) to all assets included in the same disposal, whether or not included in the same acquisition; and

(ii) to all relevant acquisitions of those assets; and

(iii) to the whole interest included in the disposal in any assets to which the adventure relates, whether or not the whole interest was included in any relevant acquisition;

and all necessary apportionments shall be made accordingly of the consideration for any acquisition or disposal or of any receipts or expenditure (including in particular, in the case of land, apportionments between the interest disposed of and an interest retained of receipts and expenditure in connection with the land).

(4) If in the case of any asset the interest to which the adventure relates does not derive wholly from one or more relevant acquisitions, then the gain shall be computed as if such part of that interest as derives from any other acquisition had been first appropriated to the adventure immediately before the disposal.

(5) If, in the case of land, there is included in the disposal besides the land to which the adventure relates any adjoining or neighbouring land, being chargeable assets and not being land acquired as legatee, so much (if any) of the consideration for the disposal as represents an enhancement due to a relevant acquisition of the first-mentioned land in the value of the adjoining or neighbouring land shall on the apportionment of the consideration be apportioned to the first-mentioned land.

(6) If, in the case of land, the disposal is subject to an interest created by any such letting of the land as is excepted from Case VII by subsection (11) of section twelve of this Act, and the letting was made by the person disposing of the land and made by him since a relevant acquisition, the adventure shall be

treated as extending to that letting to the same extent as if the interest thereby created had been included in the disposal

(7) An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any relevant acquisition of it, and as being disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting at the time of the disposal.

(8) For the purposes of this section—

(a)“relevant acquisition'* means, in relation to any disposal of an asset, an acquisition which with that disposal amounts to an acquisition and disposal within the meaning of this Chapter, except that it does not include an acquisition by reference to which tax is not chargeable, nor an acquisition from which no interest included in the disposal derives;

(b) an interest included in a disposal shall be treated as deriving from an acquisition if without that acquisition the whole interest could not have been so included, but so that the part of that interest which does and the part which does not derive from relevant acquisitions shall be determined as if any interest of temporary duration subsisting at the time of the first relevant acquisition (other than an interest of such a duration as to expire before the time of the disposal) had been of the same duration at the time of the disposal.

14.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a person disposes of shares in a company, and immediately before the disposal either—

(a) the company is or has control of a land-owning com-

pany, and is one which is under the control of not more than five persons and in which he has a substantial interest; or

(b) the company, or a company of which it has control, has a substantial interest in a land-owning company under the control of not more than five persons, and the company is one of which he has control, or of which he and persons connected with him have control;

then he shall be chargeable to tax under Case VII by reference to his disposal of the shares, whenever he acquired them, and notwithstanding that he acquired them as legatee.

(2) Where, but for this section, a person would not be chargeable to tax under Case VII by reference to a disposal of shares in a company, then—

(a) he shall not be chargeable unless chargeable gains would have accrued to the company, being a land-owning

1962

Finance A, 1962

Ch. 44

717

company, or to a land-owning company referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), as the case may be, of subsection

(1) above, on the company disposing of its land at market value at the time of his disposal and any such land-owning company disposing likewise of the land of that company; and

(b) he shall not, if a gain accrues to him on that disposal, be chargeable by reference to it to tax on an amount greater than the amount of the chargeable gains which would have so accrued, or such part of that amount as is attributable to the shares disposed of by him, but if a loss accrues to him on the disposal, it shall not be allowable under Case VII.

(3) For the purposes of this section, “chargeable gains” means gains chargeable to tax under Case VII, but in calculating the chargeable gains that would have accrued to a company on the disposal of its land there shall be made the like deductions as would have been made in charging that tax for the losses that would have so accrued and, so far as they could not be deducted from chargeable gains previously accruing to the company, for losses previously accruing to it:

Provided that in the application of this section to a disposal of shares acquired as legatee on a death a company shall be treated as not chargeable to tax under Case VII by reference to any acquisition of land made before the death.

(4) Where in the case of a company any amount deductible under subsection (3) above in respect of losses cannot be deducted under that subsection because no gains or insufficient gains would have accrued to the company, the amount of the chargeable gains attributable to shares in the principal company shall be reduced by the amount that cannot be deducted or, if the company is not the principal company, by such part of that amount as is attributable to any shares held by the principal company.

In this subsection “ principal company ”, in relation to any disposal of shares in a company, means that company.

(5) The part attributable to any shares in a company of the amount of any chargeable gains, or of any amount deductible in respect of losses, shall be the sum which that amount would add to or take from the distributions made in respect of those shares in a winding-up of the company if the amount represented assets of the company or, in the case of an amount deductible in respect of losses, a habdftty of the company, and if apart from that amount the assets of the company were enough, and no more than enough, to ensure the satisfaction of its liabilities (including the return of share capital); and the part of any such amount

Part II

718

Ch. 44

Finance A, 1962

10 & 11 Eliz. 2

Part n which is directly or indirectly attributable under this subsection to shares held by a company shall (so far as is necessary for the determination of any question as to the tax chargeable) be apportioned by the like method between the shares m that company to arrive at the part attributable to any of those shares.

(6) In this section “land-owning company’* means a company not carrying on a trade of dealing in or developing land, but entitled to land, being chargeable assets, to a value equal to or exceeding one-fifth of the net value of all its assets (that is to say, their value less the value of the debts and liabilities of the company); and for this purpose the value of the said land shall be taken to be the value of the company’s interest free of any liability charged thereon, and to include the value of interests which the company has unconditionally contracted to acquire, but not that of interests which the company has unconditionally contracted to dispose of.

For the purposes of this subsection “ value ” in relation to a company’s land means market value, and the net value of a company’s assets is the net value they would have on a sale in the open market of the company’s business as a going concern.

(7) For the purposes of this section a person shall be deemed to have a substantial interest in a company if one-tenth or more in market value of the issued shares in the company is held by him or is held partly by him and partly by persons connected with him; and the persons to be treated as connected with one another are those specified in paragraph 20 of the Ninth Schedule to this Act.

(8) In this section “share”, in relation to a company not limited by shares (whether or not it has a share capital), shall include the interest of a member of the company as such, whatever the form of that interest, and this section shall apply in relation to any disposal of rights attached to or forming part of a share as if the rights included in the disposal and those not included were separate shares.

Charities, superannuation funds, and other special cases.

15.—(1) There shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII any gain accruing to a charity, or to any such Association as is mentioned in section four hundred and forty-nine of the Income Tax Act, 1952, from its acquisition and disposal of any assets.

In this subsection “ charity ” means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only.

(2) There shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII any gain accruing to a person from his acquisition and disposal of investments or deposits held by him as part of a fund approved under section three hundred and seventy-nine of the Income Tax

1962

Finance A, 1962

Ch. 44

Act, 1952, but so that where part only of a fund is approved under that section the gain shall be exempt to the same extent only as income derived from the assets would be exempt under that section.

(3) There shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII any gain accruing to a person from his acquisition and disposal of assets held by him as part of a fund of which income is exempt from tax under any of the following enactments (which relate to superannuation and similar funds), that is to say,—

{a) in the Income Tax Act, 1952, sections three hundred and eighty-one, three hundred and eighty-two and three hundred and eighty-five;

(b) in the Finance Act, 1956, subsection (5) of section

twenty-two and subsection (3) of section forty;

(c) in the Finance Act, 1961, section twenty-one.

(4) There shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII any gain accruing to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority from its acquisition and disposal of any assets, or accruing to any other person from his acquisition and disposal of investments or deposits held by him for the purposes of any pension scheme provided and maintained by that Authority.

(5) There shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII any gains which accrue to an assurance company (within the meaning of Part XX of the Income Tax Act, 1952) from its acquisition and disposal of investments of its life assurance fund, but which by reason of the mutual nature of the company’s business or part of it do not accrue as profits of a trade.

(6) Any gain accruing to a person from his acquisition and disposal of any assets as trustee or assignee in bankruptcy shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII.

(7) Where assets of the British Transport Commission are, by virtue of or in accordance with any Act of the present Session providing for the dissolution of that Commission, transferred to any body corporate established by that Act, then—

(a) the Commission shall not be chargeable to tax under Case VII by reference to the transfer in respect of its acquisition and disposal of any asset included in the transfer; and

(h) the body corporate shall be treated as if the Commission’s acquisition of the asset had been its acquisition of it (paragraph 18 of the Ninth Schedule to this Act applying for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of that Schedule).

(3) Where two or more persons carry on a business in partnership, gains accruing to them on the disposal of any partnership assets shall, in Scotland as well as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, be assessed and charged on them under Case VII separately, and any partnership dealings shall be treated as dealings by the partners and not by the firm as such; but any statement of the profits or gains of a partnership delivered under section one hundred and forty-four of the Income Tax Act, 1952,

(6) The assessment to be made on the trustees of a fund by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (5) above for any year of assessment shall not take account of losses accruing in any previous year of assessment, and if for that or any other reason the tax paid on behalf of an underwriting member for any year of assessment by virtue of assessments so made exceeds the tax for which he is liable, the excess shall, on a claim being made by him to the surveyor, be repaid by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue:

Provided that if the surveyor objects to a claim for a deduction on account of losses allowable under Case VII, die claim shall be heard and determined by the Commissioners concerned in like manner as if it were an appeal against an assessment under Case VII, and the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1952, relating to the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall apply.

(a) the claim shall not be made by reference to the capital

allowances for that year (“ the relevant year of assessment”), but by reference to those for the year for which that year is the basis year; and

(b) the amount of the capital allowances to be taken into

account in computing the loss shall not be limited by reference to the amount to which effect cannot be given in charging profits or gains of the trade, but the capital allowances for any year shall be so taken into account only if and in so far as they are not required to offset balancing charges for the year ; and

(c) where the allowances taken into account are the allow-

ances for the year for which the claim is made or for the preceding year (the relevant year of assessment being the basis year for that year itself or the claim being made by way of carry-forward of the loss under subsection (3) of section fifteen of the Finance Act,

1953), relief shall not be given by reference to those allowances in respect of an amount greater than the amount non-effective in the year for which the claim

(2) For the purposes of the said section twenty, where the end of the basis period for a year of assessment (as defined in section three hundred and twenty-five of the Income Tax Act, 1952) falls in, or coincides with the end of, any year of assessment, that year is the basis year for the first-mentioned year of assessment, but so that if a year of assessment would under the foregoing provision be the basis year both for that year itself and for another year of assessment, it shall be the basis year for the year itself and not for the other year; and—

(a) any reference to the capital allowances or balancing

charges for a year of assessment shall be construed as a reference to those falling to be made in charging the profits or gains of the trade for that year (but not including in the case of allowances any part of the allowances for an earlier year carried forward under subsection (2) of section three hundred and twenty-three of the Income Tax Act, 1952); and

(b) any reference to an amount of capital allowances non-

effective in a year shall be construed as referring to the amount to which by reason of an insufficiency of profits or gains effect cannot be given in charging the profits or gains of the trade for the year.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) above the capital allowances for a year of assessment shall be treated as required to offset balancing charges for the year up to the amount on which the balancing charges fall to be made after deducting from that amount the amount (if any) of capital allowances for earlier years which is carried forward to that year and would, without the balancing charges, be non-effective in that year.

(4) Accordingly (subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) above) the said section twenty shall have effect with the following amendments;—

(a) a body of persons pays a dividend out of profits or gains

in respect of which development relief is given; and

(b) credit cannot be given against profits tax for that relief

or can be so given for part only of it (on the basis that credit is to be so given for development relief in priority to any other double taxation relief);

(2) In this section “development relief” means double taxation relief given by virtue of section seventeen of the Finance Act, 1961 (which provides for relief by reference to exemptions from foreign taxation given to promote development), but includes any indirect relief by the reduction under this section of the tax deducted or treated as deducted from any dividend.

(3) The reduced rate referred to in subsection (1) above shall be, in relation to any dividend, the standard rate reduced by the amount of any reduction in the net United Kingdom rate for the dividend (within the meaning of subsection (1) of the said section three hundred and fifty) which is due to so much of the development relief as cannot be given by way of credit against profits tax as mentioned in paragraph ( of subsection (I) above; and for the purposes of this section there shall be treated as paid out of profits or gains in respect of which development relief has been given any dividend for which the net United Kingdom rate is reduced by development relief.

(4) The power of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under section three hundred and fifty-one of the Income Tax Act, 1952, to make regulations for carrying out the provisions of sections three hundred and forty-seven and three hundred and fifty of that Act shall include power to make regulations for carrying out this section.

section, and not according to the standard rate; and tax payable Part n in respect of a dividend shall be treated as satisfied by a deduo tion made in accordance with this section to the same extent as if the deduction had been of tax at the standard rate.

(6) Where a company is or has been an overseas trade corporation and is or has been entitled to development relief, the rate at which tax is authorised to be deducted from a dividend shall be determined, if there is a different net United Kingdom rate for different parts of the dividend, by treating each such part as a separate dividend, and Part IV of the Finance Act,

1957, shall have effect subject to the following modifications:—

(a) so much of any relevant distribution or part of a

relevant distribution (within the meaning of the Fifth Schedule to that Act) as is to be regarded under that Schedule as made out of the exempt trading income of the period to which the distribution or part is finally related shall, for any of the following purposes, be grossed up at the reduced rate applying to a dividend regarded as paid out of that income (instead of at the standard rate for the year of assessment in which the date of distribution falls), that is to say,—

(i) for the purpose of determining under paragraph 9 of that Schedule the amount of that income which is to be regarded as applied in making the distribution or that part of it; and

(ii) for the purpose of determining, in the case of a dividend, die amount on which the company is chargeable to tax by reference to it under section twenty-six of that Act; and

(iii) for the purpose of determining, in the case of a grant or loan to which paragraph 1 or 2 of the Sixth Schedule to that Act applies, the amount of income which is under that paragraph to be deemed to have been received by the person to whom the grant or loan is made; and

(b) in determining under the Fifth Schedule to that Act—

(i) how far a relevant distribution is to be finally related to any period; or

(ii) in what proportions a relevant distribution or part of a relevant distribution is to be regarded as made out of the exempt trading income and the other income respectively of the period to which it is finally related;

any part of the income of the period in respect of which development relief is given (or, in the case of exempt trading income, would fall to be given if

ia) controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one half of the voting power in a company resident in a territory outside the United Kingdom; or

(6) controls, directly or indirectly, a proportion of that voting power greater than one quarter and is subject to a local limitation preventing it from controlling a larger proportion; then, for the purposes of any credit to be allowed to the first-mentioned company in accordance with the Sixteenth or Seventeenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1952, in respect of a dividend paid to it by the other company, tax payable by the other company in respect of its profits under the law of any territory outside the United Kingdom shall be taken into account as if it were payable under the law of the first-mentioned territory, and paragraphs 7 and 8 of the said Sixteenth Schedule (which relate to the computation of the amount of income

assessments, income tax and profits tax penalties and assessments), shall be construed as having, from the commencement of that Act, the like effect in relation to happenings before that commencement as it has in relation to happenings after that commencement, except as specifically provided by any enactment contained in the said Part III (including the Seventh Schedule to the Act); and where any enactment so contained makes use of words in the present tense or in a past tense, that use shall not be taken to have any reference to the commencement of the Act or to import any distinction between happenings before and happenings after that commencement.

In this subsection “ happening ” includes any act or omission.

(2) As respects deaths so occurring, in subsection (1) of section thirty-eight of the Finance Act, 1949 (which, among other things, exonerates from land tax land comprised on a death in an estate of a principal value less than two thousand pounds), for the reference to two thousand pounds there shall be substituted a reference to the amount below which the rate of estate duty under the scale in force for the death is nil.

28. —(1) In the case of persons dying after the commencement of this Act, subsection (2) of section twenty-eight of the Finance Act, 1949 (which specifies the cases in which property situate out of Great Britain is excluded from the property treated for purposes of estate duty as passing on the death of a person), shall have effect with the omission of paragraph (c) thereof (which provides for the exclusion of immovable property); and in the case of persons so dying the enactments relating to estate duty shall have effect subject to the further modifications specified in subsections (2) to (5) below:

Provided that—

(a) the property passing on the death of a person so dying shall not by virtue of a disposition or event occurring before the tenth day of April, nineteen hundred and sixty-two, being a relevant disposition or event within the meaning of section sixty-four of the Finance Act, 1960 (which relates to gifts inter vivos, etc.), be deemed to include any property—

where an interest in expectancy in any property was before the said tenth day of April bona fide sold or mortgaged for full consideration in money or money’s worth, then—

(i) no other duty on that property shall be payable by the purchaser or mortgagee when the interest falls into possession than would be payable if subsection (2) of the said section twenty-eight then had effect as originally enacted; and

(ii) in the case of a mortgage any higher duty payable by the mortgagor shall rank as a charge subsequent to that of the mortgagee.

Subsection (1) of section fifty-six of the Finance Act, 1940 (which relates to transactions with companies under the control of not more than five persons), shall apply for the purposes of paragraph (b) above as it applies for the purposes of section three of the Finance Act, 1894.

(2) Subsection (3) of section eight of the Finance Act, 1894 (which renders the executor accountable for the estate duty in respect of all personal property of which the deceased was competent to dispose at his death), shall have effect as if the reference therein to all personal property wheresoever situate included a reference to all property (of whatever kind) situate out of Great Britain ; and subsection (4) of the said section eight (which, where the executor is not accountable for the estate duty, renders beneficiaries and others accountable therefor) shall apply in relation to estate duty on property situate out of Great Britain as if the words referring to the executor not being accountable were omitted.

(3) Where under subsection (1) of section nine of the Finance Act, 1894, a charge in respect of a rateable part of the estate duty on an estate is imposed on any property situate out of Great Britain, the charge shall extend to assets which form the proceeds of any disposition of the property or otherwise for the time being directly or indirectly represent it; and the proviso to that subsection (which protects a bona fide purchaser for value without notice), and any other enactment relating to the charge imposed under that subsection, shall have effect accordingly.

(4) In relation to property situate out of Great Britain—

Act, 1910 (which provides that an appeal shall not lie under section ten of the Finance Act, 1894, on a question of the* value of any real (including leasehold) property, but makes other provision as to appeals on such questions), shall not apply;

(c) the proviso to subsection (5) of section seven of the

Finance Act, 1894 (which provides for the valuation of certain agricultural property by reference to annual value as assessed for purposes of income tax under Schedule A), and so much of sub-para^aph (7) of paragraph 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Finance Act, 1940, as requires any value to be calculated by reference to the annual value of land as ascertained for purposes of income tax under Schedule A, shall not apply.

(5) In subsection (2) of section seven of the Finance Act, 1894 (which, in the valuation of an estate for purposes of estate duty, restricts allowances for foreign debts by reference to the value of personal property abroad), the word “personal ” shall be omitted in each place where it occurs.

(6) So much of subsection (1) of section four of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as precludes the Parliament of Northern Ireland from making laws in respect of matters not exclusively relating to Northern Ireland shall not be taken to preclude that Parliament, in relation to estate duty payable under the laws of Northern Ireland, from making provision with respect to property situate out of Northern Ireland.

29.—(1) Where the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are Double satisfied that in any territory outside the United Kingdom duty taxation is payable by reason of a death occurring on or after the tenth day relicf* of April, nineteen hundred and sixty-two, in respect of any property situate in that territory and passing on that death, they shall allow a sum equal to the amount of that duty as a credit against the estate duty payable in respect of that property on the same death unless, under arrangements having effect by virtue of section fifty-four of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945, or section five of the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922 (Session 2), a credit is allowable in relation to the property against either the estate duty or the duty payable in that territory; and accordingly subsection (4) of section seven of the Finance Act,

1894 (which provides that, in valuing foreign property for purposes of estate duty, an allowance is to be made for the foreign duty), shall not apply as respects deaths so occurring.

For every 100/., and also for any fractional part of 100/., of the amount or value of the property subject to the trusts created or recorded by the instrument 0 5 0”

and, in relation to instruments so made or executed, in section fifteen of the Stamp Act, 1891, for the words “ Settlement . . . The settlor ” in the table set out at the end of subsection (2) there shall be substituted the words “ Unit trust instrument . . . The trustees” and in the said First Schedule for the word “settlement” in the heading beginning “Declaration” there shall be substituted the words “ unit trust instrument ”.

(2) Duty under subsection (2) of section fiftyJthree of the Finance Act, 1946, in respect of property which on or after the said first day of August becomes trust property represented by units under a unit trust scheme shall be chargeable by reference to the heading “ Unit trust instrument ” in the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, but so that—

(a) if on or after that day units under the scheme are extinguished, the amount or value of property thereupon transferred by the trustees to the managers under the scheme, or to the person entitled to any extinguished unit, shall be treated as a credit to be deducted (in so far as it has not previously been deducted under this

paragraph in relation to any property) from the amount Part IV or value of property which subsequently becomes trust property represented by units under the scheme; and (b) the requirements of the said subsection (2) shall not apply in relation to property the amount or value of which is treated as reduced to nil by one or more such deductions, and duty under that subsection shall be chargeable in respect of any other property which is subject to such deductions by reference to the amount or value as reduced.

(3) Where the amount or value of any property is treated as reduced to nil by one or more deductions under subsection (2) above, the trustees shall, before the end of the period within which a statement is next required to be furnished to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under subsection (2) of the said section fifty-three in relation to the scheme, or before such later date as the Commissioners may allow, furnish to the Commissioners a statement of the property and of the transfers giving rise to the deductions; and where the amount or value of any property is otherwise treated as reduced by one or more such deductions, the trustees shall, before the end of the period within which a statement of that property is required to be furnished to the Commissioners under subsection (2) of the said section fifty-three, or before such later date as the Commissioners may allow, furnish to the Commissioners a statement of the tranfers giving rise to the deductions.

(4) If the trustees under a unit trust scheme fail to comply with the requirements of subsection (3) above in relation to any property, subsection (3) of the said section fifty-three (which enables unpaid duty with interest to be recovered from the trustees) shall apply as if the trustees had failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) of that section and as if no deduction had fallen to be made from the amount or value of the property.

(5) Subsection (1) of section fifty-seven of the Finance Act,

1946, shall apply for the interpretation of expressions used in subsections (2) to (4) above as it applies for the interpretation of expressions used in Part VII of that Act, but so that references in subsection (2) above to trust property represented by units shall not be taken to include property within the proviso to subsection (2) of section fifty-three of that Act (which excludes property derived from other trust property from the operation of subsection (2) of the said section fifty-three).

31.—(1) The Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall have the Insurance like power to enter into an agreement (with a view to the com- policies, pounding of stamp duties) with any person or body of persons carrying on the business of issuing policies of insurance other than policies of life insurance as is conferred upon them

Miscellaneous Rules Applicable to Case VII of Schedule D

Discharge and assignment of contracts; options and other conditional , etc.

1. —(1) Save as provided by paragraph 2 below, a person's acquisition or disposal of an asset by a contract in that behalf shall be disregarded for purposes of Case VII if—

(a) the contract is discharged by mutual consent or by operation of law; or

(b) default is made in carrying out the contract and by reason

of that default there is no conveyance or transfer to implement the contract, whether by or to the person originally making the contract or another ; or

(c) the contract is conditional and the condition is not satisfied.

(2) Where a person disposes of an asset, and the whole or part of the consideration is irrecoverable, the amount irrecoverable shall be disregarded in so far as it is not realised by the disposal in whole or in part of the right to the consideration; and if the consideration is abated for any error in or default under the contract. Chapter II of Part II of this Act shall apply as if the abated consideration had originally been contracted far.

(3) If in the case of a conditional contract to acquire or dispose of an asset the condition is satisfied (and in particular if in the case of a contract conferring an option the option is exercised), then subject to the following sub-paragraphs the acquisition or disposal of the asset by the contract shall be treated as taking place at the time when the condition is satisfied.

(4) If the disposal of an asset by a conditional contract is made for a consideration not depending wholly or mainly on the value of the asset at the time the condition is satisfied the contract shall in relation to the disposal be treated (on the condition being satisfied) as if it had never been conditional.

(5) Where a contract for the disposal of an asset is discharged by mutual consent, but is replaced by a new contract for its disposal to the same person or to another in his place, the disposal by the new contract shall be treated as if it had taken place at the time when the disposal by the previous contract is to be treated as having taken place, and if the previous contract was a conditional contract, the condition shall for that purpose be treated as satisfied by the making of the new contract.

(6) Nothing in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) above shall apply in relation to a contract entered into before the tenth day of April, nineteen hundred and sixty-two.

2. —(1) Subject to paragraph 18 of this Schedule, a person acquiring a right under a subsisting contract to acquire or dispose of an asset shall be treated as thereby acquiring or disposing of the asset to the like extent as if he had then entered into a new

1962

Finance Act, 1962

Ch. 44

757

contract conferring that right (his undertaking the obligations under 9th Sch. the subsisting contract not being treated as consideration given by him for the acquisition of the right, but any consideration so given being treated, in relation to his acquisition and disposal of the asset, as an expense of acquiring or disposing of it).

(2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of section twelve of this Act a person disposing of tihe right under a subsisting contract to acquire or dispose of an asset shall not be treated as thereby disposing of the asset nor, in a case not within sub-paragraph (3) below, as having acquired or disposed of it by that contract.

(3) Subject to paragraph 18 of this Schedule, where a person disposes of an asset to another subject to and with the benefit of any subsisting contract for its disposal to a third person, then, if the contract is not conditional or the condition is satisfied at the time of the later disposal,—

(a) he shall not be treated as thereby making any new disposal

of the asset except to the extent to which it was not disposed of by that contract, and so much of the consideration for the later disposal as is attributable to the right to receive the consideration under that contract shall be disregarded; and

(b) he shall be treated as thereby completing the disposal by that

contract, and that disposal shall not under paragraph 1 above be treated as affected by any subsequent discharge of or default under the contract or abatement of the consideration.

(4) A person’s right under a contract entered into by him to acquire or dispose of an asset shall, in relation to any disposal by him of that right, be treated as having been acquired by him on the making of the contract for any consideration given by him for having that right (other than his agreement to acquire or dispose of the asset); and where a person gives any consideration to be discharged from a contract to acquire or dispose of an asset, the person to whom it is given shall be treated as disposing for that consideration of his right under the contract to dispose of or acquire the asset. 5

(5) Where a person dies after entering into a conditional contract for the acquisition or disposal of an asset (the condition not being satisfied at the time of his death), then—

(a) in the case of a contract to acquire the asset nothing in this paragraph shall apply so as to treat any other person as acquiring the asset by reason of that contract on the condition being satisfied, except that sub-paragraph (1) shall apply in relation to any person acquiring from the personal representatives or legatee the right under the contract to acquire the asset; and

(b) in the case of a contract to dispose of the asset, nothing

in this or the last foregoing paragraph shall apply so as to treat him as disposing of the asset under the contract on the condition being satisfied.

Gifts, settled property, and bargains not at arm’s length

3. —(1) Where a person resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom either—

(a) disposes by way of gift of an asset previously acquired by him, but does so without there being (within the meaning of Case VII) an acquisition and disposal by him; or (b) disposes by way of gift of an asset acquired by him only as legatee;

then, so far as relates to the interest taken by the donee, the donee shall be treated as if the donor's acquisition of the asset had been his acquisition of it.

(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, where in a case not falling within paragraph (a) or (b) of sub-paragraph (1) above a person resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom disposes by way of gift of an asset acquired or to be acquired by him, and the donee is also resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, then on an election being made in that behalf—

(a) the donor shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal by reference to that disposal ; and

(b) the donee shall be treated as if the donor's acquisition of the asset had been his acquisition of it, but so that the amount of the consideration for which he is treated as acquiring the asset shall not by virtue of this sub-paragraph be increased.

(3) An election under sub-paragraph (2) above shall be made by the donor and the donee jointly, except that it may be made by the donee alone if the donor would not apart from that sub-paragraph be chargeable to tax under Case VII in respect of the gain (if any) treated as accruing to him from his acquisition and disposal of the asset.

(4) Sub-paragraph (2) above shall not apply in relation to a gift of shares where the donor is, but the donee is not, in relation to his acquisition and disposal of the shares, within section fourteen of this Act (“shares” having for this purpose the same meaning as in that section).

(5) A person shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal by reference to a disposal made to any charity or Association within subsection (1) of section fifteen of this Act if the disposal is by way of gift for the purposes of the charity or Association.

4. —(1) Subsection (3) of section twelve of this Act and paragraph 3 above shall apply in relation to a gift in settlement as a gift to the trustees of the settlement, and shall so apply notwithstanding that the settlor is one of the trustees or the sole trustee of the settlement; but if the settlor or the settlor's wife or husband has, or can by any means (whether or not requiring any consent or concurrence) obtain for the settlor or for the settlor’s wife or husband, any beneficial interest in the settled property or the income from it, no loss treated as accruing to the settlor by reason of the gift in settlement shall be allowable under Case VII.

(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, where under a settlement a person becomes absolutely entitled as against the trustee to settled property (whether alone or jointly with another), he shall be chargeable by reference to any subsequent disposal of the property by him as if its acquisition by the trustees had been his acquisition of it.

(3) Where for a consideration in money or money’s worth a person becomes absolutely entitled as against the trustee to settled property, or two or more persons jointly become so entitled, either by the exercise of a power of appointment under the settlement or by acquiring the interests of persons who were together so entitled and acted in concert in disposing of their interests to him or them, then notwithstanding anything in subsection (8) of section twelve of this Act—

(a) the person or persons becoming so entitled shall, on disposing of the property, be chargeable under Case VII by reference to that acquisition of it, if there is an acquisition and disposal by him or them ; and

(b) the person exercising the power or persons disposing of their interests under the settlement shall be chargeable under Case VII by reference to that disposal of the property, as if its acquisition by the trustees had been his or their acquisition of it.

5.—(1) Subjeot to sub-paragraph (4) below, where a person resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom disposes otherwise than by way of bargain at arm’s length (but not by way of gift) of an asset acquired or to be acquired by him so that there is an acquisition and disposal of the asset by him, and the person acquiring the asset on that disposal is also resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, then on an election being made in that behalf the person disposing of the asset and the person acquiring it on that disposal shall be treated as doing so for a consideration equal to whichever is the higher of—

(a) the actual consideration ; and

(b) such amount as will secure that neither a gain nor a loss accrues to the person disposing of the asset from his acquisition and disposal of it:

Provided that this sub-paragraph shall not apply so as to increase the amount of the consideration for which those persons are respectively treated as disposing of and acquiring the asset.

(2) An election under this paragraph shall be made jointly by the person disposing of the asset and the person acquiring it, except that an election may be made by the person disposing of the asset alone if the person acquiring it would not, on disposing of it, be chargeable to tax under Case VII in respect of the gain (if any) accruing to him from his acquisition and disposal of it.

(3) In a case falling within paragraph (6) of subsection (3) of section twelve of this Act, the amount referred to in paragraph ( ) of sub-paragraph (1) above shall be taken to be higher than the actual consideration referred to in paragraph (a).

6. —(1) Where, in the case of a man and his wife living with him, the man disposes of an asset acquired or to be acquired by him to the wife, or the wife disposes of an asset acquired or to be acquired by her to the man, then—

(a) the one making the disposal shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of an acquisition and disposal by reference to that disposal; and

fb)the one to whom the disposal is made shall be treated as if the other’s acquisition of the asset had been his or her acquisition of it.

(2) Where a company resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom disposes of an asset acquired or to be acquired by it to another such company at a time when either is the subsidiary of the other, or both are subsidiaries of a third company (“ subsidiary ” having for this purpose the meaning assigned to it for certain purposes of the profits tax by section forty-two of the Finance Act, 1938), then—

(a) the first-mentioned company shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of an acquisition and disposal by reference to that disposal; and ( b)the other company shall be treated as if the first-mentioned company’s acquisition of the asset had been its acquisition of it.

Appropriations to and from stock in trade

7. —(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, where an asset acquired by a person otherwise than as trading stock of a trade carried on by him is appropriated by him for the purposes of the trade as trading stock (whether on the commencement of the trade or otherwise) and, if he had then sold the asset for its market value, a gain or loss chargeable or allowable under Case VII would have accrued to him, he shall be treated as having thereby disposed of the asset by selling it for its then market value.

(2) Where an asset forming part of the trading stock of a person’s trade is appropriated by him for any other purpose, or is retained by him on his ceasing to carry on the trade, he shall be treated

1962

Finance A, 1962

Ch. 44

761

as having acquired it for a consideration equal to the amount brought into the accounts of the trade in respect of it for tax purposes on the appropriation or on his ceasing to carry on the trade, as the case may be.

(3) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not apply in relation to a person's appropriation of an asset for the purposes of a trade if he is chargeable to tax in respect of the profits of the trade under Case I of Schedule D, and elects that instead the market value of the asset at the time of the appropriation shall, in computing the profits of the trade for purposes of tax, be treated as reduced by the amount of the gain or increased by the amount of the loss referred to in that sub-paragraph, and where that sub-paragraph does not apply by reason of such an election, the profits of the trade shall be computed accordingly:

Provided that if a person making an election under this sub-paragraph is at the time of the appropriation carrying on the trade in partnership with others, the election shall not have effect unless concurred in by the others.

Dealings in marketable secur, , etc.

8.—(1) Where a person disposes of shares, the shares disposed of shall be identified in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph with the shares acquired by him which could be comprised in that disposal, and shall be so identified notwithstanding that they are otherwise identified by the disposal or by a transfer or delivery giving effect to it (but so that where a person disposes of shares in one capacity, they shall not be identified with shares which he holds or can dispose of only in some other capacity).

(2) The identification under this paragraph of the shares disposed of on any occasion shall have effect not only for determining the gain or loss accruing by reason of that disposal but for all purposes of Case VII, including its operation in relation to other disposals by the same person and, in a case where that person's acquisition of the shares is or may be relevant to the person acquiring from him, its operation in relation to the last-mentioned person.

(3) Shares disposed of on an earlier date shall be identified before shares disposed of on a later, and the identification of the shares first disposed of shall accordingly determine the shares which could be comprised in the later disposal. 4 5

(4) Shares disposed of for transfer or delivery on a particular date or in a particular period—

(a) shall not be identified with shares acquired for transfer

or delivery on a later date or in a later period; and

(b) shall be identified with shares acquired for transfer or delivery on or before that date or in or before that period, but on or after the date of the disposal, rather than with shares not so acquired.

(5) The shares disposed of shall be identified with shares not acquired as legatee rather than with shares acquired as legatee.

(c) with shares acquired at different times on any one day in

as nearly as may be equal proportions.

(7) The rules above contained shall have priority according to the order in which they are so contained.

(8) Notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) above, where, under arrangements designed to postpone the transfer or delivery of shares disposed of, a person by a single bargain acquires shares for transfer or delivery on a particular date or in a particular period and disposes of them for transfer or delivery on a later date or in a later period, then—

(a) the shares disposed of by that bargain shall be identified with

the shares thereby acquired ; and

(b) shares previously disposed of which, but for the operation of paragraph (a) above in relation to acquisitions for transfer or delivery on the earlier date or in the earlier period, would have been identified with the shares acquired by that bargain—

(i) shall, subject to sub-paragraph (3) above, be identified with any available shares acquired for such transfer or delivery (that is to say, any shares so acquired other than shares to which paragraph (a) above applies and other than shares with which shares disposed of for such transfer or delivery would be identified apart from this sub-paragraph) ; and

(ii) in so far as they cannot be so identified shall be treated as disposed of for transfer or delivery on the later date or in the later period above mentioned.

(9) This paragraph shall apply in relation to a disposal of any assets as it applies in relation to a disposal of shares, where the assets are of a nature to be dealt in without identifying the particular assets disposed of or acquired.

9.—(1) Subjeot to sub-paragraph (3) below, where a loss accrues to a person from his acquisition and disposal of any shares, and he re-acquires the same shares within one month after the disposal or, in the case of a re-acquisition otherwise than through a stock exchange, within six months after it, that loss shall not be allowable under Case VII otherwise than by deduction from any gain accruing to him from an acquisition and disposal of the shares beginning with the re-acquisition.

(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, where a person disposes of shares and afterwards acquires the like shares within the period

1962

Finance A, 1962

referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, he is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as re-acquiring the shares disposed of (or, if the quantity disposed of was greater than the quantity acquired, a part of them equal to the quantity acquired), but so that—

(a) there cannot be in relation to the same disposal more than one re-acquisition of the same share, nor be by the same acquisition of a share a re-acquisition in relation to more than one disposal; and

(b) an acquisition of shares shall, where there has been more than one relevant disposal, be treated as a re-acquisition of shares disposed of on an earlier date rather than of shares disposed of on a later, and as a re-acquisition of shares disposed of at different times on the same date in as nearly as may be equal proportions; and

(c) where there is more than one acquisition of shares rele-

vant to a previous disposal, shares acquired on an earlier date shall be treated in relation to that disposal as the shares re-acquired rather than shares acquired on a later date, and as between shares acquired on any one date those subsequently disposed of on an earlier date shall be so treated rather than those subsequently disposed of on a later date, and those subsequently disposed of on any one day shall be so treated in as nearly as may be equal proportions;

() where a person disposes of shares in one capacity, shares which he acquires in some other capacity shall be disregarded.

(b) that acquisition shall not be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as a re-acquisition of any shares. 4 5

(4) Where under sub-paragraph (8) of paragraph 8 above shares disposed of are identified with shares acquired by the same bargain, sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph shall apply as if the disposal had preceded the acquisition.

(5) Where—

(a) under arrangements designed to postpone the acceptance of

shares acquired, a person by a single bargain disposes of shares for transfer or delivery on a particular date or in a particular period and acquires them for transfer or delivery on a later date or in a later period ; and

(b) under paragraph 8 above—

(i) the shares disposed of by that bargain are identified with shares previously acquired for transfer or delivery on the earlier date or in the earlier period; and

(2) Subject to the following sub-paragraphs, a reorganisation or reduction of a company's share capital shall not be treated as involving any disposal of the original shares or any acquisition of the new holding or any part of it, but the original shares and the new holding shall be treated as the same asset acquired as die original shares were acquired.

shall in relation to any disposal of the new holding or any part of 9th Sch.

it be treated as having been given for the original shares, and if the new holding or part of it is disposed of with a liability attaching to it in respect of that consideration, the consideration given for the disposal shall be adjusted accordingly:

Provided that there shall not be treated as consideration given for the new holding or any part of it any surrender, cancellation or other alteration of the original shares or of the rights attached thereto, or consisting of any application in paying up the new holding or any part of it of assets of the company or of any dividend or other distribution declared out of those assets but not made.

(4) Where, on a reorganisation or reduction of a company’s share capital, a person receives or becomes entitled to receive in respect of his original shares any capital distribution from the company not forming part of the new holding, he shall be treated as if the new holding resulted from his having in consideration of that distribution disposed of an interest in the original shares of a market value equal to that of the distribution (but without prejudice to the original shares and the new holding being treated in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) above as the same asset).

(5) Where for the purpose of computing the gain or loss accruing to a person from the acquisition and disposal of any part of the new holding it is necessary to apportion the cost of acquisition of any of the original shares between what is disposed of and what is retained, the apportionment shall be made by reference to market value at the date of the disposal (with such adjustment of the market value of any part of the new holding as may be required to offset any liability attaching thereto but forming part of the cost to be apportioned); and any corresponding apportionment for the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) above shall be made in like manner.

(6) Where on a reorganization of a company’s share capital a person receives or becomes entitled to receive in respect of any shares a provisional allotment of shares in or debentures of the company, then unless he neither accepts the allotment nor disposes of his rights before or after the making of the allotment, those rights shall be treated in relation to him and in relation to any person acquiring them directly or indirectly from him as if they were the shares or debentures to which they relate and as if the consideration to be given for the shares or debentures were a liability attaching to the rights.

(7) References in this paragraph to a reduction of share capital do not include the paying off of redeemable share capital, and where shares in a company are redeemed by the company otherwise than by the issue of shares or debentures (with or without other consideration) and otherwise than in a liquidation, the shareholder shall be treated as disposing of the shares at the time of the redemption.

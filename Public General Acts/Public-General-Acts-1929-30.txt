(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an insurance officer, a court of referees or the umpire, on new facts being brought to his or their knowledge, from revising a decision given in any particular case, but where any such revision is made, the revised decision shall have effect as if it had been an original decision, and the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.

(9) Where a claim for benefit is allowed by a court of referees, benefit shall be payable in accordance with the decision of the court notwithstanding that an appeal to the umpire is pending, unless the appeal has been brought on the ground that the claimant ought to be disqualified under the provisions of subsection (1) of section eight of the principal Act and wit hin twenty-one days of the date on which the decision of the court of referees was given, and any benefit paid in pursuance of the provisions of this subsection or of the next following section of this Act shall be treated, notwithstanding that the final determination of the question is adverse to the claim, as having been duly paid and shall hot be recoverable from the insured contributor under the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts or otherwise.

Agreement between Canada, Ontario and Manitoba.

Ottawa, November 15, 1922.

Memorandum of agreement arrived at regarding the control of the upper waters of the Winnipeg River.

Present:

Representing the Dominion Government:

Right Honourable Mackenzie King, Prime Minister; Honourable Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior; Mr. W. W.

Cory, Deputy Minister of the Interior.

In attendance r

Mr. W. J. Stewart and Mr. J. B. Challies, Consulting

Engineers to the Department of External Affairs;

Mr. S. S. Scovil, Engineer of Lake of the Woods

Control Board.

Representing the Province of Ontario:"

Honourable E. C. Drury, Premier.

In attendance:

Mr. H. G. Acres and Mr. L. V. Rorke.

Representing the Province of Manitoba:

Honourable John Bracken, Premier.

Honourable R. W. Craig, Attorney-General; also

Honourable T. H. Johnson, K.C., Counsel.

This agreement, as a working basis for the regulation of the

English and Winnipeg rivers, is entered into on the understanding that all parties are agreeable to the repeal of the Lake of the

Woods Regulation Act, 1920, but Ontario does not bind itself to the terms of this agreement in the event, of that Act not being repealed.

The Government representatives agreed that the general advantage legislation could be rescinded on the following basis

(Mr. Bracken undertaking to urge the acceptance thereof by the

Manitoba power interests):

1 . Control of Lake of the Woods:

The recommendation of the 'Lake of the Woods Control

Board that the Norman Dam be expropriated was agreed to in principle.

1030.

British North America

Act, 1930.

(Jh. 20.

287

It was further understood that the Board should immediately investigate and report to the three governments concerned,

whether—

(1) There is some alternative method of securing control by construction of a new structure above the present dam or otherwise;

(2) Failing such an alternative being found, under what procedure and whether under Federal or Provincial auspices should the dam be expropriated.

The cost of securing the results contemplated under either

(1) or (2) above should be borne on the following basis:—

One-third of the total cost to be attributable to navigation and borne by the Federal Government;

The remaining two-thirds to be considered chargeable to power, to be borne in the first instance by the expropriating Government, but

(a) Ontario to be responsible for the share chargeable to the undeveloped power site at White Dog Falls;

(b) The Federal Government (as proprietors of the water powers on the Winnipeg river in Manitoba)

to be responsible in the first instance for the amount chargeable to the remaining fall of the Winnipeg river in the Province of Manitoba; the Department of the

Interior to recover cost of same from the presont power developments on the river and from prospective power developments on such basis as that Department may consider advisable.

So far as the amount chargeable to power is concerned, the basis of settlement between the Dominion Government and the

Province of Ontario should be that of the ratio of potential head in Ontario and Manitoba.

2. Regulation under Concurrent Legislation:

It was agreed that the Lake of the Woods Control Board should be instructed to immediately canvass the necessities of the situation and make appropriate recommendations to thb

Governments of Canada and Ontario with a view to having approved and authorized whatever operating regulations are considered necessary to make practically effective the existing concurrent legislation.

3. Lac Seul:

With regard to storage cn Lac Seul, it is agreed that if the power interests in Manitoba or their administrative agency desire storage on Lac Seul, they shall immediately notify the Government

288 Ch. 26. British North America 20 & 21 Geo. 5.

Act, 1930.

of Ontario to this effect. In the event of such notification the

Government of Ontario shall undertake not to permit the Construction of any development which would later be destroyed,

wholly or in part, by the creation of this storage, and shall agree to grant flooding rights, on Crown Lands affected, under the customary conditions, including recompense for timber destroyed,

and the usual rental for water powers which may be wholly or partially destroyed incidental to the construction of the said works. Further, the power interests benefited shall be prepared,

when required by the Government of Ontario, to pay the said

Government an amount to be ascertained by the Control Board,

sufficient to pay the difference between the cost of power feasible of development at Pelican Falls and the cost of a similar amount of power to be developed at some other possible site designated by the Government of Ontario and delivered at Sioux Lookout at a distribution voltage.

It is agreed that whatever storage scheme may be worked out covering Lac Seul shall be under the jurisdiction of the Lake of the Woods Control Board, the cost of the same to be borne by the power interests as and when benefited.

4. International Questions:

With regard to the international issues it was unanimously agreed that there was not sufficient data to enable a commitment at the present stage with regard to storage and regulation on

Rainy and upper international lakes, and that in any case all the interests concerned, governmental, municipal, corporate and private, on both sides of the boundary, should be afforded the opportunity and the advantage of presenting their views, and of hearing the views of others presented, to the International Joint

Commission.

It was further agreed that the basis for an international arrangement between the two countries arrived at by the technical advisers of the United States and Canada at Washington in

December, should be adhered to, namely:—

(a) An immediate settlement by treaty of the Lake of the

Woods issues; and

(b) Concurrent with the ratification of such a treaty, an appropriate reference to the International Joint Commission respecting Rainy and upper lakes matters.

It was further agreed that once a reference of the upper lakes matter has been agreed to, the Canadian Governments, Dominion and Provincial, should facilitate in every possible way, a thorough investigation and an early report by the International Joint

Commission, but that pending such a report, the Dominion

Government could not make any commitment as to policy.

Memorandum op Agreement.

Made this 20th day of March, 1930.

Between

The Government of the Dominion of Canada, represented herein by the Honourable Ernest Lapointe, Minister of Justice, and the Honourable Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior,

Of the First Part,

and

The Government of the Province of Saskatchewan, represented herein by the Honourable James Thomas Milton Anderson,

Premier and Minister of Education of the Province, and the

Honourable Murdoch Alexander MacPherson, Attorney-

General .Of the Second Part.

Whereas by section twenty-one of the Saskatchewan Act,

being chapter forty-two of the four and five Edward the Seventh,

it was provided that “ AU Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the Province under the North-West Irrigation Act,

1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said Province with the substitution therein of the said Province for the North-West Territories ”:

And whereas the Government of Canada desires that the

Province should be placed in a position of equality with the other provinces of Confederation with respect to the administration and control of its natural resources as from its entry into

Confederation in 1905:

And whereas the Government of the Province contends that,

before the Province was constituted and entered into Confederation as aforesaid, the Parliament of Canada was not competent to enact that the natural resources within the area now included within the boundaries of the Province should vest in the Crown and be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada and was not entitled to administer the said natural resources otherwise than for the benefit of the residents within the Baid area, and moreover that the Province is entitled to be and should be placed in a position of equality with the other

Provinces of Confederation with respect to its natural resources as from the fifteenth day of July, 1870, when Rupert’s Land

300 Ch. 26. British North America 20 & 21 Geo. 5.

Act, 1930.

and the North-Western Territory were admitted into and became 1

part of the Do mini on of, Canada:

And whereas it has been agreed between Canada and the said Province that the said section of the Saskatchewan Act should be modified and that provision should be made for the determination of the respective rights and obligations of Canada and the Province as herein set out:

Now therefore this Agreement Witnesseth:

(a) any deduction, which was made before the expiration of one month from the passing of the resolution and which would if the tax had been renewed at the rate imposed for the previous year have been a legal deduction, shall be deemed to be a deduction rendered legal by section two of the said Act, and the said section two shall,

subject to the provisions of this section, apply accordingly; •>

(b) any over-deduction to be made good under the said section two may be made good by a reduction of the amount of tax deducted from the next payment of like nature made on the security or share in question after the .passing of the Act imposing the tax for the year:

Provided that the foregoing provision shall not authorise the retention of any part of the amount over-deducted for more than one year from the passing of the Act so imposing the tax;

been deducted therefrom by reference to a standard rate of tax greater or less than the standard rate for the year in which the dividend became due, the net amount received shall, for all the purposes of the

Income Tax Acts, be deemed to represent income of such an amount as would, after deduction of tax by reference to the standard rate last-mentioned, be equal to the net amount received, and for the said purposes there shall in respect of that income be deemed to have been paid by deduction tax of such an amount as is equal to the amount of tax on that income computed by reference to the standard rate last-mentioned.

and”

(3) If the owner of any undertaking (in this subsection referred to as the “transferor undertaking”)

proposed by any scheme submitted by the Coal Mines

Reorganisation Commission to be amalgamated with, or absorbed in, any other undertaking (in this subsection referred to as the “transferee undertaking”) satisfies the Railway and Canal Commission that any property,

Railway and Canal Commission under the Act of 1926,

it shall not be necessary for the Board to refer the scheme to the Railway and Canal Commission under that Act, but if the Board certify that the provisions of the scheme as to any debentures or as to the issue of any share or loan capital are reasonably required for the purpose of the amalgamation, subsection (2) of section five of the Act of 1926 (which grants certain exemptions from stamp duty in respect of schemes confirmed by the

Railway and Canal Commission) shall apply in respect of the scheme and of anything done in pursuance thereof as if the scheme had been confirmed by the Railway and

(3) In this Act the word “expenses” includes any costs, charges or expenses incurred or to be incurred by a

Catchment Board in the execution of this Act, including the interest on, and provision for the repayment of, any moneys from time to time borrowed by the Catchment

Board under the provisions of this Act.

(a) an owner’s drainage rate, that is to say, a rate raised for the purpose of defraying expenses incurred in connection with new works or the improvement of existing works and charges in respect of contributions to be made by the board to a Catchment Board; or

(b) an occupier’s drainage rate, that is to say, a

rate raised for the purpose of defraying any other expenses or charges:

Provided that as regards any rates raised in order to defray expenses incurred, or charges in respect of liabilities incurred, before the commencement of this Act, the provisions as to the incidence of rates contained in section thirty-eight of the Land Drainage Act, 1861, or, in the case of rates raised under any local Act, the corresponding provisions in that Act, shall have effect in substitution for the provisions of this subsection.

(b) in the case of any other land, on one-third of the annual value thereof:

Provided that, where at the commencement of this Act a drainage board was levying drainage rates on the basis of acreage, or partly on the basis of acreage and partly on the basis of annual value, any rate made by that board at any time within the period of six months next following the commencement of this Act may be made on any basis on which it might have been made if this section had not been passed.

railway as aforesaid shall be treated as if it were divided into two parts by a line drawn along the centre thereof and each part shall be deemed to be of the same character and annual value as the land adjoining that part:

Provided that the annual value of the adjoining land shall for the purposes of this subsection be deemed to be reduced by such proportion thereof, if any, as is in the opinion of the drainage board ascribable to buildings.

(6) A drainage board, after consultation in. the case of an internal drainage board with the Catchment Board,

may, if having regard to all the circumstances of the case they think that it is just so to do, make and levy differential rates, and may for that purpose from time to time by order divide the district into sub-districts and determine the proportion which the amount per pound of annual value to be assessed upon the occupiers of hereditaments in any sub-district shall bear to the amount to be assessed on the occupiers of hereditaments in any other sub-district within the drainage district.

So long as any such order is in force, the provisions of the five last preceding subsections shall apply in the case of a sub-district as they apply in the case of a

drainage district not divided into sub-districts.

(7) A drainage board, after consultation in the case of an internal drainage board with the Catchment

Board, may by order determine that no rates shall be

Court shall, if they allow an appeal against conviction,

quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.

(3) On any appeal, whether against conviction or against sentence, the Court shall, if they think that

(4) If on any appeal it appears to the Court that,

although the appellant was guilty of the act or omission charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was done or omission made so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions, the Court may quash the sentence passed at the trial and order the appellant to be kept in custody as a criminal lunatic under the

Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, in the same manner as if

a special verdict had been found by the jury under that

Act.

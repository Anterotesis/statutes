( 2) In this section and sections 23 to 27 below " day " means
the period of 24 hours from midnight to midnight, and where a
period of employment begun on any day extends over mid-
night into the following day, or would normally so extend, then-
( a) if the employment before midnight is, or would nor-
mally be, of longer duration than that after midnight,
that period of employment shall be treated as falling
wholly on the first day ; and
( b) in any other case, that period of employment shall be
treated as falling wholly on the second day.
( 3) An employee shall not be entitled to a guarantee payment
under subsection ( 1) above in respect of a workless day unless
he has been continuously employed for a period of four weeks
ending with the last complete week before that day.
23.-( 1 ) An employee shall not be entitled to a guarantee
payment in respect of a workless day if the failure to provide
him with work occurs in consequence of a trade dispute involving
any employee of his employer or of an associated employer.
( 2 ) An employee shall not be entitled to a guarantee payment
in respect of a workless day if-
(a ) his employer has offered to provide alternative work for
that day which is suitable in all the circumstances,
whether or not work which the employee is under his
contract employed to perform, and the employee has
unreasonably refused that offer ; or
( b) he does not comply with reasonable requirements im-
posed by his employer with a view to ensuring that his
services are available.
24.-(1 ) Subject to the limits set by section 25 below, the
amount of a guarantee payment payable to an employee in
respect of any day shall be the sum produced by multiplying the
number of normal working hours on that day by the guaranteed
hourly rate, and accordingly no guarantee payment shall be
payable to an employee in whose case there are no normal
working hours on the day in question .
(2) Subject to subsection ( 4 ) below, the guaranteed hourly rate
in relation to an employee shall be the amount of one week's
pay divided by-
( a) the number of normal working hours in a week for that
employee when employed under the contract of employ-
ment in force on the day in respect of which the
guarantee payment is payable ; or
с.71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2125
( b) where the number of such normal working hours differs
from week to week or over a longer period, the average
number of such hours calculated by dividing by 12 the
total number of the employee's normal working hours
during the period of 12 weeks ending with the last
complete week before the day in respect of which the
guarantee payment is payable ; or
(c) in a case falling within paragraph (b) above but where
the employee has not been employed for a sufficient
period to enable the calculation to be made under
that paragraph, a number which fairly represents the
number of normal working hours in a week having
regard to such of the following considerations as are
appropriate in the circumstances, that is to say,-
(i) the average number of normal working hours
in a week which the employee could expect in accord-
ance with the terms of his contract ;
(ii ) the average number of such hours of other
employees engaged in relevant comparable employ-
ment with the same employer.
( 3) For the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4 to this Act
as it applies for the calculation of a week's pay for the purposes
of this section, the calculation date is, subject to subsection ( 4)
below, the day in respect of which the guarantee payment is
payable.
( 4 ) If in any case an employee's contract has been varied,
or a new contract has been entered into, in connection with a
period of short-time working, subsections (2) and (3) above shall
have effect as if for the references in those subsections to the day
in respect of which the guarantee payment is payable there were
substituted references to the last day on which the original con-
tract was in force.
( 5 ) In this section and section 25 below " week ", in relation
to an employee whose remuneration is calculated weekly by a
week ending with a day other than Saturday, means a week
ending with that other day, and in relation to other employees,
means a week ending with Saturday.

section (2) above shall be, subject to subsection (4) below,—
( a) the number of days, not exceeding five, on which the
employee normally works in a week under the contract
of employment in force on the day in respect of which
the guarantee payment is claimed ; or
( b) where that number of days varies from week to week
or over a longer period, the average number of such
days, not exceeding five, calculated by dividing by
12 the total number of such days during the period
of 12 weeks ending with the last complete week before
the day in respect of which the guarantee payment is
claimed, and rounding up the resulting figure to the
next whole number ; or
( c ) in a case falling within paragraph (b) above but where
the employee has not been employed for a sufficient
period to enable the calculation to be made under that
paragraph, a number which fairly represents the num-
ber of the employee's normal working days in a week,
not exceeding five, having regard to such of the follow-
ing considerations as are appropriate in the circum-
stances, that is to say, -
(i) the average number of normal working days
in a week which the employee could expect in
accordance with the terms of his contract ;
(ii) the average number of such days of other
employees engaged in relevant comparable employ-
ment with the same employer.
( 4) If in any case an employee's contract has been varied , or
a new contract has been entered into, in connection with a period
of short- time working, subsection (3) above shall have effect as
if for the references to the day in respect of which the guarantee
payment is claimed there were substituted references to the last
day on which the original contract was in force.

to in this section, and may in particular vary the relevant periods
referred to in subsection ( 2) above, after a review under section

respect of a workless day shall go towards discharging any
liability of the employer to pay a guarantee payment in respect of

that day, and conversely any guarantee payment paid in respect
of a day shall go towards discharging any liability of the
employer to pay contractual remuneration in respect of that
day .
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) above, contractual
remuneration shall be treated as paid in respect of a workless
day-

( a) where it is expressed to be calculated or payable by
reference to that day or any part of that day, to
the extent that it is so expressed ; and

work actually done, and is referable to that day when

workless period falling within the period in respect of
which the remuneration is paid.

for the complaint to be presented within the period of three
months.
(3) Where an industrial tribunal finds a complaint under sub-
section ( 1) above well- founded the tribunal shall order the
employer to pay the complainant the amount of guarantee
payment which it finds is due to him.

question had been duly paid by the employer to the employee

case to which subsection ( 1) of that section applies ; or
c.71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2139
( b) applied for a payment under section 43 above,

the amount of any such payment which it finds the Secretary of
State ought to make.

section 42 above, in a case to which subsection (2) of that
section applies, may, subject to subsection (5) below, appeal to
an industrial tribunal on the ground that-

comply with the determination.
(4) Where the Secretary of State determines that an amount
is recoverable from an employer under section 44 above, the
employer may, subject to subsection (5) below, appeal to an
industrial tribunal ; and if on any such appeal the tribunal is
satisfied that no amount should be recovered from the employer,

recoverable from the employer by the Secretary of State.

appeal under this section unless it is presented to the tribunal
within the period of three months beginning with the date on

Right to return
to work.
48.-( 1 ) The right to return to work of an employee who has
been absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy or
confinement is, subject to the following provisions of this Act, a
right to return to work with her original employer, or, where
appropriate, his successor, at any time before the end of the
period of 29 weeks beginning with the week in which the date
of confinement falls, in the job in which she was employed under
the original contract of employment and on terms and conditions
not less favourable than those which would have been applicable
to her if she had not been so absent.
(2) In subsection ( 1) above-
(a) " job ", in relation to an employee, means the nature
of the work which she is employed to do in accordance
with her contract and the capacity and place in which
she is so employed ; and
(b) " terms and conditions not less favourable than those
which would have been applicable to her if she had
c .71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2141
not been so absent " means, as regards seniority, pen-
sion rights and other similar rights, that the period or
periods of employment prior to the employee's absence
shall be regarded as continuous with her employment
following that absence.
(3) In sections 35 and 49 to 51 of, and Schedule 3 to, this
66
Act, except where the context otherwise requires, " to return to
work " means to return to work in accordance with subsection ( 1 )
above, and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly.
( 4 ) If an employee is entitled to return to work in accordance
with subsection ( 1) above, but it is not practicable by reason of
redundancy for the employer to permit her so to return to work,
she shall be entitled, where there is a suitable available vacancy,
to be offered alternative employment with her employer (or his
successor), or an associated employer, under a new contract of
employment complying with subsection (5) below.
(5) The new contract of employment must be such that-
( a ) the work to be done under the contract is of a kind
which is both suitable in relation to the employee and
appropriate for her to do in the circumstances ; and
(b) the provisions of the new contract as to the capacity and
place in which she is to be employed and as to the
other terms and conditions of her employment are not
substantially less favourable to her than if she had
returned to work in accordance with subsection ( 1 )
above.
(6) The remedies of an employee for infringement of either of
the rights mentioned in this section are those conferred by or by
virtue of the provisions of sections 49 and 50 below and Schedule
3 to this Act.
PART II
49.-(1 ) An employee shall exercise her right to return to Exercise of
work by notifying the employer ( who may be her original right to return.
employer or a successor of that employer) at least one week
before the day on which she proposes to return of her proposal to
return on that day (hereafter in this section and section 50 below
and Schedule 3 to this Act referred to as the " notified day of
return ") .
(2) An employer may postpone an employee's return to work
until a date not more than four weeks after the notified day of
return if he notifies her before that day that for specified reasons
he is postponing her return until that date, and accordingly she
will be entitled to return to work with him on that date.
F3
c. 71
2142 Employment Protection Act 1975
PART II (3) Subject to subsection ( 4) below, an employee may-
( a ) postpone her return to work until a date not exceeding
four weeks from the notified day of return, notwith-
standing that that date falls after the end of the period
of 29 weeks mentioned in section 48( 1) above ; and
( b) where no day of return has been notified to the em-
ployer, extend the time during which she may exercise
her right to return in accordance with subsection ( 1)
above, so that she returns to work not later than
four weeks from the expiration of the said period of
29 weeks ;
if before the notified day of return or, as the case may be, the
expiration of the period of 29 weeks she gives the employer a
certificate from a registered medical practitioner stating that by
reason of disease or bodily or mental disablement she will be
incapable of work on the notified day of return or the expiration
of that period, as the case may be.
( 4) Where an employee has once exercised a right of post-
ponement or extension under subsection (3)(a) or (b) above, she
shall not again be entitled to exercise a right of postponement
or extension under that subsection in connection with the same
return to work.
( 5 ) If an employee has notified a day of return but there
is an interruption of work (whether due to industrial action
or some other reason) which renders it unreasonable to expect
the employee to return to work on the notified day of return,
she may instead return to work when work resumes after
the interruption or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter .
( 6) If no day of return has been notified and there is an
interruption of work (whether due to industrial action or some
other reason) which renders it unreasonable to expect the
employee to return to work before the expiration of the period
of 29 weeks referred to in section 48( 1 ) above, or which appears
likely to have that effect, and in consequence the employee does
not notify a day of return, the employee may exercise her right
to return in accordance with subsection ( 1) above so that she
returns to work at any time before the end of the period of
14 days from the end of the interruption notwithstanding that
she returns to work outside the said period of 29 weeks .
( 7) Where the employee has either-
(a ) exercised the right under subsection (3)(b) above to
extend the period during which she may exercise her
right to return ; or
c.71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2143
(b) refrained from notifying the day of return in the
circumstances described in subsection (6) above,
the other of those subsections shall apply as if for the reference
to the expiration of the period of 29 weeks there were substituted
a reference to the expiration of the further period of four
weeks or, as the case may be, of the period of 14 days from
the end of the interruption of work.
(8) Where
(a) an employee's return is postponed under subsection
( 2) or (3) (a) above, or
(b) the employee returns to work on a day later than the
notified day of return in the circumstances described
in subsection (5) above,
then, subject to subsection ( 4) above, references in those sub-
sections and in section 50 below and Schedule 3 to this Act to
the notified day of return shall be construed as references to the
day to which the return is postponed or, as the case may be,
that later day.

she was not permitted to return .

Written statement of reasons for dismissal
70.-( 1 ) An employee shall be entitled-
(a) if he is given by his employer notice of termination of

to be provided by his employer, on request, within 14 days of
that request, with a written statement giving particulars of
the reasons for his dismissal .

given in purported compliance with that subsection
are PART II
inadequate or untrue, and if the tribunal finds the complaint well-
founded-
(a ) it may make a declaration as to what it finds the em-
ployer's reasons were for dismissing the employee ;
and
( b) it shall make an award that the employer pay to the
employee a sum equal to the amount of two weeks'
pay.
( 5) An industrial tribunal shall not entertain a complaint
under this section relating to the reasons for a dismissal unless
it is presented to the tribunal at such a time that the tribunal
would, in accordance with paragraph 21(4) or (4A) of Schedule 1
to the 1974 Act, entertain a complaint of unfair dismissal in
respect of that dismissal presented at the same time.
( 6) For the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4 to this Act as
it applies for the calculation of a week's pay for the purposes of
this section, the calculation date where the dismissal was with
notice is the date on which the employer's notice was given and
in any other case is the effective date of termination .
Remedies for unfair dismissal
71.-( 1 ) Where on a complaint under paragraph 17 of Order for
Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (unfair dismissal) an industrial reinstatement
tribunal finds that the grounds of the complaint are well- or re-
founded , it shall explain to the complainant what orders for engagement.
reinstatement or re- engagement may be made under this section
and in what circumstances they may be made, and shall ask him
whether he wishes the tribunal to make such an order, and if
he does express such a wish the tribunal may make an order
under this section.
( 2) An order under this section may be an order for reinstate-
ment (in accordance with subsections (3) and (4 ) below) or an
order for re-engagement (in accordance with subsection ( 5)
below ), as the tribunal may decide, and in the latter case may
be on such terms as the tribunal may decide.
( 3) An order for reinstatement is an order that the employer
shall treat the complainant in all respects as if he had not been
dismissed, and on making such an order the tribunal shall
specify-
( a ) any amount payable by the employer in respect of
any benefit which the complainant might reasonably
be expected to have had but for the dismissal ,
including arrears of pay, for the period between the
date of termination of employment and the date of
reinstatement ;
с .71
2164 Employment Protection Act 1975
PART II ( b) any rights and privileges, including seniority and
pension rights , which must be restored to the employee ;
and
( c) the date by which the order must be complied with.
( 4 ) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3)
above, if the complainant would have benefited from an
improvement in his terms and conditions of employment had
he not been dismissed, an order for reinstatement shall require
him to be treated as if he had benefited from that improvement
from the date on which he would have done so but for being
dismissed.
( 5 ) An order for re - engagement is an order that the com-
plainant be engaged by the employer, or by a successor of the
employer or by an associated employer, in employment com-
parable to that from which he was dismissed or other suitable
employment, and on making such an order the tribunal shall
specify the terms on which re - engagement is to take place
including-
( a ) the identity of the employer ;
( b) the nature of the employment ;
(c) the remuneration for the employment ;
( d ) any amount payable by the employer in respect of
any benefit which the complainant might reasonably
be expected to have had but for the dismissal, including
arrears of pay, for the period between the date of
termination of employment and the date of
re-engagement ;
(e) any rights and privileges, including seniority and pension
rights, which must be restored to the employee ; and
(f ) the date by which the order must be complied with.
(6 ) In exercising its discretion under this section the tribunal
shall first consider whether to make an order for reinstatement
and in so doing shall take into account the following considera-
tions, that is to say-
(a) whether the complainant wishes to be reinstated ;
( b) whether it is practicable for the employer to comply
with an order for reinstatement ;
( c ) where the complainant caused or contributed to some
extent to the dismissal, whether it would be just to
order his reinstatement.
( 7) If the tribunal decides not to make an order for reinstate-
ment it shall then consider whether to make an order for
re - engagement and if so on what terms ; and in so doing the
c . 71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2165
tribunal shall take into account the following considerations,
that is to say-
(a ) any wish expressed by the complainant as to the nature
of the order to be made;
(b ) whether it is practicable for the employer or, as the
case may be, a successor or associated employer to
comply with an order for re - engagement ;
( c ) where the complainant caused or contributed to some
extent to the dismissal, whether it would be just to
order his re - engagement and if so on what terms ;
and except in a case where the tribunal takes into account
contributory fault under paragraph (c) above it shall, if it
orders re- engagement, do so on terms which are, so far as is
reasonably practicable, as favourable as an order for
reinstatement.
(8) Where in any case an employer has engaged a permanent
replacement for a dismissed employee the tribunal shall not take
that fact into account in determining, for the purposes of sub-
section (6) (b) or (7)(b) above whether it is practicable to comply
with an order for reinstatement or re - engagement unless the
employer shows-
( a ) that it was not practicable for him to arrange for the
dismissed employee's work to be done without engaging
a permanent replacement ; or
( b) that he engaged the replacement after the lapse of a
reasonable period, without having heard from the dis-
missed employee that he wished to be reinstated or
re-engaged, and that when the employer engaged the
replacement it was no longer reasonable for him to
arrange for the dismissed employee's work to be done
except by a permanent replacement.
( 9) In calculating for the purpose of subsection (3) (a) or (5) (d)
above any amount payable by the employer the tribunal shall
take into account, so as to reduce the employer's liability, any
sums received by the complainant in respect of the period
between the date of termination of employment and the date of
reinstatement or re- engagement by way of-
( a) wages in lieu of notice or ex gratia payments paid by
the employer ;
(b) remuneration paid in respect of employment with
another employer ;
and such other benefits as the tribunal thinks appropriate in
the circumstances .

72.- ( 1 ) If an order under section 71 above is made and the
complainant is reinstated or, as the case may be, re - engaged
but the terms of the order are not fully complied with, then,
subject to paragraph 20 of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (limit
on compensation), an industrial tribunal shall make an award
of compensation, to be paid by the employer to the employee,
of such amount as the tribunal thinks fit having regard to
the loss sustained by the complainant in consequence of the
failure to comply fully with the terms of the order.
( 2 ) Subject to subsection ( 1) above, if an order under
section 71 above is made but the complainant is not reinstated
or, as the case may be, re - engaged in accordance with the
order-
(a ) the tribunal shall make an award of compensation for
unfair dismissal, calculated in accordance with sections
73 to 76 below, to be paid by the employer to the
employee ; and
( b) unless the employer satisfies the tribunal that it was
not practicable to comply with the order, the tribunal
shall make an additional award of compensation to be
paid by the employer to the employee of an amount-
( i) where the dismissal is of a description referred
to in subsection (3) below, not less than 26 or more
than 52 weeks' pay, or
(ii) in any other case, not less than 13 or more
than 26 weeks' pay.
(3) The descriptions of dismissal in respect of which an
employer may incur a higher additional award in accordance
with subsection (2)(b) (i) above are the following, that is to say, --
(a ) a dismissal which is unfair by virtue of paragraph 6(4)
or (5) of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (dismissal for
membership or non-membership of a trade union, or
for taking part in the activities of an independent trade
union) ;
(b) a dismissal which is an unlawful act of discrimination
by virtue of section 3( 1) of the Race Relations Act
1968 ;
(c) a dismissal which is an act of discrimination (within
the meaning of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975)
which is unlawful by virtue of that Act .
(4) Where in any case an employer has engaged a permanent
replacement for a dismissed employee the tribunal shall not take
that fact into account in determining, for the purposes of sub-
section (2) (b) above whether it was practicable to comply with
the order for reinstatement or re - engagement unless the employer
c . 71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2167
shows that it was not practicable for him to arrange for the dis-
missed employee's work to be done without engaging a permanent
replacement.
PART II
( 5) If on a complaint under paragraph 17 of Schedule 1 to
the 1974 Act the tribunal finds that the grounds of the complaint
are well-founded, and no order is made under section 71 above
the tribunal shall make an award of compensation for unfair
dismissal, calculated in accordance with sections 73 to 76 below
to be paid by the employer to the employee.
(6) Where in any case the tribunal makes an award of com-
pensation for unfair dismissal, calculated in accordance with
sections 73 to 76 below, and the tribunal finds that the com-
plainant has unreasonably prevented an order under section 71
above from being complied with, it shall, without prejudice to
the generality of section 76( 4) below, take that conduct into
account as a failure on the part of the complainant to mitigate
his loss.
(7) For the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4 as it applies for
the calculation of a week's pay for the purpose of subsection
(2 ) (b) above, the calculation date where the dismissal was with
notice is the date on which the notice was given and in any
other case the effective date of termination.
(8) Notwithstanding anything in the said Part II , the amount
of a week's pay for the purpose of calculating an additional
award under subsection (2) (b) above shall not exceed £80.
73. Where a tribunal makes an award of compensation for Compensation
unfair dismissal under section 72( 2) (a) or (5) above, the award for unfair
shall consist of a basic award (calculated in accordance with dismissal.
sections 74 and 75 below) and a compensatory award ( calculated

where compensation in respect of the same matter is
also awarded under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975) .
( 2) In the following cases the amount of the basic award shall
be two weeks' pay : -
( a ) where the tribunal finds that the reason or principal
reason for the dismissal of the employee was that he
was redundant and the employee-
(i) by virtue of section 2( 5) or (6 ) of the
Redundancy Payments Act 1965 (unreasonable
refusal or relinquishment of suitable alternative
employment) is not, or if he were otherwise entitled
would not be, entitled to a redundancy payment ; or
(ii) by virtue of the operation of section 3(3) of
that Act (renewal of employment or re- engagement)
is not treated as dismissed for the purposes of Part I
of that Act ;
(b) where the amount calculated in accordance with sub-
sections (3) to (7) and section 75( 1) to (7) below is less
than the amount of two weeks' pay.
( 3) The amount of the basic award shall be calculated by
reference to the period, ending with the effective date of termina-
tion, during which the employee has been continuously
employed, by starting at the end of that period and reckoning
backwards the numbers of years of employment falling within
that period, and allowing-
(a) one and a half weeks' pay for each such year of employ-
ment which consists wholly of weeks in which the
employee was not below the age of 41 ;
( b) one week's pay for each such year of employment which
consists wholly of weeks in which the employee was
below the age of 41 and was not below the age of 22 ;
and
(c ) half a week's pay for each such year of employment
which consists wholly of weeks in which the employee
was below the age of 22 and was not below the age of
18.
( 4) In ascertaining for the purpose of subsection ( 3) above
the period for which an employee has been continuously
employed, where the effective date of termination falls to be
determined in accordance with paragraph 5( 6) of Schedule 1
to the 1974 Act, a period falling within such an interval as is
referred to in paragraph 30( 1A) of that Schedule ( period of
continuous employment) shall count as a period of employment
notwithstanding that it does not count under Schedule 1
to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 (computation of period
of employment) .
c .71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2169
( 5 ) Where in reckoning the number of years of employment
PART II
in accordance with subsection ( 3) above 20 years of employ-
ment have been reckoned no account shall be taken of any year
of employment earlier than those 20 years.
( 6 ) Where in the case of an employee the effective date of
termination is after the specified anniversary the amount of the
basic award calculated in accordance with subsections (3) to
( 5) above shall be reduced by the appropriate fraction.
( 7 ) In subsection ( 6 ) above " the specified anniversary " in
relation to a man means the 64th anniversary of the day of his
birth, and in relation to a woman means the 59th anniversary
of the day of her birth, and " the appropriate fraction " means
the fraction of which-
( a ) the numerator is the number of whole months reckoned
from the specified anniversary in the period beginning
with that anniversary and ending with the effective date
of termination ; and
( b) the denominator is 12.
75.-( 1 ) For the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4 to this Provisions
Act as it applies for the calculation of a week's pay for the supplementary
purposes of section 74 above, the calculation date is, subject to
to s. 74.
subsection (3) below, the date on which notice would have been
given by the employer had the conditions referred to in sub-
section (2) below been fulfilled ( whether those conditions were
in fact fulfilled or not) .
( 2 ) Those conditions are that the contract was terminable by
notice and was terminated by the employer giving such notice
as is required to terminate that contract by section 1 (1) of the
Contracts of Employment Act 1972 ( minimum period of notice), 1972 c. 53.
and that the notice expired on the effective date of termination.
( 3) Where by virtue of paragraph 5( 6) of Schedule 1 to the
1974 Act a date is to be treated as the effective date of termina-
tion for the purposes of section 74(3) above which is later than
the effective date of termination as defined by paragraph 5(5)
of that Schedule, then, for the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4
to this Act as it applies for the calculation of a week's pay for
the purpose of section 74 above, the calculation date is the
effective date of termination as defined by the said paragraph
5(5 ) .
( 4 ) Notwithstanding anything in the said Part II, the amount
of a week's pay for the purpose of calculating a basic award
shall not exceed £80.
(5) The Secretary of State may, after a review under section
86 below, vary the limit referred to in subsection (4 ) above by
order made in accordance with that section.

make transitional provision in an order under subsection (5)
above, such an order may provide that it shall apply in the
case of a dismissal in relation to which the effective date of
termination for the purposes of this subsection (as defined by
paragraph 5(6 ) of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act) falls after the
order comes into operation, notwithstanding that the effective
date of termination for the purposes of other provisions of this
Act or the 1974 Act (as defined by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 1
to the 1974 Act ) falls before the order comes into operation.
( 7) Where the tribunal finds that the dismissal was to any
extent caused or contributed to by any action of the com-
plainant it shall, except in a case where the dismissal was by
reason of redundancy, reduce the amount of the basic award
by such proportion as it considers just and equitable having
regard to that finding.
(8) The amount of the basic award shall be reduced or, as the
case may be, be further reduced, by the amount of any redun-

Payments Act 1965 in respect of the same dismissal or of any
payment made by the employer to the employee on the ground
that the dismissal was by reason of redundancy, whether in

the tribunal considers just and equitable in all the circum-
stances having regard to the loss sustained by the complainant
in consequence of the dismissal in so far as that loss is
attributable to action taken by the employer.
( 2) The said loss shall be taken to include-
( a) any expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant
in consequence of the dismissal, and
( b) subject to subsection (3) below, loss of any benefit
which he might reasonably be expected to have had
but for the dismissal.
(3) The said loss, in respect of any loss of any entitlement
or potential entitlement to, or expectation of, a payment on
account of dismissal by reason of redundancy, whether in

( b) had taken, or proposed to take, part at any appropriate
time in the activities of a particular independent trade
union of which he was or proposed to become a
member ;
may, subject to the following provisions of this section, apply
to the tribunal for an order under the following provisions of
this section.
( 2 ) An industrial tribunal shall not entertain an application
under this section unless-
( a ) it is presented to the tribunal before the end of the
period of seven days immediately following the effec-

thatdate ) ; and
(b) before the end of that period there is also so presented
a certificate in writing signed by an authorised official
of the independent trade union of which the employee
was or had proposed to become a member stating that
on the date of the dismissal the employee was or had
proposed to become a member of the union and that
there appear to be reasonable grounds for supposing
that the reason for his dismissal (or, if more than one,
the principal reason) was one alleged in the complaint.
( 3) An industrial tribunal shall determine an application under
this section as soon as practicable after receiving the application
and the relevant certificate, but shall, at least seven days before
the date of the hearing, give the employer a copy of the applica-
tion and certificate, together with notice of the date, time and
place of the hearing.
( 4 ) An industrial tribunal shall not exercise any power it has
of postponing the hearing in the case of an application under this
section except where the tribunal is satisfied that special
circumstances exist which justify it in doing so.
( 5 ) If on hearing an application under this section it appears to
an industrial tribunal that it is likely that on determining the
complaint to which the application relates the tribunal will find
that the complainant was unfairly dismissed and that the reason
for the dismissal or (if more than one, the principal reason) was
a reason mentioned in subsection ( 1) above, the tribunal shall
announce its findings and explain to both parties ( if present)
c .71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2173
what powers the tribunal may exercise on an application under
this section and in what circumstances it may exercise them, and
shall ask the employer (if present) whether he is willing, pending

employee in all respects as if he had not been dis-
missed; or
( b) if not, to re -engage him in another job on terms and
conditions not less favourable than those which would
have been applicable to him if he had not been
dismissed .
( 6 ) In subsection (5 ) above " terms and conditions not less
favourable than those which would have been applicable to
him if he had not been dismissed " means, as regards seniority,
pension rights and other similar rights, that the period prior to
the dismissal shall be regarded as continuous with his employ-
ment following the dismissal.
( 7 ) If the employer states that he is willing to reinstate the
employee, the tribunal shall make an order to that effect.
( 8) If the employer states that he is willing to re - engage the
employee in another job and specifies the terms and conditions
on which he is willing to do so, the tribunal shall ask the
employee whether he is willing to accept the job on those terms
and conditions, and-
( a) if the employee is willing to accept the job on those
terms and conditions, the tribunal shall make an order
to that effect ; and
( b ) if the employee is unwilling to accept the job on those
terms and conditions, then, if the tribunal is of the
opinion that the refusal is reasonable, the tribunal shall
make an order for the continuation of his contract
of employment, but otherwise the tribunal shall make
no order under this section.
( 9) If on the hearing of an application under this section the
employer fails to attend before the tribunal or he states that he
is unwilling either to reinstate the employee or re-engage him as
mentioned in subsection (5) above, the tribunal shall make an
order for the continuation of the employee's contract of employ-
ment.

by him ), to the date on which the employer's notice
was given ; and
( b) in any other case, to the effective date of termination.
(11) A document purporting to be an authorisation of an
official by a trade union to act for the purposes of this section
and to be signed on behalf of the union shall be taken to be such
an authorisation unless the contrary is proved, and a document
purporting to be a certificate signed by such an official shall be

out of the change to the renewed, or new, employment,
terminates the contract, or gives notice to terminate
it and the contract is thereafter, in consequence,
terminated,
then, the employee shall remain entitled under the protective
award unless, in a case falling within paragraph (a) above, he

Introductory
1. References in this Schedule to provisions of this Act and the

Redundancy Payments Act 1965 are references to those provisions 1965 с. 62.
as they apply by virtue of section 50 above.
2226 Employment Protection Act 1975
c . 71
SCH. 3
1965 с. 62.
Adaptation of unfair dismissal provisions
2.- (1 ) Paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (fair and un
fair dismissal shall have effect as if for sub- paragraph ( 8) there were
substituted the following sub- paragraph : -
" ( 8) Subject to sub-paragraphs ( 4), ( 6) and (7 ) above, the
determination of the question whether the dismissal was fair or
unfair, having regard to the reason shown by the employer, shall
depend on whether the employer can satisfy the tribunal that in
the circumstances ( having regard to equity and the substantial
merits of the case ) he would have been acting reasonably in
treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee if
she had not been absent from work. ".
( 2 ) If in the circumstances described in section 48( 4 ) above no offer
is made of such alternative employment as is referred to in that
subsection, then the dismissal which by virtue of section 50 above
is treated as taking place shall, notwithstanding anything in para-
graph 6 of that Schedule, be treated as an unfair dismissal for the
purposes of that Schedule.
( 3) The following references shall be construed as references to
the notified day of return, that is to say-
( a ) references in that Schedule and in section 74 above to the
effective date of termination ;
( b) references in section 71 above to the date of termination of
employment .
( 4 ) The following provisions of that Schedule shall not apply, that is
to say, paragraphs 5, 6( 5 ), 9 to 14, and 30(1A).
( 5 ) The following provisions of this Act shall not apply, that is
to say, sections 72(7) , 74(4), (6) and (7) and 75(1) to ( 3) and (6) .
( 6 ) For the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4 to this Act as it
applies for the calculation of a week's pay for the purposes of
section 72 or 74 above, the calculation date is the last day on which
the employee worked under the original contract of employment.
Adaptation of redundancy payments provisions
3.- (1 ) References in the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 shall
be adapted as follows, that is to say-
( a ) references to the relevant date, wherever they occur, shall be
construed, except where the context otherwise requires, as
references to the notified day of return ;
( b ) references in sections 2( 4 ) and 3( 3) of that Act ( offer of
alternative employment) to a renewal or re-engagement
taking effect immediately on the ending of employment under
the previous contract or after an interval of not more than
four weeks thereafter, shall be construed as references to a
renewal or re- engagement taking effect on the notified day
of return or not more than four weeks after that day ; and
( c ) references in section 3( 5 ) of that Act ( trial period ) to the
provisions of the previous contract shall be construed as
c . 71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2227
references to the provisions of the original contract of
employment..
( 2 ) Nothing in section 50 above shall prevent an employee from
being treated, by reason of the operation of section 3( 3) of the said
Act of 1965, as not having been dismissed for the purposes of
thatAct.
( 3) The following provisions of the said Act of 1965 shall not
apply, that is to say, sections 1 (1 ) (b) , 2(1 ) and (2), 3(1), (2) and (10),
4 to 7, 10, 11, 16( 2) and ( 3), 22, 23 and 40, paragraphs 4 and 5( 3)
and (7 ) of Schedule 1 and Schedule 4.
( 4 ) For the purposes of Part II of Schedule 4 to this Act as
it applies for the calculation of a week's pay for the purposes of
Schedule 1 to the said Act of 1965 (computation of redundancy
payments), the calculation date is the last day on which the employee
worked under the original contract of employment.
Dismissal during period of absence
4.- (1) This paragraph applies to the dismissal of an employee
who is under the foregoing provisions of this Act entitled to return
to work and whose contract of employment continues to subsist
during the period of her absence but who is dismissed by her
employer during that period after the beginning of the 11th week
before the expected week of confinement.
( 2 ) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) above an employee
shall not be taken to be dismissed during the period of her absence
if the dismissal occurs in the course of the employee's attempting
to return to work in accordance with her contract in circumstances
in which paragraph 5 below applies.
( 3) In the application of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act to a dismissal
to which this paragraph applies, the following provisions shall not
apply, that is to say, paragraphs 6( 5), 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14.
( 4 ) Any such dismissal shall not affect the employee's right to
return to work, but-
( a ) compensation in any unfair dismissal proceedings arising
out of that dismissal shall be assessed without regard to
the employee's right to return ; and
( b ) that right shall be exercisable only on her repaying any
redundancy payment or compensation for unfair dismissal
paid in respect of that dismissal, if the employer requests
such repayment.
Contractual right to return
5.- (1 ) An employee who has a right both under this Act and
under a contract of employment, or otherwise, to return to work,
may not exercise the two rights separately but may in returning
to work take advantage of whichever right is, in any particular
respect, the more favourable.
( 2) The provisions of sections 48 to 50 and paragraphs 1 to 4
above, shall apply, subject to any modifications necessary to give
SCH. 3
c .71
2228 Employment Protection Act 1975
SCH. 3
1965 с. 62.
effect to any more favourable contractual terms, to the exercise of
the composite right described in sub- paragraph (1) above as they
apply to the exercise of the right to return conferred solely by this
Act .
Prior redundancy
6. If in proceedings arising out of a failure to permit an employee
to return to work, the employer shows-
( a ) that the reason for the failure is that the employee is
redundant ; and
( b ) that the employee was dismissed or, had she continued
to be employed by him, would have been dismissed, by
reason of redundancy during her absence on a day earlier
than the notified day of return and falling after the begin-
ning of the 11th week before the expected week of
confinement,
then, for the purposes of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 the
employee-
( i ) shall not be treated as having been dismissed with effect
from the notified day of return ; but
(ii) shall, if she would not otherwise be so treated, be treated
as having been continuously employed until that earlier
day and as having been dismissed by reason of redundancy
with effect from that day.
Power to amend or modify
7.- (1 ) The Secretary of State may by order amend the provisions
of this Schedule or modify the application of those provisions to any
description of case.
( 2 ) No order under this paragraph shall be made unless a draft
of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a
resolution of each House of Parliament.

PART I
NORMAL WORKING HOURS
1. For the purposes of this Schedule the cases where there are
normal working hours include cases where the employee is entitled
to overtime pay when employed for more than a fixed number of
hours in a week or other period, and, subject to paragraph 2 below,
in those cases that fixed number of hours shall be the normal working
hours.
2. If in such a case-
( a ) the contract of employment fixes the number, or the mini-
mum number, of hours of employment in the said week or
c . 71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2229
other period (whether or not it also provides for the reduction of that number or minimum in certain circum-
stances ), and
( b ) that number or minimum number of hours exceeds the
number of hours without overtime,
that number or minimum number of hours ( and not the number of
hours without overtime ) shall be the normal working hours.
SCH. 4
PART II
A WEEK'S PAY
Employments for which there are normal working hours
3.- (1 ) This paragraph and paragraph 4below shall apply if there
are normal working hours for an employee when employed under the
contract of employment in force on the calculation date.
( 2 ) Subject to paragraph 4 below, if an employee's remuneration
for employment in normal working hours, whether by the hour
or week or other period, does not vary with the amount of work
done in the period , the amount of a week's pay shall be the amount
which is payable by the employer under the contract of employment
in force on the calculation date if the employee works throughout
his normal working hours in a week.
( 3) Subject to paragraph 4below, if sub-paragraph ( 2 ) above does
not apply, the amount of a week's pay shall be the amount of
remuneration for the number of normal working hours in a week
calculated at the average hourly rate of remuneration payable by
the employer to the employee in respect of the period of 12 weeks-
( a ) where the calculation date is the last day of a week, ending
with that week ;
( b ) in any other case, ending with the last complete week before
the calculation date.
( 4 ) References in this paragraph to remuneration varying with the
amount of work done include references to remuneration which may
include any commission or similar payment which varies in amount.
4.- (1) This paragraph shall apply if there are normal working
hours for an employee when employed under the contract of employ-
ment in force on the calculation date, and he is required under
that contract to work during those hours on days of the week or
at times of the day which differ from week to week or over a
longer period so that the remuneration payable for, or apportionable
to, any week varies according to the incidence of the said days or
times .
( 2 ) The amount of a week's pay shall be the amount of remunera-
tion for the average weekly number of normal working hours
( calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph ( 3) below) at the
c.71
2230 Employment Protection Act 1975
SCH. 4 average hourly rate of remuneration ( calculated in accordance with
sub- paragraph (4 ) below ).
(3) The average number of weekly hours shall be calculated by
dividing by 12 the total number of the employee's normal working
hours during the period of 12 weeks-
( a ) where the calculation date is the last day of a week, ending
with that week ;
( b) in any other case, ending with the last complete week before
the calculation date.
( 4 ) The average hourly rate of remuneration shall be the average
hourly rate of remuneration payable by the employer to the employce
in respect of the period of 12 weeks-
( a) where the calculation date is the last day of a week, ending
with that week ;
(b ) in any other case, ending with the last complete week before
the calculation date.
5.- (1) For the purpose of paragraphs 3 and 4 above, in arriving
at the average hourly rate of remuneration only the hours when the
employee was working, and only the remuneration payable for, or,
apportionable to, those hours of work, shall be brought in ; and if
for any of the 12 weeks mentioned in either of those paragraphs
no such remuneration was payable by the employer to the employee,
account shall be taken of remuneration in earlier weeks so as to
bring the number of weeks of which account is taken up to 12.
( 2 ) Where, in arriving at the said hourly rate of remuneration ,
account has to be taken of remuneration payable for, or apportion-
able to, work done in hours other than normal working hours, and
the amount of that remuneration was greater than it would have
been if the work had been done in normal working hours, account
shall be taken of that remuneration as if-
( a ) the work had been done in normal working hours ; and
(b ) the amount of that remuneration had been reduced
accordingly.
( 3) For the purpose of the application of sub-paragraph ( 2) above
to a case falling within paragraph 2 above, sub - paragraph (2 ) shall
be construed as if for the words " had been done in normal working
hours ", in each place where those words occur, there were sub-
stituted the words " had been done in normal working hours falling
within the number of hours without overtime ".
Employments for which there are no normal working hours
6.- (1) This paragraph shall apply if there are no normal working
hours for an employee when employed under the contract of employ-
ment in force on the calculation date.

with that week ;
c. 71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2231
( b ) in any other case, ending with the last complete week before
the calculation date.
SCH. 4
( 3 ) In arriving at the said average weekly rate of remuneration
no account shall be taken of a week in which no remuneration was
payable by the employer to the employee and remuneration in
earlier weeks shall be brought in so as to bring the number of weeks
of which account is taken up to 12.
Supplemental
7. In any case in which an employee has not been employed for
a sufficient period to enable a calculation to be made under any of
the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the amount of
a week's pay shall be an amount which fairly represents a week's
pay; and in determining that amount the tribunal shall apply as
nearly as may be such of the foregoing provisions of this Part as it
considers appropriate, and may have regard to such of the following
considerations as it thinks fit , that is to say-
( a ) any remuneration received by the employee in respect of the
employment in question ;
( b ) the amount offered to the employee as remuneration in
respect of the employment in question ;
( c ) the remuneration received by other persons engaged in
relevant comparable employment with the same employer ;
( d ) the remuneration received by other persons engaged in
relevant comparable employment with other employers .
8. In arriving at an average hourly rate or average weekly rate
of remuneration under this Part of this Schedule-
( a ) account shall be taken of work for a former employer within
the period for which the average is to be taken if , by
virtue of Schedule 1 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 c. 53.
1972 (computation of period of employment) a period of
employment with the former employer counts as part of
the employee's continuous period of employment with the
later employer, and
(b ) " week " means, for an employee whose remuneration is
calculated weekly by a week ending with a day other than
Saturday, a week ending with that other day, and, for
other employees , means a week ending with Saturday.
9. Where under this Part of this Schedule account is to be taken
of remuneration or other payments for a period which does not
coincide with the periods for which the remuneration or other pay-
ments are calculated, then the remuneration or other payments shall
be apportioned in such manner as may be just.
10. The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that in
prescribed cases the amount of a week's pay shall be calculated
in such manner as the regulations may prescribe.

incapable of work because of sickness or injury, and-
( a ) one or more payments, by way of sick pay are made to
him by the employer in respect of that part of the period
of notice, and
( b) in calculating any such payment such an amount as is
referred to in sub-paragraph ( 1)( b) of this paragraph is
taken into account as therein mentioned,
then for the purposes of this Schedule the amount so taken into
account shall be treated as having been paid by the employer to
the employee by way of sick pay in respect of that part of that
period, and shall go towards meeting the liability of the employer
under paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 of this Schedule accordingly.
Absence on leave granted at request of employee

earnings in that part of the period of notice.
( 2 ) If, during the period of notice, the employee breaks the

PART I
SECTION 11 , AS SUBSTITUTED
NOTE : This Part of the Schedule reproduces section 11 with
amendments enabling wages councils, instead of the Secretary ofState,
to make orders under that section and enabling wages councils to
fix other terms and conditions of employment as well as remuneration
and holidays and to specify the date from which remuneration fixed
by them is to be payable.
11 .- (1) A wages council may make an order, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of this section, -
( a ) fixing the remuneration,
( b ) requiring holidays to be allowed,
( c ) fixing any other terms and conditions,
for all or any of the workers in relation to whom the council operates.
( 2) An order under this section requiring a holiday to be allowed
for a worker-
( a ) shall not be made unless both holiday remuneration in
respect of the period of the holiday and remuneration other
than holiday remuneration have been or are being fixed
under this Part of this Act for that worker ;
(b ) shall provide for the duration of the holiday being related
to the duration of the period for which the worker has
been employed or engaged to be employed by the employer
who is to allow the holiday ; and
( c ) subject as aforesaid, may make provision as to the times
at which or the periods within which, and the circumstances
in which, the holiday shall be allowed.
( 2A ) Any order under this section fixing holiday remuneration
may contain provisions-
( a ) as to the times at which, and the conditions subject to
which, that remuneration shall accrue and shall become
payable, and
(b ) for securing that any such remuneration which has accrued
due to a worker during his employment by any employer
c.71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2239
shall, in the event of his ceasing to be employed by that
employer before he becomes entitled to be allowed a
holiday by him, nevertheless become payable by the
employer to the worker.
( 3) Before making an order under this section, a wages council
shall make such investigations as it thinks fit and shall-
( a ) publish in the prescribed manner notice of the council's
proposals with respect to any new terms and conditions
of employment (that is to say, any terms and conditions of
employment differing from any then in force by virtue of
an order made under this section) ; and
( b) give the prescribed notice for the purpose of informing, so
far as practicable, all persons affected by the proposals,
stating the place where copies of the proposals may be
obtained and the period ( which shall not be less than
fourteen days from the date of publication of the notice )
within which written representations with respect to the
proposals may be sent to the council.
( 3A ) After considering any written representations made with
respect to any such proposals within the said period and making
such further inquiries as the council considers necessary, or if no
such representations are made within that period, after the expiration
of that period, the wages council may make an order-
( a ) giving effect to the proposals ; or
(b ) giving effect to them with such modifications as the council
thinks fit having regard to any such representations ;
but if it appears to the council that, having regard to the nature
of any proposed modifications, an opportunity should be given to
persons concerned to consider the modifications, the council shall
again publish the proposals and give notice under subsection (3)
of this section, and that subsection and this subsection shall apply
accordingly .
( 4 ) An order under this section shall have effect as regards any
terms as to remuneration as from a date specified in the order,
which may be a date earlier than the date of the order but not earlier
than the date on which the council agreed on those terms prior to
publishing the original proposals to which effect is given, with or
without modifications, by the order ; but where any such order
fixing workers' remuneration applies to any worker who is paid
wages at intervals not exceeding seven days and the date so specified
does not correspond with the beginning of the period for which the
wages are paid ( hereafter in this section referred to as a wages
period ), the order shall, as respects that worker, have effect as from
the beginning of the next wages period following the date specified
in the order.
( 4A ) Any increase in remuneration payable by virtue of an order
under this section in respect of any time before the date of the order
shall be paid by the employer within a period specified in the order,
being-
SCH. 7
( a ) in the case of a worker who is in the employment of the
employer on the date of the order, a period beginning
with that date; 14

SCH. 7
( b ) in the case of a worker who is no longer in the employment
of the employer on that date, a period beginning with
the date on which the employer receives from the worker
or a person acting on his behalf a request in writing for
the remuneration ;
but if , in the case of a worker falling within paragraph ( a) of this
subsection who is paid wages at intervals not exceeding seven days,
pay day (the day on which wages are normally paid to him ) for
any wages period falling wholly or partly within the period so
specified occurs within seven days from the end of that specified
period, any such remuneration shall be paid not later than pay
day .
( 5 ) As soon as a wages council has made an order under this
section it shall give the prescribed notice of the making and con-
tents of the order and shall then and subsequently give such notice
of other prescribed matters affecting its operation for the purpose
of informing, so far as practicable, all persons who will be affected
by it .
( 6 ) An order under this section may make different provision for
different cases and may amend or revoke previous orders under
this section.
( 7 ) A document purporting to be a copy of an order made by
awages council under this section and to be signed by the secretary
of the council shall be taken to be a true copy of the order unless
the contrary is proved.
( 8) An order under this section shall not prejudice any rights con-
ferred on any worker by or under any other enactment.
PART II
SECTION 12, AS SUBSTITUTED
NOTE : This Part of this Schedule reproduces section 12 with
amendments substituting any terms and conditions of employment
fixed by an order under section 11 (as well as remuneration so
fixed ) for those contained in a worker's contract of employment,
making it an offence to fail to pay arrears of remuneration related
to a period before the making of any such order and increasing
the powers of a convicting court to order an employer to pay the
remuneration or arrears .
Effect and
12. (1 ) If a contract between a worker to whom an order under
enforcement of section 11 of this Act applies and his employer provides for the
orders under
section 11 . payment of less remuneration than the statutory minimum remunera-
tion, it shall have effect as if the statutory minimum remuneration
were substituted for the remuneration provided for in the contract,
and if any such contract provides for the payment of any holiday
remuneration at times or subject to conditions other than those
specified in the order, it shall have effect as if the times or
conditions specified in the order were substituted for those provided
for in the contract.
c.71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2241
(1A ) If any such contract fixes terms and conditions other than
those relating to remuneration or wages which are less favourable
than the corresponding terms and conditions specified in an order
under section 11 of this Act it shall have effect as if the correspond-
ing terms and conditions were substituted for those fixed by the
contract .
( 2) If an employer fails-
( a ) to pay a worker to whom an order under section 11 of
this Act applies remuneration not less than the statutory
minimum remuneration ; or
( b) to pay him arrears of remuneration before the expiration
of the period specified in the order ; or
( c ) to pay him holiday remuneration at the times and subject
to the conditions specified in the order, or
( d ) to allow to any such worker the holidays fixed by the
order ;
he shall for each offence be liable on summary conviction to a
fine not exceeding £100.
( 3) Where proceedings are brought under the foregoing subsection
in respect of an offence consisting of a failure to pay remuneration
not less than the statutory minimum remuneration, or to pay
arrears of remuneration, and the employer or any other person
charged as a person to whose act or default the offence was due
is found guilty of the offence, then, subject to subsection (3A )
below, -
( a ) evidence may be given of any failure on the part of the
employer to pay any such remuneration or arrears during
the two years ending with the date of the offence to any
worker employed by him ; and
( b ) on proof of the failure, the court may order the employer
to pay such sum as is found by the court to represent
the difference between the amount of any such remunera-
tion or arrears which ought to have been paid during
that period to any such worker, if the provisions of this
Part of this Act had been complied with, and the amount
actually so paid.
( 3A ) Evidence of any failure to pay any such remuneration or
arrears may be given under subsection ( 3) of this section only if-
(a ) the employer or any other person charged as aforesaid
has been convicted of the offence consisting of the failure ;
and
( b ) notice of intention to adduce such evidence has been served
with the summons or warrant.
( 4 ) The powers given by this section for the recovery of sums
due from an employer to a worker shall not be in derogation of
any right to recover such sums by civil proceedings
( 5 ) In the application of this section to Scotland-
( a ) in subsection (3), the words " or any other person charged
as a person to whose act or default the offence was due "
shall be omitted ; and

EXTENSION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
PART I
RECOGNISED TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND GENERAL LEVEL OF
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. A claim may be reported to the Service , in accordance with and
subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule,
that as respects any worker an employer is, in respect of any matter,
observing terms and conditions of employment less favourable than
the recognised terms and conditions or, where, or so far as, there
are no recognised terms and conditions, the general level of terms
and conditions.
2. In this Part of this Schedule-
( a ) the " recognised terms and conditions " means terms and
conditions of workers in comparable employment in the
trade or industry, or section of a trade or industry, in which
the employer in question is engaged, either generally or in
the district in which he is so engaged, which have
been settled by an agreement or award, to which the parties
are employers' associations and independent trade unions
which represent ( generally or in the district in question, as
the case may be) a substantial proportion of the employers
and of the workers in the trade, industry or section, being
workers of the description to which the agreement or award
relates ; and
"
( b ) the general level of terms and conditions " means the
general level of terms and conditions observed for com-
parable workers by employers-
(i) in the trade, industry or section in which the
employer in question is engaged in the district in which
he is so engaged ; and
(ii) whose circumstances are similar to those of the
employer in question,
and for the purposes of sub-paragraph ( a ) above the reference to
terms and conditions, in a case where minimum terms and con-
ditions have been settled as mentioned in that sub- paragraph, is a
reference to those minimum terms and conditions.
3. No claim shall be reported under paragraph 1 above as respects
workers whose remuneration or terms and conditions, or minimum
remuneration or terms and conditions, is or are fixed (otherwise than
by the employer, with or without the approval of any other person)
inpursuance of any enactment other than-
( a ) the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 or the Agricultural Wages
( Scotland ) Act 1949 ;
( b ) the Wages Councils Act 1959 ;
( c ) sections 90 to 94 above ; or
( d ) this Schedule ;
c .71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2259
or in the case of whom provision is made by or under any such
enactment for the settlement of questions as to remuneration or
terms and conditions or minimum remuneration or terms and
conditions.
4. A claim may be reported under paragraph 1 above, where, or
so far as, the claim is founded upon recognised terms and conditions,
by an employers' association or an independent trade union being
one of the parties mentioned in paragraph 2(a) above.
5.- (1 ) A claim may be reported under paragraph 1 above, where,
or so far as, the claim is founded upon the general level of terms
and conditions , by-
( a ) an employers' association having members engaged in the
trade, industry or section, in the district to which the claim
relates ; or
( b) subject to sub-paragraph ( 2) below, a trade union of which
any worker concerned is a member.
( 2) Where any such worker is of a description in respect of which
an employer recognises one or more independent trade unions, such
a claim may be reported by a trade union only if it is that recognised
union or, as the case may be, one of those recognised unions.
6. Aclaim under paragraph 1 above shall be in writing and shall
contain such particulars as the Service may require.
7. When a claim is reported to the Service under paragraph 1
above the Service shall take any steps which seem to it expedient
to settle the claim or to secure the use of appropriate machinery to
settle the claim and shall if the claim is not otherwise settled refer
it to the Committee.
8. The Committee shall hear and determine the claim and it shall
be for-
(a ) the party making the claim to show that there are recognised
terms and conditions and what those terms and conditions
are, or, as the case may be, what the general level of terms
and conditions is ; and
( b ) the employer to satisfy the Committee that he is observing
terms and conditions of employment not less favourable
than the recognised terms and conditions or, as the case may
be, the general level of terms and conditions.
9. In ascertaining whether, in respect of any matter which is the
subject of a claim under paragraph 1 above, the employer is
observing terms and conditions less favourable than the recognised
terms and conditions, or as the case may be, the general level of
terms and conditions regard shall be had to the whole of the terms
and conditions observed by the employer as respects the worker to
whom the claim relates.
10. If the Committee finds the claim wholly or partly well-founded
it shall make an award that the employer shall observe the recog-
nised terms and conditions or, as the case may be, terms and
SCH. 11
c .71
2260 Employment Protection Act 1975
SCH. 11
1970 с. 41.
conditions conforming to the general level of terms and conditions
and shall identify or specify-
( a ) the recognised terms and conditions or, as the case may be,
terms and conditions conforming to the general level of
terms and conditions ;
( b) the description or descriptions of employees in respect of
which they are to be observed ; and
( c ) the date from which they are to be observed, being a date
not earlier than the date on which the employer was first
informed of the claim giving rise to the award by the union
or association which reported the claim to the Service.
11. Any terms and conditions which by an award under paragraph
10 above the employer is required to observe in respect of employees
of his shall have effect as part of the contract of employment of any
such employee as from the date specified in the award, except in
so far as they are superseded or varied-
( a ) by a subsequent award under that paragraph ;
( b ) by a collective agreement between the employer and the
trade union for the time being representing that employee ;
or
( c ) by express or implied agreement between the employee and
the employer so far as that agreement effects an improve-
ment in any terms and conditions having effect by virtue of
the award.
12. Where-
(a ) by virtue of any enactment, other than one contained in this
Part of this Schedule, providing for minimum remuneration
or terms and conditions a contract of employment is to
have effect as modified by an award, order or other instru-
ment under that enactment, and
( b ) by virtue of an award under paragraph 10 above any terms
and conditions are to have effect as part of that contract,
that contract shall have effect in accordance with that award, order
or other instrument or in accordance with the award under para-
graph 10 above, whichever is the more favourable, in respect of any
terms and conditions of that contract, to the employee.
13. If in the course of determining a claim under this Schedule
after the commencement of section 3 of the Equal Pay Act 1970,
it appears to the Committee that a collective agreement or pay
structure within the meaning of that section contains any provision
applying specifically to men only or to women only so that it
would, had it been referred to the Committee by the Secretary of
State under that section, have required amendment in accordance
with subsection (4) of that section so as to remove that discrimination
between men and women-
(a) that provision shall not be regarded as part of the recognised
terms and conditions or, as the case may be, shall not be
c .71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2261
taken into account in assessing the general level of terms
and conditions ; and
( b) the Committee shall report its opinion to the Secretary of
State and, in the case of a collective agreement, to the
parties to that agreement or, in the case of a pay structure,
to the employer concerned.
14. For the purposes of this Schedule the carrying on of the
activities of public or local authorities shall be treated as the carry-
ing on of a trade or industry.

PART II
COLLECTIVELY NEGOTIATED TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN CERTAIN
INDUSTRIES
15. A claim may be reported to the Service under this paragraph
by an independent trade union as respects any worker who is a
member of that trade union and who falls within the field of
operation of a wages council, a statutory joint industrial council,
the Agricultural Wages Board or the Scottish Agricultural Wages
Board-
( a ) that the union is a party to one or more collective agreements
and that those agreements cover a significant number of
establishments within the field of operation of that council
or Board either generally or in the district in which the
worker is employed ; and
( b ) that in those establishments the circumstances of the
employer are similar to those of the employer of the worker
in question ; and
( c ) that the employer is paying him less than the lowest current
rate of remuneration (disregarding any rate agreed to more
than 12 months before the date on which the claim was
reported) payable to workers of his description under any
of those agreements .
16. The provisions of paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 to 14 above shall
apply to a claim under paragraph 15 above
(a ) as if for any reference to the recognised terms and conditions
there were substituted a reference to the rate of remuneration
referred to in paragraph 15( c) above ;
( b ) as if references to the general level of terms and conditions
were omitted ; and
( c ) as if the reference in paragraph 12 (a) to Part I of this Schedule
were a reference to Part II of this Schedule and so much of
Part I as is thereby applied.

Section 110. SCHEDULE 12
DEATH OF EMPLOYEE OR EMPLOYER
PART I
GENERAL
Introductory
1. In this Schedule " the relevant provisions " means the pro-
visions of this Act (including this Schedule ) conferring rights on
employees, or connected therewith, and so much of the 1974 Act
as relates to unfair dismissal.
Institution or continuance of tribunal proceedings
2. Where an employee or employer has died tribunal proceedings
arising under any of the relevant provisions may be instituted or
continued by a personal representative of the deceased employee
or, as the case may be, defended by a personal representative of the
deceased employer.
3.- (1) If there is no personal representative of a deceased
employee, tribunal proceedings arising under any of the relevant
provisions ( or proceedings to enforce a tribunal award made in any
such proceedings) may be instituted or continued on behalf of the
estate of the deceased employee by such other person as the industrial
tribunal may appoint being either-
( a ) a person authorised by the employee to act in connection
with the proceedings before the employee's death ; or
( b) the widower, widow, child, father, mother, brother or sister
of the deceased employee,
and references in this Schedule to a personal representative shall
be construed as including such a person.
( 2 ) In such a case any award made by the industrial tribunal
shall be in such terms and shall be enforceable in such manner as
may be provided by regulations made by the Secretary of State.
4.- (1 ) Subject to any specific provision of this Schedule to
the contrary, in relation to an employee or employer who has
died-
( a ) any reference in the relevant provisions to the doing of
anything by or in relation to an employee or employer
shall be construed as including a reference to the doing
of that thing by or in relation to any personal repre-
sentative of the deceased employee or employer ; and
( b) any reference in the said provisions to a thing required or
authorised to be done by or in relation to an employee
or employer shall be construed as including a reference
to any thing which, in accordance with any such pro-
vision as modified by this Schedule (including sub-paragraph
( a ) above ), is required or authorised to be done by or in
relation to any personal representative of the deceased
employee or employer.
c . 71
Employment Protection Act 1975 2263
( 2 ) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent references in the
relevant provisions to a successor of an employer from including
a personal representative of a deceased employer.
Rights and liabilities accruing after death
5. Any right arising under any of the relevant provisions as
modified by this Schedule shall, if it had not accrued before the
death of the employee in question, nevertheless devolve as if it
had so accrued.
6. Where by virtue of any of the relevant provisions as modified
by this Schedule a personal representative of a deceased employer
is liable to pay any amount and that liability had not accrued
before the death of the employer, it shall be treated for all purposes
as if it were a liability of the deceased employer which had accrued
immediately before the death.
Death during protected period
7. Where an industrial tribunal makes a protective award under
section 101 above and an employee of a description to which the
award relates dies during the protected period, the award shall be
treated in his case as if it specified a protected period of such length
as to end on the date of his death.
PART II
UNFAIR DISMISSAL
Introductory
8. In this Part of this Schedule " the unfair dismissal provisions "
means so much of this Act (including this Schedule) and the 1974
Act as relates to unfair dismissal .
Death during notice period
9. Where an employer has given notice to an employee to terminate
his contract of employment and before that termination the employee
or the employer dies, the unfair dismissal provisions shall apply as if
the contract had been duly terminated by the employer by notice
expiring on the date of the death.
10. Where the employee's contract of employment has been
terminated by the employer and by virtue of paragraph 5(6) of
Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act a date later than the effective date of
termination as defined by sub-paragraph ( 5 ) of that paragraph is to
be treated as the effective date of termination for the purposes
of certain of the unfair dismissal provisions, and before that later
date the employee or the employer dies, the said sub- paragraph ( 6 )
shall have effect as if the notice referred to in that sub-paragraph as
required to be given by the employer would have expired on the
death.
Remedies for unfair dismissal
11. Where an employee has died, then, unless an order for
reinstatement or re-engagement has already been made, the unfair
SCH. 12
c.71
2264 Employment Protection Act 1975
SCH. 12
dismissal provisions relating to reinstatement and re- engagement shall
not apply ; and accordingly if the industrial tribunal finds that the
grounds of the complaint are well-founded the case shall be treated
as falling within section 72( 5) above as a case in which no order is
made under section 71 above.
12. If an order for reinstatement or re-engagement has been made
and the employee dies before the order is complied with-
( a ) if the employer has before the death refused to reinstate
or re-engage the employee in accordance with the order,
section 72(2) and ( 3) above shall apply and an award shall
be made under section 72( 2)(b) above unless the employer
satisfies the tribunal that it was not practicable at the time
of the refusal to comply with the order ;
( b ) if there has been no such refusal, section 72(1) above shall
apply if the employer fails to comply with any ancillary
terms of the order which remain capable of fulfilment after
the employee's death as it would apply to such a failure to
comply fully with the terms of an order where the employee
had been reinstated or re-engaged.

graphs (2) to (4 ) of clause 8A of this licence, the deduc-
tions which the Licensee was entitled to make in pursu-
ance of paragraph 3( 2) of Schedule 2 to this licence fall
short of the deductions which the Licensee would have
been so entitled to make if royalty were only payable
in pursuance of paragraph (1) of that clause and paга-
graph (2) of it were omitted ; and payments by the
Minister in pursuance of this paragraph shall be made as
soon as the amounts of the relevant deductions have been
determined.

pursuance of clause 8A of this licence in respect of
that period ; and where the amount specified in the
notice is larger or smaller than the total amount already
paid by the Licensee in pursuance of this clause in
respect of that period, then, subject to paragraph (8) of

with by the Minister to the Licensee.
( 7 ) If after the date when the Minister gave notice to
the Licensee in pursuance of paragraph ( 6 ) of this clause
or this paragraph in respect of a chargeable period it
appears to the Minister, in consequence of a relevant
assessment or determination made after that date which
relates directly or indirectly to the value of petroleum
by reference to which the amount specified in the notice
was determined, that another amount ought to have
been so specified, he may give notice in writing to the
Licensee specifying the other amount ; and where he
does so, then, subject to paragraph (8) of this clause-
( a ) if the other amount is larger than the amount
specified in the previous notice the difference

the said paragraph (6) or (7 ) is payable by virtue of
clause 8A of this licence may be referred to arbitration
in the manner provided by clause 34 of this licence ;
and on a reference to arbitration in pursuance of this
paragraph any relevant assessment or determination

Minister and the Licensee so far as the assessment or
determination relates directly or indirectly to the value of
petroleum relating to the chargeable period in question.
(9) When any payment falls to be made by the Licensee
or the Minister in pursuance of paragraph (5), (6) or (7)
of this clause, an amount in respect of interest on the
payment shall also be payable by him hi to the recipient
of the payment and that amount shall be calculated in
such manner as the Minister may specify from time to
time in a notice in writing given by him to the Licensee ;
but-
(a ) a notice in pursuance of this paragraph shall
provide for amounts by way of interest to be
calculated by applying a rate of interest which
is for the time being a commercial rate of
interest ; and
( b ) any such amount in respect of interest shall be
disregarded in calculating for the purposes of
the said paragraph (5) or (6 ) any amount already
paid by the Licensee in pursuance of this clause .

or both of the following grounds, namely-

(ii ) where the notice contains such a state-
ment as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (b)
above, modifications of the programme which
ensure the getting of petroleum from the area
there mentioned at the rates specified in the

paragraph (i) of this sub- paragraph to submit
modifications if the carrying out of the programme
without modifications would not be contrary to good
oilfield practice.

fications of a programme in respect of which
notice of rejection containing such a statement
as is mentioned in the said paragraph (i) was
Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 c . 74 2499

in this clause referred to as a " limitation notice ") autho-
rising the Minister, by a further notice given to the
Licensee from time to time after the expiration of the
period specified in that behalf in the limitation notice,

quantity of petroleum or a different period specified in
the further notice.

notice as that to be substituted for a quantity or period
which is specified in the programme in question shall be
within the limits specified in the limitation notice as
those applicable to that quantity or period specified in

secure that the expenditure to be incurred by the Licensee
in complying with the further notice, in a case where an
effect of the notice is to increase the quantity of petroleum
which the Licensee is required to get from the licensed
area in any period, is less than the cost of drilling a new
well in the licensed area at the time when the further
notice is given.
( 4) Where the Minister proposes to give a limitation
notice or any such further notice as aforesaid he shall
before doing so-
(a ) give the Licensee particulars of the proposal and

that the notice is required by reason of a national emer-
gency and shall not give any other such further notice
SCH. 2

Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975
SCH. 2 as aforesaid unless he is satisfied that the notice is
required in the national interest.

aforesaid may-
(a ) specify any quantity or period by reference to
such factors as the Minister thinks fit ; and
( b ) in the case of such a further notice, contain
provisions as to-
( i) the date when the notice is to come into
force ,

be in force,
and specify different dates in pursuance of this
sub-paragraph for different provisions of the
notice ;

a particular time by serving on the Licensee a notice
in writing stating that the further notice is revoked at that
time.

licence or this clause as to what is, is not or is required
in the national interest or as to what is, or is required
by reason of, a national emergency shall be determined
by the Minister.
( 7 ) The Licensee shall ensure that any conditions to
which an approval is subject in pursuance of clause
12A(4)(b) of this licence or a consent is subject in
pursuance of paragraph (1 ) of this clause are complied
with.
( 8) If in respect of part of the licensed area-
(a ) a consent has been given in pursuance of
paragraph ( 1 ) of clause 12A of this licence ; or
(b) the Licensee has submitted to the Minister, in
accordance with a direction given by virtue of
paragraph (3)(a) of that clause, a programme in

served notice in pursuance of paragraph (4) (a)
or (b) or paragraph (6 ) of that clause, or
(ii ) in consequence of which the Minister
has served a programme on the Licensee in
pursuance of the said paragraph (6), or

above, modifications of the programme which
ensure the getting of petroleum from the
area there mentioned at the rates specified in

gramme in pursuance of paragraph ( 4 ) (a) or (b)
or paragraph (6 ) of clause 12A of this licence

paragraph (6) ; or
(b ) it is determined by arbitration that the Licensee
is not required by virtue of paragraph (i) of
clause 12A(5)(c ) of this licence to submit modi-
fications of a programme in respect of which
notice of rejection containing such a statement
SCH. 3
2552 c. 74

notice is given.
( 4) Where the Minister proposes to give a limitation
notice or any such further notice as aforesaid he shall
before doing so-

as aforesaid unless he is satisfied that the notice is
required in the national interest.

section (5) above shall not be required to cover any future benefit
under a policy in so far as any sums have been paid to the

sums which would have fallen due from policyholders of a com-
pany in liquidation by way of premiums under long term policies
if the company had not gone into liquidation .
12. (1) If it appears to the Board, in the case of any long Dispropor-
term policy of a company in liquidation which was a United tionate

in question are excessive ; and

( a) that payment in respect of any sums falling due under
the policy could have been made in accordance with
the policy to a person other than the policyholder ; or
(b) that any sums paid under the policy would have been
subject to any trust, charge or other agreement binding
on the policyholder ;
Policyholders Protection Act 1975 2605
c. 75
the Board may secure the payment of any sum payable to the
policyholder in accordance with any of the provisions of sections
6 to 10 or in accordance with section 11 (7) above or pay any sum

to the person appearing to the Board to be entitled under the
trust, charge or agreement in question, instead of to the
policyholder.
Any payment made by virtue of this subsection to a person
other than the policyholder shall be treated for the purposes of

the Board think fit.

to a policyholder in accordance with any of the provisions of

appears to the Board that the funds available to them for
expenditure under that provision, together with any funds they
may raise by means of a levy under section 19 or 21 below
which might be applied on such expenditure, fall short of what
they may require ; and accordingly the Board may-
( a ) postpone making any payment, or any part of any
payment, they propose to make under any such pro-
vision ; and
( b) postpone taking any measures under any such provision
involving expenditure on their part ;
from time to time, until it appears to them that their funds are

to the liability of the company in liquidation by reference to
which that sum is so payable.
( 6) In connection with imposing any conditions under any of
the preceding provisions of this section with respect to the
assignment to them of any rights the Board may make any

virtue of the rights in question .
( 7) The Secretary of State may by regulations made by
statutory instrument provide for the transfer to and the vesting
in the Board by virtue of the regulations, in such circumstances
as may be specified therein—
(a) of any such rights of a policyholder to whom the Board
have given assistance by any of the measures provided
for by sections 6 to 11 above as are mentioned in

suant to any provision contained in or made under any

and tear of any of the machinery or plant which belongs to him Part I and is in use for the purposes of the trade at the end of that Chapter n chargeable period or its basis period.

(2) The following provisions of this Chapter shall apply for the purposes of corporation tax notwithstanding that any provision in section 20, 21 or 26 of this Act, or in Schedule 4 to this Act, is expressed to apply in relation to a year of assessment, and for those purposes the amount of any writing-down allowance shall be determined by applying the law in force for the year of assessment in which die accounting period ends, and references in the said provisions to “ the year of assessment in question ” shall be construed accordingly.

(3) Where under the provisions of this Chapter a writing-down allowance falls to be determined by reference to a fraction or percentage, specified numerically, of any expenditure or other sum, or by reference to a percentage determined or deemed to be determined for a year of assessment, then for a chargeable period of less than a year the fraction or percentage shall be proportionately reduced; and similarly with the amounts by reference to which writing-down allowances for certain vehicles are limited by section 32(1) of, and paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to, this Act

(4) In sections 20 to 24 below, and Schedule 4 to this Act, the expression “new machinery or plant” means machinery or plant being unused and not second-hand, and for the purposes of this Chapter machinery or plant which has at any time fallen within the description “ new machinery or plant capital expenditure on the provision of which was incurred after 5th November 1962 ” shall continue to be treated as within that description notwithstanding any sale of it or other change of circumstances.

20.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the writing- Normal down allowance in respect of any machinery or plant for any method of chargeable period shall be a percentage of the amount by which calculation, the capital expenditure of the person to whom the allowance is to be made in providing the machinery or plant exceeds the total amount of any initial allowance, writing-down allowances, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to him in respect of that machinery or plant for previous chargeable periods.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this section, the said percentage is such percentage as may be determined by the Board to be appropriate to be applied for the purposes of this section in relation to machinery or plant of the class in question for the year of assessment in question, and in determining the said percentage in relation to machinery or plant of any class, the Board shall have regard to the anticipated normal working life of machinery or plant of that class.

Ch. 3

Capital Allowances Act 1968

Part I (3) So for as the class in question consists of new machinery Chapter n or plant capital expenditure on the provision of which was incurred after 5th November 1962, the said percentage shall be— (a) where the said life is 18 years or more, 15 per cent,

(b) where that life is less than 18 but not less than 14 years,

20 per cent,

(c) where that life is less than 14 years, 25 per cent

(4) So far as the class in question consists of other machinery or plant, the said percentage shall be five-fourths of the percentage (in this Chapter referred to as the “basic percentage*) determined in accordance with this subsection.

The Board shall select, as the basic percentage, the percentage which in their opinion may fairly be taken as that which, if applied year by year throughout the said life as a writing-down percentage applicable in title first year to the cost of such machinery or plant, in the second year to that cost as written down in the first year, in the third year to that cost as written down in the first and second years, and so on, would, at the end of that life, have caused that cost to be written down to one-tenth thereof.

(5) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board that a per-1952 c. 10. centage which, under section 281(4) of the Income Tax Act 1952

(percentages in use in 1948-49) was deemed to be a percentage determined by them in relation to machinery or plant of any class under the said section 281(2) for the year 1949-50 (whether or not also applying to later years), if applied as a basic percentage in the manner specified in subsection (4) above, would, at the end of the anticipated normal working life of the machinery or plant of that class (estimated as if during the year 1948-49), cause the cost to be written down to a fraction thereof which is smaller than one-tenth, subsection (4) above shall have effect in relation to machinery or plant of that class as if a reference to that smaller fraction were substituted therein for a reference to one-tenth.

(6) It shall not be necessary for the Board to redetermine a percentage under this or the next following section yearly, and any such determination for any year of assessment shall apply also to subsequent years except so far as it is superseded by any subsequent determination.

Schedule 4 to this Act shall have effect as respects the application to years of assessment to which this Act applies of determinations applying to the year 1967-68.

(7) In this section “the anticipated normal working life* means, in relation to machinery or plant of any class, the period which might be expected, when machinery or plant of that class is first put into use, to be going to elapse before it is finally put out of use as being unfit for further use, it being

assumed that it is going to be used in the normal manner and to part I. the normal extent and is going to be so used throughout that chapibr n period.

21.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the writing- Alternative down allowance in respect of any machinery or plant for any method, chargeable period—

(a) may, if the person to whom the allowance is to be made so elects when he makes his claim for the allowance, be computed by reference to the amount of his capital expenditure in providing the machinery or plant, and

(b) shall in that event be the percentage of that amount specified in subsection (2) below.

(2) The said percentage is such percentage as may be determined by the Board in relation to machinery or plant of the class in question for the year of assessment in question by reference to the anticipated normal working life of machinery or plant of that class.

(3) So far as the class in question consists of new machinery or plant capital expenditure on the provision of which was incurred after 5th November 1962, the said percentage shall beta) where the said life is 18 years or more, 6J per cent.,

(b) where that life is less than 18 but not less than 14 years,

8} per cent.,

(c) where that life is less than 14 years, 11J per cent.

(4) So far as the class in question consists of other machinery or plant, the said percentage shall be five-fourths of the percentage (in this Chapter referred to as “ the basic percentage ”) determined in accordance with this subsection.

The basic percentage is such percentage as may be determined by the Boaid as being in their opinion equal to nine-tenths of the fraction of which the numerator is one and the denominator is the number of years in the said life.

(5) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board that a percentage which, under section 282(3) of the Income Tax 1952 c. 10. Act 1952 (percentages in use in 1948-49), was deemed to be a percentage determined by them in relation to machinery or

plant of any class under the said section 282(2) for the year 1949-50 (whether or not also applying to later years) bears to the fraction (with numerator one) specified in subsection (4) above (computed by reference to an anticipated normal working life estimated as if during the year 1948-49) a higher proportion than nine-tenths, subsection (4) above shall have effect in relation to machinery or plant of that class as if for the reference therein to nine-tenths there were substituted a reference to the said higher proportion.

(6) Machinery or plant may be treated for the purposes of this section as being of a different class from other machinery or plant where the one is new when it is acquired and the other is not new when it is acquired, or, in the case of machinery or plant which is not new when it is acquired, where different periods have elapsed between the date when the machinery or plant was made or first put into use and the date of the acquisition thereof.

(7) An election under this section shall not be effective for any chargeable period in relation to any machinery or plant unless the Board are satisfied that the person making the election is keeping, and will keep and make available for inspection, all such records as are necessary to secure that the Board, inspectors and other officers concerned can ensure that the total writing-down allowances made to him for all chargeable periods in respect of that machinery or plant do not exceed the limit imposed by section 27(1) of this Act, due regard being had to any initial allowance, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to him in respect thereof.

(8) In this section “the anticipated normal working life” has the meaning assigned to it by subsection (7) of the last preceding section, except that, in relation to a class consisting of machinery or plant which is not new when it is acquired, die reference in the said subsection (7) to the first putting into use of the machinery or plant shall be construed as a reference to the first putting into use thereof after the acquisition thereof.

22.—(1) Where an election under section 21 above has effect with respect to any machinery or plant, and the writing-down allowance in respect of the same machinery or plant made to the same person for any previous chargeable period has been calculated in accordance with section 20 of this Act, the writing-down allowance for that machinery or plant for the chargeable period with respect to which the election has effect shall be computed in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say—

(a) instead of being computed by reference to the amount of the person’s expenditure in providing the machinery or plant, it shall be computed by reference to the amount by which that amount exceeds any initial allowance, writing-down allowances, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to that person in respect of that machinery or plant for the chargeable periods up to and including the said previous chargeable period or, if the writing-down allowance was calculated in accordance with the said section 20 in the case of more

than one previous chargeable period, up to and includ- Part I ing the last of those previous chargeable periods, and Chapter II

(b) it shall be computed as if for the percentage which would otherwise apply there were substituted such other percentage as the Board may determine.

In the case of expenditure to which section 21(4) above applies, the references in paragraph (b) above to a percentage are references to the basic percentage.

(2) The references in subsection (1) above to allowances calculated in accordance with section 20 of this Act shall be deemed to include references to allowances for the year 1948-49 or any previous year of assessment calculated by the application of, or of five-fourths of, a percentage intended for application, or for application when multiplied by five-fourths, to a sum which, except in the case of the first year, is less than the cost of the machinery or plant.

(3) Any reference in this section to section 20 of this Act shall be deemed to include a reference to that section as modified by the following sections of this Chapter.

23.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the writing- Special method down allowance for any chargeable period in respect of any lor use in machinery or plant used for the purposes of a trade which connection consists of or includes the working of a mine, oil well or other wdls^tc. source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature, being machinery or plant used in connection with the working of the source, shall, if the person to whom the allowance is to be made so elects when he makes his claim for the allowance—

(a) be computed by reference to the amount specified in

section 20(1) or section 21(1) of this Act, but

(b) be the percentage of that amount specified in sub-

section (2) of this section.

(2) The said percentage is such percentage as the Board may determine having regard to the date when the source is likely to cease to be worked and the probable value of the machinery or plant at that date to the person carrying on the trade.

(3) The references to section 20 of this Act contained in subsections (1) and (3) of the last preceding section shall be deemed to include references to this section where the election thereunder is that the allowance shall be computed by reference to the amount specified in section 20(1) of this Act

(4) The references to section 21 of this Act contained in subsection (1) of the last preceding section shall be deemed to include references to this section where the election thereunder is that the allowance shall be computed by reference to the amount specified in section 21(1) of this Act.

(b) the event is the permanent discontinuance of the trade

and at the time of the discontinuance the machinery or plant is either sold at less than the open-market price, the sale not being one to which section 78 of this Act applies, or the machinery or plant is given away, or

(c) the event is the sale of the machinery or plant at less than

the open-market price, not being a sale to which the said section 78 applies, or is the gift of the machinery or plant, or

(d) the event is that, after the setting up and before the permanent discontinuance of the trade, the machinery or plant permanently ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade carried on by the person by whom the first-mentioned trade is being carried on, and so ceases either by reason of that person’s transferring the machinery or plant to other use or, on a transfer of the trade which is not treated as involving the discontinuance thereof, by reason of the retention of the machinery or plant by die transferor.

“ B ” is the total output from the source up to the time of the sale:

Provided that if the person to whom a balancing allowance is to be made in respect of any expenditure considers that the amount by which the allowance is to be reduced under this subsection is excessive having regard to the dates on which the expenditure was actually incurred, he may apply to the inspector for relief, and the inspector may authorise such smaller reduction as may be appropriate.

On an appeal to the General Commissioners or Special Commissioners, the Commissioners shall have jurisdiction to review any relevant decision taken by the inspector under this subsection.

Part I (3) A writing-down allowance under this section in respect of Chapter in any expenditure shall not be made to a person for a chargeable period unless the amount of the expenditure exceeds the aggregate of any allowances under this section made to him for previous chargeable periods in respect of the expenditure together with any capital sums accruing to him in or before the said chargeable period or its basis period by virtue of his acquisition of the mineral asset in question, and where made shah not be greater than the amount of the excess; and for this purpose there shall be deemed to have been made for years preceding the year 1963-64 such annual allowances as would 1963 c. 25. have fallen to be made if section 37 of the Finance Act 1963 (which is re-enacted in this section) had always had effect

(4) Where in any chargeable period or its basis period a person ceases to work the source to which capital expenditure incurred by him relates and, apart from this and the last preceding subsection, a writing-down allowance under this section would fall to be made to him for that chargeable period in respect of the expenditure, the allowance shall not be made, and—

(a) if the aggregate of any allowances under this section

made to him for previous chargeable periods in respect of the expenditure exceeds so much of the expenditure as represents the cost of acquiring the output got by him from the source (other than output got before 4th April 1963), a balancing charge on an amount equal to the excess shall be made on him for that chargeable period, or

(b) if that aggregate is less than so much of the expendi-

ture as represents the cost of acquiring that output, a balancing allowance equal to the difference shall be made to him for that chargeable period.

(5) So much of the capital expenditure incurred by a person on the acquisition of a mineral asset as remains after deducting—

(a) the market value of the asset at the time the source to

which the expenditure relates ceases to be worked by him, and

(b) any capital sums accruing to him before that time by virtue of his acquisition of the asset,

shall be taken for the purposes of subsection (4) above to represent the cost of acquiring the output got by him from the source; and where part of the output was got by him before 4th April 1963, the cost of acquiring the part got on or after that date shall be taken for those purposes to be an amount which bears to the amount so remaining the same proportion

Capital Allowances Act 1968

Ch. 3

63

as the royalty value of the output from the source on or after Part 1 that date bears to the royalty value of the whole output got Chapter m by virtue of the expenditure.

In this subsection “market value*', in relation to an asset, means the price which it might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market (whether for use by the purchaser for mining purposes or other purposes) if, before the sale, the owner of the asset had carried out such works (if any) for restoring or otherwise making good the land surface at the site of the source as, having regard to the obligations imposed on him and other relevant circumstances, he might reasonably be expected to carry out whether or not he sold the asset, but reduced by so much of that price as is attributable to matters not representing any part of the capital expenditure in question.

(6) Where a balancing adjustment is made in respect of a person under subsection (4) of this section, or would fall to be so made if the relevant amounts were not equal, and after ceasing to work the source he carries out any works for restoring or otherwise making good the land surface at the site of the source, the cost of those works shall not be taken into account in computing for the purposes of tax under Case I of Schedule D the profits or gains of his trade unless it was assumed, in computing the market value of the asset for the purposes of the said subsection (4), that those works would be carried out

(7) Where any allowance under this section falls to be made to a person for the chargeable period related to his ceasing to work the source to which the expenditure relates, or for a previous chargeable period, and in a later chargeable period or its basis period he again begins to work the source, then—

(a) in computing, in accordance with subsection (2) of this

section, the amount of a writing-down allowance for the later chargeable period or any subsequent chargeable period, the period between the cessation and recommencement of working shall be disregarded, and

(b) in computing, for the purposes of subsection (3) or (4)

of this section, the aggregate of allowances for previous chargeable periods, those allowances shall be treated as reduced by the amount on which any balancing charge under paragraph (a) of the said subsection (4) has been made in respect of the expenditure.

(8) Where a person (in this subsection referred to as “tho transferee") acquires a mineral asset from another person (in this subsection referred to as “ the transferor"), and the transferee is a body of persons over whom the transferor has control, or the transferor is a body of persons over whom the transferee has control, or both the transferee and the transferor are bodies

64

Ch. 3

Capital Allowances Act 1968

Part I of persons and some other person has control over both of them. Chapter in the capital expenditure incurred by the transferee on the acquisition of the asset shall be taken for the purposes of this section (including this subsection) not to exceed the capital expenditure incurred by the transferor on its acquisition by him or, where the asset consists of an interest or right grantkl by the transferor, so much of the capital expenditure so incurred by the transferor as, on a just apportionment, is referable to that interest or right; and the expenditure incurred by the transferee shall where necessary be treated as reduced accordingly.

(9) Where in any chargeable period or its basis period a person, having previously incurred capital expenditure on the acquisition of a mineral asset the acquisition of which entitled him to work a source, incurs for the purposes of the trade capital expenditure on the acquisition of another mineral asset the acquisition of which entities him to work the same source, this section shall apply as respects that chargeable period and subsequent chargeable periods as if the assets were one mineral asset capital expenditure on the acquisition of which was incurred by him when he incurred the first-mentioned expenditure and was of an amount equal to the aggregate of that expenditure and the further expenditure:

Provided that where the first-mentioned expenditure was incurred before 4th April 1963 and the further expenditure on or after that date—

(a) no greater allowances shall for the purpose of subsection

(3) of this section be deemed by reason of this subsection to have been made before that date, and

(b) the cost of acquiring output got before that date, as computed under subsection (5) of this section, shall not by reason of this subsection be treated as increased.

If the asset to which the further expenditure relates extends to mineral deposits or land not included in the asset to which the first-mentioned expenditure relates, so much of it as so extends shall be treated for the purposes of this section as a separate mineral asset, and the further expenditure shall be apportioned between the assets as may be just. 10

(10) References in this section to expenditure on the acquisition of an asset do not include—

(a) qualifying expenditure as defined in section 51(1) of this

Act, or

(b) expenditure on machinery or plant, or on any asset

which has been treated for any chargeable period as machinery or plant, or

(c) expenditure on any building or structure, Part I

and where expenditure was incurred on the acquisition of an m

asset in respect of which, for chargeable periods previous to a chargeable period for which he first becomes entitled in respect of the expenditure to an allowance under this section, the person incurring the expenditure has been allowed any deductions under Schedule 9 to the Finance Act 1963, the expenditure shall 1963 c. 25. be treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by so much of those deductions as, if he had been entitled to an allowance under this section for earlier chargeable periods, would have been excluded by paragraph 5 of that Schedule.

(11) In this section—

“basis period* means, for any year of assessment, the period on the profits or gains of which income tax for that year falls to be finally computed under Case I of Schedule D in respect of the trade in question or, where, by virtue of any provision of section 127 of the Income Tax Act 1952, the profits or gains of any other 1952 c. 10. period are to be taken to be the profits or gains of the said period, that other period;

“ mineral asset * means any mineral deposits or land comprising mineral deposits, or any interest in or right over such deposits or land;

“ output *, in relation to a source, means mineral deposits lifted or extracted from the source;

“ royalty value *, in relation to any output from a source, means the amount of the royalties that would be payable on that output if the person working the source were a lessee under a lease, for a term expiring immediately after that output was produced, granted to him at the date when the expenditure in question was incurred and providing for the payment of such royalties on output from the source as might reasonably have been expected to be provided for by such a lease, but reduced by the amount of any royalties actually payable in respect of that output

(12) This subsection shall have effect for determining for the purposes of this section the amount of any capital sum accruing to a person by virtue of his acquisition of a mineral asset.

Where the property in question is sold at a price other than that which it would have fetched if sold in the open market, the like consequences shall ensue for the said purposes as would have ensued if the property had been sold for the price which it would have fetched if sold in the open market.

61.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a person, for the purposes of a trade carried on by him which consists of or includes the working of a mine, oil well or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature outside the United Kingdom, incurs expenditure by contributing a capital sum to the cost of—

(a) buildings to be occupied by persons employed at or in

connection with the working of that source, or

(b) works for the supply of water, gas or electricity wholly

or mainly to buildings occupied or to be occupied by persons so employed, or

(c) works to be used in providing other services or facilities

wholly or mainly for the welfare of persons so employed or their dependants,

and the buildings or works are likely to be of little or no value when the source is no longer worked, then writing-down allow* ances shall be made to him in respect of that expenditure during a writing-down period of ten years beginning with the chargeable period related to the incurring of the expenditure.

(2) This section shall not apply—

(a) to expenditure resulting in the acquisition of an asset by

the person incurring the expenditure, or

(b) to expenditure in respect of which an allowance may be

made under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts or the Corporation Tax Acts (or might be so made if this section, and section 22 of the Finance Act 1952, which is re-enacted in this section, had not been passed).

(3) If a person who has incurred expenditure to which this section applies in connection with any source of mineral deposits sells his interest in that source to a person who buys it for the purpose of a trade carried on or to be carried on by him, being a trade which consists of or includes the working of that source, then—

(a) no allowance in respect of that expenditure shall be made to the first-mentioned person for any chargeable period after the chargeable period related to the sale, and the allowance (if any) to be made to him for the chargeable period related to the sale shall be the fraction of the full allowance which the part of the chargeable period related to the sale falling before the sale is of the whole of the said chargeable period related to the sale, and

(2) If the trade is permanently discontinued in any chargeable period, then for that chargeable period there shall be made to the person last carrying on the trade, in addition to any other allowance made to him, an allowance equal to the amount of the expenditure less the allowances made in respect of it under the preceding subsection for that and previous chargeable periods.

The reference in this subsection to allowances made for previous chargeable periods (which, by virtue of Part III of this Act, may include allowances under section 17 of the Finance Act 1956, which is re-enacted in this section) shall be construed, except as regards initial allowances, as if the said section 17 had always had effect (instead of having effect only for chargeable periods after the year 1955-56).

(4) Any allowance under this section shall be made in taxing the trade.

(5) Where expenditure is incurred partly for the purposes of a qualifying trade and partly for other purposes, subsection

of this Act as it applies for income tax purposes “ basis period ” has the meaning assigned to it by the following provisions of this section.

(2) In the case of a person to or on whom an allowance or charge falls to be made in taxing his trade, his basis period for any year of assessment is the period on the profits or gains of which income tax for that year falls to be finally computed under Case I of Schedule D in respect of the trade in question or, where, by virtue of any provision of section 127 of the Income Tax Act 1952, the profits or gains of any other period are to be taken to be the profits or gains of the said period, that other period:

Provided that, in the case of any trade—

(a) where two basis periods overlap, the period common

to both shall be deemed for the purpose of this subsection to fall in the first basis period only,

(b) where there is an interval between the end of the basis

period for one year of assessment and the basis period for the next year of assessment, then, unless the second-mentioned year of assessment is the year of the permanent discontinuance of the trade, the interval shall be deemed to be part of the second basis period, and

(c) where there is an interval between the end of the basis

period for the year of assessment preceding that in which the trade is permanently discontinued and the basis period for the year in which it is permanently discontinued, the interval shall be deemed to form part of the first basis period.

(3) Where an allowance falls to be made under Chapter II of this Part of this Act to a person carrying on a profession or vocation, subsection (2) of this section shall apply as if the references to a trade included references to a profession or vocation and as if the reference to Case I of Schedule D included a reference to Case II of Schedule D.

(4) In the case of any other person to or on whom an allowance or charge falls to be made under this Part of this Act, his basis period for any year of assessment is the year of assessment itself.

(5) Any reference in this section to the overlapping of two periods shall be construed as including a reference to the

(2) Where such an allowance which is to be made for any accounting period cannot be given full effect under subsection

(1) above in that period by reason of a want or deficiency of income of the relevant class, then (so long as the company remains within the charge to tax) the amount unallowed shall be carried forward to the succeeding accounting period, except in so far as effect is given to it under subsection (3) below; and the amount so carried forward shall be treated for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, and of any further application of this subsection, as the amount of a corresponding allowance for that period.

(3) Where such an allowance which is to be made for any accounting period (otherwise than by being carried forward from an earlier accounting period) cannot be given full effect under subsection (1) above in that period by reason of a want or deficiency of income of the relevant class, the company may claim that effect shall be given to the allowance against the profits (of whatever description) of that accounting period and, if the company was then within the charge to tax, of preceding

(ii) where no such adjustment is made, such amount as appears reasonable compensation for any estimated decrease in net receipts from the carrying on of the undertaking which is directly attributable to the proceeding giving rise to compensation;

Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Amendment Act 1968

1968 CHAPTER 33

An Act to make further provision as regards the imposition of duties of customs where goods have been dumped or subsidised, and as regards duties so imposed.

[3rd July 1968]

Most Gracious Sovereign,

We, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled, with a view to affording better protection against dumping and subsidies affecting imported goods have freely and voluntarily resolved that such further provision as hereinafter appears shall be made for the imposition of certain duties; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Power to

impose

retrospective

duties after

provisional

charge.

1957 c. 18.

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an order imposing a duty of customs under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957 on goods of any description may impose the duty for a period before the making of the order if during that period a provisional charge to the duty (or a greater duty) was imposed on goods of that description by an order made under that Act and remaining in force.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an order imposing on goods of any description a provisional charge to duty (in this Act referred to as a “ preliminary order ”) may be made under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957 if at any time it appears to the Board of Trade, on the facts so far before them, that the conditions of section l(l)(a) or (b) of that

787

Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Ch. 33

Amendment Act 1968

Act as to the dumping or subsidisation of imports into the United Kingdom are fulfilled and that in the circumstances it is expedient to impose such a charge.

(3) A preliminary order, if not previously revoked, shall cease to have effect at the expiration of three months beginning with the date it comes into force, except in so far as it is extended by a further order made within that period, and in so far as it is so extended, shall cease to have effect at the expiration of six months beginning with that date.

(4) No duty shall be leviable by virtue only of a provisional charge imposed by a preliminary order; but the Schedule to this Act shall have effect as to the operation of a preliminary order and as to the giving of security for duty which may become payable by reference to a preliminary order, and generally as to matters arising out of the imposition of a provisional or retrospective charge to duty by virtue of this section.

(5) A preliminary order (including an order extending a previous order) shall not be taken to be an order imposing or increasing a duty of customs for the purposes of section 13(3) and (4) of the Import Duties Act 1958 as they apply by virtue of 1958 c. 6. section 11(1) of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) 1957 c. 18. Act 1957, and shall accordingly be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament.

(6) The report made yearly by the Board of Trade under section 11(2) of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies)

Act 1957 shall deal with orders under which a provisional charge to duty has operated during the year as orders under which duties have been chargeable during the year, and with any retrospective operation in relation to the preceding year of orders made during the year.

2.—(1) An order imposing a duty of customs, or a provisional Special charge to such a duty, shall not be made under the Customs Duties f88 f (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957 in respect of the dumping or q a T T. ° subsidisation of goods of any description as being goods which countries, originated in or were exported to the United Kingdom from a treaty country, unless the conditions mentioned in this section are fulfilled; but subsections (2) to (4) below shall not restrict the making of orders in other cases.

(2) An order imposing a duty of customs shall not be made unless the Board of Trade are satisfied that the effect of the dumping or of the giving of the subsidy either—

(a) is such as to cause or threaten material injury to an established industry in the United Kingdom, or such as to retard materially the establishment of an industry in the United Kingdom; or

788 Ch. 53 Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies)

Amendment Act 1968

(b) is such as to cause or threaten material injury to an established industry in another treaty country in which originate any like goods (that is, any identical or comparable goods) imported into the United Kingdom.

(3) An order imposing a provisional charge to duty shall not be made unless the facts so far before the Board of Trade indicate that the effect of the dumping or of the giving of the subsidy is such as to cause or threaten material injury to an established industry in the United Kingdom.

(4) An order shall not be made imposing a duty on goods of any description retrospectively by virtue of section 1(1) above, unless the Board of Trade are satisfied, as regards importations made during or before the period of the provisional charge, that the effect of the dumping or of the giving of the subsidy has been such as to cause material injury to an established industry in the United Kingdom.

(5) In this section “ treaty country ” means a country in relation to which Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is for the time being bound under the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concluded at Geneva in the year 1947.

1957 c. 18. (6) In the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957

the proviso to section 1(1) is hereby repealed.

Fair market 3.—(1) Section 7(3) of the Customs Duties (Dumping and

price. Subsidies) Act 1957 (which allows the fair market price of goods

in a country to be determined in certain circumstances by reference to the price obtained for goods exported from the country, or by reference to the cost or estimated cost of production with additions in respect of the selling cost and profit) shall be amended—

(a) by substituting for the words “ selling cost ” the words

“ administrative, selling or other costs and

(b) by adding at the end of the subsection the words—

“ The price by reference to which a determination is made under this subsection may be the highest admissible price, but should be a representative price ”.

(2) Notwithstanding anything in section 7(2) or (3) of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957, where it appears to the Board of Trade that the system of trading in a country is such, as a result of government monopoly and control, that there cannot appropriately be determined in accordance with that section a fair market price in the country for particular goods, then there shall be taken as representing that fair market price such price as the Board may determine by reference to any

Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Ch. 33

Amendment Act 1968

789

price obtained for goods of that description (that is to say, any identical or comparable goods) when exported to the United Kingdom from another country, with adjustments for the purpose of ensuring that the comparison to be made between the price arrived at as representing the fair market price and the export price is effectively a comparison between the prices on two similar sales.

4. —(1) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers Suspension conferred by sections 2 and 11(1) of the Customs Duties (Dumping of duties, and Subsidies) Act 1957, a duty imposed by an order under that I957 c. 18. Act may by a further order be removed (or varied) for any

period or periods, whether continuous or not.

(2) Where an order suspending a duty under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957 by removing it for any period or periods is revoked in whole or in part by a subsequent order, then for purposes of section 13(3) and (4) of the Import1958 c* 6-Duties Act 1958 as they apply by virtue of section 11(1) of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957 the subsequent order shall, as regards the annulment of the suspension, be deemed not to be an order imposing or increasing a duty of customs; and accordingly, unless for other reasons it requires to be approved by resolution of the Commons House of Parliament, it shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of that House.

5. —(1) This Act may be cited as the Customs Duties (Dumping Short tide,

(2) The Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957 and extent, and this Act shall be construed as one, and may be cited together

as the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Acts 1957 and 1968.

(3) It is hereby declared that this Act extends to Northern Ireland.

SCHEDULE

Supplementary Provisions as to Provisional Chargb to Duty and as to Retrospective Duties

1. Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, a preliminary order shall, as regards the period for which it is in force, have the same operation (except that duty shall not be levied) as if the charge to duty had not been provisional; and the lapsing of the provisional charge on the revocation or expiration of the preliminary order shall not affect the liability to any penalty, forfeiture or prosecution in respect of things done during the period of the provisional charge.

21.—(1) Drainage charges under Part I of the Land Drainage Act 1961 (hereafter in die charges provisions referred to as “ the principal Act ”) shall, instead of being raised at an amount per pound on the annual value of chargeable hereditaments in river authority areas and levied on the occupiers or owners of the hereditaments, be raised at an amount per acre of chargeable land in those areas and levied on the occupiers or owners of the land in accordance with the charges provisions and the provisions of the said Part I as modified by this Act.

(2) In sections 22 to 29 of this Act and this section “ the charges provisions ” means those sections and this section.

22.—(1) The general drainage charge raised by a river authority for any year shall be at a uniform amount per acre ascertained in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

(2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, the said amount shall be ascertained by—

(a) dividing the aggregate amount demanded by the precepts issued by the river authority to the councils of counties, county boroughs and London boroughs under section 87(4) of the Water Resources Act 1963 in respect of the year for which the charge is raised by the aggregate amount of the appropriate penny rate products on the basis of which the amount so demanded was apportioned in pursuance of section 87(3) of that Act among those councils; and

Agriculture {Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 Ch. 34

811

(b) multiplying the quotient by one penny and by such Part IV number as the Minister may specify by order made for the purposes of this paragraph;

and the number so specified shall (apart from any adjustment made to it to lake account of rough grazing land) be such as the Minister considers will secure, so far as reasonably practicable, that the aggregate amount produced by any charge levied by reference to a quotient ascertained in pursuance of paragraph (a) of this subsection will be equal to the aggregate amount which, if the chargeable land in the river authority area were liable to be rated, would be produced by a rate levied on that land at an amount in the pound (of rateable value) equal to that quotient multiplied by one penny.

(3) Where an amount ascertained in pursuance of subsection (2) of this section includes a fraction of a penny, the fraction shall—

(a) if it is one farthing or less, be disregarded;

(b) if it is greater than one farthing but less than three farthings, be treated as one half-penny;

(c) if it is three farthings or more, be treated as one

penny.

(4) An order under this section may be made so as to apply either to all general drainage charges which may be raised by river authorities or to the general drainage charges proposed to be raised by any one or more river authorities specified in the order, and any such order applying to the charges of more than one river authority may make different provision as respects the charges of the different authorities.

(5) In subsection (2) of this section “ appropriate penny rate product ” has the same meaning as that expression has for the purposes of the said section 87, and the reference in that subsection to subsection (4) of that section does not include a reference to it as applied by subsection (5) of that section.

24. —(1) Where the area of chargeable land in respect of which, apart from this section, a sum is payable by any person by way of a drainage charge consists of or includes a fraction of an acre, then for the purpose of calculating that sum the fraction shall be disregarded if it is less than one-half and treated as one acre in any other case.

(2) The sum payable by way of a drainage charge in respect of chargeable land consisting of commercial woodlands shall be calculated as if die area of the land were one-fifth of its actual area; and in the application of subsection (1) of this section to such chargeable land the area ascertained in pursuance of this subsection (and not the area of which it is one-fifth) shall be treated as the area mentioned in that subsection.

25. —(1) A river authority may make arrangements with the owner of any chargeable land for any drainage charges which may be raised by the authority for any period in respect of the land to be levied on the owner instead of on the occupier of the land; and where such arrangements are made the charges in question shall be levied on the owner instead of on the occupier of the land and any reference to an occupier in the charges provisions (except this section) and in Part I of the principal Act shall be construed accordingly.

(2) Where in pursuance of any such arrangements the owner of any land pays drainage charges in respect of the land to a river authority before the expiration of the period of two months beginning with the date of the service on him of the demand for the charges or before the expiration of one half of the period for which the charges are raised, the authority shall make to him an allowance equal to ten per cent, of the full amount of the

(a) determine that no arrangements under the foregoing

provisions of this section shall be made in respect of the land and that any such arrangements previously made shall cease to have effect so far as they relate to the land and any drainage charge to be raised for a period beginning after the date on which the notice takes effect;

(b) revoke any determination under paragraph (a) above so

far as it prohibits the making of such arrangements in respect of the land;

and a notice under this subsection shall take effect on the day following that on which it is given to the river authority.

Family Allowances and National Insurance Ch. 40

Act 1968

Awards made before changes in rates take effect

2. —(1) As from the date on which section 1(1) of this Act comes

into force any allowance under the Family Allowances Act 1965 1965 c. 53. awarded before that date shall, subject to any prescribed exceptions or conditions, become payable at the rate provided for by this Act, and the award shall have effect accordingly.

(2) Accordingly any award of such an allowance made before that date (but after that date is appointed) either may provide for the allowance to be paid as from that date at the rate provided for by this Act or may be expressed in terms of the rates appropriate at the date of the award.

3. —(1) Where the weekly rate of any benefit is decreased by this Act, and before the date when the decrease takes effect (in this paragraph referred to as “ the relevant date ”) an award of that benefit has been made whether before or after the passing of this Act, then subject to such exceptions or conditions as may be prescribed the benefit shall, except as respects any period falling before the relevant date, become payable at the rate appropriate under or by virtue of this Act without any review of the award, and the award shall have effect accordingly.

(2) Where the weekly rate of any benefit is decreased by this Act, and before the relevant date (but after the date is appointed) an award is made of the benefit, the award either may provide for the benefit to be paid as from the relevant date at the rate appropriate under or by virtue of this Act or may be expressed in terms of the rates appropriate at the date of the award.

Set-off of overpayments of benefit

4. Where a beneficiary receives in respect of any persons as being, or as falling to be treated as, children of his family an amount of benefit which by reason of section 1 of this Act is not properly payable, but would have been properly payable according to the

rates in force at the passing of this Act or at that of the Family Allow- 1967 c. 90. ances and National Insurance Act 1967, and he receives it for a period for which there are payable to him or anyone else in respect of those

persons or any of them allowances under the Family Allowances Act 1965 at a rate which would not have been payable but for this Act, then the amount of benefit overpaid and not required to be repaid shall be treated as having been properly paid up to the amount of any arrears of allowances payable under the Family Allowances Act 1965 for that period in respect of those persons, and any such arrears shall be correspondingly reduced or withheld.

Calculation of contributions to cost of providing for child

5. Where for any purpose of the provisions amended by section l(l)(b) of this Act the weekly rate at which a person contributes to the cost of providing for a child is to be calculated for a period after section l(l)(b) applies, but account is taken of amounts referable to the period before it applies, then those amounts shall be treated as increased in proportion to the increase effected by section 1(1

in the required rate of contributions.

Continuation of previous rates of benefit in special cases

6. As regards benefit of which any weekly rate is reduced by this Act, the Minister of Social Security may by regulations make provision, either generally or for particular cases or classes of case, for excluding the reduction in whole or in part where—

(a) immediately before the reduction takes effect a person is

entitled to any such benefit in respect of any children; and (b) during any period during which he continues without a break to be entitled to benefit (whether the same benefit or another) in respect of those children or any of them the aggregate weekly rate of the benefit to which he is entitled in respect of those children and of the allowances payable in respect of them under the Family Allowances Act 1965 is less than it would have been according to the rates in force at the passing of this Act.

Regulations

7. Section 108 of the National Insurance Act 1965 and section 62(2) of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 (which require a draft of proposals for regulations under the Act to be submitted to the National Insurance Advisory Committee or Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, as the case may be) shall not apply to any regulations (whether made under this Scheaule or not) if they are contained in a statutory instrument made before the expiration of the six months beginning with the date of the passing of this Act and the instrument states that it is made in consequence of the passing of this Act.

Interpretation

8. In this Schedule '* benefit ” means benefit under the National Insurance Act 1965 or the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965, and “ beneficiary ” has a corresponding meaning.

(4) An order made for purposes of this section shall prescribe in such manner and by reference to such matters as the Minister or Ministers may think fit the prices and charges that may be lawfully charged in cases to which the order applies; but where anything is done with the written consent of a Minister making or joining in making an order under this section, it shall not by reason of that order be unlawful under this section.

Part n

Prices and Incomes Act 1968

Ch. 42

939

any financial year at a rate greater than that paid for the pre- Part n ceding financial year.

(2) For purposes of this section “ ordinary dividend ” means a dividend payable in cash, not being a capital dividend nor a fixed rate dividend; but so long as a company is subject to any order or directions under this section prohibiting it from declaring ordinary dividends as mentioned in subsection

(1), then, except in so far as provision to the contrary is made by the order or directions, the company shall also be prohibited, without first obtaining the consent of the Treasury,—

(a) from making any distribution out of assets of the

company in respect of equity share capital of the company otherwise than by payment of an ordinary dividend or a fixed rate dividend or by repayment of capital; and

(b) from assuming, whether conditionally or otherwise, any

obligation to make a distribution as aforesaid.

(3) For purposes of this section a company is to be treated (subject to subsection (4) below) as declaring ordinary dividends for a financial year at a rate greater than that paid for the preceding financial year if at any time it declares an amount of ordinary dividends for the year which, alone or taken with any amount declared earlier, is greater than the amount of the ordinary dividends paid for the preceding financial year (which is not to be taken as including any amount paid in excess of that lawfully declared); but—

(a) there shall be left out of the comparison to be made in

connection with any declaration amounts declared earlier or paid for the preceding financial year so far as declared or paid in respect of share capital repaid before the declaration in point; and

(b) dividends not expressed to be payable for the financial

year in which they are declared shall be treated as dividends for the one before; and

(c) the declaration of a dividend contrary to an order or

direction under this section shall not be invalidated except to the extent to which it contravenes the order or direction.

(4) In this section references to a financial year of a company are references to any period in respect of which a profit and loss account of the company laid before it in general meeting is made up, and “the preceding financial year" means the immediately preceding financial year; but—

(a) where comparison is to be made between the rates of ordinary dividend for two financial years differing in length by a month or more (both years having come

to an end), the amount to be taken into account as dividends paid for the earlier year shall be treated as increased or reduced in proportion to the greater or less length of the later year; and

(b) where it appears to the Treasury that a comparison

with ordinary dividends for the immediately preceding financial year of a company would for any reason be inappropriate, the Treasury may direct that for purposes of the comparison “the preceding financial year ” shall mean such earlier year as may be specified in the direction; and

(c) in relation to the declaration of ordinary dividends in

or for its first financial year by a new company formed in connection with the reconstruction or amalgamation of another company or companies, this section shall have effect as if the company were not a new company but had paid no ordinary dividends for any previous financial year.

(5) Subject to subsection (4)(c) above nothing in this section shall be taken to apply to a new company during its first financial year or to the declaration by it of ordinary dividends for that year.

(6) The Treasury shall not withhold their consent under this section to the doing of anything by a company, if it is made to appear to the Treasury—

(a) that the company is a close company for purposes of Part IV of the Finance Act 1965; and

(b) that the action proposed to be taken by the company does not go beyond that which is likely to be required if there is not to be, within the meaning of section 77 of that Act, a shortfall in the company's distributions for an accounting period (any operation of section 77(4) in relation to the restrictions imposed by this section being for this purpose disregarded).

(7) In this section references to the declaration of a dividend by a company are references to the taking of the decision to pay it, whether or not the decision is that of the company in general meeting; “equity share capital” means any share capital not restricted, as regards participation in distributions of profits, to fixed rate dividends; and “ fixed rate dividend ” means a dividend which in accordance with the rights attached to any share capital is payable in cash at a fixed rate on that capital or at a rate fluctuating only with the standard rate of income tax.

(2) The Minister may by regulations make such provision as to contractual periods of regulated tenancies as appears to the Minister to be expedient in order to secure that the restriction imposed by subsection (1) above in relation to statutory tenancies is not made ineffective by the grant to a tenant (whether a statutory tenant or not) of a new tenancy or by any other arrangement or device.

(3) The provision which may be made by regulations under subsection (1) above may include provision for excepting from the restriction imposed by that subsection, either generally or in a particular area, such regulated tenancies (determined by reference to rateable values or otherwise) as may be provided by the regulations, or for making other exceptions, as well as for regulating in any manner the extent to which, or stages

11.—(1) The Minister may give directions to local authorities requiring them, not later than one month after the date the directions are given, to give him notice, in such form and containing such particulars as may be indicated by the directions, of cases of any description so indicated in which the rents payable to them in respect of local authority houses at or last before the date of the coming into force of this section exceeded the rents so payable at or last before the 31st March 1968.

(2) Where the Minister has given directions under subsection

(1) above, then as regards cases of any description indicated in those directions he may give directions to a local authority requiring them within a period specified in the directions (ending not earlier than two months after the date they are given) to submit for his approval proposals for reducing rents for the purpose of mitigating rent increases taking effect after the 31st March 1968 and before the date of the coming into force of this section.

(3) If the Minister approves proposals submitted to him under subsection (2) above either without modification or with any modifications made by the local authority on reconsidering the proposals at the request of the Minister, the Minister shall

notify the authority and the authority shall put the proposals Part III into effect accordingly; and if an authority fails to submit proposals as required by subsection (2), or the proposals submitted are not approved by the Minister, the authority shall give effect to any directions which the Minister may see fit to give for reducing rents for the purpose of mitigating the rent increases in question.

(4) On receipt from a local authority of a notice required by directions under subsection (1) above the Minister may by a further direction require the authority to give further information; but no directions shall be given to a local authority under subsection (2) above more than two months after the date on which the authority complied with the directions under subsection (1) or. if a further direction is given under this subsection, with that direction.

(5) Directions under subsection (1) above may include provision for excepting from their operation cases in which it appears to the Minister that the information to be included in a local authority's notice is otherwise at his disposal; but no exception so made shall affect the operation of subsections

to the Minister that in the case of a local authority named in the reference the provisions of this section should extend to rent increases which took effect before the 1st April 1968, then any directions under subsection (2) above may extend to those increases as if they had taken effect at or after that date, or the Minister may in relation to those increases give under this subsection die like directions as in a case within subsection (2) he may give under that subsection in relation to increases taking effect at or after that date, and subsection (3) above shall apply accordingly; but directions shall not be given under this subsection more than two months after the date of publication of the Board's report or the date of the passing of this Act, whichever is the later.

(2) Where a local authority gives a notice of increase under subsection (1) above for the beginning of a rental period and the tenancy continues into that period, the notice shall nevertheless not have effect if the tenancy is terminated by notice to quit given by the tenant in accordance with the provisions express or implied of the tenancy, and—

(b) ending with those three months if the report is not so published;

and if the Board's report is so published and contains a recommendation adverse in any respect to the wages regulation proposals, the making of the order may be postponed for an additional period, but so that the order shall be made within the twelve months beginning with the date of submission of the proposals.

(a) as regards periods after the proposals come into operation

they shall have the like effect as if they had been brought into operation without any such postponement; and

(3) Where an agricultural wages order is referred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes and the reference is published in the Gazette before part of the provisions of the order come into operation, this paragraph shall have effect in relation to the coming into operation of that part of its provisions.

7. Where the coming into operation of an agricultural wages order is postponed (in whole or in part) under this Part of this Schedule, then as regards periods after it comes into operation it shall have the like effect as if it had come into operation without any such postponement.

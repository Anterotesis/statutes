service in respect of which the pension is payable.

(b) shall not impose a duty on any goods as goods

industry in the United Kingdom, or materially retard the establishment of an industry in the United Kingdom; or

(b) to cause or threaten material injury to an established

industry in another treaty country which is the country of origin of any like goods (that is, any identical or comparable goods) imported into the United Kingdom.

(5) Subject to subsection (3)(a) above, an order made in the exercise of the power described in that subsection may include such provisions with respect to the description of the goods chargeable with duty and with respect to the cases in which duty is chargeable as may appear to the Board of Trade to be required for the purposes of this Act, including provisions limiting the description of the goods by reference to the particular persons or organisations by whom the goods were produced or who were concerned with the production of the goods in some specified manner.

1969 CHAPTER 20

An Act to make provision with respect to certain property (including the proceeds thereof and any income or other property accruing therefrom) of persons formerly resident or carrying on business in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or a part of Czechoslovakia, Finland, Poland or Rumania which has been ceded to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and to amend the Foreign Compensation Act 1950.

[16th May 1969]

Whereas by an agreement entered into on 5th January 1968 between Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics each of those Governments undertook not to pursue with the other on its own behalf or on behalf of other persons, or to support, the claims described in Articles 1 and 2 of the agreement and the former Government undertook to make a settlement of claims against the latter Government by the holders of the unredeemed notes mentioned in Article 4 of the agreement and agreed to pay to the latter Government the sum of £500,000 out of the property or proceeds of property claimed by the latter:

And whereas it is expedient to make provision for carrying out such of those undertakings as were given by Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom;

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) The purposes for which the Board of Trade may make orders under section 7 of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 (collection of enemy debts and custody of enemy property), and for which powers or duties conferred or imposed by that section or any such order on a custodian of enemy property may be exercised or are to be performed, shall include the disposal of

or other dealing with former property of a Baltic State or ceded territory to enable a custodian of enemy property to perform his functions under subsections (3) and (5) below.

(2) Any order made by the Board of Trade under that section may make the like provision in relation to former property of a Baltic State or ceded territory as might be made by such an order in relation to enemy property if a state of war existed:

Provided that an order made by virtue of this subsection shall not provide for the payment to, or the vesting in, a custodian of enemy property of any money or other property unless an order had been made under or by virtue of that section before the passing of this Act purporting to require it to be paid to a custodian or to vest it or the right to transfer it in a custodian.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in that section or any order thereunder, a custodian of enemy property shall, if the Treasury so directs—

(a) pay to the Foreign Compensation Commission, for the

purpose of enabling them to make payments in respect of any of the claims mentioned in Articles 1 and 4 of the agreement recited above or other similar claims, any money held by the custodian, being former property of a Baltic State or ceded territory, and any income arising therefrom which has not before the giving of the direction been paid into the Exchequer;

(b) pay to any other person specified in the direction any of

that money;

(c) transfer to any person so specified any such property

which, or the right to transfer which, is vested in the custodian;

and section 4(1) of the Enemy Property Act 1953 (payment into Exchequer of income from money invested by a custodian) shall not apply to income with respect to which a direction has been given under paragraph (< a) above.

(4) The Board of Trade may out of moneys provided by Parliament pay to the Foreign Compensation Commission sums not exceeding in the aggregate the amount of any income which has accrued since 12th February 1967 from former property of a Baltic State or ceded territory and has been paid into the Exchequer in pursuance of the said section 4(1).

(5) When so directed by the Treasury, the custodian of enemy property shall, by way of repaying a payment of £500,000 made out of moneys provided by Parliament for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the agreement recited above for the payment of that sum to the Government of the Union of

Soviet Socialist Republics, pay the like sum into the Consolidated Fund out of money held by him, being former property of a Baltic State or ceded territory.

(6) Section 3(4) and (5) of the Enemy Property Act 1953 (saving 1953 c. 52. for right to recover property dealt with under the Trading with the 1939 c. 89. Enemy Act 1939 as enemy property) shall not operate so as to authorise the recovery after 5th January 1968 of any former property of a Baltic State or ceded territory, except property which on any of the relevant dates belonged to or was held or managed on behalf of an individual, or of any proceeds of such property, and any such property or proceeds (except as aforesaid) recovered by virtue of those subsections between that date and the passing of this Act shall be re-transferred or repaid, as the case may require.

2.—(1) The powers conferred by section 3 of the Foreign Amendments Compensation Act 1950 (claims to, and distribution of, com-of Foreign pensation paid by foreign governments) shall be exercisable if Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom enter into or *

contemplate an agreement with the government of any other1950 c*12* country (whether foreign or not) providing for the payment of compensation by the latter government; and accordingly in that section for the words “any foreign country” there shall be substituted the words “ any other country ”.

(2) An Order in Council under the said section 3 may make the like provision with respect to money paid to the Foreign Compensation Commission by virtue of section 1(3) or (4) above as may be made by any such Order in relation to sums paid to Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom by way of compensation by the government of any other country under an agreement between the two governments.

(3) An Order in Council may be made under the said section 3 not only in the circumstances therein mentioned, but also if it appears to Her Majesty expedient to provide, in case agreement is reached between Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the government of any other country for the payment of compensation by the latter, for the registration, investigation and determination of claims to such compensation.

(4) Section 2(3) of the Foreign Compensation Act 1950 (appointment by Commonwealth governments of additional members of the Foreign Compensation Commission for the purpose of determining claims to compensation paid by the Governments of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia) shall cease to have effect.

defect or error in the enforcement notice if he is satisfied that the informality, defect or error is not material;

(b) in a case where it would otherwise be a ground for determining the appeal in favour of the appellant that a person required by section 15(5) of this Act to be served with the notice was not served, the Secretary of State may disregard that fact if neither the appellant nor that person has been substantially prejudiced by the failure to serve him.

(5) On the determination of an appeal under this section, the Secretary of State shall give directions for giving effect to his determination, including, where appropriate, directions for quashing the enforcement notice or for varying the terms of the notice in favour of the appellant; and the Secretary of State may—

which the enforcement notice relates or, as the case may be, discharge any condition or limitation subject to which planning permission for that development was granted;

(b) determine any purpose for which the land may, in the

circumstances obtaining at the time of the determination, be lawfully used, having regard to any past use thereof and to any planning permission relating to the land.

(6) In considering whether to grant planning permission under subsection (5) above, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the provisions of the development plan, so far as material to the subject-matter of the enforcement notice, and to any other material considerations, and any planning permission granted by him under that subsection may—

notice, or

(b) that another local planning authority or statutory undertakers specified in the notice under this sub-paragraph have agreed to comply with it in their place; or

paragraph, the authority are not willing to comply with the purchase notice and have not found any other local planning authority or statutory undertakers who will agree to comply with it in their place and that they have transmitted a copy of the purchase notice to the Secretary of State, on a date specified in the notice under this sub-paragraph, together with a statement of the reasons so specified.

(2) Where the local planning authority on whom a listed building purchase notice is served by an owner or lessee have served on him a notice in accordance with sub-paragraph (lXu) or (b) above, the authority, or the other local planning authority or statutory undertakers specified in the notice, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be authorised to acquire the interest of the owner or lessee compulsorily in accordance with the provisions of section 50 of this Act, and to have served a notice to treat in respect thereof on the date of service of the notice under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph.

(3) Where the authority on whom a listed building purchase notice is served by an owner or lessee propose to serve on him a notice in accordance with sub-paragraph (1 Xc) above, they shall transmit a copy of the purchase notice to the Secretary of State together with a statement of their reasons; and subsections (5) and (7) of section 17 of the Act of 1947 (procedure on reference of purchase notice to the Secretary of State) shall then apply in relation to the purchase notice as it applies in relation to a purchase notice under that section, with the substitution for references therein to the Secretary of State taking action under that section of references to his taking action under paragraph 13 of this Schedule.

Sch. 4 Provided that, if he is satisfied that the said conditions are fulfilled only in respect of part of the land, he shall confirm the notice only in respect of that part and the notice shall have effect accordingly.

(2) The Secretary of State shall not confirm the purchase notice unless he is satisfied that the land comprises such land contiguous or adjacent to the building as is in his opinion required for preserving the building or its amenities, or for affording access to it, or for its proper control or management

(3) If it appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient to do so in the case of a listed building purchase notice served on account of listed building consent being refused or granted subject to conditions, he may, in lieu of confirming the purchase notice, grant listed building consent for the works in respect of which the application was made or, where such consent for those works was granted subject to conditions, revoke or amend those conditions so far as it appears to him to be required in order to enable the land to be rendered capable of reasonably beneficial use by the carrying out of those works.

(2) If, before the end of the relevant period, the Secretary of State has neither confirmed the purchase notice nor taken any such action in respect thereof as is mentioned in sub-paragraphs (3) to

(3) In this paragraph—

(a) “ the relevant interest ” means the owner’s or lessee’s interest

in the land or, if the purchase notice is confirmed by the Secretary of State in respect of only part of the land, the owner's or lessee's interest in that part;

(i) the period of nine months beginning with the date of the service of the purchase notice; and

15. Where in consequence of listed building consent being revoked or modified by an order under Part II of this Schedule, compensation is payable in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying out any works to the building in respect of which the consent was granted, then if a listed building purchase notice is served in respect of an interest in the land, any compensation payable in respect of the acquisition of that interest in pursuance of the purchase notice shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the works in respect of which compensation is payable by virtue of paragraph 10 above.

3. Where, because persons, whether company members or not. possess extraordinary rights or powers under the articles of association or under any other document regulating the company, ownership of ordinary share capital may not be an appropriate test of whether there has been a major change in the persons for whose benefit the losses may ultimately enure, then in considering whether there has been a change of ownership of the company for the purposes of the principal section, holdings of all kinds of share capital, including preference shares, or of any particular category of share capital, or voting power or any other special kind of power, may be taken into account instead of ordinary share capital.

4. Where the principal section has operated to restrict relief by reference to a change of ownership taking place at any time, no transaction or circumstances before that time shall be taken into account in determining whether there is any subsequent change of ownership.

(2) If there is a change in the ownership of a company which has a 75 per cent, subsidiary (whether owned directly or indirectly) then, unless under sub-paragraph (1) above that change in ownership is to be disregarded, the principal section shall apply as if there had also been a change in the ownership of that 75 per cent, subsidiary.

(d) the amount of ordinary share capital of one company

Capital allowances

8. Where relief in respect of a company’s losses has been restricted under the principal section then, notwithstanding section 87(3) of the Capital Allowances Act 1968, in applying the provisions of that 1968 c. 3. Act about balancing charges to the company by reference to any event after the change of ownership of the company, any allowance or deduction falling to be made in taxing the company’s trade for any chargeable period before the change of ownership shall be disregarded unless the profits or gains of that chargeable period or of any subsequent chargeable period before the change of ownership were sufficient to give effect to the allowance or deduction.

In applying this paragraph it shall be assumed that any profits or gains are applied in giving effect to any such allowance or deduction in preference to being set off against any loss which is not attributable to such an allowance or deduction.

(2) If after the relevant time the specified securities are appropriated by the company in such circumstances that if they were disposed of after the appropriation, any profit accruing on their disposal would be brought into account in computing the company’s profits for corporation tax, then for the purposes of corporation tax any loss incurred by the company on the disposal of those securities

Finance Act 1969 Ch. 32

shall not exceed the loss which would have been incurred on that disposal if the amount or value of the consideration for the acquisition of the securities had been equal to their market value at the time of the appropriation.

2. —(1) This paragraph applies if—

(a) at the relevant time or at any time thereafter (whether before

or after the commencement of this Act) any specified securities were held by a company in such circumstances that any profit accruing on their disposal would be brought into account in computing the company's profits for corporation tax; and

(b) those securities are subsequently appropriated by the company in such circumstances that any gain accruing on their disposal would by virtue of section 41 of this Act be exempt from corporation tax on chargeable gains.

(2) Where this paragraph applies, the company concerned shall be treated for the purposes of corporation tax as if, immediately before the appropriation, it had sold and repurchased the specified securities at their market value at the time of the appropriation.

(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, if the transferor so claims, the transfer shall not be treated for the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965 as a disposal, but all sums which, if it had been so treated, would have been brought into account for consideration for that disposal in the computation under Schedule 6 to that Act of a gain accruing on the disposal shall be deducted from any expenditure allowable under that Schedule as a deduction in computing a gain on any subsequent disposal of the holding.

(3) This paragraph shall not apply—

(a) if die amount or value of the consideration for the transfer exceeds £2,500, or (i b) where in the year of assessment in which the transfer is made, the transferor made any other disposal of land, if the total amount or value of the consideration for all disposals of land made by the transferor in that year exceeds

(5) Paragraph 9 of Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 1966 (which deals with cases where no expenditure is attributable to the asset or that expenditure is small) shall apply as if this paragraph were mentioned in the said paragraph 9(1).

(6) In relation to a transfer which is not for full consideration in money or money’s worth, “ the amount or value of the consideration *’ in this paragraph shall mean the market value of the land transferred.

(7) In the application of this paragraph to a transfer to which section 33(1) of the Finance Act 1967 (current use value) applies, or would apply but for this paragraph, for references to the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer or to the market value of the holding there shall be substituted references to the current use value of the land, or as the case may be of the holding, at the relevant time.

(8) For the purposes of this paragraph the holding of land shall comprise only the land in respect of which the expenditure allowable under paragraphs ( a) and (b) of paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 would be apportioned under paragraph 7 of that Schedule if the transfer had been treated as a disposal (that is. as a part disposal of the holding).

6 to the Finance Act 1965.

(3) In any case where land or an interest in land is acquired as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above from any person and the compensation or purchase price includes an amount in respect of severance of the land composed in the acquisition or sale from other land in which that person is entitled in the same capacity to an interest or in respect of that other land as being injuriously affected, there shall be deemed for the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965 to be a part disposal of that other land.

(4) Unless the person receiving the compensation makes an election

under section 33(3) of the Finance Act 1967, the amount of the 1967 c. 54. consideration for such a part disposal as is referred to in sub-para-graph (3) above shall in the case of land in Great Britain be determined in accordance with paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 14 to the Finance Act 1967 as if the part disposal derived from such a chargeable act or event as is referred to in that paragraph.

638

Ch. 32

Sch. 19 apart from the provisions of this paragraph, any chargeable

gain on one asset (called “ asset No. 1 ”) is reduced, with a corresponding reduction of the expenditure allowable in respect of another asset (called “ asset No. 2 *),

(h) any reference to a gain of any amount being carried forward to any asset is a reference to a reduction of that amount in a chargeable gain coupled with a reduction of the same amount in expenditure allowable in respect of that asset.

(2) If asset No. 2 is a depreciating asset, the held over gain shall not be carried forward, but the claimant shall be treated for the purposes of long-term and short-term tax on capital gains as if so much of the chargeable gain on asset No. 1 as is equal to the held over gain did not accrue until—

(a) that the consideration for asset No. 1 was applied in acquiring

asset No. 3, and

(b) that the time between the disposal of asset No. 1 and the acquisition of asset No. 3 was within the time limited by subsection (3) of the said section 33,

the whole amount of the postponed gain could be carried forward from asset No. 1 to asset No. 3; and the claim under sub-paragraph (3) above shall be accepted as if those assumptions were true.

(5) If part only of the postponed gain could be carried forward from asset No. 1 to asset No. 3, and the claimant so requires, that and the other part of the postponed gain shall be treated as derived from two separate assets, so that, on that claim—

(2) Where any agreement such as is mentioned in the said paragraph 7 refers to property, rights and liabilities which, under paragraph 1 or 3 of this Schedule, are divided or apportioned between the Executive and the designated company, the agreement shall have effect on and after the date from which the division or apportionment has effect as if it constituted two separate agreements separately enforceable by and against each of those bodies respectively as regards the part of the property, rights and liabilities vesting in that body and not as regards the other part; and this sub-paragraph shall apply in particular to the covenants, stipulations and conditions of any lease by or to the London Board.

(3) For the purposes of the said paragraphs 8 to 12 as applied by sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall be deemed to form part of the said paragraph 7.

(2) It shall be the duty of the Executive and the designated company, if any such transaction is effected, to notify any person who has rights or liabilities which thereby become enforceable as to part by or against one, and as to part by or against the other, of those bodies, and if such a person applies to the Minister and satisfies him that the transaction operated unfairly against him the Minister may give such directions to those bodies as appear to him appropriate for varying the transaction.

10. If in consequence of any such transfer as is referred to in paragraph 8(1) of this Schedule the rights or liabilities of any person other than the Executive or the designated company which were enforceable against or by the London Board become enforceable in part against or by one, and in part against or by the other, of the Executive and the designated company, and the value of any property or interest of that person is thereby diminished, the Executive and the designated company shall pay to that person such compensation as may be just, and any dispute as to whether and if so how much compensation is so payable, or as to the

13. It shall be the duty of the Executive and designated company to keep one another informed of any case where either of them may be prejudiced by paragraph 11 or 12 of this Schedule, and if either of them claims that they have been so prejudiced and that the other of them ought to indemnify or make a payment to them on that account and has unreasonably failed to meet that claim, the body so claiming may refer the matter to the Minister for determination by the Minister.

Right to production of documents of title

Where in the case of any land or other property transferred from the London Board under this Act the Executive or the designated company are entitled to retain possession of any document relating in part to the title to, or to the management of, property so transferred to the other of those bodies, the retaining body shall be deemed to have given to the other an acknowledgment in writing of the right of the other body to production of that document and to delivery of copies thereof; and section 64 of the Law of Property Act 1925 shall have effect accordingly, and on the basis that the acknowledgment did not contain any such expression of contrary intention as is mentioned in that section.

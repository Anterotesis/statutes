9. In calculating, for the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Schedule, the capital value at any date of a right to receive rent payable in respect of a tenancy, it shall be assumed that the tenant under that tenancy—

(a) will aways pay that rent when it falls due and will perform

his other obligations under the tenancy, and

(b) will exercise any option to renew that tenancy, and will

not exercise any option to terminate it, then or thereafter available to him.

Base value realised

10. Except in so far as the relevant Schedules otherwise provide, the base value realised by the disposition shall, for the purpose of assessing levy in respect of the disposition, be ascertained in accordance with paragraphs 11 to 15 of this Schedule.

11. —(1) There shall first be ascertained what immediately before the disposition is the value of the chargeable interest, calculated in accordance with Schedule 6 to this Act and on the assumption that planning permission—

(a) would be granted for any development of the relevant

land which does not constitute material development, but

(b) would not be granted for any development of that land which constitutes material development

(2) The value of the chargeable interest, calculated as mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph, is in this Part of this Schedule referred to as the current use value of the chargeable interest.

(3) The value referred to in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph is in this Part of this Schedule referred to as the reversionary value of the chargeable interest.

13. There shall then be calculated what proportion the amount of the consideration for the disposition bears to the aggregate of—

(a) that amount, and

(b) the reversionary value of the chargeable interest;

and so much of the current use value of the chargeable interest as bears that proportion to the whole of that current use value is in this Part of this Schedule referred to as the current use value realised by the disposition.

14. It shall also be ascertained whether the value of an interest in any other land held with the relevant land immediately before the disposition, where the grantor was immediately before the disposition entitled in the same capacity to that other interest as that in which he is entitled to the chargeable interest, is depreciated in consequence of the disposition, and, if so, the amount of the depreciation shall be determined.

15. The base value realised by the disposition shall then be taken to be an amount equal to the aggregate of—

(a) eleven-tenths of the current use value realised by the disposition, and

23. Where the relevant interest is a tenancy which is not in reversion expectant on the termination of any other tenancy, the market value of that interest shall (subject to paragraphs 26 and 27 of this Schedule) be taken to be the capital value at the relevant date of a right, during the period beginning with that date and ending with the termination of that tenancy, to receive a rent equal to the amount by which the full market rent exceeds the annual amount of the rent payable under the tenancy.

24. Where the relevant interest is a tenancy (in this paragraph referred to as 44 the superior tenancy ”) which is in reversion immediately expectant upon the termination of another tenancy (in this paragraph referred to as "the sub-tenancy”), the market value of that interest shall (subject to paragraphs 26 and 27 of this Schedule) be taken to be the aggregate of—

(a) the capital value at the relevant date of a right, during the period beginning with that date and ending with the termination of the sub-tenancy, to receive a rent equal to the amount by which the annual amount of rent payable under the sub-tenancy exceeds the annual amount of rent payable under the superior tenancy, and

Adjustment in case of last relevant disposition falling within antecedent period

8. Where the last relevant disposition was a disposition falling within the antecedent period, and by virtue of the last preceding paragraph the amount of the consideration given for that disposition is taken to be the base value of the relevant interest for the purpose of assessing levy in respect of the chargeable act or event, then the provisions of Part V of Schedule 4 to this Act shall have effect for that purpose as if paragraph 49 of that Schedule were omitted.

(2) In this paragraph “ reversion ” means any interest in land (being either the fee simple or a tenancy) which is in reversion expectant on the termination of a tenancy of that land.

Apportionment

13. For the purpose of assessing levy in Case C where the relevant interest is an interest in part (but not the whole) of the relevant land—

Modification of Schedule 5, paragraph 9, relation to certain projects of material development

17. Where paragraph 9 of Schedule 5 to this Act has effect for the purpose of assessing levy in Case C, and the circumstances of the relevant project are such that paragraph 29(3) of Schedule 4 to this Act has effect in ascertaining the current use value of the relevant interest, the comparison to be made under sub-paragraph (2) of the said paragraph 9 shall be between—

(a) the current use value of that interest ascertained in accordance

with paragraphs 29 and 30 of Schedule 4 to this Act, and

(b) the value which would have been the current use value of

that interest if paragraph 29(3) of Schedule 4 to this Act had been omitted and that value had fallen to be ascertained in accordance with those paragraphs (subject to that omis-. sion) as at the date of the last relevant disposition or (where so required by sub-paragraph (3) of the said paragraph 9) at the time immediately after that disposition was made.

134

Ch. 1

Land Commission Act 1967

Sch. 6 (2) In the circumstances specified in the preceding sub-paragraph.

the base value of the relevant interest (or, in Case B, the base value realised by the disposition which constitutes the chargeable act or event) shall be ascertained in two ways, that is to say, it shall first be ascertained apart from the provisions of this paragraph, and it shall then be ascertained separately—

(a) in relation to each part of the chargeable unit in respect of

which the conditions specified in the preceding sub-paragraph are fulfilled, as if the chargeable unit had been limited to that part of it, and

(b) in relation to the remainder of the chargeable unit in respect

of which those conditions are not fulfilled, as if the chargeable unit had been limited to that remainder of it

(3) If in those circumstances, otherwise than in Case B. the aggregate of the base values as so ascertained separately is greater than the base value as first ascertained, that aggregate (instead of the base value as first ascertained) shall for the purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph be taken to be the base value of the relevant interest

(4) If in those circumstances, in Case B, the aggregate of the base values realised by the disposition which constitutes the chargeable act or event when ascertained separately as mentioned in the last preceding sub-paragraph, is greater than the base value so realised as first ascertained, that aggregate (instead of the base value realised as first ascertained) shall for the purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph

(1) of this paragraph be taken to be the base value realised by the disposition.

(5) In this paragraph “the chargeable unit”, except in Case C. means the relevant land, and in Case C means so much of the relevant land as is land in which the relevant interest subsists.

Allowance for costs of valuation or apportionment

19.—(1) For the purpose of assessing levy in respect of a chargeable act or event—

(a) for the purpose of assessing levy in respect of a chargeable

act or event paragraph 15 or paragraph 16 of this Schedule has effect by reference to a taxable disposal deemed to have occurred on the death of the deceased (in this paragraph referred to as “ the first taxable disposal ”)» and

(b) for the purpose of assessing levy in respect of a subsequent chargeable act or event that paragraph falls to be applied by reference to another taxable disposal deemed to have occurred on that death.

any reference in that paragraph to the tax chargeable in respect of gains accruing to the deceased or to the trustees of the settlement in the year of assessment in which the deceased died shall be construed as a reference to the tax which would have been so chargeable if the gain deemed to accrue on the first taxable disposal had not been deemed to accrue.

(2) Where there is a series of three or more chargeable acts or events, and three or more taxable disposals are deemed to have occurred on the death of the deceased, the preceding sub-paragraphs shall have effect in relation to each chargeable act or event of the series successively, so that, for the purpose of assessing levy in respect of each subsequent chargeable act or event, there is excluded from the calculation of capital gains tax the chargeable gain deemed to accrue on any of those taxable disposals taken into account in ascertaining the net principal value of the dutiable interest in relation to a previous chargeable act or event of the series.

19. Where under section 64 of the Finance Act 1960 the principal value of the dutiable interest was or is reduced by a percentage specified in that section, then, for the purpose of ascertaining the net principal value of the dutiable interest, the gross principal value of that interest, or, if one or more deductions fall to be made under paragraphs 13 to 17 of this Schedule, so much of it as remains after those deductions have been made, shall be reduced by the like percentage; and the amount resulting from that reduction shall for the purposes of this Schedule be taken to be the net principal value of that interest.

Amount of estate duty attributable to net principal value

20. There shall be ascertained the rate at which estate duty leviable on the death of the deceased would have been payable on the dutiable interest if the following conditions had been fulfilled (whether any of those conditions was in fact fulfilled or not), that is to say—

(a) section 23 of the Finance Act 1925 (which relates to agricultural property) did not apply to the estate of the deceased;

Land Commission Act 1967

Ch. 1

141

(b) section 28 of the Finance Act 1954 (reduced rate of duty Sch. 7 on certain business assets) did not apply to that estate; 1954 c. 44. but

(c) in a case where subsection (1) of section 13 of the Finance 1914 c. 10.

Act 1914 (which relates to marginal relief) applied to that estate, the rate of estate duty payable was the lower rate referred to in that subsection, and in all other respects the circumstances relevant for ascertaining the rate of duty leviable were those which actually existed.

21. There shall then be calculated what amount of estate duty would have been payable in respect of the dutiable interest if—

(u) the amount on which the duty fell to be charged in respect of the dutiable interest had been the net principal value of that interest, and (i) the rate of duty chargeable in respect of that interest had been the rate ascertained under paragraph 20 of this Schedule,

and in all other respects the circumstances relevant for computing the duty were those which actually existed.

22. For the purposes of the following provisions of this Schedule the amount of estate duty attributable to the net principal value of the dutiable interest shall be taken to be the amount calculated under paragraph 21 of this Schedule.

Effective rate of duty and appropriate allowance

(2) That proportion, expressed as a percentage, is in this Schedule referred to as the effective rate of duty.

24. The appropriate allowance shall then be the amount which bears to the excess gross value of the dutiable interest the proportion which constitutes the effective rate of duty.

Part m Procedure Notice of claim

25.—(1) For the purpose of assessing levy no allowance under this Schedule shall be made in respect of an interest in land, as being the dutiable interest for the purposes of this Schedule, unless the chargeable owner, or a successor in title of his in whom the chargeable interest has become vested by operation of law, has served on the Commission a notice (in this Part of this Schedule referred to as a “ notice of claim ”) specifying that interest and stating—

(a) that a person specified in the notice died on a date so specified, and that a grant of probate or of letters of administration in respect of his estate was obtained on a date and at a registry so specified;

6. -^-(l) For the purposes of the application of Part I of Schedule 5 to this Act to a chargeable act or event (in this paragraph referred to as “the subsequent chargeable act or event*) where a previous disposition of the chargeable interest would apart from this paragraph have been a relevant disposition of that interest for those purposes, but there has been a compulsory acquisition by, or sale to, an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers in the circumstances specified in paragraph 2(1) of this Schedule, and—

(a) that acquisition or sale was effected in pursuance of a notice to treat served, or contract made, before the date which is the relevant date in relation to the subsequent chargeable act or event, and

Sch. 9 (b) the interest which in relation to the subsequent chargeable

act or event constitutes the relevant interest is an interest in the whole or part of the land referred to in paragraph 2(1) of this Schedule as the other land,

that previous disposition shall not be taken for those purposes to have been a relevant disposition of the chargeable interest.

(2) In this paragraph “ the chargeable interest ” has the meaning assigned to it by paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 5 to this Act.

7.—(1) Where apart from this paragraph a previous disposition of a related tenancy would be a relevant disposition of that tenancy for the purposes of the application of Part III of Schedule 5 to this Act to a chargeable act or event, paragraph 6 of this Schedule shall have effect for those purposes as it has effect for the purposes of the application of Part I of that Schedule, as if in that paragraph any reference to the chargeable interest were a reference to that tenancy.

(2) In this paragraph “ related tenancy ” has the meaning assigned to it by paragraph 22(2) of Schedule 5 to this Act.

Modification of Schedule 6, paragraph 8

8. Where a disposition of an interest in land to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers constitutes a chargeable act or event falling within Case A, and is made in the circumstances specified in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 8 of Schedule 6 to this Act, sub-paragraph (2Xh) of that paragraph shall apply as if, for the reference to the date on which the carrying out of the project was begun, there were substituted a reference to the date of service of the notice to treat, or (as the case may be) the date of the contract, in pursuance of which the disposition is made.

Derivation of base value from compensation for acquisition ( C)

9. —(1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect for the purpose of assessing levy in Case C where an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers is the developing owner in relation to the relevant project and has served notice to treat, or has entered into an agreement, for the acquisition of the relevant interest.

(2) After the current use value of the relevant interest has been ascertained in accordance with Part III of Schedule 4 to this Act, it shall be determined whether the amount of that current use value (so ascertained) is greater or less than it would have been if it had fallen to be ascertained as at the date of the notice to treat or agreement, and, if so, the amount of the difference (whether it is an excess or a deficiency) shall be determined.

(3) If the amount of the compensation to be paid for the acquisition of the relevant interest has been agreed or determined before the latest date on which, in accordance with section 46(2) of this Act, a counter-notice could be served objecting to a notice of assessment of levy served in respect of the relevant interest, and that amount—

Land Commission Act 1967

Ch. 1

163

(a) increased by the amount of any excess determined under the Sch. 9 last preceding sub-paragraph, in a case where the determination under that sub-paragraph shows an excess, or

(b) reduced by the amount of any deficiency determined under that sub-paragraph, in a case where that determination shows a deficiency,

exceeds the value which would be the base value of the relevant interest apart from this paragraph, then for the purpose of assessing levy in Case C in respect of the relevant interest that amount, as so increased or reduced, shall be taken to be the base value of the relevant interest.

Base value to include additional factor for disturbance

10. —(1) For the purpose of assessing levy in Case A in respect of a disposition of an interest in land to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers, the base value of the relevant interest (ascertained apart from this paragraph) shall be increased by adding to it an amount calculated in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph.

(2) For the purpose of calculating that amount regard shall be had to the compensation which would have been payable by the acquiring authority in respect of the acquisition of the relevant interest if the following circumstances had existed, that is to say—

(a) no planning permission for the carrying out of any material

development of the relevant land were in force on the relevant date, and

(b) it were to be assumed that no such planning permission would be granted;

and the amount referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph is so much of that compensation as would have been attributable to disturbance.

(3) If the disposition referred to in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph is a disposition in pursuance of an agreement, and not in pursuance of a notice to treat, the last preceding sub-paragraph shall apply as if it were a disposition in pursuance of a notice to treat served on the date of the agreement.

Additional requirements as to notification in certain cases

11. Where by a disposition made on or after the first appointed day an interest in land is compulsorily acquired by, or is sold to, an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers, other than the Commission, and the compensation or purchase price includes an amount in respect of severance of the land comprised in the acquisition or sale from other land or in respect of other land as being injuriously affected, the acquiring authority shall serve notice on the Commission under this paragraph.

3. For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, the standard number of therms of a Gas Board shall be taken to be the number certified by the Board to be, in their estimation, the total number of therms in the gas supplied by them in the year 1957-58 to consumers in their area less one-half the number of therms in any gas purchased by the Board in that year.

4. —(1) For each year each Gas Board shall—

(a) estimate the number representing the total number of therms supplied by the Board or the Gas Council in the penultimate year to consumers in the Board's area less one-half the number of therms in any gas purchased by the Board in the penultimate year otherwise than from the Gas Council; and

(b) calculate and certify the amount by which that estimated

number exceeds, or falls short of, the Board's standard number of therms;

and the Board's basic total of rateable values shall be adjusted for that year by multiplying it by the fraction of which the numerator is the Board's standard number of therms increased by one-fifth of the said excess or, as the case may be, decreased by one-fifth of the said deficiency, and the denominator is the Board's standard number of therms.

(2) For the purposes of the foregoing sub-paragraph, gas purchased by the Gas Council from any person other than a Gas Board shall be treated as having been purchased by the Gas Boards in the respective quantities settled by a scheme or schemes made from time to time by the Gas Council and approved by the Minister of Power.

5. —(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) of this paragraph and to section 33(5) of this Act, a Gas Board’s basic total of rateable values, as adjusted for any year under paragraph 4 of this Schedule, shall be apportioned in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for that year among all the rating areas in which in the penultimate year any therms were supplied to consumers, or were manufactured, or were produced by such an application of such a process as is mentioned in section 33(3)(6) of this Act, either by the Board or, in the Board's area, by the Gas Council.

(2) The proportion of the adjusted total aforesaid to be allocated under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph to any one rating area

350

Ch. 9

General Rate Act 1967

Sch. 6 shall be ascertained by multiplying that adjusted total by the fraction of which—

(a) the numerator is the number of therms supplied to consumers

in that rating area by the Board or, in the Board's area, by the Gas Council in the penultimate year, as estimated and certified by the Board, plus nine-tenths of the number of therms, if any, manufactured, or produced by such an application of such a process as aforesaid, in that rating area by the Board or, in the Board's area, by the Gas Council in the penultimate year, as so estimated and certified; and

(b) the denominator is the total number of therms supplied to consumers in the Board's area by the Board or the Gas Council in the penultimate year, as so estimated and certified, plus nine-tenths of the total number of therms manufactured, or produced by such an application of such a process as aforesaid, in the Board’s area by the Board or the Gas Council in the penultimate year, as so estimated and certified.

(3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the number of therms produced by such an application of such a process as aforesaid shall be taken to be half the actual number thereof.

(4) Subject to paragraph 14 of this Schedule, the Minister may by order provide that the adjusted total aforesaid shall, in the case of all Gas Boards or any Gas Board specified by the order, instead of being apportioned and allocated as provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, be apportioned and allocated as provided by the order.

6. The amount which, in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Schedule, is allocated for any year to a rating area in the case of any Gas Board shall be the rateable value of the hereditament which, by virtue of section 33(3) of this Act, that Board are to be treated as occupying in that area for any rate period consisting of or forming part of that year.

10. Where the valuation officer notifies the amount of a rateable value to the rating authority in respect of a Gas Board in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Schedule—

(a) the rating authority, in making and levying any rate for a

rate period to which the notification relates, shall include the Gas Board as the occupier of a hereditament of that rateable value; and

(b) the valuation officer, at or as soon as may be after the beginning of the year consisting of or comprising any such rate period, shall cause such alterations (if any) to be made in the valuation list as may be requisite for showing the Gas Board in the list as the occupier of a hereditament of that rateable value; and if any such alteration is made after the beginning of the year, it shall be treated as having been made at the beginning of the year:

Provided that, if the year referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph is a year beginning with the date on which a new valuation list comes into force, that sub-paragraph shall not apply, but the valuation officer shall include the Gas Board in the list as the occupier of a hereditament of the said rateable value.

11. —(1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect, in the case of a Gas Board, where gas is manufactured by the Board, or in the Board's area by the Gas Council, in a gasworks which is situated partly in one rating area and partly in one or more other rating areas.

Rateable value of notional hereditament

1. The rateable value for any year of the hereditament which, by virtue of section 34(3) of this Act, an Electricity Board are to be treated as occupying in any rating area shall be the value of the distribution activities of the Board for that area and year increased, in the case of a Board carrying on generating activities in the area, by the value for that area and year of the generating activities of the Board.

Valuation of activities

2. —(1) The value of an Electricity Board's distribution or generating activities for a rating area shall be an apportioned part of the aggregate value of the Board’s distribution or, as the case may be, generating activities, and, subject to sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the apportionment shall be made—

(a) in the case of distribution activities, by reference to the

aggregate net annual value of the rating area, or so much thereof as is comprised in the area of the Board, and of the area of the Board;

(b) in the case of generating activities, by reference to the generating capacity of the Board in the rating area and the aggregate generating capacity of the Board.

(2) Subject to paragraph 16 of this Schedule, the Minister may by order provide that the apportionment required by sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, shall in the case of all Electricity Boards or any Electricity Boaid specified by the order, instead of being made as provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of that sub-paragraph, be made as provided by the order.

Determination of aggregate value of activities

3. —(1) In the case of the Generating Board, the aggregate value of the generating and distribution activities of the Board for any year shall each be taken to be one half of the Board's basic value for that

year:

Provided that, subject to paragraph 16 of this Schedule, the Minister may by order provide that the foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph shall have effect as if for the reference to one half there were substituted references to such other fractions as may be specified by the order in relation to the Board's generating activities and distribution activities respectively.

ing Board the same proportion as the aggregate generating capacity of the Area Board bears to the aggregate generating capacity of the Generating Board;

(b) the aggregate value of the distribution activities of the Area Board shall be taken to be the Board’s basic value for the year reduced, in the case of a Board carrying on generating activities, by the aggregate value of the generating activities.

Determination of Board’s basic value

4. The basic value of an Electricity Board for any year shall be their share of the basic electricity rateable value determined in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Schedule adjusted as mentioned in paragraph 6 of this Schedule by reference to the excess or deficiency of the Board’s output, as calculated and certified by the Board, in die twelve months ending with 31st December falling next but one before the beginning of the year for which the basic value is being ascertained, as compared with the Board's standard output

5. —-(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the basic electricity rateable value shall be taken to be £47,212,610; and the share thereof of each respectively of the Electricity Boards set out in the following table shall be the percentage of that sum so set out in relation to that Board.

(a) the average of the mean (adjusted, in a case in which

subsection (2) below applies, in accordance with that subsection, or in a case in which subsection (3) below applies, in accordance with both subsections) of the quotations for securities of that class appearing in the said List on each of the relevant days falling within the period during which they were so quoted; or

(b) the average of the mean (adjusted, in either such case

as aforesaid, in manner aforesaid) of the quotations for securities of that class appearing in the said List on each of the relevant days in the said six months;

whichever is the higher, such addition, if any, being made to the higher average as is necessary to make it a complete multiple of one penny.

(2) Where, in the case of securities of a class whose value falls to be determined under this section, a fresh issue of securities of that class has been made before the end of the last of the relevant days, each mean of the quotations for securities of that class appearing in the said List on a relevant day before the issue is made that falls to be brought into computation under the foregoing subsection shall be adjusted by multiplying it—

(a) in a case in which the fresh issue was made for payment,

by the quotient derived by dividing the number ascertained under subsection (4) below with reference to securities of that class by that referred to in paragraph

(o)(i) of that subsection;

(b) in a case in which the fresh issue was free, by the re-

ciprocal of the number of times by which the nominal value of the aggregate of the securities of that class before the fresh issue is increased by reason of that issue.

(ii) the product obtained by multiplying the number that expresses in shillings (correct to five places of decimals) the price at which the freshly issued securities are issued by the nominal value of the aggregate of the securities freshly issued expressed as a fraction of the nominal value of the aggregate of the existing securities; by

(b) the number of times by which the nominal value of the

aggregate of the securities of the class in question before the fresh issue is increased by reason of that issue.

(5) Where, in the case of securities of any class whose value would, apart from this subsection, fall to be ascertained under the foregoing provisions of this section, there has been, at any time after the last of the relevant days, a fresh issue of securities of that class, the value of every security of that class for the purposes of the last foregoing section shall (subject to the next following subsection) instead of being ascertained under the said provisions, be deemed to be the average of the values of all the securities of that class calculated on the basis that—

(a) the value of each of the securities comprised in that

issue is the price at which it was issued or, if it was issued free, is nil; and

(b) the value of the remaining securities is that which they

had or would have had for the purposes of this section immediately before the issue took place.

Ch. 17

(b) the last foregoing subsection shall apply to any fresh issue of securities which have been converted as aforesaid* but if a part only of a class of securities has been converted as aforesaid, the converted securities shall* for the purposes of that subsection* be treated as securities of a different class from that of the unconverted securities.

(7) Where a new class of securities has been issued after the last of the relevant days* the value of securities of that class for the purposes of the last foregoing section—

(a) except in a case falling within the following paragraph.

shall be deemed to be the price at which they were issued or, if they were issued free* shall be deemed to be nil;

(b) in a case in which they consist in shares issued in con-

sideration of the extinguishment of an equivalent number of shares in another company (being one specified in Schedule 1 to this Act) which is effected by virtue of a compromise or arrangement sanctioned under section 206 (power to compromise with creditors and members) of the Companies Act 1948 by the court* being a compromise or arrangement whose effect is that that company becomes a subsidiary of the company by whom the shares are issued, shall be deemed—

(i) in a case in which the shares extinguished do not constitute the whole of a class* to be (except in a case in which, after the compromise or arrangement takes effect, a fresh issue of shares of that class is made) the same as that of shares of that class* and (in the said excepted case) what the value of shares of that class would have been had the fresh issue not been made (no regard being had* in either event, to any conversion, after the compromise or arrangement, into shares of a different nominal value of shares of that class);

(ii) in a case in which the shares extinguished constitute the whole of a class, to be what the value of shares of that class would have been had they

holder thereof; or

(b) the price received by the company for the security

plus an amount equal to two and a half per cent, of that price; whichever is the lower.

Payments of dividends and interest pending transfer

18.—(1) Where any company specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967 has without the approval of the Minister made, in pursuance of an authority or recommendation contained in a resolution of the directors of the company passed after 30th April 1965, and before the date of transfer, payments of interest or dividend (other than payments by way of capital or special dividend) on any of its securities in respect of the last complete financial year before the said day or any subsequent period before the date of transfer, being payments which, regard being had to any interest or interim dividend paid before the said day in respect of that year or period, are in excess of the payments of interest or dividend permitted under this section, all persons who were directors of the company at the time when the resolution of the directors was passed authorising or recommending the payments shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be liable to pay to the Corporation an amount equal to the total amount of the excess.

(2) The payments of interest or dividend permitted under this section are as follows

(a) in the case of securities forming part of the loan capital of the company, payments of interest at the minimum rate required to prevent the company from committing any default in respect of its obligations to the holders of the securities;

(i) if the securities fall in the class, or in one of the classes, which ranks or rank lowest in order of priority for payment of dividend (in this section referred to as “ ordinary shares ”), payments of dividend at the rate, calculated as an annual rate, paid (otherwise than as a capital or special dividend) on that class of securities in respect of the last financial year in respect of which a final dividend was paid before 30th April 1965 or, in the case of a class of securities on which a final dividend was never paid before the said day, at such rate as the Minister may approve for the purposes of this section;

(ii) if the securities fall in a class ranking for dividend in priority to the ordinary shares, payments of dividend at the minimum rate required to enable, in accordance with the constitution of the company and

534

Ch. 17

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Sch. 4

the rights attaching to the various classes of securities, the permitted payments of dividend to be made on the ordinary shares:

Provided that such payments of dividend shall only be made out of the net revenue of the company for the period in respect of which they are made, as certified by the auditor or one of the auditors of the company, or out of any funds or reserves applicable in accordance with the normal practice for the purpose of maintaining or equalising rates of dividend, and no payment of dividend made otherwise than out of that revenue or out of those funds or reserves shall be permitted under this section, so, however, that this proviso shall not be taken as preventing the payment out of the net revenue for any period (as so certified) of the permitted dividend on any securities mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii) hereof notwithstanding that the payment or a part thereof is attributable to an earlier period, if the payment is made by virtue of cumulative rights attaching to the securities.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the last preceding subsection the Minister may—

(b) in the case of any securities which after the said day were issued at a price below the market value thereof or were issued free, direct that the payments of interest or dividend thereon permitted under this section shall be less than those which would otherwise be permitted or that no such payments shall be permitted.

(6) Any claim under this section by the Corporation against the directors of any such company as aforesaid shall be made within twelve months after the date of transfer, and, if so made and not settled by agreement, shall be determined by arbitration under this Act, and, if the arbitration tribunal decide the claim in favour of the Corporation, they shall make such orders against all or any of the said directors in respect of their liability on the claim as the tribunal think just, having regard to all the circumstances.

(7) References in this and the next following section to any payments of interest or dividend made or permitted to be made by any

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Ch. 17

535

company shall be construed as references to the gross amounts of those payments, that is to say, to the amounts thereof before any deduction is made therefrom in respect of income tax, and, if any such payment has been made by a company without deduction of income tax, the amount paid shall be deemed for the purposes of this and the next following section to be a net amount paid after deduction of income tax, and the gross amount of that payment for the purposes of this section shall be calculated accordingly:

Provided that, in determining the amount recoverable under this section from the directors of any company in respect of payments of interest or dividend made by that company, there shall be deducted from the amount which would, but for this proviso, be so recoverable a sum equal to the income tax chargeable on that amount at the standard rate for the year in which the payments became due.

19.—(1) A company specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967 shall make the following payments as soon as possible after the date of transfer to the persons who immediately before that date were holders of securities of the company in respect of which compensation is payable under Part II of the Iron and Steel Act 1967: —

(a) interest payments on any securities forming part of the loan capital of the company, which have accrued up to the date of transfer and have not been paid, at the rates permitted under the last preceding section or, if rates in excess of those rates have been approved for the purposes of subsection (1) of that section, at the highest rates so approved; and

(b) subject to the next following subsection, payments of dividend for the final financial period on any other securities of the company at the maximum rates permitted under that section or, if rates in excess of those rates have been approved for the purposes of subsection (1) of that section, at the highest rates so approved;

and for the purpose of any such payments the statutory or other provisions relating to the company shall be deemed to permit payments of interest or dividend in respect of the final financial period.

(2) The payments required to be made by a company under paragraph (b) of the preceding subsection shall not exceed the aggregate of—

(a) the amount certified by the auditor or one of the auditors of the company to be the net revenue of the company for the final financial period, less the total amounts paid by the company before the date of transfer by way of interim dividend on any securities mentioned in that paragraph in respect of the final financial period, and less the total amounts of the payments mentioned in paragraph (a) of the preceding subsection, in so far as those amounts would not otherwise be deducted in calculating the said net revenue of the company for the final financial period; and

Sch. 4

536

Ch. 17

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Sch. 4 (b) the amount of any funds or reserves possessed by the com-

pany at the date of transfer and applicable in accordance with the normal practice for the purpose of maintaining or equalising rates of dividend;

and if the aggregate of those amounts is insufficient to enable all the said payments to be made in full, the payments shall be made in the proper order of priority and according to the respective rights attaching to the securities in question.

(3) In this section, the expression “ final financial period ” means such part of the financial year during which the date of transfer occurs as precedes that date :

Provided that where, in the case of a company, the accounts thereof in respect of the last complete financial year before the date of transfer have not been laid before the company in general meeting before that date, the said expression means that year together with such part of the financial year during which the date of transfer occurs as precedes that date.

20.—(1) Where it appears to the Minister that any company not specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967 operates or owns the whole, or a substantial or essential part, of works used for the carrying on of any iron and steel activities, being works which were, on or at any time after 4th November 1964, operated or owned, as the case may be, by a company specified in the said First Schedule or by a subsidiary of a company so specified, the Minister may, at any time before the general date of transfer or within the period of three months beginning with that date, serve on the first-mentioned company a notice (in this section referred to as a “ notice of acquisition ”) stating that, subject to the following provisions of this section, the securities of the company will be transferred to the Corporation in like manner as the securities of the companies specified in the said First Schedule:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply in a case where the Minister has approved in writing for the purposes of this subsection, either before or after they were effected, all transactions entered into after the said day resulting directly or indirectly in the transfer or grant to the first-mentioned company of rights of ownership in, or rights in respect of the user of, any of the said works which were operated or owned by the company specified in the said First Schedule or, as the case may be, by the subsidiary, and the Minister undertook that the powers conferred by this subsection would not be used in relation to those works.

(2) Where it appears to the Minister—

(a) that the membership of any company not specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967 was, on 4th November 1964, such that, if it remained unchanged, the company would come or would have come into public ownership under Part II of that Act; and

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Ch. 17

537

(b) that since the said day the membership of the company has Sch. 4 changed in such a way as to prevent (but for this provision) the company coming into public ownership under Part II of that Act;

the Minister may, at any time before the general date of transfer or within the period of three months beginning with that date, serve on the company a notice (in this section referred to as a "'notice of acquisition") stating that, subject to the following provisions of this section, the securities of the company will be transferred to the Corporation in like manner as the securities of the companies specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply in a case where the Minister has approved in writing for the purposes of this subsection, either generally or specially, the changes in the membership of the company since the said day.

For the purposes of this subsection, where any share in a company held by any person as a nominee of another company ceases to be held by him as the nominee of that company, there shall be deemed to have been a change in the membership of the first-mentioned company.

(3) A company on which a notice of acquisition has been served under this section may, within one month after the service of the notice of acquisition, serve a notice on the Minister contending that the company does not operate or own the whole, or a substantial or essential part, of works which fulfil the conditions specified in subsection (1) or, as the case may be, that the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) of this section are not fulfilled with respect to the company, and the notice shall set out the grounds of that contention.

(4) Where a notice is served on the Minister under the last preceding subsection, and neither that notice nor the notice of acquisition is withdrawn, the question whether the contention of the company is correct shall be determined by arbitration under this Act, and on any such arbitration the arbitration tribunal shall, if they are satisfied that the contention of the company is correct, revoke the notice of acquisition but shall otherwise confirm it.

(5) Every notice of acquisition shall specify a date (not being earlier than the general date of transfer and not being earlier than the expiration of three months after the service of the notice) which, subject as hereinafter provided, shall be the date of transfer in relation to the company on which the notice is served:

Provided that—

(a) the Minister and the company may by agreement substi-

tute another date for the date specified as aforesaid;

(b) where a reference to arbitration is made under the preceding provisions of this section and the arbitration tribunal confirm the notice, the date of transfer shall be the date specified as aforesaid or a date substituted by agreement

538

Ch. 17

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Sch. 4

as aforesaid or a date two months after the decision of the arbitration tribunal, whichever is the latest date.

(6) Where a notice of acquisition is served on a company under this section and is not withdrawn or revoked, the securities of the company shall, on the date of transfer in relation to the company, vest in the Corporation (except any created as collateral security for a loan to it, which shall be cancelled as from that date), and the provisions (other than this section) of this Part of this Act revived by the Iron and Steel Act 1967, shall apply, and be deemed always to have applied, to the company as they apply to the companies specified in the First Schedule to that Act.

(7) When a notice of acquisition has been served on a company under this section and either the period within which the company may serve a notice under subsection (3) of this section has expired without such a notice being served or the question whether or not the notice is to have effect has been finally settled in favour of the Minister, the company shall forthwith give notice to every holder of its securities of the fact that its securities are to be acquired by the Corporation; and the notice shall, in the case of security holders whose names are entered in any register kept by or on behalf of the company, be given in the same manner as the company gives notice to its members of its general meetings and shall, in any other case, be given by advertisement or in any way allowed by the company's articles of association for giving notice to its members.

21.—(1) Where it appears to the Minister that any company specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967 does not fulfil the following condition, namely, that it or a subsidiary of it operates or owns the whole, or a substantial or essential part, of works used for the carrying on of any iron and steel activities, he may, at any time before the general date of transfer, serve a notice on the company stating that, subject to the following provisions of this section, the securities of the company will not vest in the Corporation by virtue of that Act.

(2) A company on which a notice has been served under this section may, within one month after the service of the notice, serve a notice on the Minister contending that the condition specified in the preceding subsection was fulfilled with respect to the company on the date of the service of the notice by the Minister.

(3) Where a notice is served on the Minister under the last preceding subsection, and neither that notice nor the notice of the Minister is withdrawn, the question whether the said condition was fulfilled with respect to the company on the said date shall be determined by arbitration under this Act, and on any such arbitration the arbitration tribunal shall, if they are satisfied that the contention of the company is correct, revoke the notice of the Minister but shall otherwise confirm it.

(4) Where a notice has been served by the Minister as aforesaid on any company, no transfer of the securities of the company shall take place by virtue of the Iron and Steel Act 1967 during the

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Ch. 17

period within which a notice may be served by the company under subsection (2) hereof or, if such a notice has been served by the company, pending the final settlement of the question whether or not the Minister’s notice is to have effect, and, if the Minister withdraws his notice or the arbitration tribunal revoke the notice of the Minister, and, but for this subsection, the said transfer of securities would have already taken place or would take place less than two months after the date of the withdrawal or, as the case may be, the decision of the arbitration tribunal, the date of transfer shall be a date two months after the date of the withdrawal or decision.

(5) Where a notice is served on a company under this section and is not withdrawn or revoked, the Iron and Steel Act 1967 and this Act shall have effect, and be deemed always to have had effect, as if the company had never been specified in the First Schedule to the said Act of 1967, but without prejudice to the operation of the last preceding section or either of the next two following sections in relation to any works which were owned or operated by the company or its subsidiary, as the case may be, on or after 4th November 1964, and ceased to be so owned or operated before the service of the said notice.

(6) When a notice has been served on a company under this section by the Minister and either the period within which the company may serve a notice under subsection (2) of this section has expired without such a notice being served or the question whether or not the Minister’s notice is to have effect has been finally settled in favour of the Minister, the effect of the latter notice shall be published in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes, and the company shall give the like notice thereof to the holders of its securities as in the case of a notice of acquisition under the last preceding section.

22.—(1) It shall not be lawful—

(a) for any company specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967 or any subsidiary of a company so specified, at any time before the date of transfer, to enter into any transaction transferring or granting to any person any rights of ownership in, or rights in respect of the user of, any works or part of any works used for the carrying on of any iron and steel activities;

(6) for any other company which has acquired any rights of ownership in, or any rights in respect of the user of, any works or part of any works which, on or at any time after 4th November 1964, were operated or owned by a company so specified or a subsidiary of a company so specified, and were used for the carrying on of any such activities, to enter into any transaction transferring or granting to any person any rights of ownership in those works or any part thereof, or any rights in respect of the user of those works or any part thereof, at any time before the general date of transfer or within the period of three months beginning with that date or, if a notice of acquisition is served under the last but one preceding section on the company, at any time

before the date of transfer of that company or, if the notice is withdrawn or revoked, the date of such withdrawal or revocation;

and any transaction purporting to effect such a transfer or grant shall accordingly be void:

Provided that this section shall not apply to any transfer or grant approved in writing for the purposes of this section by the Minister, either generally or specially, and the Minister may approve such a transfer or grant after it has been made and in that case the transfer or grant shall be deemed always to have been valid, but such approval may be given subject to conditions including conditions enabling the Corporation to require the transfer, surrender or grant of rights in respect of the works or part of the works in question either to themselves or to a publicly-owned company.

(2) Any question whether any transaction is rendered void by the preceding subsection shall, unless settled by agreement between the Corporation and the parties to the transaction and the parties to any subsequent transaction relating to the same works, be determined by arbitration under this Act between the Corporation and those parties, and any proceedings for the determination thereof shall be commenced within twelve months after the date of transfer or (if the company concerned has no date of transfer) the general date of transfer, and, if such proceedings are not commenced within that period, the transaction shall, subject to any such agreement as aforesaid, be deemed to be a valid transaction so far as this section is concerned.

(3) If the Corporation suffer damage by reason of any transaction which is unlawful by virtue of subsection (1) of this section, the Corporation may, at any time within twelve months after the date of transfer or (if the company has no date of transfer) the general date of transfer, make an application to the arbitration tribunal, and all parties to the transaction and all persons who were directors of the company at the time when the transaction was entered into shall, unless the tribunal otherwise direct, be made parties to the application; and if the tribunal are satisfied that the Corporation has suffered such damage, they shall make such orders against any of the parties to the application as they think just, having regard to the extent to which those parties were respectively responsible for the transaction or benefited from it and to all the circumstances of the case, for the payment by them to the Corporation of sums sufficient to enable the loss, or such part thereof as the tribunal think just, to be made good:

Provided that, in the case of any transaction entered into in pursuance of a resolution of the directors, no person who was not a director at the time when the resolution authorising or recommending the transaction was passed, shall, by reason of his directorship, be made a party to the application.

Provided that, in the case of a company other than a company specified in the First Schedule to the Iron and Steel Act 1967, the tribunal shall not make an order under this subsection against any director of the company or other person who satisfies the tribunal that he did not know and could not reasonably have expected that the company would come into public ownership under Part II of the Iron and Steel Act 1967 or this Part of this Act.

(2) The serving of a notice of acquisition under section twenty-three of this Act in relation to any property or rights shall not prejudice the taking of proceedings under either of the two last preceding sections with respect to any transaction relating to that property or those rights, and any such proceedings and any proceedings pursuant to the notice may, if the arbitration tribunal think fit. be heard together, and any sums ordered by the tribunal in the proceedings under either of the two last preceding sections to be paid by any person may, if the tribunal think fit, be set off against any compensation, payable to that person in the proceedings pursuant to the notice.

(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the Corporation or a publicly-owned company from taking part together with other employers or organisations of employers in the establishment and maintenance of machinery for the settlement of terms and conditions of employment and the promotion and encouragement of measures affecting the safety, health and welfare of persons employed by them and the discussion of other matters of mutual interest to them and persons employed by them.

(b) for the establishment and administration of pension schemes and pension funds for the purposes of the preceding paragraph, for the continuance, amendment, repeal or revocation of existing pension schemes relating to the like purposes (whatever the date on which they came into force) and of enactments relating thereto and of trust deeds, rules or other instruments made for the purposes thereof, for the transfer in whole or in part, or for the extinguishment, of liabilities under any such existing pension schemes, and for the transfer in whole or in part, or winding up, of pension funds held for the purposes of any such existing pension schemes, so, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as authorising the diversion of any such funds to purposes other than those of the proceeding paragraph;

(c) for making any provision consequential on any such provision as aforesaid including provision for the dissolution or winding up of bodies, whether incorporated or not, the continued existence whereof is unnecessary having regard to the regulations.

(2) Where provision is made by any such regulations for the amendment, repeal or revocation of any existing pension scheme or of any enactment relating thereto or any trust deed, rules or other instrument made for the purposes thereof, or for the transfer or extinguishment of any liability under any pension scheme or for the transfer or winding up of any pension fund held for the purposes of any such scheme, the regulations shall be so framed as to secure that persons having pension rights under the scheme, whether such persons as are mentioned in paragraph (a) of the preceding subsection or not, are not placed in any worse position by reason of the amendment, repeal, revocation, transfer, extinguishment or winding up :

Provided that this subsection shall have effect subject to such limitations as the Minister may by regulations prescribe for meeting cases in which, in connection with any provision made by the Iron and Steel Act 1967 or this Act, or in anticipation of the making of any provision by the said Act of 1967, pension rights have been created otherwise than in the ordinary course.

(3) Regulations made under this section shall not be invalid by reason that in fact they do not secure that persons having pension rights are not placed in any worse position by reason of any such amendment, repeal, revocation, transfer, extinguishment or winding up as is mentioned in the last preceding subsection, but if the Minister is satisfied or it is determined as hereinafter mentioned that any such regulations have failed to secure that result, the

Iron and Steel Act 1967

Ch. 17

549

(5) Without prejudice to the generality of the preceding provisions of this section, regulations made under this section may contain provisions authorising any person who, being a participant in any pension scheme to which the regulations relate, becomes a member of the Corporation, being treated as if his service as a member of the Corporation were service as an officer of the Corporation, and the pension rights of any such person resulting from the operation of any such provision shall not be affected by any provision of this Act which requires that the pensions, if any, which are to be paid in the case of members of the Corporation are to be determined by the Minister with the approval of the Treasury.

(7) Regulations made under this section may contain such supplementary and consequential provisions as the Minister thinks necessary, including provisions as to the manner in which questions arising under the regulations are to be determined and provisions adapting. modifying or repealing enactments, whether of general or special application.

(8) Regulations made under this section may be made so as to have effect from a date prior to the making thereof, so, however, that so much of any regulations as provides that any provision thereof is to have effect from a date prior to the making thereof shall not place any person other than the Corporation or a publicly-owned company in a worse position than he would have been if the regulations had been made to have effect only as from the date of the making thereof.

41.—(1) The Minister shall by regulations require the payment either by the Corporation or the company, in such cases and to such extent as may be specified in the regulations, of compensation to officers of any company which comes into public ownership under Part II of this Act, being officers who suffer loss of employment or loss or diminution of emoluments or pension rights in consequence of the company becoming a publicly-owned company or of effect being given to conclusions reported under section four of the Iron and Steel Act 1967 to the Minister or a direction given by

(2) Different regulations may be made under this section in relation to different classes of persons, and any such regulations may be so framed as to have effect as from a date prior to the making thereof, so, however, that so much of any regulations as provides that any provision thereof is to have effect as from a date earlier than the making thereof shall not place any person other than the Corporation or any such company in a worse position than he would have been in if the regulations had been made to have effect only as from the date of the making thereof.

(3) Regulations made under this section—

(a) shall prescribe the procedure to be followed in making claims for compensation, and the manner in which and the person by whom the question whether any or what compensation is payable is to be determined; and

(b) shall in particular contain provisions enabling appeals from any determination as to whether any or what compensation is payable to be brought, in such cases and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the regulations, before a tribunal established under section 1964 c. 16. twelve of the Industrial Training Act 1964.

(3) The appropriate Minister shall fix the boundaries of the area having regard primarily to natural conformations, features and boundaries, and only secondarily to the boundaries of the areas of local authorities and other public bodies, or to the boundaries of the area of particular agricultural units or other holdings of the land.

(4) The area may consist of two or more separate tracts of land, and land which is part of the area may totally enclose land which is not.

Procedure for making order

Agriculture Act 1967

Ch. 22

(2) The notice shall—

(a) name one or more places in or near the proposed area

where copies of a draft of the order (including the map) may be inspected,

(b) describe, with such degree of detail as is reasonable in a notice published in a newspaper, the boundaries of the proposed ^area, and

(c) draw attention to the provisions of this Schedule authorising

the making of objections, and specify the time (not being less than twenty-eight days from the first publication of the notice) within which and the manner in which objections can be made.

3. The grounds on which an objection may be made shall be—

(a) that a proposed boundary ought to be altered so as to exclude part of the proposed area on the ground that there are no problems or needs of the kind described in section 45 of this Act in that part of the area, and that there are no other considerations which justify the inclusion of that part,

(b) that a proposed boundary ought to be altered by including an additional area on the ground that there are in it problems or needs of the kind described in section 45 of this Act, or that there are other considerations which justify the inclusion of that additional area,

(c) that a proposed boundary ought to be altered (whether bring-

ing land in or taking it out or both) so as better to conform to natural conformations, features and boundaries,

(d) that land within the proposed area and contiguous to a proposed boundary of that area ought to be excluded because not forming a natural part of a tract of agricultural or forestry land or of land suitable for agricultural or forestry purposes, or that land outside the proposed area and contiguous to a proposed boundary of the area ought to be included for the converse reasons,

(e) that a proposed boundary divides an agricultural unit or other land in one ownership or one occupation,

(/) that a proposed boundary should be adjusted so that land over which access is required to land included in the pro* posed area is also within the proposed area.

4. —(1) If no objection is duly made or if all objections so made are withdrawn, the appropriate Minister may make the proposed order in the form proposed.

(2) If any objection duly made is not withdrawn the Minister shall either cause a public local inquiry to be held or afford to any person by whom any objection has been duly made and not withdrawn an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by* a person appointed by the appropriate Minister for the purpose.

(3) If any person by whom an objection has been made avails himself of the opportunity of being heard the appropriate Minister


712

Ch. 22

Agriculture Act 1967

Sch. 5

shall afford to any other persons to whom it appears to him expedient to afford it an opportunity of being heard on the same

occasion.

(4) After considering any objections duly made and not withdrawn, and the report of the person who held the inquiry or hearing under this paragraph, the appropriate Minister may proceed to make the proposed order and, subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, may make it with such modifications as appear to him expedient.

(5) Except where the appropriate Minister is satisfied that on the inquiry or hearing all persons who might reasonably be expected to require an opportunity of making an objection to the modification have had sufficient notice of the possibility of the modification being made, and of objecting to it, the appropriate Minister shall not make the order with the modification until he has taken such steps as appear to him appropriate for bringing the modification to the notice of those persons and affording them an opportunity of making the objections, and appearing at a local inquiry or hearing, which they would have had if the original proposal had incorporated the modification.

(6) The decision of the appropriate Minister on the question whether an objection falls within paragraph 3 of this Schedule shall be conclusive but he shall give a written notice to the objector of any adverse decision stating the reasons for his decision.

5. As soon as may be after the appropriate Minister has made the order the appropriate Minister shall publish in one or more local newspapers circulating in or near the area specified in the order a notice describing the area, stating that the order has been made and naming a place where a copy of the order (including die map) may be inspected at all reasonable hours.

6.—(1) The appropriate Minister may by order by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament—

(a) vary a Board's area, or

(b) dissolve a Board.

(2) Before making an order under sub-paragraph (l)(a) above the Minister shall comply with the procedure in paragraphs 2 to 5 above, but as if in paragraphs 2 and 3 for references to the proposed boundary of the area there were substituted references to the parts of the boundary as proposed to be altered, and with any other necessary modifications.

(3) An order under tub-paragraph (1 above may contain such consequential and incidental provisions as appear to the Minister expedient, including provisions for the disposal of the property of the dissolved Board, and transitional provisions in respect of anything done by the Board before its dissolution.

(3) The rate so specified shall be such as appears to the Minister, after consultation with such recipient authorities, or such bodies representative of recipient authorities, as appear to him to be appropriate, to be representative of the rates of interest paid on loans raised (including any sums borrowed by way of temporary loan) by recipient authorities in the financial year immediately preceding that in which the dwellings in question were completed; and different rates may be so specified in relation to different classes of recipient authority, and for that purpose the Greater London Council and the Commission for the New Towns may each either be treated as a class of recipient authorities or be included in any class of other recipient authorities.

(6) Any apportionment of cost necessary to arrive at the approved cost of any dwelling shall be made in such manner as the Minister may determine.

ground that otherwise the cost to the recipient authority of providing dwellings on the site would, in the opinion of the Minister, be unduly high in the circumstances of the case.

(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment

for a term not exceeding twelve months or both.

(3) A person shall not be convicted under this section of being in charge of a motor vehicle if he proves that at the material time the circumstances were such that there was no likelihood of his driving it so long as there was any probability of his having alcohol in his blood in a proportion exceeding the prescribed limit.

(4) In determining for the purposes of the last foregoing subsection the likelihood of a person's driving a motor vehicle when he is injured or the vehicle is damaged, the jury, in the case of proceedings on indictment, may be directed to disregard, and the court in any other case may disregard, the fact that he had been injured or that the vehicle had been damaged.

(5) Section 6(2)(ii) of the principal Act (which includes as an ingredient of a defence on a prosecution of being in charge of a motor vehicle the need to prove that the accused had not driven the vehicle between becoming impaired and the material time) shall cease to have effect

Road Safety Act 1967

Ch. 30

817

made or, if the constable thinks fit, at a police station specified by the constable;

(b) in the said excepted case, at the hospital;

but a person shall not be required to provide such a specimen while at a hospital as a patient if the medical practitioner in immediate charge of his case is not first notified of the proposal to make the requirement or objects to the provision of a specimen on the ground that its provision or the requirement to provide it would be prejudicial to the proper care or treatment of the patient

3. The relief provided by this Article for one of the parties shall not include the avoidance of the contract under some other provision of the present Law or deprive the other party of any right which he has under the present Law to reduce the price, unless the circumstances which entitled the first party to relief were caused by the act of the other party or of some person for whose conduct he was responsible.

[14th July 1967]

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) Where by virtue of a reference to the National Board Power to for Prices and Incomes under section 2(1) or (3) of the Prices extend periods and Incomes Act 1966 either— Cnder^ H

(a) an increase of prices or charges is forbidden by section of Prices and 7(3 )(b)or section 8(2) of that Act; or Act°l%6

(b) the implementation of an award or settlement relating to 1966 terms or conditions of employment is forbidden by section 14(6)(6) or section 15(2) of that Act;

and, before it ceases to be so forbidden, a report of the Board on the reference is published with a recommendation adverse in any respect to the increase of the prices or charges or to the implementation of the award or settlement, then for the period and to the extent provided for by this section the standstill provision (that is to say, the relevant provision of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) above) shall continue to apply as it applied up to the date of publication of the report.

(2) The standstill provision shall continue to apply (subject as hereinafter provided)—

(a) for a period ending ten days after the date of publication of the Board’s report and, if within that period the Secretary of State gives notice of a proposal to make

1052

Ch. 53

Prices and Incomes Act 1967

an order under paragraph (b) below, then for a period ending thirty days after the date of publication of the report; and

(b) if, after giving notice as aforesaid and before the end of those thirty days, the Secretary of State by order so directs, then for a further period extending until the expiration of the six months beginning with the date of publication of the reference to the Board or until such earlier time as may be specified in the order.

(3) The provisions of the Schedule to this Act shall have effect to regulate the extent to which the standstill provision is in any case to apply by virtue of this section, and other matters in connection with the operation of this section.

1966 c. 33.

2.—-(1) Where section 8 of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 is applied to any prices or charges, or section 15 of that Act is applied to an award or settlement, the direction applying the section may provide that it shall apply in relation to those prices or charges, or to that award or settlement, by reference to a specified date not more than three months before the date of publication of the direction; and, if the direction does so provide, then Part II of that Act together with section 1 of this Act shall, in relation to the direction and in relation to matters arising therefrom, have effect as if—

(a) in the case of a direction applying section 8 to any prices

or charges, increases in those prices or charges made in the interval between the specified date and the coming into force of the direction had not been made; and

(b) in the case of a direction applying section 15 to an award

or settlement, the award or settlement had not been implemented in that interval.

(2) Where a direction applying section 8 or section 15 of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 makes provision in accordance with subsection (1) above,—

(a) the notice giving the direction shall be published in the

Gazette, but so much of section 8(1) or 15(1) as requires it to be published in the same issue as the text of the reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes shall not apply (and accordingly a direction may be given in connection with a reference published before die coming into force of this section or the passing of this Act);

(b) the direction may be given so as to come into force on a

date after that on which the notice giving the direction is published;

(c) section l(2)(b) above shall have effect with the substitution

of the six months beginning with the date when the

Prices and Incomes Act 1967

Ch. 53

1053

direction comes into force for the six months beginning with the date of publication of the reference.

3.—(1) Where— Imposition of

(a) on a reference to the National Board for Prices and p^l0nfter

Incomes under section 2(1) or (3) of the Prices and Board’s Incomes Act 1966 a report of the Board contains report, a recommendation adverse in any respect to an increase 1966 c. 33. of prices or charges or to the implementation of an award or settlement (being a matter to which the reference related), but the standstill provisions referred to in section 1(1) above did not at any time apply to forbid the increase or implementation; and

(b) it appears to the Secretary of State that (before or after publication of the report) there has been an increase of prices or charges, or implementation of the award or settlement, which does not accord with the recommendation of the Board;

then, subject to the provisions of this section, the Secretary of State may by order provide, as respects any prices or charges or any award or settlement to which the reference related, for section 8(2) or 15(2) of that Act to apply for a period not exceeding three months (beginning with the date of the order or a later date) as it would have applied, up to the date of publication of the Board’s report, by virtue of a direction duly given before that date.

(2) An order shall not be made under subsection (1) above in consequence of a report of the Board, if the report was not published by a date within three months from the publication of the reference to the Board under section 2(1) of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 (whether or not varied under section 2(3)), nor shall an order be made as aforesaid more than six months after the date of publication of that reference; but this section shall apply notwithstanding that the Board’s report was made, or the relevant increase of prices or charges or implementation of the award or settlement took place, before the coming into force of this section or the passing of this Act.

(3) Where an order is made under subsection (1) above, the relevant provisions of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 shall, for purposes of the order and matters arising therefrom, have effect as if—

(a) in the case of an order applying section 8(2) to any prices or charges, increases in those prices or charges made in the interval between the day preceding die publication of the reference to the Board and the time from which section 8(2) is applied had not been made; and

1966 c. 33.

Modification

or

clarification of certain provisions of Prices and Incomes Act 1966.

(b) in the case of an order applying section 15(2) to an award or settlement, the award or settlement had not been implemented in that interval.

(4) Before making an order under subsection (1) above the Secretary of State shall give notice of the proposal to make it; and the provisions of the Schedule to this Act shall have effect to regulate the extent to which section 8(2) or 15(2) of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 is in any case to apply by virtue of this section, and other matters in connection with the operation of this section.

4.—(1) Section 16 of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 (which relates to the enforcement of Part II as regards terms and conditions of employment) shall have effect—

(a) as if at the end of subsection (1) there were added the words “ or (after the implementation is forbidden) to implement it in respect of employment at a time before the implementation is forbidden ”; and (b) as if accordingly in subsection (4) for the words “ to implement an award or settlement in respect of employment at a time when implementation of that award or settlement is forbidden under the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Act ” there were substituted the words “ to implement an award or settlement in contravention of subsection (1) above and in subsection (6) of that section (under which prohibitions imposed by the section are to be treated as irrelevant for the purposes of civil proceedings in Scotland) for the words “ by this section ” there shall be substituted the words “ by subsection

(4) above

(2) The effect of Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 in forbidding the implementation of an award or settlement and thereby restricting the remuneration to be paid in respect of employment at any time shall not be to make wholly invalid contracts providing for remuneration in respect of that employment in excess of the remuneration permitted by the restriction, but shall be that, as regards payments due before the coming to an end of the restriction, any contract to pay such remuneration is invalidated so far as relates to the excess (and accordingly does not revive or become enforceable as regards the excess on the coming to an end of the restriction by the lapse of any provision of that Act or otherwise); and sections 28 and 29 of that Act are hereby declared to be of the like effect in restricting the remuneration to be paid for work for any period.

(3) Where section 15(2) or section 28 of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 is or has been made (either expressly or impliedly) to apply in relation to persons employed by or under the Crown, then although the Crown is not thereby made subject to any

Prices and Incomes Act 1967

Ch. 53

1055

obligation, any claims to remuneration by persons so employed and the lawfulness of things done in relation thereto are subject by the operation of section 15(2) or 28, as the case may be, to the like restrictions as if those persons were employees of a private person.

(4) In the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 section 7(3)(a) shall 1966 c. 33. have effect as if after the word “prices ” there were inserted the words “ or charges

5.—(1) Subject to the following subsections, where but for this Protection of provision an agreement entered into between an employer and employers who an employee before the 21st July 1966 would (if given effect paye^SS^d according to its terms) have required the employer to pay to the before July employee for work for any period before July 1967 remuneration 1967. at a higher rate than the basis rate, the agreement shall have, and be deemed to have had, effect subject (as regards work for any such period) to a condition allowing the employer not to pay remuneration at that higher rate if he pays or has paid it at a rate not less than the basis rate nor less, where any enactment as to the minimum remuneration to be paid to any workers is applicable, than the rate necessary for compliance with that enactment.

For this purpose “ the basis rate ” means the rate which was last applied by the employer before the 21st July 1966 in making payments of remuneration to the employee for the same kind of work; and, in the case of remuneration agreed to be paid at a rate varying from time to time, the basis rate shall be the rate as it was for the time being effective when so applied, and “ higher rate ” shall be construed accordingly.

(2) Subject to subsection (5) below, the condition implied under subsection (1) above in any agreement shall be limited to remuneration for periods not exceeding in the aggregate six months; but—

(a) the periods covered by the condition may be either continuous or not, and may include periods before the making of the agreement; and

(b) the aggregate of six months shall be reckoned by including earlier periods to which the higher rate applied under the agreement in preference to later periods, but including only periods for which die employee has not received the remuneration provided for (apart from the condition) by the agreement.

(3) Where subsection (1) above applies to an agreement resulting (if given effect according to its terms) in two or more increases for different periods in the rate of the employee’s remuneration, then the like condition shall be implied in relation to each of the successive rates of remuneration resulting therefrom which exceeds the basis rate (with subsection (2) above applying

Ch. 53

Prices and Incomes Act 1967

separately to each condition so implied); but where any of the successive rates is under the agreement to apply for a fixed period only, and the condition is to be implied in relation to the immediately succeeding rate, then the agreement shall have, and be deemed to have had, effect as if it provided that the earlier rate should, subject (if it is not the basis rate) to the condition implied in relation to it, continue to apply until superseded by payment of the next succeeding rate.

(4) Subject to subsections (5) and (6) below, subsection (1) above (but not subsections (2) and (3)) shall have effect in relation to an agreement entered into on or after the 21st July 1966 and before the 5th June 1967 as it has effect in relation to an agreement entered into before the 21st July 1966, except that the basis rate shall be determined by reference to the rate last applied before the agreement instead of the rate last applied before the 21st July 1966.

(5) Where under an agreement entered into between an employer and an employee before the 21st July 1966 the remuneration to be paid to the employee was, without any further agreement being entered into between them, affected by any provision as to rates of remuneration made by an award or settlement on or after that date, then this section shall have effect in relation to that remuneration as if, so far as relates to any increase in it attributable to that provision, the said agreement were an agreement entered into between the employer and the employee on the date of the award or settlement; and similarly with an agreement entered into before the 5th June 1967 and an award or settlement made on or after that date.

(6) Where under an agreement entered into between an employer and an employee the terms and conditions of the employment were those applicable to other persons working, or who have worked, for the employer on the same kind of work (whether or not the agreement was so expressed), and either—

(a) subsection (1) above, without subsection (4), has or would have had effect to modify the terms and conditions in the case of those other persons but, apart from this provision, subsection (1) above—

(i) would do so in the case of that employee by virtue of subsection (4); or

(ii) would not in his case do so; or

(b) subsection (1) above, together with subsection (4), has or would have had effect to modify the terms and conditions in the case of those other persons but, apart from this provision, subsection (1) above would not in the case of that employee do so;

then subsections (1) to (3) above or, in a case within paragraph (b) above, subsections (1) and (4) shall have effect in relation to that

Prices and Incomes Act 1967

Ch. 53

1057

agreement as they have or would have had effect in relation to the agreements of those other persons, the basis rate being determined accordingly by reference to the remuneration of those persons (or the most nearly comparable of them) instead of the remuneration of that employee:

Provided that for purposes of subsection (2)(6) above as it applies by virtue of this subsection the employee shall be treated as having worked for the employer on the work in question, and having received for it remuneration at the basis rate, throughout the interval between the 20th July 1966 and the earliest date thereafter when he in fact so worked.

. (7) Effect shall be given to the foregoing provisions of this section in legal proceedings begun before the passing of this Act as well as in those begun afterwards; and where in any such proceedings an order, judgment or decree has been made or given which is not in accordance with those provisions, the court by which it was made or given shall, on the application of the person liable thereunder, set it aside in whole or in part and make such further order, if any, as the case requires:

Provided that—

(a) proceedings to have an order, judgment or decree set aside under this subsection shall not be instituted after the end of one month beginning with the date this Act is passed; and

(b) where proceedings were begun before the 5th June 1967, or an order, judgment or decree made in any proceedings has been satisfied in whole or in part before the date this Act is passed, then this subsection shall not apply in relation to those proceedings or any further proceedings by way of appeal or otherwise.

(8) Where for any period an employee’s right to remuneration was subject to a restriction under section 28, 29 or 30 of the

Prices and Incomes Act 1966, then for purposes of subsection 1966 c. 33. (2)(b) above the periods to which the higher rate applied under the agreement with his employer, and the amount of the remuneration provided for by the agreement, shall be determined without regard to the effect of that restriction; but this section shall not be taken to override any such restriction.

(9) This section shall not apply to remuneration for work other than work to be performed wholly or substantially within the United Kingdom or on British ships or aircraft; but where a person employed by or under the Crown has any enforceable claim to remuneration for that employment, this section shall apply as it applies in the case of an employee of a private person.

(10) In subsection (1) above “ enactment ” includes an enactment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared—

(a) that section 270(6) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (classes

of income against which allowances in respect of industrial buildings or structures may be made) applies to allowances under section 274 of that Act (temporary disuse of industrial buildings or structures),

(b) that the reference in section 286 of that Act (allowances

for machinery or plant for part of a year of assessment) to a writing down (or annual) allowance computed in accordance with the preceding provisions of Chapter II of Part X of that Act includes, where relevant, a reference to an allowance computed in accordance with those provisions and section 14 of the Finance Act 1965 (new ships),

(c) that by virtue of section 298(2) of the Income Tax Act

1952 references in Acts passed after that Act to writing down (or annual) allowances in respect of machinery or plant include, except where otherwise expressly provided or where the context otherwise requires, references to allowances under subsection (1) of the said section 298 (allowances for lessors of machinery or plant), and

(d) that section 279(2) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (which

relates to expenditure incurred by a person for the purposes of a trade before he begins to carry it on) applies, where relevant, for the construction of references to the date when expenditure was incurred in subsections (1) and (3) of section 13 of the Finance Act 1965 (withdrawal of initial allowances for cars in respect of expenditure incurred after 6th April 1965).

22.—(1) Any loss incurred in a trade of farming or market gardening shall be excluded from section 341 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (set-off of losses and capital allowances against total income) if in each of the prior five years a loss was incurred in carrying on that trade, and where a loss is so excluded any related capital allowance shall also be excluded from the said section 341.

(2) Any loss incurred in any accounting period by a company in carrying on a trade of farming or market gardening shall be excluded from section 58(2) of the Finance Act 1965 (set-off of losses against total profits) if a loss, computed without regard to capital allowances, was incurred in carrying on that trade in that accounting period, and in each of the chargeable periods wholly or partly comprised in the prior five years.

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not restrict relief for Part III any loss or for any capital allowance, if it is shown by the claimant that the whole of his farming or market gardening activities

in the year next following the prior five years are of such a nature, and carried on in such a way, as would have justified a reasonable expectation of the realisation of profits in the future if they had been undertaken by a competent farmer or market gardener, but that if that farmer or market gardener had undertaken those activities at the beginning of the prior period of loss he could not reasonably have expected the activities to become profitable until after the end of the year next following the prior period of loss.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not restrict relief where the carrying on of the trade forms part of, and is ancillary to, a larger trading undertaking.

(5) In this section—

construed in accordance with section 18(2) of the 1962 c. 44. Finance Act 1962;

“ prior five years ”—

(a) in relation to a loss incurred in a year of assessment, means the last five years of assessment before that year;

(b) in relation to a loss incurred in a company's accounting period, means the last five years before the beginning of the accounting period;

“ prior period of loss ” means the prior five years except that if losses were incurred in the trade in successive years of assessment or chargeable periods amounting in all to a period longer than five years (and ending when the prior five years end), it means that longer period, and in applying this definition to a chargeable period of a company “ losses ” means losses computed without regard to capital allowances;

“ farming ” and “ market gardening ” shall be construed in accordance with the definitions of those terms in section 526 of the Income Tax Act 1952, but as if those definitions were not restricted to activities in the United Kingdom,

and the reference in this section to section 341 of the Income Tax Act 1952 includes a reference to that section as extended

(b) a husband or his wife were the same person as any

company of which either the husband or the wife has control, or of which the two of them have control, and accordingly relief from income tax or from corporation tax may be restricted under this section by reference to losses some of which are incurred in years of assessment and some, computed without regard to capital allowances, are incurred in a company’s chargeable periods.

2. —(1) If for any accounting period ending after the passing of this Act any capital allowances fall to be made to the one company which are to be given by discharge or repayment of tax and arc; to be available primarily against a specified class of income, so much of the amount of those capital allowances (exclusive of any carried forward from an earlier period) as exceeds its income of the relevant class arising in that accounting period (before deduction of any losses of any other period or of any capital allowances) may be set off for purposes of corporation tax against the total profits of the other company for its corresponding accounting period.

(2) In the case of a claim made by a company as a member of a consortium only a fraction of the excess referred to in sub-paragraph

(1) above may be so set off, and that fraction shall be equal to that member’s share in the consortium, subject to any further reduction under paragraph 6(2) of this Schedule.

Expenses of management

Corresponding accounting periods

6. —(1) For the purposes of this Schedule any accounting period of the claimant company which falls wholly or partly within an accounting period of the surrendering company corresponds to that accounting period.

(2) If an accounting period of the surrendering company and a corresponding accounting period of the claimant company do not coincide—

(a) the amount which may be set off against the total profits

of the claimant company for the corresponding accounting

period shall be reduced by applying the fraction g (if that

fraction is less than unity), and

(b) the said profits against which the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) above (as reduced where so required) may be

set off shall be reduced by applying the fraction (if that

fraction is less than unity).

where

“A” is the length of the period common to the two accounting periods,

“ B ” is the length of the accounting period of the surrendering company, and

44 C” is the length of the corresponding accounting period of the claimant company.

Companies joining or leaving group or consortium

8. —(1) This paragraph has effect where on any occasion two companies become or cease to be members of the same group.

(2) For the purposes specified below it shall be assumed as respects each company that on that occasion (unless a true accounting period of the company begins or ends then) an accounting period of the company ends, and a new one begins, the new accounting period to end with the end of the true accounting period (unless before then there is a further break under this sub-paragraph), and—

Sch. 10 (a) that the losses or other amounts of the true accounting

period are apportioned to the component accounting periods on a time basis according to their lengths, and

(b) that the amount of total profits for the true accounting period of the company against which group relief may be allowed in accordance with paragraph 5(1) of this Schedule is also so apportioned to the component accounting periods.

(3) Where the one company is the surrendering company and the other company is the claimant company—

(a) references to accounting periods, to profits, and to losses, allowances, expenses of management or charges on income of the surrendering company, in paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Schedule shall be construed in accordance with sub-para-graph (2) above,

(b) references to accounting periods in paragraphs 6 and 7 of

this Schedule shall be so construed (so that if the two companies are members of the same group in the surrendering company’s accounting period, they must under paragraph 6 also be members of the same group in any corresponding accounting period of the claimant company),

(c) references to profits, and amounts to be set off against the

profits, in the said paragraph 6 shall be so construed (so that an amount apportioned under sub-paragraph (2) above to a component accounting period may fall to be reduced under the said paragraph 6(2)).

(4) This paragraph shall apply with the necessary modifications where a company begins or ceases to fulfil the conditions for relief for a consortium, either as a surrendering company or as a claimant company, as it applies where two companies become or cease to be members of the same group.

(2) In accordance with sub-paragraph (1) above, two or more claimant companies cannot, in respect of any one loss or other amount for which group relief may be given, and whatever their accounting periods corresponding to that of the surrendering company, obtain in all more relief than could be obtained by a single claimant company whose corresponding accounting period coincided with the accounting period of the surrendering company.

(3) If claims for group relief are made by more than one claimant company which relate to the same accounting period of the same surrendering company, and—

(a) all the claims so made are admissible only by virtue of para-

graph 8 above, and

(b) there is a part of the surrendering company’s accounting period during which none of those claimant companies is a member of the same group as the surrendering company.

Finance Act 1967

Ch. 54

(4) If claims for group relief are made by a claimant company as respects more than one surrendering company for group relief to be set off against its total profits for any one accounting period, and—

(a) all the claims so made are admissible only by virtue of paragraph 8 above, and

(b) there is a part of the claimant company’s accounting period during which none of the surrendering companies by reference to which the claims are made is a member of the same group as the claimant company,

the claimant company shall not obtain in all more relief to be set off against its profits for the accounting period than it could obtain on a claim as respects a single surrendering company (with unlimited losses and other amounts eligible for relief) which was not a member of the same group as the claimant company during that part of the claimant company’s accounting period (but was a member during the remainder of that accounting period).

(5) The provisions of this sub-paragraph have effect as respects a claim for group relief made by a company as a member of a consortium, in this sub-paragraph referred to as a “ consortium claim ”—

(a) a consortium claim, and a claim other than a consortium

claim, shall not both have effect as respects the loss or other amount of the same accounting period of the same surrendering company, unless each of the two claims is as respects a loss or other amount apportioned under paragraph 8(2)(<z) above to a component of that accounting period, and the two components do not overlap.

(b) in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) above consortium claims shall be disregarded,

and paragraph (a) above shall take effect according to the order in which claims are made.

(6) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 331(5) of the Income Tax Act 1952, any reference in Part X of that Act 1952 c io to an allowance made includes a reference to an allowance which

would be made but for the granting of group relief, or but for that and but for an insufficiency of profits or other income against which to make it

“ Provided that, where the company and the member receiving the benefit are both resident in the United Kingdom and either the former is a subsidiary of the latter or both are subsidiaries of a third company also so resident (the question whether one body is another’s subsidiary being determined as if for the purposes of section 48(3) of this Act, subject to the modification that a body shall be treated as not being the owner of any share capital which it owns directly if a profit on the sale of the shares would be treated as a trading receipt of that body), the said amount shall not be treated as a distribution.”

(3) After the proviso to paragraph 9(2) of that Schedule (which relates to the provision by close companies of benefits for participators) there shall be inserted the following additional proviso:—

“And provided also that where—

(a) the company and the participator are both resident in

the United Kingdom and one is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of a third company also so resident (the question whether one body is another's subsidiary being determined as if for the purposes of section 48(3) of this Act, subject to the modification that a body shall be treated as not being the owner of any share capital which it owns directly if a profit on the sale of the shares would be treated as a trading receipt of that body), and

(b) the benefit to the participator arises on or in connection with a transfer of assets or liabilities by the company to him or to the company by him,

the said amount shall not be treated as a distribution.”

(4) If any amount would, but for sub-paragraph (2) or (3) above, be treated as, or as part of, a distribution made in or after the year 1966-67 and would as so treated constitute also the net amount of

a relevant distribution within the meaning of section 65 of the Finance 1965 c. 25. Act 1965 (dividend stripping) then, for the purposes of corporation tax in respect of any chargeable gains, that amount shall be treated as if it were a capital distribution (within the meaning of Part HI of the Finance Act 1965) received in respect of the holding.

(5) Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) above shall not affect the meaning of 'distribution' for the purposes of paragraphs 5, 6(1) and 7 of Schedule 17 to the Finance Act 1965 (dividend stripping: relation of distributions to profits), except so far as the said sub-paragraphs

(3) Shares shall be deemed to be beneficially held by the public—

(a) if beneficially held by a company resident in the United Kingdom which is not a close company, or by a company not so resident which would not be a close company if it were so resident, or

(b) if held on trust for a fund or scheme approved under section 379 or section 388 of the Income Tax Act 1952 1952 c. 10. (superannuation funds and retirement schemes), or

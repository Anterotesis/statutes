And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees so pledged as aforesaid, was during the year ending the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and thirty-eight insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year and the principal sum of two hundred pounds with interest amounting to thirty-four pounds seven shillings now remains unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable :

Provisions relating to the securing of a standard price to growers.

1.—(1) In the year nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, and in each third succeeding year, the Minister shall appoint a committee of three persons, who, after considering general economic conditions and the conditions affecting the agricultural industry, shall report to the Minister as to the desirability of making any alteration in the price which is for the time being specified as the standard price of home-grown millable wheat for the purposes of the Wheat Act, 1932 (hereinafter referred to as “ the principal Act ”).

(2) If the report of a committee appointed under this section is to the effect that the standard price should be altered, the Minister may by order substitute such price, to be specified in the order, as he may, after considering the report, think fit, for the price of ten shillings per hundredweight specified in subsection (3) of section two of the principal Act, or, if a previous order

(h) “ wheat by-products ”, that is to say, any milled wheaten substance destined for livestock that has an ash content (standard basis) exceeding two and seven-tenths per cent., other than a substance from which it would be practicable to separate a part which would have an ash content (standard basis) of two per cent, or less and the wheaten content of which would weigh more than three-tenths of the weight of the wheaten content of the substance.

(4) The expression “ wheaten content ” means, in relation to any substance, so much thereof, whether being a part or the whole thereof, as comprises, and comprises only, those constituents of the substance which are derived from—

(a) wheat, or

6.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, every miller shall make to the Wheat Commission quota payments in respect of all flour (not being a substance in respect of which, by virtue of the provisions of the next succeeding section, no quota payments are to be made) produced by him in the United Kingdom and delivered, and every importer of flour shall make to the Commission quota payments in respect of all flour imported by him.

(2) Quota payments to be made in respect of any flour produced in the United Kingdom shall accrue due when it is delivered, and quota payments to be made in respect of any flour imported shall accrue due when it is imported.

(a) that the wheaten content of the substance does not exceed three-quarters of the weight of the substance;

(b) that the whole of the wheat from which the

wheaten content of the substance is derived has been subjected to a milling applied to the wheat (whether previously cooked or not), by the person by whom the substance was produced, with the object of flattening the wheat; and

(c) that the substance is not as to any part of its

wheaten content derived from a milling the object of which was a division into fragments of the matter to which that milling was applied, or a production of meal, or a separation between husk and kernel, that is to say, between parts of wheat having different ash contents.

(4) “ Cut wheat” means a milled wheaten substance destined for livestock as to which the following conditions are fulfilled, namely—

(b) that the substance is not as to any part of its

wheaten content derived from a milling the object of which was a flattening of the matter to which that milling was applied, or a production of meal, or a separation between husk and kernel, that is to say, between parts of wheat having different ash contents.

References in the principal Act to a provender-miller’s certificate shall be construed as including references to a certificate granted under this subsection, and references in this section and in section nine of the principal Act to the output of a miller for any cereal year shall, in relation to a case in which a miller imports any flour during that year, be construed as excluding references to that flour.

(7) In the case of a milled wheaten substance being flour produced in the United Kingdom and destined for livestock but not being such a mixture as aforesaid or cut wheat or multure meal, the amount of any quota payments to be made in respect thereof, in lieu of being calculated by reference to each hundredweight of the substance as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (3) of section six of this Act, shall be calculated by reference—

(a) if conditions (b) and (c) of subsection (3) of this section are fulfilled in relation thereto, to each hundredweight of a quantity equal to four times the excess of the weight of the wheaten content thereof over three-quarters of the weight of the substance; or

Provided that, if the substance falls within subsection (5) of section six of this Act, the amount of any quota payments to be made in respect thereof shall be an amount calculated in accordance with that subsection or an amount calculated in accordance with this subsection, whichever is the less.

Conditions 8.—(1) For the purpose of ascertaining, in relation

for treating to the delivery or importation of a milled wheaten sub-substanoes stance, whether quota payments then accrued due in forlive11^ resPec*' thereof, and, if so, the amount of those quota stock!6 payments, the substance shall be treated as a substance destined for livestock if, and (subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section) only if, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Wheat Commission in accordance with byelaws that the condition specified in the next following subsection is fulfilled in relation to that delivery or importation:

Provided that this section shall not have effect for the purpose of the determination of any question by an officer of Customs and Excise in the execution of his functions under the Wheat Acts.

(2) The condition referred to in the foregoing subsection is that the person in whom the property in the substance was vested immediately before the delivery, or at the time of the importation, as the case may be, then intended that the substance should be used only as food for livestock, or as material in the production of goods to be so used and of such goods only.

(3) If-

(a) it has been shown to the satisfaction of the Commission in accordance with byelaws that the condition aforesaid is fulfilled in relation to the delivery or importation of a milled wheaten substance, but

(b) that substance or a part thereof or goods in the production of which that substance or a part

1939. Wheat (Amendment) Ch. 37.

Act, 1939.

thereof has been used as material has or have been used otherwise than as food for livestock or as material as aforesaid,

then, whichever of the events aforesaid last occurred, a delivery of the substance or of that part thereof, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have taken place on the date on which the substance or that part thereof or those goods, as the case may be, was or were used as aforesaid, and quota payments shall accordingly accrue due in respect of the substance or of that part thereof, as the case may be, and shall be payable by the person in whom the property in the substance, or in that part thereof or in those goods, as the case may be, was vested at the time of the use thereof as aforesaid :

Provided that, if that person did not know, at the time when the property in the substance or in that part thereof or in those goods, as the case may be, became vested in him, that the condition aforesaid was fulfilled in relation to the substance, the said quota payments shall be payable by, or out of the estate of, the first person from whom, at or after the time when the said condition was fulfilled, the property in the substance or in that part thereof or in those goods, as the case may be, passed to a person who did not know, when the property so passed to him, that the said condition was so fulfilled.

(4) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commission that a milled wheaten substance has in fact been used after a delivery or importation thereof only as food for livestock, or as material in the production of goods so used and of such goods only, although the condition aforesaid is not fulfilled in relation to the delivery or importation thereof, then, if that fact is shown before the determination of the questions relating to liability for quota payments referred to in subsection (1) of this section, the substance shall be treated for the purpose therein mentioned as a substance destined for livestock, and, if that fact is shown thereafter, all such adjustments shall be made, by repayment of any quota payments made or otherwise, as may be requisite for putting the miller or importer, the Commission and all other persons concerned (if any), in the like position as if the substance had been so treated.

(5) References in the Wheat Acts to a miller shall, except where the context otherwise requires, be construed as including references to a person liable to make quota payments by virtue of this section.

(6) It shall be the duty of any person who knows that he has become liable to make quota payments by virtue of this section to inform the Commission of that fact, and if, with intent to avoid payment of quota payments or otherwise with intent to deceive, he fails so to do, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction thereof to such punishment as is specified in subsection (3) of section sixteen of the principal Act.

9.—(1) Where a miller proves, as respects any floor produced by him in the United Kingdom and delivered, that a liability to make quota payments in respect of that flour, or of goods from which that flour was derived (whether exclusively or otherwise), arose by virtue of an earlier delivery or importation, then, in determining the liability of the miller to make quota payments by virtue of the later delivery, an allowance shall be made, in respect of the liability to make quota payments that arose by virtue of the earlier delivery or importation, in accordance with the following provisions of this section.

(2) The measure of the allowance shall be the amount that accrued due by way of quota payments by virtue of the earlier delivery or importation :

Provided that, if the amount prescribed as the standard amount at the time of the earlier delivery or importation, or the amount then prescribed under section three or eight of the principal Act, as the case may be, was not the same as the amount prescribed as the standard amount at the time of the later delivery, the measure of the allowance shall be the sum which would have accrued due by way of quota payments by virtue of the earlier delivery or importation if the last-mentioned amount had been the amount prescribed as aforesaid at the time thereof.

(3) If the measure of the allowance is equal to or greater than the amount of the quota payments which would, but for this provision, accrue due by virtue of the later delivery, the liability to make quota payments by virtue thereof shall be extinguished, and, if the measure

(4) In this section the expression “ sub-apportionment” means such an apportionment of income as is provided for by section thirty-two of the Finance Act, 1927 (which applies the said section twenty-one to interconnected companies) and the expression “ original apportionment ” has the same meaning as in the said section thirty-two.

(6) The provisions of this section shall have effect for the purposes of assessments for the year 1936-37 and subsequent years, and shall so have effect in the case of all persons notwithstanding that the liabilities of those persons to tax have been finally determined in whole or in part before the passing of this Act, and notwithstanding that all or any of the relevant powers of the Special Commissioners have, by virtue of something done or omitted to be done before the passing of this Act, ceased to be exercisable; and for the purpose of ensuring that all assessments are made in accordance with the said provisions, the Special Commissioners shall have power to give such directions, make and amend such apportionments, issue such notices, and make and amend such assessments and make such additional assessments, as they think proper, notwithstanding any such determination or cessation as aforesaid.

1939.

Finance A, 1939.

Ch. 41.

(2) The said section twenty-one and any provisions of this or any other Act relating thereto shall apply, with the necessary modifications, in cases in which directions are given by virtue of subsection (1) of this section as they apply in cases in which directions are given by virtue of section fourteen of the Finance Act, 1937, with respect to a year of assessment:

Provided that—

(a) no deduction shall be allowed in computing the

actual income from all sources of the company which would not be allowable in computing the total income of an individual for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, other than deductions for any national defence contribution payable by the company or for any such sums disbursed by the company as expenses of management as the Special Commissioners consider reasonable, having regard to the requirements of the company’s business and, in the case of directors’ fees or other payments for services, to the actual services rendered to the company';

(b) paragraph 5 of the First Schedule to the Finance

Act, 1922, and section eighteen of the Finance Act, 1928 (which restrict the powers of the Special Commissioners where statutory declarations or accounts are furnished to the Commissioners) shall not apply in cases in which directions may be given by virtue of subsection (1) of this section.

(3) The preceding provisions of this section shall not apply to an investment company the whole of the actual income whereof from all sources is estate or trading income.

(4) Where part only of the actual income from all sources of an investment company to which section twenty-one of the Finance Act, 1922, applies is estate or trading income, the provisions of the said section twenty-one and any provisions of this or any other Act relating thereto shall have effect as follows :—

(a) in the first place, they shall have effect as if such part of the actual income from all sources of the company as is not estate or trading income

Ch. 41.

Finance Act, 1939.

2 & 3 Geo. 6.

were the whole of the income of the company, and directions shall be given by virtue of subsection (1) of this section accordingly as respects that part;

(b) in the second place and separately (but without prejudice to the treatment of the company as an investment company for the purposes of the said provisions), they shall have effect as if such part of the actual income from all sources of the company as consists of estate or trading income were the whole of the income of the company, and, if the circumstances warrant that course, directions may be given accordingly as respects that part otherwise than by virtue of the said subsection (1):

Provided that—

(i) any income distributed by such a company to its members in such manner that the amount distributed falls to be included in the statements to be made by the members of their total income for the purposes of surtax shall, to the extent of the actual income from all sources of the company other than estate or trading income, be deemed for all purposes to have been distributed out of that other income and not out of the estate or trading income, and be left out of account accordingly in considering whether a reasonable part of the estate or trading income has been so distributed;

(ii) subject as aforesaid, any outgoings of the company of such a nature as to be capable of being taken into account in computing the amount of the actual estate or trading income of the company, in considering whether the company has so distributed a reasonable part of its estate or trading income, or in computing the amount of the actual income from all sources of the company other than estate or trading income, shall be treated as attributable to the estate or trading income or to the income other than estate or trading income, as the case may be, only to the extent that the Special Commissioners consider appropriate.

2. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertake that they will continue to use all possible efforts in cooperation with commercial interests to stimulate the consumption of Indian cotton in all possible ways, including technical research, commercial investigation, market liaison and industrial propaganda.

7. Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraphs, if the imports of Indian raw cotton into the United Kingdom fall below 400,000 bales in the cotton year ending 31st December, 1939, or in the ootton year ending 31st December, 1940, and 450,000 bales in any other cotton year, the duties charged on imports of United Kingdom cotton piece goods into India in the following cotton piece goods year may be increased above the basio rates to such extent as the Government of India

(1) that, bearing in mind the provisions of Article 6 of the Agreement supplementary to the Ottawa Trade Agreement concluded between the two Governments on the 9th January,. 1935, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom desire to reserve the right to impose a customs duty on imports of pig iron from India if after the expiry on the 31st March, 1941, of the Iron and Steel Protection Act, 1934, duties are applied to articles of iron and steel imported into India substantially less favourable to the United Kingdom than those for which that Act provides; and

(2) that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will consult the Government of India before taking any decision to impose such a customs duty; agree that it will be open to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, after consultation with the Government of India, and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1 of the Trade Agreement, to impose after the 31st March, 194 1, a customs duty on imports of pig iron produced or manufactured in India if duties are applied to articles of iron and steel imported into India substantially less favourable to the United Kingdom than those for which the above mentioned Act provides, without prejudice, however, to the provisions of Section 4 (1) of the Indian Tariff Act, 1934.

Sir, :

With reference to Article 13 of the Trade Agreement signed this day, I have the honour to inform you that the Government of India have taken note of the statement of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the course of the recent discussions that, in agreeing that the preferences included in Schedule VI to the Agreement are principally of interest to Ceylon, ' they are nevertheless anxious that the claims of other Colonial £ dependencies to receive any of these preferences should be 55 sympathetically considered by the Government of India if the ! proposed negotiations between that Government and the Government of Ceylon do not result in the extension of suoh preferences to those dependencies for the duration of the Agreement concluded this day. I am authorised to state that the Government of India will give sympathetic consideration to any requests which Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom may make in regard to such preferences on behalf of Colonial dependencies other than Ceylon.

(4) For the purposes of the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph relating to deductions for wear and tear or depreciation, any additional deduction allowable for income tax purposes by virtue of the proviso to paragraph (2) of Rule 5 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule D, and any deduction allowable for those purposes under section eighteen of the Finance Act, 1919, shall be treated as a deduction for depreciation.

689

(2) A board—

(a) may make the payments referred to in subsection (1) of this section notwithstanding that there is nothing in the scheme authorising it so to do; and

(b) in cases in which that subsection applies, may, in such circumstances as it may from time to time determine, refrain from making payments, notwithstanding that the scheme requires payments to be made.

(3) Where a board has duly paid any sum under subsection (1) of this section in respect of any milk, the Minister shall pay to that board out of moneys provided by Parliament such sum, if any, as is prescribed in that behalf by the said Schedule :

Provided that no sum shall be payable under this subsection to a board in respect of any milk unless the milk was sold or, as the case may be, used during a period (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ a period for ’which quality milk subsidy is payable ”) as to which the Minister is satisfied that the board has, with such exceptions as he may allow, made the payments referred to in subsection (1) of this section with respect to substantially all the milk to which that subsection applies sold or, as the case may be, used during that period.

Provided that, where such a licence has been granted to a registered producer (either originally or by way of renewal of an existing licence), he shall, if the board thinks fit, be deemed for the purposes of this definition to have been the holder of that licence as from such date earlier than the grant thereof as the board may direct;

(d) where, under the provisions of a milk marketing scheme requiring registered producers to make payments to the board in respect of milk, the payments which a producer is required to make in respect of any quality milk are less than the payments which he is required to make in respect of milk which is not quality milk, the board shall be deemed to pay the amount of the difference to the producer in respect of that milk, and references in this section to payments and the making thereof shall be construed accordingly.

(5) This section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-eight.

(b) by expectant or nursing mothers, or children under five years of age,

the Minister may, with the approval of the Treasury, pay to that board out of moneys provided by Parliament such sum as he thinks fit, not exceeding the amount which in his opinion represents the loss incurred by the board in carrying out the arrangements in respect of that period.

(2) As soon as may be after any arrangements have been approved by him for the purposes of this section m connection with a milk marketing scheme, the Minister shall lay particulars of the arrangements before Parliament.

(3) Any arrangements approved before the passing of this Act under section eleven of the Milk Act, 1934, which could be approved for the purposes of this section shall, until superseded by arrangements so approved, have effect as if they were approved under this section and the said section eleven shall cease to have effect, except as respects things done before the coming into operation of this section.

respect of the approval of the Treasury, a milk marketing board milk used in satisfies the Minister—

(a) that any quantity of milk produced in the area to which the scheme applies, being milk delivered in accordance with—

(i) a contract for the sale of milk by a registered producer otherwise than to, or through the agency of, the board; or

(ii) a contract for the sale of milk by the board, either in its own right or as agent for a registered producer,

has, in that half-year, been used (elsewhere than at a farm) in manufacturing butter; or

(b) that any quantity of milk produced in that area by a registered producer has, in that half-year, been used by the board in manufacturing butter,

the Minister shall, subject to the following provisions of this Act, pay to the board out of moneys provided by Parliament a sum obtained by multiplying the butter price deficiency by the number of gallons comprised in that quantity of milk and dividing the result by the number of gallons of milk which, in the opinion of the Ministers, would on the average be used in Great Britain, in a winter half-year or a summer half-year, as the case may be, in manufacturing one hundredweight of butter.

(2) If there is a cheese price deficiency (as hereinafter defined) for any half-year to which this section applies, and, by means of such evidence as aforesaid, a milk marketing board satisfies the Minister—

{a)that any quantity of milk produced in the area to which the scheme applies, being milk delivered in accordance with such a contract as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of the preceding subsection, has, in that half-year, been used (elsewhere than at a farm) in manufacturing cheese; or

the Minister shall, subject to the following provisions of this Act, pay to the board out of moneys provided by Parliament a sum obtained by multiplying the cheese price deficiency by the number of gallons comprised in that quantity of milk and dividing the result by the number of gallons of milk which, in the opinion of the Ministers, would on the average be used in Great Britain, in a winter half-year or a summer half-year, as the case may be, in manufacturing one hundredweight of cheese.

Without prejudice to the generality of the powers of the Ministers to make regulations as to the evidence to be produced for the purposes of this subsection, the regulations may, in relation to milk used in manufacturing cheese at a farm, provide for the ascertainment of the quantity of the milk by means of the application to the quantity of the cheese of such formula as may be prescribed by the regulations in relation to the circumstances of the case.

(3) This section applies to the half-years comprised within the two years ending with the thirtieth day of September nineteen hundred and forty :

Provided that no payment shall be made to a board under this section in respect of any milk produced in the first of those years unless the milk was produced during a period for which quality milk subsidy is payable to the board.

(4) Any sum paid to a board under sections one to three of the Milk Act, 1934, in respect of milk produced in any period in the first of the said years for which quality milk subsidy is payable to that board shall be repaid to the Minister and paid by him into the Exchequer.

4.—(1) The total quantity of milk in respect of which payments under the last preceding section may be made to a board by reason of the fact that milk has, in any year, been used in manufacturing butter or cheese, shall not exceed the board’s proportion of the standard quantity of butter milk, or, as the case may be, of cheese milk, for that year :

Provided that, if, in any year for the summer half-year of which there is both a butter price deficiency and a cheese price deficiency, the following conditions are satisfied in the case of any board, that is to say—

(a) the quantity of milk used for manufacturing

butter or the quantity of milk used for manufacturing cheese (being, in either case, milk in respect of which payments can, or, but for this subsection, could, be made under the last preceding section) exceeds the board’s proportion of the standard quantity of butter milk or of cheese milk, as the case may be; and

(b) the quantity of milk used for manufacturing

cheese or, as the case may be, butter (being milk in respect of which payments can be made under the last preceding section), falls short of the board’s proportion of the standard quantity of cheese milk or of butter milk, as the case may be.

the Minister shall pay to the board out of moneys provided by Parliament in respect of the excess mentioned in paragraph (a) of this proviso, or the deficiency mentioned in paragraph ( of this proviso, whichever is the smaller,—

(i)

(«)

a sum obtained by multiplying the butter price deficiency for the said summer half-year by the number of gallons comprised in the said excess, or, as the case may be, the said deficiency, and dividing the result by the number of gallons which, in the opinion of the Ministers, would on the average be used in Great Britain in a summer half-year in manufacturing one hundredweight of butter; or

a sum obtained by multiplying the cheese price deficiency for that half-year by the number of gallons comprised in the said excess, or, as the case may be, the said deficiency, and dividing

the result by the number of gallons which, in the opinion of the Ministers, would on the average be used in Great Britain in a summer half-year in manufacturing one hundredweight of cheese,

whichever of those sums is the smaller.

(2) For the purposes of this section, the standard quantity of butter milk and the standard quantity of cheese milk for any year shall each be taken to be one hundred and twenty-five million gallons.

(3) The Ministers shall by order determine the proportions in which the standard quantity of butter milk for any year and the standard quantity of cheese milk for any year are to be respectively allocated to the several milk marketing boards; and the proportion of any such standard quantity which is so allocated to any such board shall be deemed, for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, to be that board’s proportion of that standard quantity.

An order under this subsection with respect to any year may be varied by a subsequent order of the Ministers made before the beginning of, or after the end of, that year; but no such order shall be made after the end of the year unless it appears to the Ministers that it can he made without lessening the amount payable under the last preceding section to any milk marketing board in respect of that year.

Any order under this subsection shall, as soon as may be after the making thereof, be laid before Parliament, and if either House of Parliament, within the period of forty days beginning with the day on which any such order is laid before it, resolves that the order be annulled, it shall thereupon become void, without prejudice, however, to anything previously done thereunder or to the making of a new order.

In reckoning any such period of forty days as aforesaid, no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued, or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.

of the Treasury, the price which in their opinion fairly 4; represents the average of the prices per hundredweight at which, in the six months beginning with the first day k of the month immediately preceding the beginning of the half-year, such descriptions of imported butter as are specified in the rules were sold by wholesale by the importers thereof on such markets in Great Britain as j_ may be so specified and the price which in their opinion; fairly represents the average of the prices per hundred-weight at which, in the said six months, such descriptions of imported cheese as are specified in the rules were sold rj by wholesale by the importers thereof on such markets r in Great Britain as may be so specified: i '

Provided that if, in the case of any board, part -only of the half-year beginning with the first day of a October nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, or part only of the half-year beginning with the first day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, was a period for which quality milk subsidy is payable to the board, separate computations shall be made in relation to that board for that half-year, and those computations shall be made, not by reference to the six months beginning with the first day of the month immediately preceding the beginning of the half-year, but by reference to a period beginning one month before the beginning of the said part of the half-year, and ending one month before the end thereof.

(2) If the first of the said prices is less—-

(a) in the case of a winter half-year, than one hundred and twenty-five shillings per hundredweight; or

(a) the board actually received the regional price

in respect of the sale of that milk; and

(b) any sums allowed by the board in respect of

that milk (being sums which it would not have allowed had the milk been milk to which no such arrangements applied) were a liability of the board.

(2) It shall be and shall be deemed always to have been within the powers of any milk marketing board, for the purpose of giving effect to any arrangements approved as aforesaid, notwithstanding anything in the scheme and subject to such conditions as the board thinks fit, to pay or allow to suppliers of milk, or any local authority concerned, such sum in respect of each gallon of milk sold as the board may from time to time determine.

The provisions of this subsection shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of section twelve of the Milk Act, 1934, and section seven of the Milk (Amendment) Act, 1937, extending the functions of milk marketing boards.

first eight months of that year comprise any land under wheat; or

(b) if it did, that the person who was the occupier

(2) If in the case of any year—

(a) the acreage qualifying for oats subsidy pay-

ments at the higher rate exceeds one million four hundred and seventy thousand acres; or

(b) the acreage qualifying for oats subsidy pay-

CHAPTER 51.

An Act to amend the law with respect to the manner in which the public trustee may deal with certain trust moneys, to confirm the legality of certain dealings by the public trustee with such moneys and to require certain moneys in the hands of the public trustee to be paid into the Exchequer; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[28th July 1939.]

WHEREAS the public trustee has at all times in his hands trust moneys standing to the credit of various trusts, being temporary cash balances awaiting investment or distribution :

And whereas, on and after the fifth day of March nineteen hundred and eighteen, in cases where moneys so stand to the credit of a trust and the public trustee deems it impracticable, or not for the benefit of the trust, to keep the moneys separate and earn interest thereon, it has been his practice to include such moneys, until required, in one general fund:

1939.

Public Trustee

(General Deposit Fund) , 1939.

Ch. 51.

757

And whereas until July nineteen hundred and thirty-six part of the said fund was kept on deposit account with certain banks, and part thereof was kept invested in Government securities :

And whereas from time to time during the years nineteen hundred and twenty-two to nineteen hundred and thirty-two, on the realisation of certain securities forming part of the assets of the said fund, sums representing the capital appreciation of those securities, amounting in all to twenty-eight thousand one hundred and seventy-eight pounds fifteen shillings and four pence, were dealt with by the public trustee as if they were fees received by him :

And whereas in July nineteen hundred and thirty-six all the securities then forming part of the assets of the said fund were realised, and of the net proceeds of the realisation, the sum of one hundred and seventeen thousand five hundred and sixty-nine pounds, eighteen shillings and ten pence (being so much of those proceeds as represented capital appreciation of the assets of the fund) was paid by the public trustee into a separate account in the Post Office Savings Bank and treated as no longer forming part of the assets of the said fund :

And whereas since the realisation of the said securities the assets of the said fund have partly been kept on deposit account in certain banks and have as to the remainder thereof been kept in the Post Office Savings Bank:

And whereas nothing in respect of capital appreciation of the assets of the said fund has been credited to the various trusts the moneys of which have from time to time been included therein, but interest at the rate hereinafter mentioned has been credited to each trust in respect of those moneys:

And whereas that interest has been so credited to the trusts at the following rates, that is to say :—

(a) in the case of any part of the period beginning with the fifth day of March nineteen hundred and eighteen and ending with the thirty-first day of July nineteen hundred and thirty-six, at the highest exact multiple of one-quarter per cent, per annum which w*as more than one-quarter per cent, per annum below the rate

which would have absorbed the whole of the; interest for the time being accruing to the public trustee in respect of the assets of the fund;

(b) in the case of any part of the period since the beginning of August nineteen hundred and ti thirty-six, at the highest exact multiple of one-sixteenth per cent, per annum which could be paid out of the interest for the time being accruing to the public trustee in respect of the assets of the fund :

And whereas the balance of the interest from time to time received by the public trustee in respect of the assets of the said fund after crediting the interest aforesaid to the various trusts has been dealt with by the public trustee as if it were fees received by him :

And whereas it is expedient to legalise the said dealings by the public trustee with the trust moneys aforesaid, to provide for the payment into the Exchequer (free of all claims) of the said sum of one hundred and seventeen thousand five hundred and sixty-nine pounds eighteen shillings and ten pence and the interest accrued thereon, and to authorise the public trustee to continue to maintain the said fund and to deal therewith, and with the interest thereon, in the manner in which the said fund and the interest thereon have been dealt with by him since the beginning of August nineteen hundred and thirty-six :

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : —

1.—(1) The said dealings by the public trustee with the trust moneys aforesaid shall be deemed always to have been lawful.

(2) The public trustee shall pay into the Exchequer the said sum of one hundred and seventeen thousand, five hundred and sixty-nine pounds, eighteen shillings and ten pence, together wdth the interest accrued to him thereon, and no claim shall be made by any person to any part of the said sum or of the interest thereon.

Provided that no application which could not have been entertained by the Authority if this section had not passed shall be made to the Authority after the buildings have been rendered fit.

(2) In addition to the grounds for the exercise of the powers of the Authority specified in paragraphs

(a), ( b) and (c) of subsection (1) of the said section eighty-four, those powers may be exercised, in relation to restrictions affecting the interest created by the lease, on the Authority being satisfied that the proposed discharge or modification is desirable in order to permit the economical use or development of the land comprised in the lease, or is otherwise desirable in the national interest.

(3) Where any restriction affecting the interest created by the lease is wholly or partially discharged or modified on any of the additional grounds specified in the last foregoing subsection, the powers of the Authority may be exercised on any of those additional grounds in relation to any similar restriction affecting the freehold out of which that interest is derived.

(4) The said section eighty-four shall, notwithstanding anything in subsection (12) thereof, apply to restrictions affecting interests created by the lease in like manner as it would have applied to restrictions affecting the land had the land been freehold, whatever the term of the lease and whatever period of the term has expired.

2. Where war damage occurs to any land comprised in a heritable security nothing in the provisions of the heritable security or in any deed or instrument bearing reference thereto shall be construed as entitling the creditor to enter into possession of the land or sell the same solely on the ground that his security has been diminished by reason of the war damage.

Act 1939.

Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :—

1. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, agree to sell or offer to sell, any price-regulated goods in the course of any business at a price which exceeds the permitted price, that is to say the basic price together with the amount of any permitted increase.

2. In this Act the expression “ price-regulated goods” means goods of a description defined in an order made by the Board of Trade under this section and for the time being in force.

3.—(1) In this Act the expression “ basic price ” means, in relation to price-regulated goods of any description sold, agreed to be sold or offered for sale, the price at which, in the ordinary course of the business in the course of which those goods were sold, agreed to be sold, or offered for sale, goods of that description similar to those goods were being offered for sale at the twenty-first day of August nineteen hundred and t hirty-nine (or other the date as at which the basic price is, under subsection (4) of this section, to be ascertained).

(2) In relation to price-regulated goods sold, agreed to be sold or offered for sale, in the course of a business which included both a wholesale and a retail branch, or both a manufacturing and a merchanting branch, or two or more branches in localities of a different character or otherwise howsoever distinguishable, the reference in subsection (1) of this section to the business in the course of which those goods were sold, agreed to be sold or offered for sale, shall be construed as a reference to the particular branch of that business in the course of which the transaction was effected. 3

(3) In relation to price-regulated goods sold, agreed to be sold or offered for sale, in the course of a business, or of a branch of a business, which was not being carried on at the date as at which the basic price for those goods is to be ascertained, or in the course of which goods of the relevant character were not being offered for sale at that date, the preceding provisions of this section shall have effect with the substitution, for the reference in subsection (1) thereof to the business in the course of which those goods were sold, agreed to be sold or offered

for sale, of a reference to some business similar to that I business, or to a branch of some business similar to that branch of that business, which was then being carried on, or in the course of which goods of the relevant character were then being offered for sale, as the case may be.

(4) If, having regard either— j

(a) to any exceptional circumstances affecting the i

price at which goods of any description were being offered for sale at the said twenty-first day of August;

(b) to the lapse of time since that day and any

resulting difficulty in ascertaining the price at which goods of any description were being offered for sale at that day; or

(c) to the fact that goods of any description air subject to a seasonal variation of price;

it appears to the Board of Trade to be expedient that the basic price for goods of that description should be ascertained as at a date other than the said twenty-first day of August, the Board may by order direct that the basic , price therefor shall, as regards a sale, agreement or offer, made whilst the order is in force, be ascertained as at such date, or, in the case of goods subject to a seasonal J variation of price, as at such different dates in the case I of transactions effected at different seasons, as maybe specified in the order.

4. In this Act the expression “ permitted increase" means, in relation to any price-regulated goods sold, agreed to be sold or offered for sale, in the course of any business, an amount not exceeding such increase as is reasonably justified in view of changes in the business, since the date as at which the basic price for the goods is to be ascertained, in relation to the matters specified in the First Schedule to this Act taken as a whole.

5.—(1) If, on the application of any body of persons appearing to the Board of Trade to be representative of traders in goods of any description, or on the application with respect to goods of any description of the central price-regulation committee appointed under section eight of this Act, it appears to the Board, after consultation with that committee in the case of an application

not made by them, to be expedient and practicable so to do, the Board may by order specify—

(a) a price representing a basic price for goods of that description;

(b) a percentage representing a standard of permitted

increase for goods of that description; or

(c) a price representing a permitted price for goods of that description;

and a sale of, or an agreement or offer to sell, goods of a description as to which an order under paragraph (a), (b) or (c), of this subsection is in force shall, notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this Act, be deemed to be lawful, so far as regards the provisions of section one of this Act, if it is made at a price which does not exceed—

(1) the price specified under the said paragraph (a)

together with the amount of any permitted increase;

(ii) the basic price together with an amount equal to the percentage thereof specified under the said paragraph (6); or

(iii) the price specified under the said paragraph (c); as the case may be.

(2) As soon as may be after making such an order as aforesaid, the Board shall publish in such manner as they think best for informing persons appearing to the Board to be likely to be affected a notice specifying the effect thereof.

(3) An appeal shall lie against such an order as aforesaid to the referee appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act, at the instance of any persons appearing to the referee to be representative of traders in, or buyers of, goods of the description in question :

Provided that an appeal against such an order shall not be entertained unless notice of the intention of the persons appealing to make the appeal is given to the Board within fourteen days from the first publication of the notice required by the last preceding subsection.

6.—(1) In relation to a description of price-regulated goods in the case of which the provisions of section three j of this Act cannot operate by reason of that description of goods having come into existence after the twenty-first day of August nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, the Board of Trade may by order specify a price which shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the basic price for goods of that description sold, agreed to be sold or offered for sale, whilst the order is in force.

(4) It shall be the duty of the central price-regulation committee to secure uniformity in the manner of the discharge of their functions by local price-regulation committees, to exercise a general supervision over the enforcement of the provisions of this Act, to enforce the said provisions themselves in cases in which it appears to them to be expedient so to do on the ground that questions as to the contravention thereof in relation to goods of any description are likely to arise in numerous localities or on other grounds, and to giw advice and assistance to the Board in the discharge oi their functions under this Act.

(5) Where it appears to a local price-regulation committee that there has been a contravention in their locality of any of the provisions of section one of tte Act and the committee, after giving to the alleged offender an opportunity of making representations to them, and, if so requested by him, of being heard by them, are of opinion that a prosecution ought to be instituted in respect thereof, the committee shall report the alleged contravention to the central price-regulation committee, who, if they are of the same opinion, shall request the Board of Trade to institute proceedings accordingly, and the central price-regulation committee shall make a like request in a case in which they think fit to investigate an alleged contravention themselves and are of opinion, after giving to the alleged offender such an opportunity as aforesaid, that a prosecution ought to be instituted.

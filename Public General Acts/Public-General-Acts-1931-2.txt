Treasury, after consultation with the appropriate Department, that any duty chargeable under this Act on goods of any class or description by reference to the value thereof could be levied with greater advantage and convenience if that duty were chargeable by reference to weight or other measure of quantity, the Treasury may by regulations direct that the duty shall be charged by reference to weight or other measure of quantity, as may be specified in the regulations.

(2) The duty to be charged as aforesaid shall be charged at such rate as may be specified in the regulations, being the rate which appears to the

Convention and the Regulations referred to therein

(except in so far as the said provisions are otherwise implemented by the Merchant Shipping Acts):

Provided that—>

(a) the Board may treat any passenger steamer constructed before the first day of July,

nineteen hundred and thirty-one, (not being a

steamer converted to passenger service on or after that date) as complying with any such requirement, if the Board are satisfied that such steps, if any, as are reasonable and practicable have been taken to make the steamer comply with that requirement;

extent that they are satisfied that the risks incurred by passenger steamers plying on that voyage are such as to make it unreasonable or unnecessary to require steamers so plying to comply with that requirement;

(c) the Board may, as respects steamers for the time being engaged in any passenger trade in which they are employed in the carriage of large numbers of unberthed passengers,

modify any such requirement, if they are satisfied that compliance with that requirement by steamers so engaged is impracticable and to the extent that they are satisfied that modifications are required by the conditions of the trade; and

(d) the Board may, as respects any steamer plying on short international voyages, modify any of the requirements of the construction regulations which implement the provisions of the Safety Convention contained in

Regulations IX, X, XV and XIX thereof,

(2) If it appears to the Board of Trade—

(a) that passenger steamers plying on any international voyage incur exceptional risks owing to weather and traffic conditions; and

(b) that owing to the small proportion of space allotted to cargo in any steamer constructed after the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, or converted to passenger service after that date, the steamer can be sub-divided to a greater extent than is required by the Safety Convention;

the Board shall direct a ship surveyor to satisfy himself,

before stating in a declaration of survey that the steamer is fit to ply on that voyage, that the steamer is subdivided to such greater extent as appears to the Board to be practicable and expedient in the interest of safety.

ANNEX I.

Regulations.

CONSTRUCTION.

Regulation I.

Definitions.

(1) The subdivision loadline is the waterline used in determining the subdivision of the ship.

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

(Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

The deepest subdivision loadline is that which corresponds to the greatest draught.

(2) The length of the ship is the length measured between perpendiculars taken at the extremities of the deepest subdivision loadline.

(3) The breadth of the ship is the extreme width from outside of frame to outside of frame at or below the deepest subdivision loadline.

(4) The bulkhead deck is the uppermost deck up to which the transverse watertight bulkheads are carried.

(5) The margin line is a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and 3 inches (76 millimetres) below the upper surface of that deck at side.

(6) The draught is the vertical distance from the top of keel amidships to the subdivision loadline in question.

(7) The permeability of a space is the percentage of that space which can be occupied by water.

The volume of a space which extends above the margin line shall be measured only to the height of that line.

(8) The machinery space is to be taken as extending from the top of keel to the margin line and between the extreme main transverse watertight bulkheads bounding the spaces devoted to the main and auxiliary propelling machinery, boilers when installed, and all permanent coal bunkers.

(9) Passenger spaces are those which are provided for the accommodation and use of passengers, excluding baggage, store,

provision and mail rooms.

For the purposes of Regulations III and IV, spaces provided below the margin line for the accommodation and use of the crew shall be regarded as passenger spaces.

(10) In all cases volumes shall be calculated to moulded lines.

Regulation II.

Floodable Length.

(1) The floodable length at any point of the length of a ship shall be determined by a method of calculation which takes into consideration the form, draught and other characteristics of the ship in question.

(2) In a ship with a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question, which can be flooded under the definite assumptions hereafter set forth in Regulation III without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line.

1st Sch. (3) In the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead

—cont. deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line, up to which, having regard to sinkage and trim after damage, the sides of the ship and the bulkheads concerned are carried watertight.

Regulation HI.

Permeability.

(1) The definite assumptions referred to in Regulation II

relate to the permeabilities of the spaces below the margin line.

In determining the floodable length, a uniform average permeability shall be used throughout the whole length of each of the following portions of the ship below the margin line :—

(a) the machinery space as defined in Regulation I (8);

(b) the portion forward of the machinery space; and

(c) the portion abaft the machinery space.

(2) —(a) For steamships the uniform average permeability throughout the machinery space shall be determined from the formula—

80 -f- 12-5 where

a = volume of the passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation I (9), which are situated below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space.

e = volume of between deck spaces below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space which are appropriated to cargo, coal or stores.

v = whole volume of the machinery space below the margin line.

(6) For ships propelled by internal combustion engines, the uniform average permeability shall be taken as 5 greater than that given by the above formula.

(c) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the average permeability, as determined by detail calculation, is less than that given by the formula, the calculated value may be substituted. For the purposes of such calculation,

the permeabilities of passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation I (9), shall be taken as 95, that of all cargo, coal and store spaces as 60, and that of double bottom, oil fuel and other tanks at such values as may be approved in each case by the

Administration.

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

{Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

(3) The uniform average permeability throughout the portion of the ship before (or abaft) the machinery space shall be determined from the formula, —

63 4- 35 —, where

v

a s= volume of the passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation I (9), which are situated below the margin line,

before (or abaft) the machinery space, and

v =53! whole volume of the portion of the ship below the margin line before (or abaft) the machinery space.

(4) If a between deck compartment between two watertight transverse bulkheads contains any passenger or crew space, ' the whole of that compartment, less any space completely enclosed within permanent steel bulkheads and appropriated to other purposes, shall be regarded as passenger space. If, however, the passenger or crew space in question is completely enclosed within permanent steel bulkheads, only the space so enclosed need be considered as passenger space.

Regulation IV.

Permissible Length of Compartments.

(1) Factor of Subdivision .—The maximum permissible length of a compartment having its centre at any point in the ship’s

length is obtained from the floodable length by multiplying the latter by an appropriate factor called the factor of subdivision.

The factor of subdivision shall depend on the length of the ship, and for a given length shall vary according to the nature of the service for which the ship is intended. It shall decrease in a regular and continuous manner—

(a) as the length of the ship increases, and

(b) from a factor A, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of cargo, to a factor B, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers.

The variations of the factors A and B shall be expressed by the following formulae (i) and (ii), where L is the length of the ship as defined in Regulation I (2)

(3) Rules for Subdivision. — (a) The subdivision abaft the fore

•peak of ships 430 feet (131 metres) in length and upwards having

a criterion numeral of 23 or less shall be governed' by the factor A given by formula (i); of those having a criterion numeral of 123 or more by the factor B given by formula (ii);

and of those having a criterion numeral between 23 and 123 by the factor F obtained by linear interpolation between the factors A and B, using the formula :—

g - A - (A-B)(C.- 2 3) .

Where the factor F is less than *40 and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration to be impracticable to comply with the factor F in a machinery compartment of the ship, the subdivision of such compartment may be governed by an increased factor, which, however, shall not exceed *40.

(b) The subdivision abaft the fare peak of ships less than

Regulation V.

Special Rules concerning Subdivision.

(1) A compartment may exceed the permissible length determined by the rules of Regulation IV provided the combined length of each pair of adjacent compartments to which the compartment in question is common does not exceed either the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is the les3.

If one of the two adjacent compartments is situated inside the machinery space, and the second is situated outside the machinery space, and the average permeability of the portion of the sMp

in which the second is situated differs from that of the machinery space, the combined length of the two compartments shall be adjusted to the mean average permeability of the two portions of the ship in which the compartments are situated.

Where the two adjacent compartments have different factors of subdivision, the combined length of the two compartments shall be determined proportionately.

(2) In ships 430 feet (131 metres) in length and upwards, one of the main transverse bulkheads abaft the fore peak shall be fitted at a distance from the forward perpendicular which is not greater than the permissible length.

(3) A main transverse bulkhead may be recessed provided that all parts of the recess lie inboard of vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship, situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one-fifth the breadth of the ship, as defined in Regulation I (3), and measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision loadline.

Any part of a recess which lies outside these limits shall be dealt with as a step in accordance with the following paragraph.

(4) A main transverse bulkhead may be stepped provided that—

(a) the combined length of the two compartments, separated by the bulkhead in question, does not exceed 90 per cent,

of the floodable length, or

(b) additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same measure of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead.

(5) Where a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped,

an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision.

(6) If the distance between' two adjacent main transverse bulkheads, or their equivalent plane bulkheads, or the distance between the transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9. 133

{Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act f 1932.

portions of the bulkheads, is less than 10 feet (3 05 metres) plus , 1st Sou.

2 per cent, of the length of the ship, only one of these bulkheads — conf '

shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship in accordance with the provisions of Regulation IV.

(7) Where a main transverse watertight compartment contains local subdivision and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that, after any assumed side damage extending over a length of 10 feet (3 05 metres) plus 2 per cent, of the length of the ship, the whole volume of the main compartment will not be flooded, a proportionate allowance may be made in the permissible length otherwise required for such compartment.

In such a case the volume of effective buoyancy assumed on the undamaged side shall not be greater than that assumed on the damaged side.

(8) Where it is proposed to fit watertight decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads, watertight or non-watertight, the

Administration shall be satisfied that the safety of the ship will not be diminished in any respect, particularly having in view the possible listing effect of flooding in way of such structural arrangements.

Regulation .VI.

Peak and Machinery Space Bulkheads, Shaft Tunnels, &c.

(1) Every ship shall have a forepeak or collision bulkhead,

which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be fitted not less than 5 per cent, of the length of the ship, and not more than 10 feet (3 05 metres) plus 5 per cent,

of the length of the ship from the forward perpendicular.

If the ship has a long forward superstructure, the forepeak bulkhead shall be extended weathertight to the deck next above the bulkhead deck. The extension need not be fitted directly over the bulkhead below, provided it is at least 5 per cent, of the length of the ship from the forward perpendicular, and the part of the bulkhead deck which forms the step is made effectively weathertight.

(2) An afterpeak bulkhead, and bulkheads dividing the machinery space, as defined in Regulation I (8), from the cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft, shall also be fitted and made watertight up-to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stopped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished.

(3) In all cases stem tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces. The stem gland shall be situated within a watertight shaft tunnel or other space of such volume that if flooded by

Assigning, Marking and Recording of Subdivision Loadlines.

(1) The subdivision loadlines assigned and marked under the provisions of Article 5 of the Convention shall be recorded in the Safetj r Certificate, and shall be distinguished by the notation C.l for the principal passenger condition, and C.2,

C.3, &c., for the alternative conditions.

(2) The freeboard corresponding to each of these loadlines inserted in the Safety Certificate shall be measured at the same position and from the same deck line as the freeboards determined by recognised National Freeboard Regulations.

(3) In no case shall any subdivision loadline mark be placed above the deepest loadline in salt water as determined by the strength of the ship and/or recognised National Freeboard

Regulations.

(4) Whatever may be the position of the subdivision loadline marks, a ship shall in no case be loaded so as to submerge the loadline mark appropriate to the season and locality as determined by the recognised National Freeboard Regulations.

Regulation VIII.

Construction and Initial Testing of Watertight Bulkheads, &c.

(1) Watertight subdivision bulkheads, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed in such a manner that they shall be capable of supporting with a proper margin of resistance,

the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line in way of each bulkhead. The construction of these bulkheads shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.

(2) Steps and recesses in bulkheads shall be watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs.

"Where frames or beams pass through a watertight deck or bulkhead, such deck or bulkhead shall be made structurally watertight without the use of wood or cement.

(3) Testing main compartments by filling them with water is not. compulsory. A complete examination of the bulkheads shall be made by a surveyor; and, in addition, a hose test shall be made in all cases.

(41 The fore peak shall be tested with water to a head up to the deepest subdivision loadline. •

(5) Double bottoms, including duct keels, and inner skins are to be subjected to a head of water up to the margin line.

(6) Each independent power bilge pump shall be capable of giving a speed of water through the main bilge pipe of not less than 400 feet (122 metres) per minute, and it shall have a

separate direct suction, to the compartment in which it is situated

. of a diameter not less than that of the bilge main. The direct suctions from each independent power bilge pump shall be arranged to pump from either side of the ship.

(7) Main circulating pumps shall have direct suction connections, provided with non-return valves, to the lowest drainage level in the machinery space, and of a diameter at least two-

thirds that of the main sea inlet. Where the fuel is, or may be,

coal, and there is no watertight bulkhead between the engines and boilers, a direct discharge overboard shall be fitted from at least one circulating pump, or, alternatively, a bye-pass may be fitted to the circulating discharge.

(8) (a) All pipes from the pumps which are required for draining, cargo or machinery spaces shall be entirely distinct from pipes which may be used for filling or emptying spaces where water or oil is carried.

m

(b) Lead pipes shall not be used under coal bunkers or oil fuel storage tanks, nor in boiler or machinery spaces, including motor rooms in which oil settling tanks or oil fuel pump units are situated.

. (9) The Administration shall make rules relating to the diameters of the bilge main and branch pipes which shall be proportioned respectively in relation to the size of the ship and the sizes of the compartments to be drained.

(10) The arrangement of the bilge and ballast pumping system shall be such as to prevent the possibility of water passing from the sea and from water ballast spaces into the cargo and machinery spaces, or from one compartment to another. Special provision shall be made to prevent any deep tank having bilge and ballast connections being inadvertently run up from the sea when containing cargo, or pumped out through a bilge pipe when containing water ballast.

(11) Provision shall be made to prevent the compartment served by any bilge suction pipe being flooded, in the event of the pipe being severed or otherwise damaged, by collision or grounding, in any other compartment. For this purpose, where the pipe is at any part situated near the side of the ship or in a

duct keel, there shall be fitted to the pipe in the compartment containing the open end either a non-return valve, or a screw-

down valve which can be operated from a position above the bulkhead deck.

The number of persons for whom the apparatus is deemed suitable shall be determined by the least of the numbers ascertained either as above or by the number of 30 - 5 centimetres

(equivalent to one foot) in the perimeter.

Such approved buoyant apparatus shall comply with the following conditions :—

1. It shall be constructed with proper workmanship and materials.

2. It shall be effective and stable when floating either way up.

3. It shall be of such size, strength and weight that it can be handled without mechanical appliances and, if necessary, thrown without damage from the vessel’s deck on which it is stowed.

4. The air-cases or equivalent buoyancy shall be placed as near as possible to the sides of the apparatus.

6. It shall have a line securely becketed round the outside of the apparatus.

Regulation XXX.

Cubic Capacity of Lifeboats of Class 1.

1. The cubic capacity of a lifeboat of Class I shall be determined by Stirling’s (Simpson’s) Rule or by any other method giving the same degree of accuracy. The capacity of a square-

stemed boat shall be calculated as if the boat had a pointed stern.

2. For example, the capacity in cubic metres (or cubic feet) of

a boat, calculated by the aid of Stirling’s Rule, may be considered as given by the following formula :—

l

Capacity — (4A -f 2B -f- 4C)

l being the length of the boat in metres (or feet) from the inside of the planking or plating at the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post; in the case of a boat with a square stem, the length is measured to the inside of the transom.

A, B, C denote respectively the areas of the cross-sections at the quarter length forward, amidships, and the quarter length aft,

which correspond to the three points obtained by dividing l into four equal parts (the areas corresponding to the two ends of the boat are considered negligible).

153

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

{Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

The areas A, B, C shall be deemed to be given in square metres

(or square feet) by the successive application of the following formula to each of the three cross-sections :—

Jh

Area — (^ -1" 4b -)■ 2c -1- 4d -1- e)

h being the depth measured in metres (or in feet) inside the planking or plating from the keel to the level of the gunwale, or,

in certain cases, to a lower level, as determined hereafter.

a, b, c, d, e, denote the horizontal breadths of the boat measured in metres (or in feet) at the upper and lower points of the depth and at the three points obtained by dividing h into four equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme points, and c at the middle point, of h).

3. If the sheer of the gunwale, measured at the two points situated at a quarter of the length of the boat from the ends,

exceeds 1 per cent, of the length of the boat, the depth employed in calculating the area of the cross-sections A or C shall be deemed to be the depth amidships plus 1 per cent, of the length of the boat.

4. If the depth of the boat amidships exceeds 45 per cent, of the breadth, the depth employed in calculating the area of the midship cross-section B shall be deemed to be equal to 45 per cent, of the breadth, and the depth employed in calculating the areas of the quarter length Sections A and C is obtained by increasing this last figure by an amount equal to 1 per cent, of the length of the boat, provided that in no case shall the depths employed in the calculation exceed the actual depths at these points.

5. If the depth of the boat is greater than 122 centimetres

(equivalent to 4 feet) the number of persons given by the application of this rule shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio of

122 centimetres to the actual depth, until the boat has been satisfactorily tested afloat with that number of persons on board, all wearing life-jackets.

6. Each Administration shall impose, by suitable formulas, a

limit for the number of persons allowed in boats with very fine ends and in boats very full in form.

7. Each Administration reserves the right to assign to a boat

a capacity equal to the product of the length; the breadth and the depth multiplied by 0-6 if it is evident that this formula does not give a greater capacity than that obtained by the above method.

The dimensions shall then be measured in the following manner:—

Length.—From the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stem post or, in the case of a square stemed boat, to the after side of the transom.

Breadth.—From the outside of the planking at the point where the breadth of the boat is greatest.

Depth.—Amidships inside the planking from the keel to the level of the gunwale, but the depth used in calculating the cubic capacity may not in any case exceed 45 per cent,

of the breadth.

In all cases the shipowner has the right to require that the cubic capacity of the boat shall be determined by exact measurement.

8. The cubic capacity of a motorboat is obtained from the gross capacity by deducting a volume equal to that occupied by the motor and its accessories, and, when carried, the wireless telegraphy installation and the searchlight with their accessories.

Regulation XXXI.

Deck Area of Boats of Class II.

1. The area of the deck of a decked boat shall be determined by the method indicated below or by any other method giving the same degree of accuracy. The same rule is to be applied in determining the area within the fixed bulwarks of a boat of

Glass II (a).

2. For example, the surface in square metres (or square feet)

of a boat may be deemed to be given by the following formula :—

Area = — (2a -(- 1 *5b -f 4c -)~ 1 *5d -f- 2e)

l being the length in metres (or in feet) from the intersection of the Outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stem post.

a, b, c, d, e denote the horizontal breadths in metres (or in feet) outside the planking at the points obtained by dividing l

into four equal parts and sub-dividing the foremost and aftermost parts into two equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme sub-divisions, c at the middle point of the length, and

b and d at the intermediate points).

"Regulation XXXII.

Marking of Boats, Life Bafts and Buoyant Apparatus.

The dimensions of the boat and the number of persons which it is authorised to carry, shall be marked on it in clear permanent characters. These marks shall be specifically approved by the officers appointed to inspect the ship.

life rafts and buoyant apparatus shall be marked with thi number of persons in the same manner.

Regulation XXXIII.

Carrying Capacity of Boats.

1. The number of persons which a boat of one of the standard types can accommodate is equal to the greatest whole number

‘obtained by dividing the capacity in cubic metres (or cubic feet),

or the surface in square metres (or square feet), of the boat by the standard unit of capacity, or unit of surface (according to circumstances), defined below for each type.

2. The standard units of capacity and surface for determining the number of persons are as follows

3. The Administration may accept,

in place of 0 325 or 3|, as the case may be, a smaller divisor, if it is satisfied after trial that the number of persons for whom there is seating accommodation in the decked boat in question is greater than the number obtained by applying the above divisor, provided always that the divisor adopted in place of 0-325 or 3-jr, as the case may be, may never be less than 0 280 or 3, as the case may be.

The Administration which accepts a lower divisor in this way shall communicate to the other Administrations particulars of the trial and drawings of the decked boat in question.

Regulation XXXIV.

Capacity Limits.

No boat shall be marked for a greater number of persons than that obtained in the manner specified in these Regulations.

This number shall be reduced—

(1) when it is greater than the number of persons for which there is proper seating accommodation; the latter number shall be determined in such a way that the persons when seated do not interfere in any way with the use of the oars;

(2) when, in the case of boats other than those of Class I,

the freeboard when the boat is fully loaded is less than the freeboard laid down for each type respectively-;

the number shall be reduced until the freeboard when the boat is fully loaded is at least equal to the standard freeboard laid down above.

In boats of Class II (6) (i), the raised part of the deck at the sides may be regarded as affording seating accommodation.

Regulation XXXVII.

Stowage and Handling of Boats and Life Rafts.

1. Subject to the conditions of Regulation XXXVIII, the lifeboats may be stowed one above the other, or they may,

subject to such conditions as the Administration may impose, be fitted one within another, but where boats so fitted require lifting before being launched they shall only be permitted if mechanical power appliances for lifting are provided.

(2) The lifeboats and life rafts additional to boats stowed under boats attached to davits may be stowed across a deck,

bridge or poop and so secured that they will have the best chance of floating free of the ship if there is no time to launch them.

(3) As large a number as possible of the additional boats referred to in paragraph 2 shall be capable of being launched on either side of the ship by means of approved appliances for transferring them from one side of the deck to the other.

(4) Boats may only be stowed on more than one deck on condition that proper measures are taken to prevent boats on

a lower deck being fouled by those stowed on a deck above.

(5) Boats shall not be placed in the bows of the ship or in any positions in which they would be brought into dangerous proximity to the propellers at the time of launching.

(6) Davits shall be of approved form and so disposed on one or more decks that the boats placed under them can be safely lowered without interference from the operation of any other davits.

(7) The davits, blocks, falls and all other gear shall be of such strength that the boats can be safely lowered with the full complement of persons and equipment, with the ship listed to

15 degrees either way. The falls shall be long enough to reach the water with the vessel at her lightest seagoing draught and with a list of 15 degrees.

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

{Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

(8) The davits shall be fitted with gear of sufficient power to ensure that the boats, fully equipped and manned, but not otherwise loaded with passengers, can be turned out against the maximum list at which the lowering of the boats is possible.

(9) The boats attached to the davits shall have the falls ready for service, and means shall be provided for speedily, but not necessarily simultaneously, detaching the boats from the falls.

(10) . Where more than one boat is served by the same set of davits, if the falls are of rope, separate falls shall be provided to serve each boat, but where wire falls are used with mechanical appliances for recovering them, separate falls need not be provided. The appliances used must be such as to ensure lowering the boats in turn and rapidly.

Where mechanical appliances are fitted for the recovery of the falls efficient hand gear shall also be provided.

(11) On short international voyages where the height of the boat deck above the water line when the vessel is at her lightest sea-going draught does not exceed 4*5 metres (15 feet), the requirements as to strength of davits and tuming-out gear in sub-

paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 shall not apply.

Regulation XXXVIII.

Number and Capacity of Boats, Life Rafts, &c., and Davits.

(1) A ship shall be provided with sets of davits in accordance with its length as provided in Column A of the Table in Regulation XXXIX, provided that a number of sets of davits greater than the number of boats necessary for the accommodation of all the persons on board shall not be required.

Each set of davits shall have a boat of Class I attached to it.

If the lifeboats attached to davits do not provide sufficient accommodation for all the persons on board, additional lifeboats of one of the standard types shall be provided. One additional lifeboat shall, in the first place, be stowed under each of the boats attached to davits. After these have been fitted other boats shall be carried inboard, but an Administration may, if it is of opinion that life rafts will be more readily available and otherwise more satisfactory than these lifeboats in a case of emergency, allow life rafts to be carried provided that the total capacity of the boats on the ship will be at least up to the minimum capacity required by Column C of the Table in Regulation XXXIX,

When in the opinion of the Administration it is neither practicable nor reasonable to place on a ship the number of sets

Regulation XLV.

Musters and Drills.

Musters of the crew for boat drill shall take place weekly when practicable, and in vessels in which the voyage exceeds one week, before leaving port. The dates upon which musters are held shall be recorded in the Official Log Book and, if in any week a muster is not held, an entry shall be made stating why a

muster was not practicable.

In ships in which the voyage exceeds one week practice musters of ‘passengers should be held at an early period of each voyage.

Different groups of boats shall be used in turn at successive boat drills. The drills and inspections shall be so arranged that the crew thoroughly understand and are practised in the duties they have to perform, and that all lifesaving appliances with the gear appertaining to them are always ready for immediate use.

The emergency signal for summoning passengers to muster stations shall be a succession of more than six short blasts followed by one long blast on the whistle or syren. This shall be supplemented on all ships except those engaged in short international voyages by other electrically operated signals throughout the ship controlled from the bridge. The meaning of all signals affecting passengers shall be clearly stated in different languages on cards posted in their cabins and in other passenger quarters.

Safety of Navigation.

Regulation XLVI.

Transmission of Information.

The transmission of information regarding ice, derelicts,

tropical storms or any other direct danger to navigation is obligatory. The form in which the information is sent is not obligatory. It may be transmitted either in plain language

(preferably English) or by means of the International Code of

Signals (Wireless Telegraphy Section). It should be issued CQ

to all ships, and should also be sent to the first point of the coast to which communication can be made with a request that it be transmitted to the appropriate authority.

All messages issued under Article 34 of the present Convention will be preceded by the safety signal TTT followed by an indication of the nature. of the danger, thus:TTT Ice; TTT

Information Required.

The following information is desired, the time in all cases being Greenwich Mean Time:—

(a) Ice, Derelicts and other Direct Dangers to Navigation.

(1) the kind of ice, derelict or danger observed;

(2) the position of the ice, derelict or danger when last observed.

(3) the time and date when the observation was made.

(b) Tropical Storms. —(Hurricanes in the West Indies,

Typhoons in the China Seas, Cyclones in Indian waters, and storms of a similar nature in other regions.)

(1) A Statement that a Tropical Storm has been Encountered .—

This obligation should be interpreted in a broad spirit,

and information transmitted whenever the master has good reason to believe that a tropical storm exists in his neighbourhood.

(2) Meteorological Information. —In view of the great assistance given by accurate meteorological data in fixing the position and movement of storm centres, each shipmaster should add to his warning message as much of the following meteorological information as he finds practicable:—

(a) barometric pressure (millibars, inches or millimetres);

(b) change in barometric pressure (the change during the previous two to four hours);

(c) wind direction (true not magnetic);

(d) wind force (Beaufort or decimal scale);

(e) state of the sea (smooth, moderate, rough, high);

(f) swell (slight, medium, heavy) and the direction from which it comes.

When barometric pressure is given the word "millibars, "

" inches " or " millimetres, " as the case may be, should be added to the reading, and it should always be stated whether the reading is corrected or uncorrected.

When changes of the barometer are reported the course and speed of the ship should also be given.

All directions should be true, not magnetic.

(3) Time and Date and Position of the Ship. —These should be for the time and position when the meteorological observations reported were made and not when the message was prepared or despatched. The time used in all cases should be Greenwich Mean Time.

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

{Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

(4) Subsequent Observations .—When a master has reported

a tropical storm it is desirable, but not obligatory,

that other observations be made and transmitted at intervals of three hours, so long as the ship remains under the influence of the storm.

Final Act of the International Conference on

Safety of Life at Sea.

a

I.

At the moment of signing title Convention for the Safety of

Life at Sea concluded this day, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have agreed on the following:—

Safety Operators.

In order to ensure the coming into foree at an early date of the international agreement to make the installation of radiotelegraphy obligatory on all cargo ships of 1, 600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, and thereby to promote the general safety of life at sea, the Contracting Governments undertake to use their efforts to promote an amendment to the Radiotelegraph

Convention to the effect that the requirements as to the minimum speed of operation to be attained by an operator on board a

compulsorily fitted ship should be laid down as follows:—

" Correct transmission and correct reception by car of code groups (mixed letters, figures and punctuation marks) at a speed of 16 (sixteen) groups per minute. .

Each code group must comprise 5 (five) characters,

each figure or punctuation mark counting as 2 (two)

characters."

Should the International Radiotelegraph Conference find itself unable to approve of the above proposal, the present

Conference is of opinion that a new Certificate with operating qualifications as set out above should be established, and that the holders of such Certificate should be authorised to deal with

175

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

' (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

public correspondence in ship stations of the Third Class a3

defined by the Washington Radiotelegraph Convention.

n.

The Conference takes note of the following declarations, made by the undermentioned delegations :—

(A.)

The Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America formally declare that the signing of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at .Sea by them, on the part of the United

States of America, on this date, is not to be construed to mean that the Government of the United States of America recognizes

a regime or entity which signs or accedes to the Convention as the Government of a country when that regime or entity is not recognized by the Government of the United States of America as the Government of that country.

The Plenipotentiaries of the United States^ of America further declare that the participation of the United States Of

America in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea signed on this date does not involve any contractual obligation on the part of the United States of America to a

Country, represented by a regime or entity which the Government of the United States of America does not recognize as the

Government of that country, until such country has a Government recognized by the Government of the United States of

America.

(B.)

The Delegation of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics declares that the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet

Republics, not being a party to the International Radiotelegraph

Convention of 1927, does not consider itself bound by the undertaking embodied in Part I of this Final Act, but will, upon ratification of the International Convention for the Safety Of

Life at Sea, apply and give full effect to those articles of the last-named Convention and its annexes, where reference is made to provisions of the said Radiotelegraph Convention, as parties to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea only.

III.

The Conference also adopts the following recommendations :—

AS REGARDS CONSTRUCTION.

1 . Stability.

The necessity for and practicability of adopting stability regulations have been considered by this Conference, and the

1st Sch.

— cont.

176 Ch. 9. C Merchant Shipping > - 22 Geo. 5.

{Safely and.Load Line Conventions) Act, -\§2>2..

* ?, '-, i* ' '

1st Sch, opinion has been reached that at this time it is practicable to

—emit. ... adopt only the general requirement for stability tests on new

., passenger ships contained in Article 8. The Conference desires,

j, however, to draw the attention of the Contracting Governments to the desirability of a study by each Administration of the

■' • subject of stability for the different national types of ships and

. trades, and of the exchange of information on .this subject between these Contracting Governments.

2. Openings in Bulkheads and Ship’s Sides.

The objection which attaches to openings, which may sometimes be open at sea, in the sides of ships and in the main transverse watertight bulkheads is recognised by this Conference, but it is the sense of the Conference that it is not at this time practicable to adopt international regulations concerning such openings which are more exacting than those incorporated in the

Regulations. The Conference recommends, however, that the various Governments make special effort to assure that the number of such openings, particularly hinged sidescuttles below the margin line and doors low down in the machinery space bulkheads, be kept at the minimum required in each case.

3. Services of Special Risk.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea realises that there are trades, such as the passenger services between England and the nearby Continental ports, in which the sea risks are, owing to weather and traffic conditions, exceptional,

and where it is practicable, owing to the absence of general cargo,

to adopt a higher standard of subdivision than that prescribed by the Convention. The Conference, therefore, recommends that the Contracting Governments concerned consider the adoption, in the case of ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers in such trades, of such improved standards of subdivision as may be found reasonable and practicable.

AS REGARDS LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES, &C.

4. Means of Clinging to Boats.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea recommends that the Contracting Governments should consider the practicability of requiring lifeboats carried on ships registered in their ports to be fitted with means to enable persons to cling to the boats if upturned in the water, without increasing the risks incident to the lowering of the boats.

5, Dangerous Ooods.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea recommends that every possible effort should be made with a view to attaining an international agreement as to what goods should be considered as " dangerous goods " as mentioned in Article 24

of the Present Convention and of fixing uniform rules for the packing and stowage of such goods.

As REGARDS RADIOTELEGRAPHY.

6. Alarm Signal.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea,

having approved of the use of the automatic alarm receiver for watch-keeping purposes, and anticipating that a large number of these receivers will be installed in passenger and cargo ships in the near future, recommends that the next International

Radiotelegraph Conference prescribe that " the alarm signal shall, as a general rule, precede the distress signal"

7. Cyclone Warnings .

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea,

considering that it is of more importance to prevent disaster than to render assistance after a disaster has occurred, and being of the opinion that in certain cases use may be made of the autoalarm to this end, strongly recommends that the next International Radiotelegraph Conference authorise Governments to permit coast stations under their jurisdiction to precede the broadcasting of emergency cyclone warnings by the alarm signal.

8. Wave Lengths.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea draws the attention of the Governments concerned to the advisability of ensuring that signals of distress utilising waves of Type A2

shall he effective over a sufficiently wide band of frequencies.

The Conference also desires to draw attention to the provisions of Article 5, § 11, of the Regulations annexed to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, Washington, 1927, and to point out that radiotelephonic transmissions on frequencies in the neighbourhood of the distress wave will render inoperative automatic alarm receivers working on the alarm signal defined in

Article 19, § 21 (e), of the above-mentioned Regulations. The

Conference desires, therefore, to emphasise the importance, in the interests of safety of life at sea, of avoiding the use of radio-

telephonic emissions in the neighbourhood of the distress wave,

except in case of emergency.

AS REGAKDS SAFETY OE NAVIGATION.

9. Radio Aids to Navigation.

Tiie International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea recommends that the Contracting Governments should establish and maintain an adequate system of radio aids to navigation,

and should take all necessary measures to ensure the efficiency and reliability of such services.

10. Synchronised Radio and Under-Water Signals.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea favours the extension of the installation of distance-finding apparatus capable of emitting synchronised radio and under-water signals,

as necessary to meet navigational needs in distance-finding and position finding by vessels.

11. Depth-Sounding Apparatus.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea recommends that the Contracting Governments should encourage the development and use of echo depth-sounding apparatus.

12. Life-Saving Signals.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea considers that the signals for life-saving stations communicating with vessels in distress and signals for vessels in distress communicating with life-saving stations should be international.

13. Shore Lights.

The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea considers that, so far as practicable, steps should be taken by the

Administrations concerned to regulate the position and the intensity of lights on land in the vicinity of the entrances to ports so as to ensure that such lights cannot be mistaken for,

or do not impair the visibility of, the navigation lights of the port.

14. Collision Regulations. — Aircraft.

Under the International Collision Regulations, aircraft on the surface of the water are within the definition of "steam vessels."

As such, they are required to carry lights, make sound signals and manoeuvre, both in respect of surface vessels and of each other, in a maimer that is not, in some instances, possible for them, due to the physical limitations of aircraft. At the same time, they can and should take upon themselves some definite

179

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

measure of responsibility for the avoidance of collisions between surface vessels and aircraft on the surface of the water, and it is necessary that their rights and duties, when on the surface of the water, should be defined.

In order that an international agreement may be reached covering those provisions of the International Collision Regulations which apply to surface vessels and to aircraft on the surface of the high seas and on the waters connected therewith, navigable by sea-going vessels, the Conference recommends, in the interests of safety of life at sea, that this question should be studied by the competent authorities in the countries concerned,

so that there may be an exchange of views, and an endeavour made to arrive at an international agreement. The Conference requests the Government of the United Kingdom, of Great

Britain and Northern Ireland to take the necessary action in the matter.

15. Becognition of Convention Standards.

Recognising the importance of bringing the Convention standards into operation at the earliest possible date, it is recommended that all such steps as may be practicable should be taken by the Contracting Governments to secure the recognition in international trade as from the date of the signing of this Convention of such ships as in fact conform to such standards.

In faith whereof the undersigned have affixed their signatures to the present Act.

Rude XXXII.

Length (L).

The length used with the Rules and Freeboard Table is the length in feet on the summer load water-line from the foreside of the stem to the afterside of the rudder post. Where there is no rudder post, the length is measured from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock. For ships with cruiser stems, the length is to be taken as 96 per cent, of the total length on the designed summer load water-line or as the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock if that be the greater.

Rule XXXIII.

Rule XXXIV.

Moulded Depth.

The moulded depth is the vertical distance in feet, measured amidships, from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character,

or where thick garboards are fitted, the depth is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

Rule XXXV.

Depth for Freeboard (D).

The depth used with the Freeboard Table is the moulded

m /t q\

depth plus the thickness of stringer plate, or plus—Up—- if that be greater, where—

T is the mean thickness of the exposed deck clear of deck openings, and

S is the total length of superstructures as defined in Rule XL.

Where the topsides are of unusual form, D is the depth of a

midship section having vertical topsides, standard round of beam and area of topside section equal to that in the actual midship section. Where there is a step or break in the topsides (e.g.,

as in the Turret Deck ship) 70 per oeut. of the area above the step or break is included in the area used to determine the equivalent section.

In a ship without an enclosed superstructure covering at least *6 L amidships, without a complete trunk or without a

combination of intact partial superstructures and trunk extending all fore and aft, where D is less than the depth used with the

Table is not to be taken as less than

35 A

c =

L.B.dj ’

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9. 207

(Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932.

where A is the ship’s moulded displacement in tons (excluding . 2nd Sch.

bossing) at a mean moulded draught di which is 85 per cent, of —eont.

the moulded depth.

The coefficient C is not to be taken as less than 68.

Rule XXXVII.

Strength.

The Assigning Authority is to be satisfied with the structural strength of ships to which freeboards are assigned.

Ships which comply with the highest standard of the rules of a Classification Society recognised by the Administration, shall be regarded as having sufficient strength for the minimum freeboards allowed under the Rules.

Ships which do not comply with the highest standard of the rules of a Classification Society recognised by the Administration,

shall be assigned such increased freeboards as shall be determined by the Assigning Authority, and for guidance the following strength moduli are formulated; —

Material. —The strength moduli are based on the assumption that the structure is built of mild steel, manufactured by the open hearth process (acid or basic), and having a tensile strength of

26 to 32 tons per square inch, and an elongation of at least 16 per cent, on a length of 8 inches.

Strength Deck. —The strength deck is the uppermost deck which is incorporated into and forms an integral part of the longitudinal girder within the half-length amidships.

Depth to Strength Deck (Ds), —The depth to strength deck is the vertical distance in feet amidships from the top of the keel to the top of the strength deck beam at side.

Draught (d).—The draught is the vertical distance in feet amidships from the top of the keel to the centre of the disc.

Longitudinal Modulus. —The longitudinal modulus -i- is the moment of inertia I of the midship section about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the top of the strength deck beam at side, calculated in way of openings but without deductions for rivet holes. Areas are measured in square inches and distances in feet.

Below the strength deck, all continuous longitudinal members other than such parts of under deck girders as are required entirely for supporting purposes, are included. Above the strength deck, the gunwale angle bar and the extension of the sheerstrake are the only members included.

This formula applies where L does not exceed 600 feet; B is between Jq + 6 and -f 20, both inclusive, and j^is between

10 and 13*5, both inclusive.

Frame .—For the purpose of the frame modulus, the frame is regarded as composed of a frame angle and a reverse angle each of the same size and thickness.

Frame Modulus .—The modulus - of the midship frame below

F

the lowest tier of beams is the moment of inertia I of the frame section about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the extremity of the frame section,

calculated without deduction for rivet and bolt holes. The modulus is measured in inch units.

The required frame modulus is expressed by - —

where—

s is the frame spacing in inches.

t is the vertical distance in feet measured at amidships from the top of the keel to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (see Figure 2);

where there is no double bottom, t is measured to a point midway

209

1932. Merchant Shipping Ch. 9.

between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side.

fj is a coefficient depending on H, which, in ships fitted with double bottoms, is the vertical distance in feet from the middle of the beam bracket of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (see Figure 2). Where there is no double bottom, H is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side. Where the frame obtains additional strength from the form of the ship, due allowance is made in the value of f 1 .

f 2 is a coefficient depending on K, which is the vertical distance in feet from the top of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point 7 feet 6 inches above the freeboard deck at side, or, if there is a superstructure, to a point 12 feet 6 inches above the freeboard deck at side (see Figure 2).

Effective Length of Enclosed Superstructures with Middle Line

Openings.

Rule LII.

Enclosed Superstructure with Middle Line Openings in the deck not Provided with Permanent Means of Closing.

Where there is an enclosed superstructure with one or more middle line openings in the deck not provided with permanent means of closing (see Rules VJJI to XVI), the effective length of the superstructure is determined as follows:—

(1) Where efficient temporary closing appliances are not provided for the middle line deck openings (see

Rule XLV), or the breadth of opening is 80 per cent, or more of the breadth B^ of the superstructure deck at the middle of the opening, the ship is considered as having an open well in way of each opening, and freeing ports are to be provided in way of this well. The effective length of superstructure between openings is governed by Rules XLVII, XLIX, and L.

(2) Where efficient temporary closing appliances are provided for middle line deck openings and the breadth of opening is less than *8 B 1(the effective length is governed by

Rules XLVn, XLIX, and L, except that where access openings in ’tween deck bulkheads are closed by

Class 2 closing appliances, they are regarded as being closed by Class 1 closing appliances in determining the effective length. The total effective length is obtained by

Sheer,

Rule LIV.

General.

The sheer is measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line at amidships.

In ships designed to trim by the stem in service, the sheer may be measured in relation to the load line, provided an additional mark is placed at *25 L forward of amidships, to indicate the assigned load line. This mark is to be similar to the load line disc amidships.

In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures the sheer is measured at the freeboard deck.

In ships with topsides of unusual form in which there is a

step or break in the topsides, the sheer is considered in relation to the equivalent depth amidships (see Rule XXXV).

In ships with a superstructure of standard height which extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer is measured at the superstructure deck; where the height exceeds the standard, the sheer may be considered in relation to the standard height.

Where a superstructure is intact or access openings in its enclosing bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 closing appliances,

and the superstructure deck has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck is not taken into account.

Rule LVI.

Measurement of Variations from Standard Sheer Profile.

Where the sheer profile differs from the standard, the seven ordinates of each profile are multiplied by the appropriate factors given in the table of ordinates. The difference between the sums of the respective products, divided by 18, measures the deficiency or excess of sheer. Where the after half of the sheer profile is greater than the standard and the forward half is less than the standard, no credit is allowed for the part in excess and the deficiency only is measured.

Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the standard, and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than

75 per cent, of the standard, credit is allowed for the part in excess; where the after part is less than 50 per cent, of the standard no credit is given for the excess Bheer forward. Where the after sheer is between 60 per cent, and 75 per cent, of the standard, intermediate allowances may be granted for excess sheer forward.

Rule LVII.

Correction for Variations from Standard Sheer Profile.

The correction for sheer is the deficiency or excess of sheer

s

(see Rule LVI), multiplied by 75 — where S is the total length of superstructure, as defined in Rule XL.

Rule LVIII.

Addition for Deficiency in Sheer.

Where the sheer is less than the standard, the correction for deficiency in sheer (see Rule LVII) is added to the freeboard.

Rule LIX.

Deduction for Excess Sheer.

In flush deck ships and in ships where an enclosed superstructure covers 1 L before and 1 L abaft amidships, the correction for excess of sheer (see Rule LVII) is deducted from the freeboard; in ships with detached superstructures where no enclosed superstructure 'covers amidships, no deduction is made from the freeboard; where an enclosed superstructure covers less than 1 L before and 1 L abaft amidships, the deduction is obtained by interpolation. The maximum deduction for excess sheer is 1£ inches at 100 feet and increases at the rate of 1| inches for each additional 100 feet in the length of the ship.

Rule LX.

Standard Round of Beam.

The standard round of beam of the freeboard deck is one-

Rule LXI.

Bound of Beam Correction.

Where the round of beam of the freeboard deck is greater or less than the standard, the freeboard is decreased or increased respectively by one-fourth of the difference between the actual and the standard round of beam, multiplied by the proportion of the length of the freeboard deck not covered by enclosed superstructures. Twice the standard round of beam is the maximum for which allowance is given.

Minimum Freeboards.

Rule LXIL

Summer Freeboard.

The minimum freeboard in Summer is the freeboard derived from the Freeboard Table after corrections for departures from the standards and after deduction for superstructures.

The freeboard in salt water measured from the intersection of the upper surface of the freeboard deck with the outer surface of the shell is not to be less than 2 inches.

Rule LXIII.

Tropical Freeboard.

The minimum freeboard in the Tropical Zone is the freeboard obtained by a deduction from the Summer freeboard of i inch per foot of Summer draught measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the disc.

The freeboard in salt water measured from the intersection of the upper surface of the freeboard deck with the outer surface of the shell is not to be less than 2 inches.

Rule LXIV.

Winter Freeboard.

The minimum freeboard in Winter is the freeboard obtained by an addition to the Summer freeboard of J inch per foot of

Summer draught, measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the disc.

Rule LXV.

Winter North Atlantic Freeboard.

The minimum freeboard for ships not exceeding 330 feet in length on voyages across the North Atlantic, North of latitude

Rule LXXI.

Depth for Freeboard (D).

In sailing ships having a greater rate of rise of floor than li inches per foot, the vertical distance from the top of keel

(Rule XXXIV), is reduced by half the difference between the total rise of floor at the half-breadth of the ship and the total rise at 1J inches per foot. 2J inches per foot of half-breadth is the maximum rate of rise for which a deduction is made.

Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or thick garboards axe fitted, the depth is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

The depth used with the Freeboard Table is to be taken as not less than

Desiring to promote safety of life and property at sea by establishing in common agreement uniform principles and rules with regard to the limits to which ships on international voyages may be loaded;

Having decided to participate in an international conference which, upon the invitation of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was held in London;

Appointed the following delegations :•—

In the course of a series of meetings between the 20th May,

1930, and the 5th July, 1930, a Load Line Convention, dated the 6th July, 1930, was drawn up.

I.

The Conference takes note of the following declarations made by the undermentioned delegation:—

The Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America formally declare that the signing of the International Load

Line Convention by them, on the part of the United States of America, on this date, is not to be construed to mean that the Government of the United States of America recognizes a

regime or entity which signs or accedes to the Convention as the Government of a country when that regime or entity is not recognised by the Government of the United States of

America as the Government of that country.

The Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America further declare that the participation of the United States of America in the International Load Line Convention signed on this date does not involve any contractual obligation on the part of the

United States of America to a country, represented by a regime or entity which the Government of the United States of America does not recognise as the Government of that country, until such country has a Government recognised by the Government of the United States of America.

The Conference also adopts the following recommendations:—

Ships of less than 150 tons gross Engaged on International

Voyages.

The Conference recommends that such regulations as may be made by any of the Contracting Governments relating to ships of less than 150 tons gross engaged on international voyages should, so far as practicable and reasonable, be framed in accordance with the principles and rules laid down in this

Convention, and should whenever possible be made after consultation and agreement with the Governments of the other countries concerned in such international voyages.

As under the Rules attached to this Convention, ships which comply with the highest standard laid down in the rules of a classification society recognised by the Administration are regarded as having sufficient strength for the minimum freeboards allowed Under the rules, the Conference recommends that each

Administration should request the Society or Societies which it has recognised to confer from time to time with the Societies recognised by other Administrations, with a view to securing as much uniformity as possible in the application of the standards of strength on which freeboard is based.

Annual Surveys.

The Conference recommends that, if possible, each Administration should make arrangements for the periodical inspections referred to in paragraph (3) (c) of Article 14 to be held at intervals of approximately twelve months so far as concerns the maintenance of the fittings and appliances referred to in

Condition B of paragraph 3 of that Article (i.e., the fittings and appliances for the (i) protection of openings, (ii) guard rails, (hi) freeing ports and (iv) means of access to crews ’

quarters).

Information regarding Damage to Tankers.

The Conference recommends that the Governments of the countries to which tankers belong shall keep records of all structural and deck damage to these ships caused by stress of weather, so that information with regard to these matters may be available.

In faith whereof the undersigned have affixed their signatures to the present Act.

CHAPTER 24.

An Act to secure to growers of home-grown millable wheat a standard price and a market therefor;

to make provision for imposing on millers and importers of flour obligations to make payments calculated by reference to a quota of such wheat and as to the disposal of the moneys thereby received; to provide for such millers being required to purchase unsold stocks of such wheat; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[12th May 1932.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) If, in any cereal year, the ascertained average price of home-grown millable wheat is less than the standard price, every registered grower shall, subject to the provisions of this Act and of any regulations or byelaws made thereunder, be entitled to receive from the

Wheat Commission in respect of every hundredweight of such wheat of his own growing sold by him in that year,

not being wheat harvested before the year' nineteen hundred and thirty-two, a payment (hereinafter referred to as a " deficiency payment ") representing, subject, to the deduction to be made under the provisions of this Act relating to administrative expenses, the difference

Wheat Act, 1932.

329

1932.

Ch. 24.

(hereinafter referred to as the " price deficit ") between the said average price and the standard price:

Provided that, if in any cereal year the quantity of home-grown millable wheat of their own growing sold by registered growers exceeds the anticipated supply of such wheat for that year, each registered grower shall be entitled to receive deficiency payments for that year

, in respect only of that number of hundredweights which bears to the number of hundredweights of such wheat of his own growing sold by him in that year the same proportion as the said anticipated supply bears to the quantity of home-grown millable wheat of their own growing sold by registered growers in that year.

(2) For the purposes of this Act wheat sold by a

registered grower shall be deemed to be of his own growing if it was grown on land forming part of a farm of which he was the occupier at the" date of the sale, so,

however, that no. wheat shall be deemed- to be of his own growing if it has been removed from the farm before being despatched on delivery after the sale,

otherwise than in accordance with' the byelaws of the

Wheat Commission.

(3) If in the month of June in any year after the year nineteen hundred and thirty-two the Wheat Commission make a representation to the Minister that it is expedient that any stocks of home-grown millable wheat then harvested, being wheat sown during the last preceding cereal year, should be bought by the Flour

Millers’ Corporation, the Minister may, by order made before the end of the cereal year in which the representation was made, require that corporation to buy from the registered growers to whom the order relates such part of those stocks as remains unsold by them when the order comes into force:

Provided that the orders made under this subsection in any cereal year shall not require the Flour

Millers’ Corporation to buy more than twelve-and-a-half per cent, of the anticipated supply for that year.

(4) Any order made under the last foregoing subsection shall specify a price, not exceeding the standard price, estimated by the Minister, after consultation with the Wheat Commission, to be, as nearly as may be, the price which would, in the area to which the order relates and at the date on which the order comes into force.

330

Ch. 24. Wheat Act, 1932. 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

be obtained by a willing seller from a willing buyer for home-grown millable wheat of fair average quality, and

* all wheat to be bought from a registered grower in pursuance of the requirements of any such order shall be bought at such prices as may be determined according to quality and market conditions, by reference to the price specified in the order, in accordance with the byelaws of the Wheat Commission.

Any such order shall also specify the period within which the wheat to which the order relates is to be bought by the Flour Millers’ Corporation, and that corporation shall take delivery thereof within that period.

(5) If, within the period within which any wheat is required by an order made under this section to be bought,

or within such further time as the Wheat Commission may, on the application of the corporation made within that period, allow, objection is made, in such manner as may be provided by the byelaws of the Wheat Commission,

by or on behalf of the Flour Millers’ Corporation, that any of that wheat—

(a) is not home-grown; or

(b) is not millable wheat; or

(c) is not of the quality according to which the price has been so determined as aforesaid;

then, if it is determined by arbitration in accordance with the said byelaws that the wheat objected to is not homegrown mifiable wheat, the order shall cease to have effect as respects that wheat, or if it is so determined that the wheat objected to, though home-grown millable wheat,

is of lower quality than that according to which the price has been determined, the requirements of the order shall be deemed to be complied with as respects that wheat if it is bought by the corporation at such lower price as the arbitrator may allow.

(6) If any person from whom the Flour Millers ’

Corporation have been required by an order made under this section to buy any stocks of wheat proves with respect to any quantity of such wheat—

(a) that default has been made by the corporation in buying and taking delivery of that quantity within the period specified in the order or within such further time as the Minister may, on the application of the corporation made within that period, have allowed; and

1932.

Wheat Act, 1932.

Ch. 24.

(b) either that no objection that the quantity is not

a quantity of home-grown millable wheat has been duly made in accordance with the pro- >

visions of the last foregoing subsection or that the quantity has been determined in accordance with those provisions to be a quantity of homegrown millable wheat; and

(c) that he was at all material times ready and willing to sell and deliver the quantity to the corporation at the price determined or allowed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section;

he shall be entitled to recover as a debt due to him from the corporation a sum equal to the amount which would have been payable for the quantity if it had been bought at the price so determined as aforesaid, and upon any sum being so recovered, or becoming payable under a

judgment given therefor, the wheat in respect of which the sum was recovered, or judgment given, shall be forfeited to the Wheat Commission, who may dispose of •

it as they think fit.

The Wheat Commission may, if they think fit, take proceedings as trustees for all or any persons entitled to take proceedings for the recovery of any sums due to them under this subsection; and, without prejudice to any other remedy, any sums recoverable under this subsection may be recovered summarily as a civil debt.

(7) Any wheat which is bought from a registered grower by the Flour Millers’ Corporation in accordance with the requirements of ah order made under this section, or which is forfeited to the Commission under the last foregoing subsection, shall be deemed for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section to have been sold by that grower on the date on which the order came into force.

(8) The Flour Millers’ Corporation may make arrangements for the purchase by any person on their behalf of wheat required by any such order as aforesaid to be bought by the corporation, and any wheat bought in pursuance of the requirements of any such order may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the corporation in such manner as they think fit.

2.—(1) As soon as practicable after the cereal year ending on the thirty-first day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and after the end of every subsequent cereal year the Minister shall, after consultation with the Wheat Commission, by order prescribe the price which he determines to have been the average price obtained by registered growers throughout the United

Kingdom for home-grown millable wheat of their own growing sold by them in that year; and in this Act the expression "ascertained average price" means, in relation to any cereal year, the price so prescribed as respects that year.

(2) The order made under the last foregoing subsection as respects any cereal year shall also contain a

certificate by the Minister certifying the quantity of *

home-grown millable wheat of their own growing sold by registered growers in that year, and, for the purposes of the proviso to subsection (lj of section one of this Act, that certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the quantity aforesaid.

(3) In this Act the expression "standard price "

means the price of ten shillings per hundredweight:

Provided that, not later than the first day of March,

nineteen hundred and thirty-five, the Minister shall appoint a committee of three persons, who, after considering general economic conditions and the conditions affecting the agricultural industry, shall report to the Minister as to the desirability of making any alteration in the standard price, and, if that committee make to the. Minister a recommendation that the standard price should be altered, the Minister may by order substitute for the price aforesaid, as from the first day of August, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, such price as may be specified in the order, but the order shall be provisional only and shall have no effect until confirmed by Parliament.

(4) The Minister shall, after consultation with the

Wheat Commission, by order prescribe at or as soon as practicable after the beginning of every cereal year, the quantity of home-grown millable wheat of their own growing which he anticipates will be sold by registered growers during that year, and any such order made with respect to any cereal year may be varied by a subsequent order made in like manner before the end of the month of

333

January in that cereal year; and, subject as hereinafter provided, in this Act the expression "anticipated supply "

means, in relation to any cereal year, the quantity so prescribed with respect to that year by the order for the time being in force:

Provided that—

(a) if the quantity of home-grown inillable wheat prescribed under this subsection in relation to any cereal year exceeds twenty-seven million hundredweights, the anticipated supply shall, except for the purposes of the proviso to subsection (3) of section one of this Act,

be taken to be twenty-seven million hundredweights;

(b) in prescribing the anticipated supply for any cereal year the Minister shall assume that seven and a half per cent, of the home-grown millable wheat available in that year will be retained for seed and not sold by registered growers.

3.—(1) For the purpose of meeting the expenditure Quota pay-

to be defrayed by the Wheat Commission under this Act, ments by every miller and every importer of flour shall be liable to make to the Wheat Commission, in respect of each imp0

hundredweight of his output of flour, a payment (hereinafter referred to as a " quota payment ") of an amount calculated and prescribed in accordance with the provisions of this section so as to represent, as nearly as may be, a sum equal to what would have been the price deficit in respect of the quota of home-grown millable wheat used in the production of that hundredweight, if the anticipated supply of such wheat for the cereal year in which that hundredweight was delivered had been used at a uniform rate per hundredweight of flour in the production of the estimated supply of flour for that year:

Provided that a miller shall not be liable to make quota payments in respect of any hundredweight of his output which is, in accordance with the byelaws of the

Wheat Commission, proved to the satisfaction of the

Commission to consist only of meal delivered by him for *

consumption, without further manufacture, as animal or poultry food, and if any miller satisfies the Commission that his output during any cereal year will

Ch. 24.

Wheat Act, 1932.

22 & 23 Geo. 5.

not comprise any flour other than meal, and that the whole of that flour will be consumed, without further manufacture, as animal or poultry food, the Commission may, in accordance with the byelaws of the Commission,

grant him a certificate (hereinafter referred to as a

" provender miller’s certificate ") certifying that he is exempt from liability to make quota payments in

’ respect of his output of such flour during that year,

so, however, that any such certificate may be revoked if at any time the Commission cease to be so satisfied as aforesaid.

(2) The quota payment in respect of any hundredweight of the output of a miller or importer of flour shall accrue due when that hundredweight is delivered.

(3) The quota payments to be made under this section shall be of such amount as may be prescribed by order of the Minister, and, for the purpose of calculating the amount to be so prescribed, the Minister shall, after consultation with the Wheat Commission,

estimate—

(a) the average price obtainable by registered growers throughout the United Kingdom for home-grown nullable wheat sold and to be sold by them in the cereal year in which the order will come into force, and the price deficit per hundredweight of such wheat;

(b) the supply of flour for that year, that is to say,

that part of the output of millers and importers of flour which, in his opinion, will in that year be* delivered and retained for consumption or use in the United Kingdom, excluding meal to be consumed, without further manufacture, as animal or poultry food;

and (subject to the provisions of this Act relating to the adjustment of surpluses and deficiences in the Wheat

Fund) the amount to be prescribed shall be the amount which bears to the estimated price deficit the same proportion as that which the number of hundredweights in the anticipated supply of home-grown millable wheat for that year bears to the number of hundredweights in the estimated supply of flour for that year.

(4) If at any time during a cereal year the Minister considers that, for the purpose of securing that the

1932.

Wheat Act, 1932.

Ch. 24.

335

average amount of the quota payments which will have accrued due during the cereal year shall more nearly represent the sum mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, it is expedient so to do, he may, after consultation with' the Wheat Commission, by a subsequent order supersede the order theretofore in force under this section as from the date of the subsequent order.

(5) Any order made under this section shall state the estimated price deficit, the anticipated supply of home grown millable wheat, and the estimated supply Of

flour, upon the basis of which the amount prescribed by the order is calculated.

(6) Any order in force under this section shall remain in force until superseded by a subsequent order,

and the amount of every quota payment to be made under this section shall be the amount prescribed by the ofder in force when the payment accrues due, notwithstanding the close of the cereal year in which the order was made, so, however, that a new order shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the beginning of each cereal year.

4.—(1) If, in accordance with the byelaws of the Repay-

Wheat Commission, it is proved to the satisfaction of the ments in

Commission that quota payments have been duly made respect of in respect of any flour and that the flour has been exported or shipped as stores, a repayment shall be made or p©d°as allowed by the Commission to the exporter, and the stores and amount of the repayment to be so made or allowed in in respect respect of any quantity of flour, as at the date on which it exported is exported or shipped as stores, shall be an amount equal bread -

to the quota payments payable in respect of a like quantity delivered on that date.

(2) If, in accordance with the byelaws of the Wheat

Commission, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commission with respect to any bread that the bread has been exported and that all the flour from which the bread was made was flour in respect of which quota payments have been duly made, a repayment shall be made or allowed by the Commission to the exporter, and the amount of the repayment to be so made or allowed in respect of any such bread, as at the date on which it is exported, shall be calculated at such a rate that the amount of the repayment in respect of every three hundred and seventy-six *

the districts of the constituent authorities; or

(b) to adopt, with or without modifications, a scheme proposed by all or any of the owners of any such land.

(2) A resolution passed under the foregoing subsection shall not take effect unless and until it is approved by the Minister, and the Minister in giving his approval may vary the extent of the land to be .included in the area to which the resolution is to apply, but the Minister shall not approve any such resolution unless he is satisfied—

(a) in the case of any land already built upon, that public improvements are likely to be made, or other development is likely to take place,

within such a period of time and on such a

scale as to make the inclusion of the land in a

scheme expedient, or that the land comprises buildings or other objects of architectural,

historic or artistic interest, or that the land is so situate that the general object of the scheme would be better secured by its inclusion;

(b) in the case of land which is neither already built upon nor in course of development, nor likely to be developed, that the land is so situated in relation to land which is already built upon,

Or in course of development, or on which development is likely to take place, as to make its inclusion in a scheme expedient, or that it comprises objects or places of natural interest or beauty:

Provided that nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the Minister from approving a resolution adopting a scheme comprising land in respect of which he is not satisfied that the conditions specified in this subsection are complied with, if the scheme has been proposed

1932. Town and Country Ch. 48. 729

Planning Act, 1932.

by the owners of not less than two-thirds of that land and approved by not less than three-fourths of the owners of that land.

(3) A local authority or joint committee, before passing a resolution which will apply to—

(i) any land not within the district or, as the case may be, districts aforesaid; or

(ii) any land to which either a resolution to prepare or adopt a scheme, or a scheme, being a

resolution or scheme passed or made by another authority or committee, applies,

shall consult with every authority or committee who will be affected thereby.

(4) A resolution of a local authority or joint committee to prepare a scheme may be revoked, either as to the whole or any part of the area to which it applies,

by a subsequent resolution of the authority or committee,

or, if the Minister thinks that in the special circumstances of the case the resolution should be so revoked, by order of the Minister;

Provided that—

(a) a resolution under this subsection shall require the approval of the Minister, and the Minister may refuse to approve it except subject to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose; and

(b) before making an order under this subsection the Minister shall inform the authority or committee, as the case may be, of the order which he proposes to make and, if within twenty-eight days the authority or committee request him so to do, shall cause a local inquiry to be held into the matter.

(5) In giving his approval to a resolution under the last foregoing subsection, and in making an order thereunder, the Minister shall by the imposition of conditions or, as the case may be, by the terms of his order secure that—

Ch. 48. Town and Country 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

Planning Act, 1932.

made to him under an interim development order, to grant an application for permission to develop the property, or that the Minister has imposed any conditions on the grant of an application made since that date; and

(ii) any person who, for the purpose of complying with any conditions imposed on the grant of such an application, has since the commencement of tins Act incurred expenditure which is rendered abortive by the revocation of the resolution to prepare a scheme,

shall be entitled, if he makes a claim for the purpose within twelve months from the date when the resolution is approved or the order is made, as the case may be,

to claim compensation from such authority as may be specified in the condition or order:

Provided that the Minister shall not secure a right to compensation in respect of any injurious affection of property arising from refusal to permit any development, or from the imposition of any conditions, where he is satisfied that, if a scheme had come into operation containing provisions which would have had the effect of prohibiting that development, or under which those conditions could have been enforced, no right to compensation would have arisen under this Act in respect of the injurious affection of the property by the coming into operation of those provisions.

(6) Where a resolution or resolutions to prepare a

scheme or schemes, has or have taken effect, the local authority or joint committee who passed the resolution or resolutions may prepare one scheme for dealing with the area to which the resolution applies or with the aggregate area to which the resolutions apply, as the case may be, or, if they think fit, may prepare different schemes for dealing with different parts of that area or aggregate area.

1932.

Town and Country

Planning Act, 1932.

Ch. 48.

737

may agree in writing to allow, they give notice to him that they have decided to the contrary, stating their reasons for so doing:

Provided that—

(a) an application for permission to erect a new building on the site of an existing building,

or on the site of a building which was standing within two years before the date on which a

resolution takes effect, if made before or within two years after the destruction or demolition of that previous building, or within twelve months after the date on which the resolution takes effect, whichever period last expires, shall not be refused and conditions shall not be imposed, if the effect of the refusal or imposition of conditions would be to render

• it impossible for the applicant to erect a

building having a cubic content above the level of the ground as great as that of the previous building or, in the case of a previous building used for business or industry, to erect a building having as great a cubic content above the level of the ground and as great a superficial area on the ground floor as those of the previous building, except where either—

(i) the new building would not conform with a provision proposed to be inserted in the scheme for fixing, in relation to any street or proposed street, a line beyond which no building in that street or proposed street may project; or

(ii) it is proposed to include the site of the new building or part thereof in an area to be reserved by the scheme for a

purpose the carrying out of which in the future would necessitate the removal or the alteration of the new building;

(b) an application for permission to use any building which is erected in substitution for an existing building, or other such previous building as aforesaid, and is commenced within two years after the destruction or demolition of the previous building, for any

3 A

738

Ch. 48.

Planning Act, 1932.

purpose of the same or similar character as that for which the previous building was last used before its destruction or demolition shall not be refused unless such a use would be of a noxious or otherwise offensive character.

(4) In any case where an application under the last preceding subsection is refused or is granted subject to conditions, the authority may, if they think fit, make

a contribution, the payment of which shall not be unreasonably delayed, towards any damage or expense which the applicant shows to their satisfaction that he is likely to suffer by reason of their decision.

(5) An applicant who is aggrieved by the refusal of the authority to consent to his application, or by any conditions imposed by them, may within twenty-

eight days from the date on which he reeeivfed notice of the decision of the authority, or such longer period as the Minister may allow, appeal to the Minister, and the Minister, after taking into consideration any offer by the authority to make a contribution under the last preceding subsection, may dismiss or allow the appeal, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as he thinks proper to impose, but the Minister,

before deciding any such appeal, shall, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, afford them an opportunity of appealing before and being heard by a

person appointed by the Minister for the purpose.

The decision of the Minister on an appeal under this subsection shall be final and shall have effect as if it were a decision of the authority.

(6) Where an appeal to the Minister under the last preceding subsection is dismissed on the ground only that the land to which the appeal relates, though otherwise suitable for immediate development, ought to be reserved by the scheme for a public open space, and the Minister is satisfied that, if the appeal had been allowed, the development for which permission was sought would have taken place within a reasonable period,

the appellant, if he is entitled to dispose of the fee simple of the land with vacant possession, may, by notice in writing given to the authority within six months from the date of the Minister’s decision, require the authority to purchase the land at a price to be agreed, or in default

of agreement to be determined in accordance -with the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of

Compensation) Act, 1919, and the authority shall purchase the land accordingly.

(7) Where expenditure is necessarily incurred on buildings or works in order to comply with a condition confirmed or imposed by the Minister on an appeal to him under this section, and the condition was confirmed or imposed in anticipation of the reservation of land for a public purpose or the execution of works under the scheme,

then, if the scheme as proposed to be approved by the Minister does not contain a provision for such reservation or execution of works, and the Minister, on representations made to him, is satisfied that the expenditure which has been so incurred is wholly or partly abortive on that account, the scheme shall provide that the person by whom the expenditure was incurred shall be entitled, if he makes a claim in that behalf within twelve months from the date on which the scheme comes into operation,

to recover as compensation from the responsible authority so much of that expenditure as is abortive.

(8) An interim development order may empower any authority specified in the order, with the consent of the Minister, to suspend the operation of any enactments contained in local Acts and of any orders, byelaws or regulations, under whatever authority made, where it is expedient in order to promote the development permitted by or under the order.

(9) The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply in any case where the scheme for the preparation or adoption of which a resolution has taken effect is

Schedule to this Act; and

(b) where it is expedient in order to promote proper planning or development, may provide for suspending the operation of any provision, whether contained in a statute or in an order, byelaw,

or regulation, under whatever authority made,

(2) A scheme may—

(a) specify as the responsible authority for all pur-

* poses of the scheme any one of the following authorities, that is to say, the local authority within whose district any land to which the scheme applies or any neighbouring land is situate, or a county council, or a joint body specially constituted by the scheme; or

(b) specify any two or more such authorities as aforesaid as the responsible authorities for different purposes of the scheme or as respects different parts of the area to which the scheme applies.

(a) differ as respects different parts of the area to which the scheme applies; and

(b) be made applicable, either with or without modifications, to existing buildings as well as to buildings which are not existing buildings;

(a) that the operations would involve danger or injury to health by reason of the lack of roads, sewers,

water supply or any public services and that the provision of the necessary services would be premature, or likely to involve excessive expenditure of public money; or

(6) that the operations would be likely seriously to injure the amenity of the locality.

(3) Any person aggrieved by the refusal of any such application as aforesaid, or by any conditions imposed by the responsible authority, may within twenty-eight days from the date on which he received notice of the decision of the authority or such longer period as the Minister may allow, appeal to the Minister, and the Minister may dismiss or allow the appeal, either unconditionally, or subject to such conditions as he thinks proper to impose.

v such land.

(2) A resolution passed under the foregoing subsection shall not take effect unless and until it is approved by the Department, and the Department in giving their approval may vary the extent of the land to be included in the area to which the resolution is to apply, but the Department shall not approve any such resolution unless they are satisfied—

(a) in the ease of any land already built upon, that public improvements are likely to be made, or other development is likely to take place,

within such a period of time and on such a

‘ scale as to make the inelusion of the land in a

scheme expedient, or that the land comprises buildings or other objects of architectural,

historic, or artistic interest, or that the land is so situate that the general object of the scheme would be better secured by its inclusion;

(b) in the case of land which is neither already built upon nor in course of development, nor likely to be developed, that the land is so situated in relation to land which is already built upon,

or in course of development, or on which development is likely to take place, as to make its inclusion in a scheme expedient, or that it comprises objects or places of natural interest or beauty:

Provided that nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the Department from approving a resolution adopting a scheme comprising land in respect of which they are not satisfied that the conditions specified in this subsection are complied with, if the scheme has been proposed by the owners of not less than two-thirds of that land and approved by not less than three-fourths of the owners of that land.

(3) A local authority or joint committee, before passing a resolution which will apply to—

(i) any land not within the district or, as the case may be, districts aforesaid; or

822 Ch. 49, Town and Country 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

Planning (Scotland)Ac£, 1932.

(ii) any land to which either a resolution to prepare or adopt a scheme, or a scheme, being a

resolution or scheme passed or made by another authority or committee, applies,

shall consult with every authority or committee who will be affected thereby.

(4) A resolution of a local authority or joint committee to prepare a scheme may be revoked, either as to the whole or any part of the area to which it applies,

by a subsequent resolution of the authority or committee,

or, if the Department think that in the special circumstances of the case the resolution should be so revoked,

by order of the Department:

Provided that—

(a) a resolution under this subsection shall require the approval of the Department, and the

Department may refuse to approve it except subject to such conditions as they think fit to impose; and

(b) before making an order under this subsection the Department shall inform the authority or committee, as the case may be, of the order which they propose to make and, if within twenty-eight days the authority or committee request them so to do, shall cause a local inquiry to be held into the matter.

(5) In giving their approval to a resolution under the last foregoing subsection, and in making an order thereunder, the Department Shall by the imposition of conditions or, as the case may be, by the terms of their order secure that—

(i) any person whose property has been injuriously affected by reason that since the commencement of this Act the Department have refused, on an appeal made to them under an interim development order, to grant an application for permission to develop the property, or that the

Department have imposed any conditions on the grant of an application made since that date; and

(ii) any person who, for the purpose of complying with any conditions imposed on the grant of such an application, has since the commencement of this Act incurred expenditure which is rendered abortive by the revocation of the resolution to prepare a scheme,

shall be entitled, if he makes a claim for the purpose within twelve months from the date when the resolution is approved or the order is made, as the case may be,

to claim compensation from such authority as may be specified in the condition or order:

Provided that the Department shall not secure a

right to compensation in respect of any injurious affection of property arising from refusal to permit any development, or from the imposition of any conditions,

where they are satisfied that, if a scheme had come into operation containing provisions which would have had the effect of prohibiting that development, or under which those conditions could have been enforced,

no right to compensation would have arisen under this Act in respect of the injurious affection of the property by the coming into operation of those provisions.

(6) Where a resolution or resolutions to prepare a

scheme or schemes has or have taken effect, the local authority or joint committee who passed the resolution or resolutions may prepare one scheme for dealing with the area to which the resolution applies or with the aggregate area to which the resolutions apply, as the case may be, or, if they think fit, may prepare different schemes for dealing with different parts of that area or aggregate area.

(7) Where under the last foregoing subsection a local authority or joint committee have power to prepare a

scheme for any area, they may decide in lieu of proceeding with the preparation of a scheme to adopt, with or without modifications, a scheme for that area or any part thereof proposed by all or any of the owners of land in that area or part thereof. A decision under this subsection shall not be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be a

resolution to adopt a scheme, but as from the date of the decision the resolution or resolutions to prepare a scheme or schemes shall, so far as concerns the area or part of an area to which the decision relates, have effect as

" interim development" means development between the date on which the resolution takes effect, and the date of the coming into operation of the scheme.

(2) An order made under the preceding subsection

(in this Act referred to as " an interim development order ") may itself permit the development of land either unconditionally or subject to any condition specified in the order, or may empower any authority so specified’to permit the development of land in accordance with the terms of the order.

(3) Where an application for permission to develop land is made to the specified authority in manner provided by the order, the authority may, subject to the terms of the order, grant the application unconditionally or subject to such conditions as they think proper to impose, or may refuse the application, and they shall be deemed to have granted the application unconditionally unless within two months from the receipt thereof, or within such longer period as the applicant may agree in writing to allow, they give notice to him that they have decided to the contrary, stating their reasons for so doing:

Provided that—

(a) an application for permission to erect a new building on the site of an existing building,

or on the site of a building which was standing within two years before the date on which a

resolution takes effect, if made before or within two years after the destruction or demolition of that previous building, or within twelve months after the date on which the resolution takes effect, whichever period last expires, shall not be refused and conditions shall not be imposed, if the effect of the refusal or imposition of conditions would be to render

830 Ch. 49. Town and Country 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

Planning (Scotland) Act, 1932.

it impossible for the applicant to erect a

building having a cubic content above the level of the ground as great as that of the previous building or, in the case of a previous building used for business or industry, to erect a building having as great a cubic content above the level of the ground and as great a superficial area on the ground floor as those of the previous building, except where either—

(i) the new building would not conform with a provision proposed to be inserted in the scheme for fixing, in relation to any street or proposed street, a line beyond which no building in that street or proposed street may project; or

(ii) it is proposed to include the site of the new building or part thereof in an area to be reserved by the scheme for a

purpose the carrying out of which in the future would necessitate the removal or the alteration of the new building;

(6) an application for permission to use any building which is erected in substitution for an existing building, or other such previous building as aforesaid, and is commenced within two years after the destruction or demolition of the previous building, for any purpose of the same or similar character as that for which the previous building was last used before its destruction or demolition shall not be refused unless such a use would be of a noxious or otherwise offensive character.

(4) In any case where an application under the last preceding subsection is refused or is granted subject to conditions, the authority may, if they think fit, make

a contribution, the payment of which shall not be unreasonably delayed, towards any damage or expense which the applicant shows to their satisfaction that he is likely to suffer by reason of their decision.

(5) An applicant who is aggrieved by the refusal of the authority to consent to his application, or by any

1932. Town and Country Ch. 49. 831

conditions imposed by them, may within twenty-eight days from the date on which he received notice of the decision of the authority, or suqh longer period as the

Department may allow, appeal to the Department, and the Department, after taking into consideration any offer by the authority to make a contribution under the last preceding subsection, may dismiss or allow the appeal,

either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as they think proper to impose, but the Department, before deciding any such appeal, shall, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, afford them an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed by the Department for the purpose.

The decision of the Department on an appeal under this subsection shall be final and shall have effect as if it were a decision of the authority.

(6) Where an appeal to the Department under the last preceding subsection is dismissed on the ground only that the land to which the appeal relates, though otherwise suitable for immediate development, ought to be reserved by the scheme for a public open space, and the Department are satisfied that, if the appeal had been allowed, the development for which permission was sought would have taken place within a reasonable period,

the appellant, if he is entitled to dispose of the fee simple of the land with vacant possession, may, by notice in writing given to the authority within six months from the date of the Department’s decision, require the authority to purchase the land at a price to be agreed, or in default of agreement to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assess- 9 & 10 Geo. 5.

ment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and the authority °- 57 -

shall purchase the land accordingly.

(7) Where expenditure is necessarily incurred on buildings or works in order to comply with a condition confirmed or imposed by the Department on an appeal to them under this section, and the condition was confirmed or imposed in anticipation of the reservation of land for a public purpose or the execution of works under the scheme, then, if the scheme as proposed to be approved by the Department does not contain a provision for such reservation or execution of works, and the

Department, on representations made to them, are satisfied that the expenditure which has been so incurred

Ch. 49.

Planning (Scotland) Act, 1932.

is wholly or partly abortive on that account, the scheme shall provide that the person by whom the expenditure was incurred shall be entitled, if he makes a claim in that behalf within twelve months from the date on which the scheme comes into operation, to recover as compensation from the responsible authority so much of that expenditure as is abortive.

(8) An interim development order may empower any authority specified in the order, with the consent of the Department, to suspend the operation of any enactments contained in local Acts and of any orders, byelaws or regulations, under whatever authority made, where it is expedient in order to promote the development permitted by or under the order.

Ch. 50.

we have cheerfully granted to Your Majesty in this session of Parliament, have resolved to grant unto Your

Majesty the sum hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most

Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Grant out of Consolidated Fund.

1. The Treasury may issue out of the Consolidated

Fund of the United Kingdom, and apply towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty for the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three, the sum of three hundred and four million seven hundred and ninety thousand two hundred and twenty-six pounds.

2. —(1) The Treasury may borrow from any person,

by the issue of Treasury Bills or otherwise, and the

Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Treasury on the credit of the said sum, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole three hundred and four million seven hundred and ninety thousand two hundred and twenty-six pounds.

(2) The date of payment of any Treasury Bills issued under this section shall be a date not later than the thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three, and section six of the Treasury Bills Act,

1877 (which relates to the renewal of bills), shall not apply with respect to those bills.

(3) Any money borrowed otherwise than on Treasury

Bills shall be repaid, with interest not exceeding five pounds per cent, per annum, out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund, at any period not later than the next succeeding quarter to that in which the money was borrowed.

(4) Any money borrowed under this section shall be placed to the credit of the account of the Exchequer,

3. All sums granted by this Act and the other Acts mentioned in Schedule (A) annexed to this Act out of the said Consolidated Fund towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty, amounting, as appears by the said schedule, in the aggregate, to the sum of five hundred and six million nine hundred and twelve thousand and seventy-three pounds four shillings are appropriated, and shall be deemed to have been appropriated as from the date of the passing of the Acts mentioned in the said Schedule (A), for the services and purposes expressed in Schedule (B) annexed hereto.

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

In addition to the sums hereby granted out of the

Consolidated Fund, there may be applied out of any money directed under section two of the Public Accounts and Charges Act, 1891, to be applied as appropriations in aid of the grants for the services and purposes specified in Schedule (B) annexed hereto the sums respectively set forth in the last column of the said schedule.

4. —(1) So long as the aggregate expenditure on naval, military and air services respectively is not made to exceed the aggregate sums appropriated by this Act for those services respectively, any surplus arising on any vote for those services, either by an excess of the sum realised on account of appropriations in aid of the vote over the sum which may be applied under this Act as appropriations in aid of that vote, or by saving of expenditure on that vote, may, with the sanction of the

Treasury, be temporarily applied either in making up any deficiency in the sums realised on account of appropriations in aid of any other vote in the same department,

or in defraying expenditure in the same department which is not provided for in the sums appropriated to the service of the department by this Act, and which it may be detrimental to the public service to postpone

893

1932. Appropriation Act, 1932. Ch. 50.

until provision can be made for it by Parliament in the usual course.

(2) A statement showing all cases in which the sanction of the Treasury has been given to the temporary application of a surplus under this section, and showing the circumstances under which the sanction of the

Treasury has been given, shall be laid before the House of Commons with the appropriation accounts of the naval,

military and air services for the year, in order that any temporary application of any surplus sanctioned by the

Treasury under this section may be submitted for the sanction of Parliament.

5. Whereas under the powers given for the purpose by the Appropriation Acts, 1930 and 1931, surpluses arising on certain votes for the navy, army and air services respectively have been applied as shown in the statement set out in Schedule (C) to this Act:

It is enacted that the application of those surpluses as shown in the said statement is hereby sanctioned.

6. —(1) A person shall not receive any payment out of a grant which may be made in pursuance of this Act for half-pay or army, navy, air force, or civil non-

effective services, until he has subscribed such declaration as may from time to time be prescribed by a warrant of the Treasury before one of the persons prescribed by the warrant:

Provided that the Treasury may dispense with the production of a declaration under this section in respect of any payment if such a declaration has been subscribed within a period of seven calendar months preceding the date of the payment.

(2) Any person who makes a declaration for the purpose of this section knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.

7. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the

CHAPTER 51.

An Act to permit and regulate the opening and use of places on Sundays for certain entertainments and for debates, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[13th July 1932.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) The authority having power, in any area to which this section extends, to grant licences under the

Cinematograph Act, 1909, may, notwithstanding anything in any enactment relating to Sunday observance, allow places in that area licensed under the said Act to be opened and used on Sundays for the purpose of cinematograph entertainments, subject to such conditions as the authority think fit to impose:

Provided that no place shall be allowed to be so opened and used unless among the conditions subject to which it is allowed to be so opened and used there are included conditions for securing-—

(a) that no person will be employed by any employer on any Sunday in connection with a cinematograph entertainment or any other entertainment or exhibition given therewith who has been employed on each of the six previous days either by that employer in any occupation or by any other employer in connection with similar entertainments or exhibitions; and

(b) that such sums as may be specified by the authority not exceeding the amount estimated by the authority as the amount of the profits which will be received from cinematograph entertainments given while the place is open on Sundays, and from any other entertainment or exhibition given therewith, and calculated by reference to such estimated profits or to such proportion of them as the authority think fit, will

Provisions as to cinematograph entertainments.

9 Edw. 7.

c. 30.

934 Ch. 51. Sunday Entertainments 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

be paid as to the prescribed percentage thereof, if any, to the authority for the purpose of being transmitted to the Cinematograph Fund constituted in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and as to the remainder thereof to such persons as may be specified by the authority for the purpose of being applied to charitable objects;

and for the purpose of any conditions imposed by an authority as to the payment of sums calculated by reference to such estimated profits as aforesaid, the profits shall be computed in such manner as the authority may direct.

(2) For the purposes of section four of the Cinematograph Act, 1909 (which contains provisions as to the enforcement of the conditions of licences) any conditions subject to which a place is allowed under this section to be opened and used on Sundays shall be deemed to be conditions of the licence granted under that Act in respect of the place.

(3) If, in any place allowed under this section to be opened and used on Sundays for the purpose of cinematograph entertainments, any person is employed on any

Sunday contrary to the conditions subject to which the place was allowed to be so opened and used, and either—

(a) it is proved—

(i) that the employment was solely due to an emergency caused by a mechanical breakdown,

or to the unavoidable absence of a skilled worker due to attend on that Sunday for whom no substitute could readily have been obtained; and

(ii) that the emergency was notified, within twenty-four hours after it occurred, to the authority by whom the place is licensed under the

Cinematograph Act, 1909; and

(iii) that the person employed on that Sunday contrary to the said conditions received a day’s

rest in lieu of that Sunday; or

(b) it is proved—

(i) that the person was employed contrary to the said conditions only by reason of his having

1932.

Sunday Entertainments

Act, 1932.

Ch. 51.

935

been employed on each of the six days previous to that Sunday in connection with similar entertainments or exhibitions by an employer other than the employer who employed him on that Sunday;

and

(ii) that the last-mentioned employer had,

after making due inquiry, reasonable ground for believing that he had not been so employed as aforesaid;

that employment shall be deemed not to have been a

contravention of the conditions subject to which the place was allowed to be so opened and used as aforesaid.

(4) In the event of a contravention of any condition subject to which a place was allowed under this section to be opened and used on Sundays for the purpose of cinematograph entertainments, the person who held the licence for that place granted under the Cinematograph

Act, 1909, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and shall, in the case of a

contravention consisting of a failure to pay in accordance with the condition any sum thereby required to be paid to any authority or person, be liable to pay that sum as a debt due to that authority or person, as the case may be.

Any sum recoverable under this subsection may,

if it does not exceed fifty pounds, be recovered summarily as a civil debt.

(5) This section extends to every area in which places licensed by the authority having power in that area to grant licences under the Cinematograph Act, 1909,

were, within the period of twelve months ending on the sixth day of October, nineteen hundred and thirty-one,

opened and used on Sundays for the purpose of cinematograph entertainments, in pursuance of arrangements purported to have been made with the authority,

and shall also extend to any borough or county district to which it may be extended by an order laid before

Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the

Schedule to this Act, and approved by a resolution passed by each House of Parliament:

Provided that, if in any area the arrangements in pursuance of which places were so opened and used

936 Ch, 51. Sunday Entertainments 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

Act, 1932.

as aforesaid related only to specific occasional entertainments, then, unless and until it is extended to that area by such an order as aforesaid, this section shall extend to that area subject to the modification that the powers thereby conferred shall not be exercised with respect to more than two Sundays in any year.

Provisions 2.—(1) There shall be established under the direc-

as to tion and control of the Privy Council a fund, to be called the " Cinematograph Fund, " and all sums paid to an graiJ ‘ authority in accordance with conditions imposed by them under the last foregoing section for the purpose of being transmitted to that fund shall be so transmitted at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations made by a Secretary of State and laid before

Parliament.

. (2) The moneys from time to time standing to the credit of the Cinematograph Fund shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be applied in such manner as may be directed by the Privy Council for the purpose of encouraging the use and development of the cinematograph as a means of entertainment and instruction:

Provided that a sum equal to the amount certified by the Treasury as the amount of the expenses incurred by the Privy Council in the administration of the said

Fund shall be deducted annually from the Fund and applied in accordance with directions given by the

Treasury as an appropriation in aid of the moneys provided by Parliament for the purposes of the Privy

Council.

(3) The accounts of the Cinematograph Fund shall be kept in such form as may be directed by the

Treasury, and an account showing the revenue and expenditure of the Fund shall be transmitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who shall certify and report upon the account, and the account and report shall be laid before Parliament.

Provision as 3. The power of any authority in any area to grant to musical licences under any enactment for the regulation of mentis* 1111 ' Pauses kept or ordinarily used for public dancing, singing,

music, or other public entertainment of the like kind,

shall include power to grant such licences in respect only of musical entertainments on Sundays, and the power to

Article 21.

This Agreement is made on the express condition that, if either Government is satisfied that any preferences hereby granted in respect of any particular class of commodities are likely to be frustrated in whole or in part by reason of the creation or maintenance directly or indirectly of prices for such class of commodities through state action on the part of any foreign country, that Government hereby declares that it will exercise the powers which it now has or will hereafter take to prohibit the entry from such foreign country directly or indirectly of such commodities into its country for such time as may be necessary to make effective and to maintain the preferences hereby granted by it.

SCHEDULE H.

Declaration by United Kingdom Government.

1. The present wholesale prices of frozen meat are at a level which has resulted in grave depression in the livestock industries of the United Kingdom and the Dominions. This depression is likely, if continued, to bring about a serious decline in production and consequent ultimate injury to the consumer.

2. Such a position is so serious that it is essential to take whatever steps may appear feasible to raise the wholesale prices of frozen meat in the United Kingdom market to such a level as will maintain efficient production.

3. With a view to the earliest possible improvement of the position, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will,

during the currency of the Ottawa Agreement, arrange for the regulation of importations of meat into the United Kingdom,

the regulation, in view of the close inter-relationship of all kinds of meat in determining the price level, to be applied to all the meats referred to in Section 5.

4. The policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United

Kingdom in relation to meat production is, first, to secure development of home production, and, secondly, to give to the Dominions an expanding share of imports into the United Kingdom.

5. In order to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the carrying out of this policy, His

Majesty’s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia agrees to limit the export of frozen mutton and lamb to the United

Kingdom for the year 1933 to an amount equivalent to the total imports from Australia during the year ended the 30th June, 1932,

in consideration of the United Kingdom Government—

(a) Arranging for the regulation of the importation of foreign meat in accordance with a programme (hereinafter referred to as the " agreed programme ") agreed between

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and

His Majesty’s Government in the Commonwealth of

Australia and including within its scope frozen mutton and lamb, frozen beef and chilled beef.

(b) Arranging, as soon as possible after receiving the Report of the Commission now sitting on the reorganisation of the pig industry in the United Kingdom, for the quantitative regulation of the supplies of bacon and hams coming on to the United Kingdom market.

(c) Undertaking that no restriction will be placed upon the importation of any meat from Australia during the period named in the agreed programme referred to in

Section 5 (a) of this Declaration.

1932. Ottawa Agreements Ch. 53.

6. During the year 1933 and in the light of the experience gained, His Majesty’s Government in the-United Kingdom will consider, in consultation with His Majesty’s Government in the

Commonwealth of Australia, the best means of ensuring an improved price situation and the more orderly marketing of supplies.

7. Should no permanent policy be agreed upon as the result of the consultation referred to above, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertakes, after the expiry of the period named in the agreed programme referred to in Section 5 (a) of this

Declaration and during the remainder of the period of the Agreement concluded at Ottawa—

(a) To arrange for the continuance, unless otherwise agreed between the Governments concerned, of the regulation of the imports of foreign meat at the rates in force at the end of the period named in the agreed programme.

(b) In any action affecting the imports of meat into the

United Kingdom which the United Kingdom Govern-

. ment may take on behalf of United Kingdom agriculture,

to have regard to the policy set out in Section 4 hereof.

8. Should it appear to His Majesty’s Government in the

United Kingdom after enquiry that, at any time in consequence of a restriction upon foreign imports, the supplies of meat of any kind are inadequate to meet the requirements of consumers in the

United Kingdom, then His Majesty’s Government may remove any such restriction until supplies are again adequate.

Article 1.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertake that Orders shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, which will ensure the continuance after the 15th November, 1932, of entry free of duty into the United Kingdom of New Zealand goods and the goods of the mandated territory of Western Samoa which comply with the laws and statutory regulations for the time being in force affecting the grant of Imperial preference, and which by virtue of that Act are now free of duty subject, however, to the reservations set forth in Schedule A appended hereto.

Article 2.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will invite

Parliament to pass the legislation necessary to impose on the foreign goods specified in Schedule B appended hereto, the duties of customs shown in that schedule in place of the duties (if any)

now leviable.

Article 3.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertake that the general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent, imposed by section 1 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, on the foreign goods specified in Schedule C shall not be reduced except with the consent of His Majesty’s Government in New Zealand.

Article 4.

In regard to frozen mutton, lamb and beef, the understanding between the Governments concerned is set out in the letter* dated the 19th August, 1932, addressed by the Rt. Hon. J. G. Coates,

Article 7.

His Majesty’s Government in New Zealand undertake that protection by tariffs shall be afforded against United Kingdom products only to those industries which are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success.

Article 8.

His Majesty’s Government in New Zealand undertake to institute an inquiry into the existing protective duties and, where necessary, to reduce them as speedily as possible to such a level as will place the United Kingdom producer in the position of a

domestic competitor, that is, that the protection afforded to the

New Zealand producer shall be on a level which will give the

United Kingdom producer full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production.

Article 9.

New Zealand Delegation,

Dear Mr. Baldwin, Ottawa, Canada, August 19, 1932.

I' have given further consideration to the matter of an agreement between His Majesty’s Government in the United

Kingdom and His Majesty’s Government in New Zealand. In

my conversations with you and your Ministers we have agreed that' a policy will be adopted that will have for its definite objective the two-fold purpose of raising the price of meat to a

remunerative level and of progressively increasing the share of the

Dominions in the United Kingdom market. I accept your undertaking that effective steps will be taken to secure these results.

2. For the purpose of restricting foreign supplies of mutton and lamb, the arrivals, as compared with the corresponding periods of the year ending the 30th June, 1932, as I understand the United

Kingdom proposal, are to be reduced by at least 10 per cent, for the quarter ending the 31st March, 1933, 15 per cent, for the quarter ending the 30th June, 1933, 20 per cent, for the quarter ending the 30th September, 1933, 25 per cent, for the quarter ending the 31st December, 1933, 30 per cent, for the quarter ending the 31st March, 1934, and 35 per cent, for the quarter ending the

30th June, 1934, and thereafter, unless otherwise agreed between the Governments concerned, for the remainder of the period of the agreement concluded at Ottawa by not less than 35 per cent.

3. During the year 1933, and in the light of the experience gained, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will consider, in consultation with Has Majesty’s Government in New

Zealand, the best means of ensuring an improved price situation,

and the more orderly marketing of supplies.

4. To assist in the orderly marketing of supplies the Dominion will give a reliable estimate of shipments of mutton and lamb as early as possible in each export season. This season will neces-

sarily cover the period the 1st October in one year to the

30th September in the following year. For the season 1932-33

we estimate our exports of frozen mutton and lamb at 200,000 tons,

with a 5 per cent, increase in each of the following two years.

For the calendar year 1933 you may take it that our shipments of frozen mutton and lamb will be the same as those of the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1932, i.e., of the year which ended with the month immediately preceding the opening of the conference.

5. It is understood that, in consideration of this undertaking on our part, no restriction will be placed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom upon the importation of any meat from New Zealand during the period ending the 30th June, 1934.

6. In frozen beef, we estimate our exports for the season

1932-33 at not more than 22,000 tons, representing a maximum increase over the previous season of approximately 10 per cent.

7. With regard to bacon and other pig products, I am informed that your Government are now dealing with the reorganisation of this industry, and that an effective policy of control of foreign imports will be adopted. This polioy, as I

understand it, will provide tot some expansion of Home and

Dominion supplies of pig products. New Zealand is already an exporter of pork and bacon carcasses and will be granted a

reasonable share of the expansion made possible by the reduction of foreign imports.

8. - All frozen beef (carcasses and boned beef) from foreign sources is to be subject to the same reductions as are specified in paragraph 2.

9. No increase of chilled beef imports from foreign sources into the United Kingdom in excess of the twelve months the

1st July, 1931, to the 30th June, 1932, will be permitted during the period January 1933 to the 30th June, 1934, and the rate of importation will not thereafter be increased during the period of the Ottawa agreement except with the concurrence of the

Governments concerned.

10. Should it appear to His Majesty’s Government in the

United Kingdom after an enquiry that, at any time, in consequence of a restriction upon foreign imports, the supplies of meat of any kind are inadequate to meet the requirements of consumers in the United Kingdom, then His Majesty’s Government may remove any such restriction until supplies are again adequate.

Copy of Cobbespondbnce between Mb. Baldwin and

Mb. Alpebdioe regarding the use Of Newfoundland

Wabana Ikon Obe in the United Kingdom.

Parliament Buildings,

Dear Prime Minister, Ottawa, August 18, 1932.

My colleagues and I recognise that an arrangement between the interests concerned for the importation into the United

Kingdom of a substantial quantity of Wabana iron ore is of paramount importance to the economic life of Newfoundland.

We therefore give you our assurance, on behalf of our

Government, that we shall regard the last paragraph of Article 9

of the Agreement which is being concluded between His Majesty’s

Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty’s Government in Newfoundland as entitling the Government of Newfoundland to give us notice that they are unable to implement the

Agreement, other than Articles 4, 7 and 8 and Schedule E, on the ground that a satisfactory arrangement between the interests concerned as regards the importation of such ore into the United

Kingdom has not been concluded.

In that event it is understood between us that the Agreement,

other than Articles 4, 7 and 8 and Schedule E, will be regarded as at an end.

I shall be glad to learn from you at your early convenience whether you concur that this correctly represents our understanding.

Yours sincerely,

(Signed) STANLEY BALDWIN.

The Prime Minister of Newfoundland,

Room 340, Parliament Buildings,

Ottawa.

Dear Lord President, Ottawa, August 18, 1932.

I have received your letter of today’s date regarding the

Agreement between our respective Governments and I agree with you that your letter correctly represents the understanding between us.

Yours sincerely,

(Signed) P. 0. ALDERDICE.

The Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P.

Indian goods of the kinds specified in Schedule B appended hereto, which comply with the law and statutory regulations for the time being in force, defining Empire goods fot the purpose of customs duties, the margin of preference over similar foreign goods shown in that schedule.

Article 4.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertake that no order will be made, and that Parliament will not be invited to pass legislation which would have the effect of reducing the margin of preference now enjoyed by Indian goods of the kinds specified in Schedule C over similar foreign goods, and further undertake that, in the event of any greater preference being accorded in respect of such goods imported from any other part of the Empire, such greater preference will be extended to similar

Indian goods.

Copy of Correspondence between Sir George Rainy and

Sir Horace Wilson, in regard to Galvanised Sheet.

Sir, September 22, 1932.

When the Agreement between the British and Indian Delegations was made at Ottawa it was found necessary to postpone a

final settlement of certain questions relating to iron and steel.

By Article 1 of the Agreement His Majesty’s Government in the

United Kingdom undertook to continue after the 15th November free entry to all classes of Indian goods covered by the Import

Duties Act. It was clearly understood, however, between the two

Delegations that the continuance of the free entry of Indian iron and steel for a longer period than six months from the date of the

Agreement was dependent on the settlement of satisfactory conditions in regard to the tariff treatment of galvanised sheet on importation into India. At the same time an understanding was reached that the conditions which would be satisfactory to His

Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were as follows:—

(1) On the basis of present selling prices, the duties on galvanised sheet in the Indian tariff to be adjusted as follows:—

30 rupees per ton on sheet made in the United

Kingdom from Indian sheet bar.

53 rupees per ton on sheet made in the United

Kingdom from other sheet bar.

83 rupees per ton on sheet not made in the United

Kingdom.

1048

— cont.

Ottawa Agreements 22 & 23 Geo. 5.

Act, 1932.

India— continued .

(2) In the event of further reductions in the price of sheet imported into India and not made in the United

Kingdom, the Government of India, as soon as they are satisfied that a fall in prices had in fact occurred, would,

without an enquiry by the Tariff Board, take prompt and effective action to meet the situation by the imposition of an additional duty. The amount of the additional duty would not necessarily be limited to the amount of the price reduction actually made, but would be sufficient to make clear the intention of the Government of India to maintain prices.

(3) Each Government would remain at liberty to take appropriate measures to prevent sales at unfair prices by the manufacturers in the other country, or to check an unnecessary increase in prices against the consumer by

a combination of manufacturers in both countries.

(4) These arrangements to remain in force until action is taken by the Government of India following the next statutory Tariff enquiry in India into the Iron and Steel industry.

2. The Indian Delegation are now prepared to undertake, on behalf of the Government of India, that proposals will be placed before the Indian Legislature for the adjustment of the duties on galvanised sheet at the rates set forth in clause (1) above, and for obtaining the powers which axe necessary to carry out the intention of clauses (2) add (3). I have been authorised by my colleagues of the Indian Delegation to make this communication to you, and I have now the honour to request that you will inform me whether the terms of the understanding have been correctly stated in this letter.

I am, &c.

(Signed) GEORGE RAINY.

Chief Industrial Adviser to His Majesty’s

Government in the United Kingdom.

Sir, September 22, 1932.

I have to thank you for your letter of today’s date on the subject of the tariff treatment to be accorded to galvanised sheets imported into India, and to confirm that the terms of the understanding which has been reached in this connection by our respective Governments are accurately set out in your letter.

I am, &e.

hereby agree with one another, on behalf of our respective

Governments, as follows:—

Article 1.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertake that Orders shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, which will ensure the continuance after the 15th November, 1932, of entry free of duty into the United Kingdom of Southern Rhodesian goods which comply with the law and statutory regulations for the time being in force affecting the grant of Imperial Preference, and which by virtue of that Act are now free of duty, subject, however, to the reservations set forth in Schedule A appended hereto.

Article 2.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will invite

Parliament to pass legislation which will secure for a period of ten years from the date hereof to tobacco, which complies with the law and statutory regulations for the time being in force affecting the grant of Imperial Preference, the existing margin of preference over foreign tobacco, so long, however, as the duty on foreign unmanufactured tobacco does not fall below 2s. O^d. per lb., in which event the margin of preference shall be equivalent to the full duty. They will further endeavour to take such steps as may be practicable, on the lines which have been discussed, to assist the marketing of Southern Rhodesian tobacco.

Article 3.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will invite

Parliament to pass the legislation necessary to impose on the foreign goods specified in Schedule B appended hereto, the duties of customs shown in that schedule in place of the duties, if any,

now leviable.

Article 4.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will invite

Parliament to pass the legislation necessary to secure to Southern

Rhodesian coffee, which complies with the law and statutory regulations for the time being in force, affecting the grant of

Imperial Preference, a margin of preference of 9s. 4rf. per cwt. over foreign coffee.

Article 7.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will invite the Governments of the non-self-governing colonies and protec-

Empire, and further will invite the Governments of all the colonies and protectorates which are free to grant preferences so to adjust their customs duties chargeable upon cigarettes and manufactured tobacco that a lesser duty shall be chargeable upon such articles when manufactured 'within the Empire from tobacco grown within the Empire than upon such articles when manufactured from foreign tobacco.

Article 8.

The Government of Southern Rhodesia will invite Parliament to pass the legislation necessary to secure to United Kingdom goods of the kinds specified in Schedule D the margins of preference shown in that schedule, and to amend the existing duties upon foreign goods of the kind specified in Schedule E so as to provide for alternative specific duties as shown in that schedule.

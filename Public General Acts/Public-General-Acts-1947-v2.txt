Ch. 48. Agriculture Act, 1947.

arising (otherwise than in the course of a continuous development) from a substantial alteration of costs of production or any other special cause, and that the change is or is likely to be of sufficient importance to require that the Ministers should exercise their powers under this subsection, the Ministers may hold a special review of the matters referred to in the last foregoing subsection, in so far as they are or may be affected by the change.

(3) In holding any review under this section the Ministers shall consult with such bodies of persons as appear to them to represent the interests of producers in the agricultural industry.

3.—(1) Any fixing or variation of any price, method of calculating a price, or other factor affecting the operation of any arrangements—

’ to this Act,

which under the enactments regulating the operation of the arrangements is authorised or required to be carried out by a Minister or other authority shall be carried out in the light of the Ministers’ conclusions from reviews held by them under the last foregoing section.

(2) Where in consequence of an annual or special review held by the Ministers under the last foregoing section it appears to the appropriate Minister expedient so to do, or if it appears to him otherwise expedient so to do in the public interest, he may by order fix or vary any such price or other factor as aforesaid notwithstanding that under the enactments regulating the operation of the arrangements in question there is no power to fix or vary the factor or it would fall to be fixed or varied at some other time or in some other manner or by some person other than him:

Provided that—

(a) the appropriate Minister shall not exercise his powers under this subsection in any manner which in his opinion would reduce the amounts payable to producers in respect of produce mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act except where it appears to him expedient so to do in consequence of an annual or special review held by the Ministers under the last foregoing section;

4.—(1) Where it appears to the appropriate Minister that Power to arrangements such as are mentioned in subsection (1) of the *uPPlement last foregoing section which are in operation in the case of any arrangemen 9 of the produce mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act are in any respect nojt well adapted for securing their object, or that no satisfactory arrangements such as are mentioned in the said subsection (1) are in operation in the case of that produce, he may by order provide—

(a) for varying the methods by which under any such arrangements the object thereof is to be achieved;

(b) where no such arrangements are in operation, for bringing into operation, or where such arrangements are in operation for replacing or supplementing them by, such provisions as appear to him expedient for providing guaranteed prices or assured markets as mentioned in the said subsection (1), including (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph) provisions for all or any of the following matters, that is to say—

(i) for securing that, subject to any specified limits of quantity, a producer who has failed to effect a sale at a specified price through the ordinary means of trading in produce mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act shall, subject to the specified conditions, be enabled to sell the produce at the specified price to such person as may be specified;

(6) the Minister shall have the powers of direction and dispossession conferred by the following provisions of this Part of this Act.

(4) Where, in the year nineteen hundred and forty-six, goods were carried for hire or reward and the carriage thereof was charged for by volume, ascertained otherwise than by means of calibration marks on the vehicle, the weight of those goods shall be taken for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the said subsection (1) to have been one ton for every eighty cubic feet of the volume of the goods, and so proportionately for volumes which are not an exact multiple of eighty cubic feet.

(5) For the purposes of paragraph ( of the said subsection «<i), the total value to the undertaking of the services of the vehicles therein referred to shall be ascertained by adding together—

(a) the receipts of the undertaking in respect of carriage for hire or reward in those vehicles,* and

(б) a sum in respect of goods carried therein otherwise than for hire or reward equal to the amount which it would have been reasonable for the person carrying on the undertaking to charge for the carriage thereof if he had been lawfully carrying them for hire or reward,

any carriage which could be effected without a licence being in force in respect of the vehicle being left out of account.

(b) in the case of a trailer (other than a superimposed trailer) by deducting, where one or more complete years have elapsed between the date on which the vehicle was first put into u$e and the date of transfer, one-seventh of the said cost in respect of the first year and, in respect of each subsequent year, one-seventh of the said cost as reduced by the total deduction falling to be made in respect of the previous years; and

Provided that no increase in the said proportion shall be taken into account for the purposes of this subsection except in so far as it is shown by the transferor that the increase could not reasonably be avoided by him.

(5) Where a hire purchase agreement is a relevant contract within the meaning of the preceding provisions of this Part of this Act relating to the effect of notices of acquisition and the effect of the notice of acquisition is to vest the rights of the hirer in the Commission, the Commission shall pay to the transferor the same compensation as would have fallen to be paid if the property which is the subject of the agreement had vested in the Commission, less the amount remaining to be paid under the agreement before the hirer can become the owner of the property:

Orders giving effect to Schemes.

Part I,

1.—(1) Where it appears to the Minister that the scheme submitted to him makes satisfactory provision with respect to the matters dealt with in the scheme, he shall prepare the draft* of an order embodying the scheme and give notice of the preparation of the draft and that he proposes to proceed with the making of the order:

Provided that, in the case of a scheme under Part IV of this Act which provides for the transfer of the whole or any part of any undertaking, the Minister shall not regard the scheme as making satisfactory provision unless—

(a) where the person theretofore carrying on the undertaking is a local authority or is a joint committee, joint board, joint

Transport Act, 1947.

Ch, 49.

1329

authority or other combined body, being a committee, board, authority or body all the members of which are, or are representatives of, local authorities, it makes provision for compensation to that local authority, joint committee, joint board, joint authority or combined body, which is, in the opinion of the Minister, identical, as near as may be, with the provision made in the case of transfers under Part II of this Act from local authorities;

(6) in the case of an undertaking or part of an undertaking (not being an undertaking theretofore carried on by such a person' as is referred to in subhead (a) of this proviso), the activities of which before the transfer by or under the scheme consist wholly or partly of operating passenger road transport services, and the activities, if any, of which after that transfer will not include the operation of such services, it complies with the provisions of Part II of this Schedule;

(c) in any other case, being a case in which the transfer is, in

the opinion of the Minister, comparable in the material respects to any form of transfer of the whole or part of an undertaking effected under Part II or Part III of this Act, it provides compensation on a basis reasonably comparable in his opinion to that of the compensation provided under this Act in the case of that form of transfer; and

(d) in any other case, it provides, in the opinion of the Minister, proper compensation in respect of the transfer.

References in this sub-paragraph to local authorities (other than the last reference in sub-head (a) of the proviso thereto) include references to councils of county districts.

(2) Where it appears to the Minister in the case of any scheme submitted to him that it would not be expedient to give effect to the scheme in the form in which it was submitted to him, he may refer the scheme with his observations thereon to the Commission for their further consideration and thereupon they shall reconsider the scheme in the light of the Minister’s observations and may again submit the scheme to the Minister with such amendments as they think fit.

2.—(1) A notice under paragraph 1 of this Schedule shall be published—

(a) in the London Gazette, the Edinburgh Gazette, or both, according as the scheme affects England, Scotland, or both; and

(b) in such local newspapers, and in such other ways, if any, as

appear to the Minister best suited for bringing the notice to the attention of persons concerned,

and shall specify a place where the draft of the order may be inspected, and copies thereof obtained at all reasonable hours, and the time (not being less than forty days from the publication of the notice) within, which, and the manner in which, any objections to the draft may be - made to the Minister, and the Minister shall consider any objections made within the time and in the manner specified in the notice:

(2) Any such objection as aforesaid may ask for amendments, additions or modifications to or of the order which amount to amendments, additions or modifications to or of the scheme.

3. —(1) If there are no objections which the Minister is required to consider, or if all such objections are withdrawn, the Minister may make the order either in the terms of the draft or subject to such amendments, additions or modifications, if any, as he thinks fit, being amendments, additions or modifications which in his opinion do not effect important alterations in the draft as published.

(2) Where any such objection is made and is not withdrawn, the Minister shall cause in the case of a scheme under Part IV of this Act, a public local inquiry, or, in any other case, an inquiry, to be held with respect thereto, and the Minister may, after considering the report of the person by whom the inquiry was held make'the order either in the terms of the draft or subject to such amendments, additions or modifications as the Minister thinks fit.

Where relief from tax paid for any year of assessment or chargeable accounting period is given to any person by repayment, he shall be entitled to require that the amount repaid shall be treated for the purposes of this subsection, so far as it will go, as if it were a discharge of the tax charged on him (whether alone or together with other persons) by or by virtue of any assessment or direction for or relating to the same year or period, so, however, that it shall not be applied to any assessment or direction made or given after the relief was given and that it

shall not be applied to more than one assessment or direction so as to reduce, without extinguishing, the amount of tax charged thereby:

Provided that where the relief is from the tax paid for two or more chargeable accounting periods, without distinction between them, every assessment or direction for or relating to any of those periods shall be treated for the purposes of this subsection as an assessment or direction for or relating to the same period as that for which the tax from which the relief is given was paid.

Notwithstanding anything in the previous provisions of this subsection, no relief, whether given by way of discharge or repayment, shall be treated for the purposes of this subsection as—

(a) affecting tax charged by any assessment to surtax or to the profits tax unless it is a relief from surtax or the profits tax, as the case may be ; or

(б) affecting tax charged by any assessment to, or by virtue

of any direction with respect to, excess profits tax unless it is a relief from excess profits tax; or

(c) affecting tax charged by any assessment to income tax made under Schedule D if either—

(i) it is a relief from surtax, the profits tax or excess profits tax ; or

(ii) it arises in connection with income taxable otherwise than under Schedule D ; or

(iii) it relates to a source income from which is taxable otherwise than under Schedule D.

(5) This section extends to assessments and directions notwithstanding that they were made or given before the passing of this Act or were made or given for years of assessment or chargeable accounting periods which have ended before the passing thereof.

(6) The interest payable under this section shall be paid without any deduction of income tax, shall be recoverable as a debt due to the Crown from the person by whom the tax in respect of which interest is charged is payable and shall not be allowed as a deduction in computing any income, profits or losses for any of the purposes of the Income Tax Acts or of the enactments relating to the profits tax.

(7) A certificate of a collector that interest is payable under this section and that payment of the interest has not been made to him, or, to the best of his knowledge and belief, to any other collector, or to any person acting on his behalf or on behalf of another collector, shall be sufficient evidence that the sum mentioned in the certificate is unpaid and is due to the Crown, and

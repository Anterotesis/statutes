And whereas at a meeting held at Brussels in October,

1923, the rules contained in the said draft convention were amended by the Committee appointed by the said

Conference:

And whereas it is expedient that the said rules as so amended and as set out, with modifications in the Schedule to this Act (in this Act referred to as “ the Rules ”) should,

subject to the provisions of this Act, be given the force of law with a view to establishing the responsibilities,

liabilities, rights and immunities attaching to carriers under bills of lading:

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent

Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present

5 . Where under the custom of any trade the weight of any bulk cargo inserted in the bill of lading is a weight ascertained or accepted by a third party other than the carrier or the shipper and the fact that the weight is so ascertained or accepted is stated in the bill of lading,

then, notwithstanding anything in the Rules, the bill of lading shall not be deemed to be prima facie evidence against the carrier of the receipt of goods of the weight so inserted in the bill of lading, and the accuracy thereof at the time of shipment shall not be deemed to have been guaranteed by the shipper.

6. —(1) This Act may be cited as the Carriage of

Minister and Board are satisfied that the total number of houses which have been completed in the two years last preceding and in respect of which contributions are payable, is less than two-thirds of the number set opposite to those two years in the First Schedule to this Act,

whether the deficiency is due to the absence of adequate arrangements for the necessary increase in the supply of labour (including any necessary augmentation of the number of apprentices employed) or for the necessary increase in the supply of materials at reasonable prices, or for the obtaining of funds at reasonable rates of interest to finance the

(6) if, on a report made after due inquiry by a

body of independent persons appointed by them, the Minister and Board are satisfied that the cost of erecting houses in respect of which contributions are payable has become unreasonable, regard being had to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to the question whether and how far any increase in the cost or any excessive charges are attributable to causes within the control of persons engaged whether as employers or workers in the building industry or in the manufacture or supply of building materials.

(3) When any such order has been made the Minister or Board shall not be liable to make or to undertake to make any contributions in respect of houses which have not been completed before the date specified in the order, other than a house which is completed not later than eight months after the specified date in respect of which the Minister or Board is satisfied that the failure to complete the house before the specified date was due to circumstances over which the local authority, person,

or body constructing the house had no control.

of 5. In the year nineteen hundred and twenty-six,

after the first day of October in that year and in each second succeeding year, after the first day of October in such year, the Minister and the Scottish Board of Health shall take into consideration the expenses which are likely to be incurred in the period of two years from such first day of October in connection with the provision of houses in respect of which contributions would be payable by the Minister or Board, due regard being had to the expenses actually incurred during the period of two years ending on that day for the like purposes, and after consultation with such associations of local authorities as appear to them to be concerned,

and with any local authority with whom consultation appears to them to be desirable, may, if they think it expedient so to do, jointly make an order altering the amount of the contributions payable or the period for which such contributions are to be payable, so far as respects houses which have not been completed before the

Housing, &c. Act, 1923, or (in the case of houses subject to special conditions) by this Act, unless

Parliament otherwise determines.

An order under this section shall make such consequential alterations of any sums or periods mentioned in the financial provisions of the said Act or in this Act, including the sum of four pounds ten shillings mentioned in subsection (1) of section three of tins Act,

as appear to the Minister and Board to be necessary for the purpose of adjusting the same to any alteration made by the order in the amount or duration of the contributions, and that Act and this Act shall have effect accordingly.

6. Before any order is made by the Minister and the Scottish Board of Health under this Act, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before the Commons

House of Parliament, and the order shall not be made unless and until a resolution is passed by that House approving of the draft.

7 . It shall be the duty of a local authority on submitting proposals for the provision of houses for the purposes of this Act to satisfy the Minister—

(a) that they have taken into account the requirements of any town planning scheme likely to be made in respect of or in the neighbourhood of the area in which the houses are to be provided;

and

(b) that the rate of density of the houses, ascertained in such manner as the Minister may determine,

will not, except with the consent of the

Minister, exceed eight per acre in an agricultural parish and twelve per acre elsewhere.

8. Where the Minister approves the proposals of a

local authority in relation to the provision of houses in the area of another local authority, and any difference arises between those authorities with respect to the carrying out of the proposals such difference may be referred by either authority to the Minister whose

(2) If at any time it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister that a local authority have, without reasonable cause, refused to adopt a new material or method of construction which in his opinion would reduce the cost of the house without unduly affecting its durability, suitability or appearance, the Minister shall require the adoption of the said new material or method of construction to be reconsidered for that purpose by the local authority, and, in the event of their failure without reasonable cause to adopt the same,

shall make such deduction from the amount of the contribution payable by him as in his opinion is reasonable having regard to the amount of the unnecessary expenditure so incurred by the local authority, but, for the purpose of paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section three of this Act, the expenses of the local authority shall be calculated as if no such deduction had been made.

11. A local authority in carrying out any proposals approved by the Minister for the purposes of this Act shall have power to determine the number of houses which they will build in any particular period subject to the imposition of a maximum limit by the Minister, and should the local authority find it necessary to suspend

2. — (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act,

agricultural wages committees shall fix minimum rates of wages for workers employed in agriculture for time work,

and may also, if and so far as they think it necessary or expedient, fix minimum rates of wages for workers employed in agriculture for piece work.

(2) Any such minimum rates may be fixed by a

committee so as to apjrly universally to all workers employed in agriculture in the county for which the committee act, or to any special class of workers so employed, or to any special area in the county, or to any special class in a special area, subject in each case to any exceptions which may be made by the committee for employment of any special character, and so as to vary according as the employment is for a day, week, month,

or other period, or according to the number of working hours, or the conditions of the employment, or so as to provide for a differential rate in the case of overtime.

In the exercise of their powers under this subsection

a committee shall, so far as is reasonably practicable,

secure a weekly half-holiday for workers.

(3) If, on an application in that behalf, a committee are satisfied that any worker employed or desiring to be employed on time work to which a minimum rate fixed under this Act is applicable is so affected by any physical injury or mental deficiency, or any infirmity due to age or to any other cause, that he is incapable of earning that minimum rate, the committee shall grant to the worker a permit exempting, as from the date of the application, or from any later date specified in the permit,

(4) In fixing minimum rates a committee shall, so far as practicable, secure for able-bodied men such wages as in the opinion of the committee are adequate to promote efficiency and to enable a man in an ordinary case to maintain himself and his family in accordance with such standard of comfort as may be reasonable in relation to the nature of his occupation.

(5) A committee may, if they think it expedient,

cancel or vary any minimum rate fixed under this Act.

(6) Before fixing, cancelling or varying any minimum rate, the committee shall give such notice as may be prescribed of the rate which they propose to fix or of their proposal to cancel the rate or of the proposed variation of the rate as the case may be, and of the manner in which and the time within which objections to the proposal may be lodged, not being less than fourteen days from the date of the notice, and shall consider any objections to the proposal which may be lodged within the time mentioned in the notice.

Where the proposal is modified in consequence of any objection so lodged, notice of the modified proposal need not be given except where in the opinion of the

4. Any worker employed in agriculture in any county on piece work for which no minimum piece rate has been fixed or any person authorised by such a

worker may complain to the agricultural wages committee for the county that the piece rate of wages paid to the worker for that work is such a rate as would yield in the circumstances of the case to an ordinary worker a less amount of wages than the minimum rate for time work applicable in the case of that worker and the committee may, on any such complaint after giving the employer an opportunity of making such representations as he thinks desirable, direct that the employer shall pay to the worker such additional sum by way of wages for any piece work done by him at that piece rate at any time within fourteen days before the date of complaint or at any time after the date of complaint and before the decision of the committee thereon as in their opinion represents the difference between the amount which would have been paid if the work had been done by an ordinary worker at the minimum rate for time work and the amount actuary received by the worker by whom, or on whose behalf, the complaint is made, and any sum so directed to be paid may be recovered by cr on behalf of the worker from the employer summarily as a civil debt.

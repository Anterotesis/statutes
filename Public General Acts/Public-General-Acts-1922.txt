Section sixty-seven of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, shall apply to any such notice.

(2) From and after the commencement of this Act, no severance of a joint tenancy of a legal estate, so as to create

a tenancy in common in land, shall be permissible, whether by operation of law or otherwise, but this subsection does not affect the right of a joint tenant to release his interest to the other or others, or the right to sever a joint tenancy in an equitable interest (whether or not the legal estate is vested in the joint tenants) but when so vested the land shall be held by the joint tenants on trust for sale.

(e) If at the commencement of this Act there is a person entitled to a perpetually renewable lease in the copy-

hold land (not being a mortgagee) the freehold estate in fee simple shall vest (subject as provided in this schedule) in that person as if he had been a copyholder in fee:

Provided that—

(i) If a question arises as to who had the best right to be admitted as copyholder in fee, or has otherwise become entitled by virtue of this schedule to the freehold estate in fee simple, or to a derivative legal estate, the court, on the application of the lord of the manor or any person interested in the land,

may declare who had the best right to be so admitted, or has become so entitled, or, in case the person who had the best right to be so admitted,

or has become so entitled, cannot be found or ascertained, then on proof that such fines and fees as are made payable by this schedule have been paid or provision made for their payment, the court, on the like application, may make an order vesting the freehold estate in fee simple, or a derivative legal estate (subject to the reservation of any terms of years absolute required for giving effect to incumbrances) in such person as may be appointed by the court for the purpose (who shall, in the case of the fee simple, be deemed to have been admitted to the inheritance), but subject to the manorial incidents affecting the same until those incidents are extinguished under Part VI. of this Act, and the lord may be so appointed and in such case shall be deemed to have paid the fines and fees aforesaid;

a fee simple conditional (whether legal or equitable)

on the birth of issue shall take effect as and be converted into an equitable entailed interest (either general or special as the case may require), if the fee has not become absolute; and

(subject as aforesaid) vest in the personal representatives or trustees of the settlement, or other persons who, under Part I. of this Act, become entitled to the legal estate of the infant; and

(iv) Where at the commencement of this Act the copyhold land was held in undivided shares, the entirety of the freehold estate in fee simple shall

(subject to any terms of years absolute required for giving effect to mortgages affecting the entirety),

vest in trustees for sale in accordance with the provisions of Part I. of this Act; and

(v) Where at the commencement or by virtue of this Act the copyhold land was or is made subject to a trust for sale, the freehold estate in fee simple shall (subject to the terms of years absolute of mortgagees) vest in the trustees for sale in accordance with this Act; and

(vi) Where under the provisions of this schedule the freehold estate in fee simple is (subject or not to any mortgage term), made to vest in any person who was not the copyholder in fee at the commencement of this Act, then such person shall be deemed to have been admitted tenant to the inheritance immediately before such commencement, and such person shall (save as hereinafter provided) be personally liable to pay the fines and fees which would have been payable by him on admittance;

(viii) If at the commencement of this Act there is a copyholder in fee (whether or not being a

mortgagee) then notwithstanding that, by virtue of this Act, the freehold estate in fee simple is made to vest in some other person who has not been admitted to the inheritance, but is deemed to have been so admitted, no fines or fees shall be payable on that account; and

(ix) No fines or fees shall be payable by reason only of the vesting, by virtue of this Act, of a term of years absolute perpetual rentcharge or other derivative legal estate in the person entitled thereto,

although he may not have been admitted at the commencement of this Act.

Scale of Compensation for extinguishment of Manorial

Incidents.

Fines Arbitrary.

1. In fine arbitrary cases where a fine is payable on alienation by, as well as on the death of, a tenant, the compensation for fines shall not exceed the number of years’ annual value of the land according to the age of the tenant as set forth in the table annexed to this schedule.

2. The table is calculated on the principle that a fine based on two years’ annual value is payable on each change of tenancy; therefore, in those manors in which the customary fine on alienatien by, or on the death of, a tenant, is based on more or less than two years’ annual value, a proportionate increase or reduction shall be made in the amount of the compensation.

3. In estimating the annual value of the land, no deduction shall be made for land tax or landlord’s property tax, but the quit rent shall be deducted, and, where there are buildings,

allowance shall be made for keeping the buildings in repair.

In default of agreement the gross annual value of the land as separately assessed for the purposes of Schedule A. of the

Income Tax Act, shall (save as hereinafter provided and unless the Minister for any special reason otherwise directs) be used as the basis for ascertaining the annual value:Provided that either party may in any case require the annual value to be assessed by an agreed valuer or by a valuer appointed by the Minister.

Section 139.

320

t

Ch. 16.

Law of Property Act, 1922. 12 & 13 Geo. 5.

4. Where there are facilities for improvement or the land has a present or prospective building value, one twentieth part of the capital value of the land as freehold to be deter-

* mined (in default of agreement) by a valuer appointed by the Minister, shall be used as a basis for ascertaining the annual-

value.

Fines Certain.

5. In fine certain cases where a fine is payable on alienation by, as well as on the death of, a tenant, the compensation for fines shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the fine by one half of the number of years’ purchase given in the table according to the age of the tenant.

Reliefs.

6. The amount of compensation for a relief shall be calculated in like manner as a fine certain.

Eeriots.

7. The compensation for a heriot payable on alienation by,

as well as on the death of, a tenant, shall be calculated by multiplying the value of the heriot by one half of the number of years’ purchase given in the table according to the age of the tenant.

8. The value of a heriot shall be ascertained from the average value of the last three heriots taken or paid in respect of the land enfranchised. If that information cannot be obtained without undue expense the following circumstances shall be taken into account in fixing the value of the heriot, namely, the nature of the heriot, the character and value of the land, the condition in life of the tenant, and whether the heriot can be seized without as well as within the manor.

When Fine of Heriot payable only on one of the Events of

Alienation or Death.

9. The table being calculated on the assumption that fines and heriots are payable both on alienation inter vivos by a

tenant and on his death, when a fine, whether arbitrary or certain, or a heriot, is payable only on one of those events,

then only one half of the compensation calculated as previously directed shall be given.

1922.

Law of Property Act, 1922.

Cu. 18.

10. In manors in which fines or heriots are payable on the death of the lord, as well as on alienation by, or on the death of, a tenant, the compensation on the extinguishment of manorial incidents shall be increased according to the nature and amount of the customary fine or heriot payable in the manor on the death of the lord.

11. The compensation for quit rents, free rents, and other annual rents, services, or payments, shall be calculated at

20 years’ purchase.

Timber.

12. Compensation for timber shall be ascertained as follows :—Where by a special custom of the manor the lord can enter upon the land, and cut and carry away the timber without the consent of the tenant, its whole value, after making a

sufficient allowance for repairs, shall be given to the lord. But where there is no special custom, so that the ordinary law of copyholds is applicable and therefore the lord cannot enter and cut without the consent of the tenant, one half only of its value, after making a sufficient allowance for repairs, shall be given. If there be any other special custom in the manor relating to timber, such custom shall be regarded.

Other Incidents.

13. The compensation for all incidents of copyhold tenure extinguished or not. saved by virtue of this Act and not otherwise provided for shall be 20 per cent, of the annual value of the land ascertained as provided in paragraphs 3

and 4.

This paragraph extends to forfeitures, whether or not for the conveyance or attempted conveyance of an estate of freehold in the land or for alienation without licence by way of sale, lease, mortgage, or otherwise:

Provided that, where by the custom of the manor the tenant has an unrestricted right of demising and otherwise dealing with the land without the licence of the lord, no compensation shall be payable under this paragraph unless the Minister otherwise determines; and where the unrestricted right relates to part only of the land the compensation shall be adjusted accordingly.

Perpetually Renewable Copyholds.

14. In the case of p°rpetually renewable copyhold land the compensation for the extinguishment of the manorial

When Land held by joint Tenants or on behalf of Tenants in common.

16. In the case of an extinguishment of manorial incidents by joint tenants, the compensation for fines, and heriots, if any,

shall be based upon such a single life as may be equivalent to the expectation of survivorship of the joint lives according to the rules and tables appended to the Succession Duty Act, 1853.

This provision shall apply to an extinguishment of manorial incidents by trustees for sale (whose expectation of survivorship shall be taken into account) on behalf of persons interested as co-parceners or tenants in common in the net proceeds of sale.

Interest. <•

17. Interest shall be payable half-yearly on the amount of the compensation at the rate of five and a half pounds per cent,

per annum from the date of the agreement or notice requiring the ascertainment of the compensation to the date of payment of the compensation, unless the compensation is paid by way of an annual terminable rentcharge under this Act.

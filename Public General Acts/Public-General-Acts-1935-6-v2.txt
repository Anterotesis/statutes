(8) Where the appropriate authority are satisfied that the owner of the land in respect of which a substituted annuity would be charged on §, n apportionment of an annuity under this Act is willing to pay to them, within such period as they may determine, the amount of the consideration money which would be payable for the redemption of the substituted annuity, they may include in the order for apportionment directions for securing that if that amount is paid to them within that period the substituted annuity shall not be charged.

(9) An owner of land in respect of which an annuity is charged may at any time pay to the appropriate authority, with a view to the reduction of the amount of the annuity, a capital sum not being less than twenty-five pounds, and, where such a payment is made,

the amount of the annuity shall be reduced by such an amount, and as from such date, as may be determined by.

the appropriate authority in accordance with the rules,

and the annuity as so reduced shall continue to be charged in respect of the whole of the land in respect of which it was theretofore charged.

(10) The appropriate authority may, on the application of the person by whom any sum is paid in respect of the redemption of an annuity, grant to him a certificate charging any land in respect of which the annuity was charged or any estate or interest therein with that sum or any part thereof, together with interest at such fate as the authority may determine, and a person to whom such a certificate is granted shall be entitled to a charge

SCHEDULES.

FIRST SCHEDULE. section 2.

Part I.

Deductions from Gross Annual Value of a

Tithe Rentcharge for Determination of Amount of Compensation.

For the purpose of determining the amount of stock to be issued for compensation in respect of the extinguishment of a

tithe rentcharge, the following deductions shall be made from the gross annual value thereof, that is to* say :—

1. In respect of the cost of collection and management, a

sum equal to one twentieth of the gross annual value of the rentcharge.

2. In respect of land tax, a sum equal to the average of the amounts which would have been payable on account of that tax for the years ending on the twenty-fourth day of March,

nineteen hundred and thirty-four, thirty-five and thirty-six

(due regard being had to any exemption or abatement under section twelve of the Finance Act, 1898, as amended by any 61 & 62 Vict,

subsequent enactment), if the sum payable in respect of the c. 10.

rentcharge in each of those years had been equal to the gross annual value of the rentcharge:

Provided that no deduction shall be made under this paragraph in the case of a rentcharge if the land tax in respect therfeof •

was redeemed before the twenty-sixth day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-six.

3. In respect of rates, subject to the provisions of ptflra-

graphs 4 and 6 of this Part—

(a) in the case of a rentcharge vested for an interest in fee simple in possession in Queen Anne’s Bounty by the Tithe Act, 1925, which was formerly attached to a benefice, a sum equal to one twenty-first part of the gross annual value of the rentcharge;

(b) in the case of a rentcharge vested for an interest in fee simple in possession in Queen'Anne’s Bounty by the Tithe Act, 1925, which was formerly attached

-— cont.

Ch. 43. Tithe Act, 1936. 26 Geo. 5. &

1 Edw. 8.

to an ecclesiastical corporation, a sum bearing the same proportion to the gross annual value of the rentcharge as the sum of sixteen pounds bears to the sum of one hundred and five pounds

(c) in the case of any other rentcharge, a sum to be calculated in the following manner, that is to say, the

Commission shall ascertain as regards each of the three years ending on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, thirty-five and thirty-six—

(i) the poundage rate at which general rates were levied;

(ii) the poundage rate at which any rates, in respect of which tithe rentcharge was rated on a

proportion only of its rateable value, were levied;

and

(iii) particulars of deductions from net annual value in arriving at rateable value;

and the Commission shall thereupon calculate the average annual rate of poundage at which the rent-

charge was assessable to rates during those three years, any liability to pay on a proportion only of the rateable value and any deduction in arriving at the rateable value being treated as a corresponding reduction of poundage in respect of that rate, and the amount to be deducted under this paragraph shall be the sum which would have been levied as rates had such average annual rate of poundage been applied to the reduced rateable value of the rentcharge, and for the purposes of this sub-paragraph the expression

“ reduced rateable value ” means, in relation to

a rentcharge, a sum ascertained by deducting from nineteen-twentieths of the gross annual value thereof the following fraction of such nineteen-

twentieths, that is to say, the. ascertained average rate of poundage in shillings over that ascertained average rate plus twenty shillings. •

4. In the case of a rentcharge created in lieu of any com rent? or like payment which was free from rates, or a rent-

charge which was otherwise free from rates, no deduction shall be made in respect of rates, and, subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Part, in a case in which the owner of a rent-

charge was liable during the three years aforesaid to be charged only a proportion of any rate, the deduction in respect of rates shall be that proportion of the sum calculated in accordance with the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph.

5. In the case of a rentcharge which was subject to a lease, or was held in trust for persons entitled in undivided shares,

1936.

Tithe Act, 1936.

Ch. 43.

1117

immediately before the appointed day, or which was vested for an interest less than a fee simple in possession in Queen Anne’s

Bounty by the Tithe Act, 1925, the deduction in respect of rates shall be such amount, calculated by reference to sub-paragraph (c)

of paragraph 3 of this Part, as the Commission may determine to be just having regard to the circumstances.

6. In respect of losses in collection, of remissions, and of the benefit resulting in rolation to security of income from the replacement of the rentcharge by stock, a sum equal to one-twentieth of the amount of the rentcharge.

Part II.

Modifications to be made in certain cases in

DETERMINING AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION.

1. In the case of a tithe rentcharge the fee simple in possession whereof was vested in Queen Anne’s Bounty by the Tithe Act, 1925, the amount of stock to be issued for compensation as ascertained apart from this provision shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value at the appointed day, as estimated by the Treasury, of the sums accumulated in respect of the refit-

charge in the sinking fund established under that Act (including any sum carried to the sinking fund after the appointed day)

or, if any payment into the sinking fund has been postponed under proviso (ii) to subsection (1) of section five of that Act, of the sums which would have been so accumulated if there had been no such postponement, due account being taken of any increased payment prescribed under that proviso.

2. In the case of a contingent tithe rentcharge, the amount of stock to be issued for compensation shall be an amount ascertained, so far as the special incidents to which the rentcharge was subject permit, in like manner as if the rentcharge had not been a contingent rentcharge, but reduced by such an amaunj as appears to the Commission to be just having regard to those incidents.

3. In the ease of a tithe rentcharge created in lieu of a com rent or like payment which was free from income tax, the amount of stock to issued for compensation as ascertained apart from this provision shall be increased by such an amount as appears to the Commission to be just having regard to the fact that the rentcharge was so free.

2. Prom the award value as so fixed, increased or reduced,

as the case may be, there shall be deducted a sum equal to one-twentieth of that value in respect of the cost of collection and management, and a sum equal to the average amount per annum, if any, which was paid or payable by the owner of the rent in respect of rates and land tax during the three years immediately before the last mentioned date or, in a case where the award value is increased or reduced, would have been so paid or payable if the annual collectable value of the rent during those years had been equal to the award value as increased or reduced:

Provided that no deduction in respect of cost of collection and management shall be made in a case in which the consideration money for the redemption is to be discharged by an annuity.

3. The net sum remaining after the said deductions have been made shall be deemed to be the net annual value of *fchel

Provisions for securing the abatement of nuisances

WHICH MAY BE DEALT WITH SUMMARILY.

1. In this Schedule, unless the context otherwise requires,

the expression “nuisance to which this Schedule applies” means any matter which, by virtue of any of the provisions of this Act,

is a nuisance which may be dealt with summarily under this Act,

and the expression “smoke nuisance ” does not include a smoke nuisance arising on a ship habitually used as a sea-going ship.

2. It shall be the duty of every officer of a sanitary authority,

and of every relieving officer, to give, in accordance with the regulations of the authority whose officer he is, information to the sanitary authority of the existence in their district of any nuisance to which this Schedule applies.

It shall be the duty of the county council and of every sanitary authority to make regulations for the purpose of this paragraph.

3. A written intimation of the existence in the district of a

sanitary authority of a nuisance to which this Schedule applies shall be served by an officer of the authority on a person who may be required to abate the nuisance, and it shall be the duty of the Sanitary authority to give such directions to their officers as will secure that the intimation required by this paragraph is given as soon as may be.

4. A sanitary authority, upon receiving any information as to the existence in their district of a nuisance to which this

Schedule applijp shall, if satisfied of the existence of the nuisance,

serve on the person by reason of whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance arose or continues, or (if that person cannot be found)

on the occupier or owner of the premises on which the nuisance exists, a notice requiring him to abate the nuisance within the period specified in the notice, and to do such things as may be necessary for that purpose; and the notice may, if the sanitary authority think fit, specify any works to be executed for the purpose aforesaid:

Provided that, where the nuisance arises from any want or defect of a structural character, or where the premises are unoccupied, the notice aforesaid shall be served on the owner of the premises.

The sanitary authority may also, by a notice under the foregoing provisions of this paragraph or by further notice, require the person on whom the notice is served to do what is necessary for preventing the recurrence of the

nuisance to which the notice relates and, if they think it desirable,

specify any works to be executed for that purpose, and a notice containing such a requirement may, notwithstanding that the nuisance to which it relates may for the time being have been abated, be served if the sanitary authority consider that the nuisance is likely to recur on the same premises.

A notice authorised to be served under this paragraph is in this Schedule referred to as “a nuisance notice.”

5. Where the person causing a nuisance to which this

Schedule applies cannot be found, and it is clear that the nuisance neither arose nor continues by reason of any act, default or sufferance on the part of the . occupier or owner of the premises on which it exists, the sanitary authority may themselves abate the nuisance and may do what is necessary to prevent the recurrence thereof.

6. Where a nuisance notice is served on any person, then if either—

(a) the nuisance to which the notice relates arose by reason of the wilful act or default of that person; or

(b) that person fails to comply with any of the requirements of the notice within the period specified therein,

he shall (whether or not an order under the next following paragraph has been made in respect of him) be liable to a fine not exceeding, in a case where the notice relates to a smoke nuisance,

fifty pounds or, in any other case, ten pounds.

7. Where a nuisance notice is served on any person,

then if—

(a) that person fails to comply with any of the requirements of the notice within the period specified (herein; or

(b) the nuisance to which the order relates, although abated since the service of the notice, is, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, likely to recur on the same premises,

the sanitary authority shall make a oomplaint to a petty sessional court, and the court hearing the complaint may make as respects the said person a summary order (in this Schedule referred to as “ a nuisance order ”).

8. A nuisance order may be an abatement order, a prohibition order or a closing order, or a combination of suoh orders.

An abatement order may require a person to comply with all or any of the requirements of the nuisance notice in connection with which the order is made, or otherwise to abate the nuisance within the period specified in the Order.

nuisance, the dwelling-house is unfit for human habitation;

and the court making a closing order may impose a fine not exceeding twenty pounds on the person as respects whom the order is made.

9. An abatement order or prohibition order shall, if the person as respects whom the order is made so requires or the court considers it desirable, specify the works to be executed by the said person for the purpose of abating, or preventing a

recurrence of, the nuisance to which the order relates.

A petty sessional court, if satisfied that a dwelling-house in respect of which a closing order is in force has been rendered fit for human habitation, may declare that it is so satisfied and revoke the closing order.

10. Where two convictions for offences relating to the overcrowding of a house or part of a house in the district of

a sanitary authority have taken place within a period of three months (whether the persons convicted were or were not the same), a petty sessional court may, on the application of the sanitary authority, make an order directing that the house be closed for such period as the court thinks necessary.

11. Where a petty sessional court is satisfied that neither the person by reason of whose act, default or sufferance a nuisance to which this Schedule applies arose or continues, nor the owner nor the occupier of the premises on which such a nuisance exists,

is known or can be found, any nuisance order made by the court with respect to that nuisance may be addressed to the sanitary authority, and, if so addressed, shall be executed by them.

12. If any person fails to comply with an abatement order, then, subject to the following provisions of this Schedule,

he shall, unless he proves that he has used all due diligence to carry out the order, be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding, in a case where the order relates to a smoke nuisance forty shillings, or in any other case twenty shillings, for every day on which the offence continues.

If any person knowingly and wilfully contravenes a prohibition order or a closing order, he shall, subject to the provisions of this Schedule relating to appeals, be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding, in a case where the order relates to

a smoke nuisance five pounds, or in any other case forty shillings,

for every day on which the offence continues.

13. There shall be no appeal to quarter sessions against a

nuisance order, unless it is or includes a prohibition order or a

closing order or requires the execution of structural works.

— cont . nuisance order, no person shall, by reason of any contravention of, or non-compliance with, the order, be liable to any fine until after the determination or abandonment of the appeal:

Provided that, if the appeal is dismissed or abandoned, the appellant shall be liable to a fine not exceeding, in a case where the order relates to a smoke nuisance forty shillings, or in any other case twenty shillings, for every day during which he has contravened or failed to comply with the order, unless he satisfies the court before which proceedings are taken for the recovery of the fine, that there was substantial ground for the appeal and that the appeal was not brought merely for the purpose of delay;

and if the appeal is dismissed, the court of quarter sessions hearing the appeal may, on dismissing it, impose the fine as if it was a petty sessional court.

15, Where a person appeals to quarter sessions against a

nuisance order, no work shall, save as hereinafter mentioned,

be done under the order until after the determination or abandonment of the appeal:

Provided that, if the court by which the order was made is of opinion that the continuance of the nuisance to which it relates will be injurious or dangerous to health, and that the immediate abatement thereof will not cause any injury which cannot be compensated by damages, that court may, notwithstanding that the appeal is pending, authorise the sanitary authority immediately to abate the nuisance; so, however, that—

(a) if the appeal is allowed, the sanitary authority shall pay to the person against whom the order was made the amount of any damage sustained by him by reason of the abatement of the nuisance by the authority; and

(b) if the appeal is dismissed or abandoned, the sanitary authority may recover from the said person the expenses incurred by them in abating the nuisance.

16. The sanitary authority—

(1) may, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any nuisance to which this Schedule applies exists on any premises, enter those premises at any hour by day or, in the case of a nuisance arising in respect of any business carried on in the premises, at any hour when that business is being, or is usually, carried on therein; and

(2) where such a nuisance as aforesaid has been ascertained to exist on any premises, or a nuisance order has been made in respect of a nuisance existing on any premises,

may enter the premises at any hour by day or, in the

1936. Public Health Ch. 50.

(London) Act, 1936.

case of a nuisance arising in respect of any business earned on in the premises, at any hour when that business is being, or is usually, carried on therein, until the nuisance is abated, or the works required by the order to be executed are completed, or (in the case of a closing order) the order is revoked, as the case may be; and

(3) where a nuisance order in respect of any premises has been contravened or not complied with, may, for the purpose of executing the order, enter the premises at all reasonable hours, including hours during which business is being, or is usually, carried on in the premises.

The sanitary authority may enter the premises to which a

nuisance order relates and may abate or remove the nuisance and do whatever is necessary in the execution of the order.

17. Any matter or thing removed by a sanitary authority in abating, or doing what is necessary to prevent the recurrence of, a nuisance to which this Schedule applies, may be sold by public auction, or, if the authority think the circumstances of the case require it, may be otherwise sold, or may be disposed of without sale.

The money arising from the sale of any matter or thing under this paragraph may be retained by the sanitary authority and applied in payment of the expenses incurred by them in connection with the nuisance, and the surplus (if any) shall be paid, on demand, to the owner of the matter or thing.

18. Where a nuisance order is made, the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining or enforcing the order or making the complaint upon which, or serving the nuisance notice in connection with which, the order was made, shall be deemed to be money paid for the use, and at the request, —

(a) of the person against whom the order was made, or

(b) if the order is addressed to the sanitary authority,

of the person by whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance was caused.

Where, on any complaint under this Schedule, a nuisance order is not made, but the nuisance in respect of which the complaint is made is proved to have existed at the time when the nuisance notice relating thereto was served or the complaint was made, the reasonable expenses incurred in serving the notice or making the complaint shall be deemed to be money paid for the use, and at the request, of the person by whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance was caused.

Any sum recoverable by virtue of this paragraph from any person being the owner of any premises may be recovered from the owner for the time being of those premises.

19. Expenses recoverable by virtue of the last foregoing paragraph, and fines incurred by virtue of this Schedule in relation to a nuisance to which this Schedule applies, may be recovered either in a summary manner or in the High Court or county court; and where, in any proceedings against two or more persons in respect of such a nuisance, it is proved that the nuisance was caused by the acts, defaults or sufferance of more than one of those persons, the court before which the proceedings are taken may, in imposing any fine or making any order as to costs or expenses, apportion the amount of the fine or of the costs or expenses, in such proportions as the court thinks just, between the persons by whose acts, defaults or sufferance the nuisance was caused.

20. Complaint of the existence on any premises of a nuisance to which this Schedule applies may be made by any person to a

petty sessional court, and thereupon the like proceedings shall be had, with the like incidence and consequence as to making of orders, fines for disobedience of orders, appeals and otherwise,

as in the case of a like complaint by the sanitary authority:

Provided that the court, if it thinks fit—

(a) may adjourn the hearing or further hearing of the complaint for the purpose of having an examination made of the premises where the nuisance is alleged to exist, and may authorise any constable or other person to enter the premises for that purpose; and

(b) may authorise any constable or other person to do all necessary acts for enforcing any order made on the complaint, and to recover the expenses of so doing in a

summary manner from the person as respects whom the order is made.

Any constable or other person authorised under this paragraph shall have the like powers and be subject to the like restrictions as if he were an officer of the sanitary authority authorised under the foregoing provisions of this Schedule to enter premises and do any acts thereon.

21. A sanitary authority may, if, in their opinion, summary proceedings would afford an inadequate remedy, cause proceedings to be taken against any person in the High Court for the abatement or prohibition of any nuisance to which this

Schedule applies, or for the recovery of any fine from, or for the punishment of, any person offending under the provisions of this Schedule relating to such nuisances as aforesaid.

Schedule, as if the act, default or sufferance had occurred within their district; so, however, that summary proceedings shall in no case be taken otherwise than before a court having jurisdiction in the district within which the act or omission is alleged to have occurred.

For the purpose of proceedings which may be taken under this paragraph by a sanitary authority in respect of a nuisance wholly or partly caused by some act, default or sufferance occurring outside the county, the expression “nuisance to which this Schedule applies ” in this paragraph shall be construed as including a nuisance within the meaning of the Public Health

* The annual sum set out in the Table is that which will normally be payable to a widow or a single nominated dependant in respect of the pensions (each of a capitalised value of £200) payable under sections 4 and 5 (or, in cases where a disability pension has been taken, payable to a widow under sections 4 and 6) of the Measure.

Where the repayable contributions exceed £200, the capitalised value of the pension payable under section 5, and, consequently, the figures in the Table, must be increased. Similarly, where the only pension payable is the pension of capitalised Value £200 payable under section 4, the figures in the Table, which are calculated on £400, will suffer a proportionate decrease.

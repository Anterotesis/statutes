property has been issued under the last preceding section; or

(b) the Board have approved the issue by the Commission

Provided that, without prejudice to the power of the Minister to give or refuse his consent under this subsection in any case and on any ground, the Minister shall so exercise his powers under this subsection as to secure that—

(i) the total weight unladen of the motor vehicles made

over to companies thereunder does not exceed five-fourths of the total weight unladen of the motor vehicles owned on the first day of January, nineteen hundred and forty-eight, by the bodies corporate which, on that day, came, by virtue of Part II of the Transport Act, 1947, under the direct or indirect control of the Commission; and

(3) So long as any company to which property has been made over under this section remains under the direct or indirect control of the Commission, any person employed by the company shall be deemed for the purposes of section ninety-five of the Transport Act, 1947 (which relates to terms and conditions of employment of staff), to be employed by the Commission and to be under the direct control of the Commission itself.

5.—(1) If it appears to the Commission that it is expedient that any property held by them for the purposes of the existing road haulage undertaking should, instead of being disposed of under section three or section four of this Act, be disposed of under this section and that such disposal will not prejudice the purposes to which the Commission are to have regard under subsection (3) of the said section three, they may make over that property, together with any such rights or obligations of theirs as in their opinion can conveniently be made over therewith, to a company under their control in the shares of which no other person than they themselves have any beneficial interest, with a view to die subsequent sale of the shares of the company:

Provided that the Commission shall not exercise their powers under this subsection without the approval of /the Board, and the Board shall not give their approval unless it appears to them that the proposed course of action is expedient and will not prejudice 4he purposes to which the Commission are to have regard as aforesaid.

(2) Where any property is made over to a company under subsection (1) of this section, it shall be made over at a price equal to the net value thereof as shown in the books of the Commission (but adjusted so as to take into account depreciation up to the time of the making over thereof so far as not already taken into account), increased by the value, if any, as so shown, of any rights of the Commission made over therewith, and decreased by the value, if any, as so shown, of any liabilities of the Commission made over therewith.

(3) Where the Commission have made over any property to a company under subsection (1) of this section, they shall proceed to the sale of all the shares thereof as soon as is reasonably practicable, and to that end shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, by public notice invite tenders for the purchase (in one parcel) of all those shares, on conditions specified in the notice or ascertainable in a manner specified in the notice:

Provided that—

(a) no invitation to tender under this section shall be issued without the approval of the Board; and

(b) if it appears to the Commission that the sale of the shares by tender would be inappropriate and would be unlikely to secure the best possible price for the shares, they may, with the approval of the Board, sell the shares (in one parcel) otherwise than by tender.

(4) In determining whether any tender or offer for the shares of any such company as aforesaid is to be accepted or refused, the Commission shall have regard to the desirability of avoiding any step which is likely to lead to the elimination or undue restriction of competition in the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward, but no such tender or offer shall be refused wholly or mainly on the ground that it is likely to lead to the elimination or undue restriction of such competition as aforesaid without the consent of the Minister.

(5) No tender or offer for the shares of any such company as aforesaid shall be accepted or refused by the Commission without the approval of the Board, and the Board shall not approve the acceptance of any such tender or offer unless they are satisfied that the price is a reasonable one having regard to the value of the company’s undertaking and the rights conferred by the subsequent provisions of this section.

(6) If any difference arises between the Commission and the Board under this section, the Commission or the Board may refer

20

1 & 2 Eliz. 2

Where Scotland is affected, the Minister shall consult the Secretary of State for Scotland before giving any directions under this subsection.

(7) Where property is made over to a company under subsection (1) of this section, section twelve of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, shall have effect as if—

(b) the Commission shall give all such notices and make all such applications as are necessary to secure that no such vehicle, being a motor vehicle, is included in an A licence so granted otherwise than by virtue of such a substitution as aforesaid and that any such vehicle, being a motor vehicle, which has been included in such an A licence otherwise than by virtue of such a substitution is removed therefrom;

(c) any such vehicles, being trailers, shall be left out of account for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the proviso to the last preceding subsection.

(10) Any property made over to a company under subsection

(1) of this section shall be deemed for the purposes of section six of this Act to have been disposed of as or as part of a transport unit, but if, after any property has been so made over to a company but before the shares of the company have been transferred in pursuance of the sale thereof under this section, any property of the company (whether part of such property or not) is transferred to the Commission, the property so transferred to the Commission shall be deemed for all the purposes of this Act to become property held by the Commission for the purposes of the existing road haulage undertaking and shall be dealt with accordingly.

provisions of section fifteen of this Act, in the case of the Vehicles described in the first column of the Tables in Parts I and III of the Second Schedule to this Act, being vehicles which are used on public roads in Great Britain on or after the first day of January, nineteen hundred and fifty-four, a charge, in this Act referred to as “ the transport levy ”, shall be made in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section for the benefit of the Transport Fund established under the next following section.

(2) The transport levy shall be charged for the periods covered by the licences taken out in respect of the vehicle in question under the Vehicles (Excise) Act, 1949, and the amount charged by way of the levy for any such period shall be the amount by which the excise duty payable upon that licence would be increased if the annual amount of that duty were increased by the amount arrived at by multiplying the unit charge, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, by the appropriate multiplier, as defined in subsection (4) thereof.

(3) The amount referred to in this section as “the unit charge

(a) shall, until the end of the year nineteen hundred and

fifty-five, be thirteen shillings and sixpence;

(b) subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of section

fifteen of this Act, shall, for each period of three years following the end of that year, be such sum as may be fixed in relation to that period by an order of the Minister made under this subsection before the beginning of that period or, if no sum is so fixed, the sum which was the unit charge immediately before the beginning of that period,

and the Minister shall exercise his powers under this subsection in respect of each period with a view to securing that, as nearly as conveniently may be, the said Transport Fund will, over that period, be sufficient and not more than sufficient to meet the payments falling to be made therefrom.

The power conferred on the Minister by this subsection to make orders shall be exercisable by statutory instrument and no order shall be made by the Minister under this subsection unless a draft thereof has been laid before Parliament and has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. 4

(4) The number referred to in this section as “ the appropriate multiplier ” is the number arrived at under the second column of the Table in Part I, or, as the case may be, the fourth and fifth columns of the Table in Part III, of the Second Schedule to

(5) Sections eight, nine, eleven to fifteen and twenty-one to twenty-five of the Vehicles (Excise) Act, 1949 (which contain provisions as to the collection of the excise duties under that Act and as to other connected matters), shall have effect as if the transport levy payable in the case of a vehicle for any period were part of the duty payable under that Act in respect of that vehicle for that period:

Provided that—

(a) the transport levy paid to a council in respect of any

vehicle shall be paid by it to the Minister in accordance with such directions as may be contained in any Order in Council made under the said section eight instead of being paid into the Exchequer; and

make regulations for the purpose of carrying that Act into effect shall include power to make regulations for the purpose of carrying this section into effect

(2) If it appears to the Minister that the Transport Fund will be insufficient for the time being to meet the payments falling to be made therefrom, he may, within the period of twelve months following the passing of this Act, pay into the Fund, out of moneys provided by Parliament, sums not exceeding in all fifty thousand pounds, but sums equal to the sums so paid into the Fund shall, as soon as the resources of the Fund are sufficient for the purpose, be paid out of the Fund into the Exchequer.

(3) If at any time the Transport Fund is insufficient to make all the payments which have become due to be paid therefrom, the payments shall be made as soon as the Fund becomes sufficient for the purpose, and, as between such payments, priority shall be given, first, to the salaries, allowances and expenses of the Board, next, to the payments into the Exchequer required by subsection (2) of this section, next, to payments of interest, and next to payments to the Commission in respect of compensation paid by them to officers and servants.

(4) Any sums standing to the credit of the Transport Fund which are not for the time being required for the purpose of making payments out of the Fund may be invested by the Minister in such securities as may be approved by the Treasury, and any income arising therefrom shall be paid into the Fund.

Provided that the Minister shall, not later than the thirtieth day of September, nineteen hundred and fifty-four, make a provisional estimate of the total amount falling to be paid as aforesaid and a provisional determination of the said period, and shall from time to time revise that estimate, and, if he thinks that the variations in his estimates warrant that course, also that determination, and—

(i) the instalments from time to time payable shall be cal-

culated and paid by reference to the latest estimate and determination for the time being; and

(ii) if, on a revision of the estimate or the determination, it appears that too little or too much has been paid, the subsequent instalments shall be adjusted as the Minister may direct in order to make good the excess or deficiency.

(2) The Minister—

shall, as respects the road haulage capital loss, consult the auditor or auditors of the Commission who shall furnish him with such information and certificates as he may require;

(3) If at any time the Transport Fund is for the time being more than sufficient to make all the payments which have become due to be paid therefrom, such sum, if any, as the Minister may direct shall be paid therefrom to the Commission, and, where any payment is made under this subsection, the total amount falling to be paid under subsection (1) of this section shall be deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment and the said total amount shall be estimated or re-estimated accordingly.

A direction may be given under this subsection either before or after the payment of the first instalment under subsection (1) of this section but not later than the payment of the final instalment thereunder, and, where the direction is given after any estimate has been made under the proviso to that subsection, the amount directed to be paid shall not exceed the total amount of the instalments remaining to be paid, calculated by reference to the latest such estimate.

(4) Interest at such rates as may from time to time >be fixed by directions of the Treasury shall be paid out of the Transport Fund to the Commission at such times as the Minister may direct on so much of the amount required to be paid therefrom by subsection (1) of this section as is due and remains unpaid and, for the purposes of this subsection—

(a) the whole of the said amount shall be deemed to have

become due at the end of June, nineteen hundred and fifty-four; and

(b) the proviso to the said subsection (1) shall, with any

necessary adaptations, apply in relation to the payments of interest as it applies in relation to the instalments.

The rate fixed by any direction of the Treasury under this subsection shall be such as would in the opinion of the Treasury be appropriate for securities the principal of which and the interest on which was charged on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom or the growing produce thereof, being securities issued at par at the time when the direction was given and redeemable twenty years after their issue.

15.—(1) If, in the last year of any of the periods of three years referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of section twelve of this Act, it appears to the Minister that, if the transport levy ceases to be charged at the end of that period, the Transport Fund will be sufficient to meet all the payments falling to be made there&om, he shall by order provide that the transport levy shall not be charged in respect of the use of any vehicle after the end of that period.

(2) If, in the last year of any of the said periods, it appears to the Minister that the amounts required to make the Transport

Ch. 13

Fund sufficient to meet all the payments falling to be made therefrom can be provided if the transport levy ceases to be charged at the end of the first, or at the end of the second, of the years comprised in the next following such period, he may by order provide that the transport levy shall not be charged in respect of the use of any vehicle after the end of the first, or, as the case may be, the second, of the said years and shall by that order fix the sum which is to be treated as the unit charge for that year or, as the case may be, for those years.

(3) Where the Minister makes an order under subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section, he may by the same or a subsequent order direct that the Transport Fund shall be wound upon such date as may be specified in die order, and, if such an order is made, the assets of the Fund at that date shall be made over to the Commission in full satisfaction of any payments which otherwise would have fallen to be made therefrom to the Commission after that date.

(4) In considering for the purposes of this section whether or not the Transport Fund will be sufficient to meet the payments falling to be made therefrom, the Minister—

(a) may ignore an insufficiency less than the estimated net

produce of the transport levy for one year with a unit charge of sixpence;

to the Commission for payments in respect of compensation to officers and servants by way of periodical payments.

(5) The powers conferred on the Minister by this section to . make orders shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, and no order making any such provision as is mentioned in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section shall be made by the Minister unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament

(8) Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the scheme under this section need not deal with all or any of the railways the operation of which forms part of the passenger transport services provided at the passing of this Act by the London Transport Executive.

(a) the application shall not be refused; and

(b) the condition specified in section fifty-two of the Transport Act, 1947 (namely that, except under or in accordance with a permit granted by the Commission, goods shall not be carried for hire or reward in any authorised vehicle if at any time while the goods are being so carried the vehicle is more than twenty-five miles from its operating centre), shall not apply to the licence; and

(c) the licence shall be granted for so much of the five year period

—cont. with respect to any motor vehicle included in a transport unit, that

vehicle is destroyed or damaged beyond repair, another vehicle of the same or less weight unladen may be included in the application instead of the destroyed or damaged vehicle and if, while any such application is pending with respect to such a motor vehicle, the motor vehicle is destroyed or damaged beyond repair, the application shall, if the applicant so requires, be treated as if it had been made with respect to another vehicle of the same or less weight unladen instead of the destroyed or damaged vehicle; and paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule shall apply in each case to that other vehicle as it would have applied to the destroyed or damaged vehicle.

4. Notwithstanding anything in this Part of this Schedule, where the permanent base or centre specified in an application for a special A licence as that from which it is intended that the authorised vehicles will normally be used for the purpose of carrying goods for hire or reward is not the permanent base or centre from which the vehicles in question, or, as the case may be, the vehicles corresponding thereto, were last used by the Commission before the publication of the public notice inviting tenders for the purchase of the transport unit, the licensing authority may refuse the application if it appears to him that the vehicles used from the first-mentioned base or centre could not conveniently serve substantially the same areas as those which might conveniently be served by vehicles used from the second-mentioned base or centre.

In relation to such a transfer as is provided for by section four of this Act, the reference in this paragraph to the publication of the public notice inviting tenders shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of the transfer.

5. Notwithstanding the last preceding paragraph, an application for a special A licence shall be deemed, for the purposes of section eleven of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933 (which relates to the procedure on applications for licences), to be an application which the licensing authority is bound to grant.

7. Nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall be taken as preventing the licensing authority from exercising, in relation to special A licences, his power to revoke or suspend a licence or to give directions under subsection (3) of section thirteen of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933.

8. Where the holder of a special A licence—

(a) agrees to assign any of the authorised vehicles to any other person (other than the Commission); and

the proposed assignee shall have the same rights under the preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule, for the purpose of obtaining a new special A licence with respect to the assigned vehicles or vehicles substituted therefor, as he would have if he were the purchaser of a transport unit consisting of the assigned vehicles and the date of delivery were the same date as the date of delivery under the assignment, so, however, that the five year period shall be calculated as from the date of the original delivery of the vehicles or, as the case may be, the vehicles corresponding thereto, as or as part of a transport unit.

An application made under sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph shall not be withdrawn unless the licensing authority, being satisfied that the assignment has not taken place and will not take place, permits it to be withdrawn, and, where permission is given, this paragraph shall not apply to the agreement which was the ground of the application.

9. Any person who, by virtue of regulations made under section twenty-one of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, is deemed temporarily to be the holder of a special A licence shall have the same rights under the preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule, for the purpose of obtaining a new special A licence with respect to the authorised vehicles or vehicles substituted therefor, as he would have if he were the purchaser of a transport unit consisting of the authorised vehicles and the date of delivery were the date on which he ceased to be deemed to be the holder of that licence, so, however, that the five year period shall be calculated from the date of the original delivery of the vehicles or, as the case may be, the vehicles corresponding thereto, as or as part of a transport unit.

For the purposes of this subsection “ income of the corresponding class” means earned or unearned income according as income arising during the same period as the loss to the person sustaining it from profits or gains of the same trade, profession, employment or vocation would have been that person’s earned or unearned income.

(2) If the claim for an adjustment under the said section three hundred and forty-one for any such year of assessment so requires, the adjustment shall be made by reference only to the income of the person sustaining the loss, without extending to the income of that person’s wife or husband.

(3) For the year 1953-54 or any subsequent year of assessment relief may be given under the said section three hundred and forty-one in respect of a person’s loss sustained in the last preceding year in any trade, profession, employment or vocation still carried on by him in the year for which the claim is made, in so far as relief in respect of that loss has not already been given under that section or otherwise; and, where relief is

claimed by virtue of this subsection, it shall be given in priority to any relief under the said section three hundred and forty-one in respect of a loss sustained in the year for which the relief is claimed.

(4) Where the surveyor objects to any claim under the said section three hundred and forty-one for the year 1953-54 or any subsequent year of assessment, it shall be heard and determined by the Commissioners concerned in like manner as in the case of an appeal against an assessment under Schedule D, and the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1952, relating to the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall apply.

(5) The foregoing provisions of this section shall apply in relation to losses sustained in the occupation of woodlands in respect of which a person has elected to be charged to tax under Schedule D as they apply in relation to losses sustained in a trade.

Capital allowances, etc.

(2) An initial allowance under Chapter II (machinery and plant) of the said Part X in respect of expenditure to which this section applies shall be equal to one-fifth of the expenditure, and accordingly, in relation to such an allowance—

(a) subsection (1) of section two hundred and seventy-nine

of the said Act shall have effect with the substitution of the words “ one-fifth ” for the words “ two-fifths ”; and

(b) sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 3 of the Fourteenth

Schedule to the said Act shall have effect with the substitution in paragraph () and in paragraph (i) of the words “four-fifths’* for the words “three-fifths”.

(3) An initial allowance under Chapter III (mines, oil wells, etc.) of the said Part X in respect of expenditure to which this section applies shall be equal to two-fifths of the expenditure, and accordingly in relation to such an allowance section three hundred and six of the said Act shall have effect with the substitution of the words “ two-fifths ” for the words “ one-tenth

(a) by virtue of subsection (6) of section two hundred and

sixty-five, subsection (2) of section two hundred and seventy-nine or subsection (1) of section three hundred and nine of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (under which, for the purposes of initial allowances, expenditure incurred for the purposes of a trade by a person about to carry it on is treated as incurred on the first day on which he does carry it on); or

sixty-five and subsection (2) of section two hundred and seventy-seven of that Act (under which certain expenditure is treated as incurred on the coming to an end of pre-1945 allowances for mills, factories, etc.).

(a) the price becomes payable before the fifteenth day of

April, nineteen hundred and fifty-three, but the ship is delivered in performance of the contract on or after that date; or

(b) the price is payable in instalments, some of which are

payable before that date and some of which are payable on or after that date;

so much of the price as becomes payable before that date but after the fifth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-two, shall for the purposes of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to initial allowances be deemed to have become payable on that date, and this section shall apply to the expenditure accordingly.

(6) This section shall not affect the law relating to the excess profits levy, and accordingly shall be included among the enactments referred to in paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 3 of the Ninth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1952 (under which certain enactments relating to initial allowances are to be treated for certain purposes of the excess profits levy as if they had not been passed).

time of that part of the building or structure, and for the purposes of this subsection any expenditure incurred for the purposes of a trade on repairs to a building or structure shall be deemed, to be capital expenditure if it is not expenditure which would be allowed to be deducted in computing, for the purposes of income tax, the profits or gains of the trade.

(2) Where under section one hundred and one of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which relates to the repairs allowance under Schedule A), a repayment of tax for any year of assessment is made to a person wholly or partly in respect of capital expenditure incurred by him on repairs to any building or structure.

(2) Where there is in any year of assessment a change on which a trade, profession or vocation is treated under the foregoing provisions as permanently discontinued, and a person engaged in carrying on the trade, profession or vocation immediately before the change continues to be so engaged immediately after it, then—

(a) the trade, profession or vocation carried on by him

immediately before and immediately after the change shall, notwithstanding the discontinuance, be treated as the same trade, profession or vocation for the purposes of subsection (3) of section fifteen of this Act and of sections three hundred and forty-two and three hundred and forty-three of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which relate to the carry forward of losses), except as respects the computation of profits or gains and losses;

(b) in respect of a loss sustained by him in the trade, pro-

For - the purposes of paragraph (c) of this subsection, the persons engaged in carrying on the trade, profession or vocation immediately before the change shall be treated as entitled to any such allowances in the shares in which they are then entitled to the profits of the trade, profession or vocation, and “ the non-effective amount*’ means, in relation to any allowances, the amount to which, because of an insufficiency of profits or gains, effect cannot be given in charging the profits or gains of the trade, profession or vocation.

(3) Where there is such a change as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, and a person engaged in carrying on the trade, profession or vocation immediately before the change continues to be so engaged, immediately after it, the persons so engaged immediately before and the persons so engaged immediately after the change may, by notice signed by them and sent to the surveyor at any time within twelve months after the date of the change, elect that the subsection shall not apply to treat the trade, profession or vocation as discontinued or a new trade, profession or vocation as set up and commenced.

(4) Where there is in any year of assessment a change in the persons engaged in carrying on a trade, profession or vocation, and subsection (1) of this section does not apply by reason of a notice under the last foregoing subsection, then—

(a) tax in respect of the trade, profession or vocation for

that year shall be assessed and charged separately on those so engaged before the change and on those so engaged after it, but the amount on which tax is chargeable shall be computed as if there had been no such change in that year and shall be apportioned as may be just, and subsection (1) of section three hundred and twenty-nine of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which relates to procedure on apportionments under Part X of that Act), shall apply to an apportionment under this paragraph as it applies to an apportionment under the said Part X; and

(5) There shall be made such additional assessments, reductions of assessments or repayments of tax as may in any case be required in order to give effect to this section.

i(9) As respects changes occurring in the year 1953-54 or any subsequent year of assessment the foregoing subsections shall have effect in substitution for sections one hundred and forty-five and one hundred and forty-six of the Income Tax Act, 1952, and references to section one hundred and forty-five shall be construed as referring to this section.

20.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a company has a deficit for tax purposes during any accounting period of the company, and receives a subvention payment in respect of that period from an associated company having a surplus for tax purposes in the corresponding period, then in computing for the purposes of income tax die profits or gains or losses of those companies the payment shall be treated as a trading receipt receivable by the one company on the last day of the accounting period during which it has the deficit, and shall be allowed as a deduction to the other company as if it were a trading expense incurred on that day.

(2) Subject to the next following subsection, a payment made by one company to another shall be treated as a subvention payment within the meaning of this section if, but only if, it

is made under an agreement providing for the paying company Part m to bear or share in losses or a particular loss of the payee com- —cont. pany, and is not a payment which (apart from this section) would be taken into account in computing profits or gains or losses of either company or on which (apart from this section and from any relief from tax) the payee company would be liable to bear tax by deduction or otherwise:

Provided that a payment in respect of any accounting period of the payee company shall not be treated as a subvention payment unless made in or before the year of assessment following that in which the period ends.

(3) If a company receives subvention payments from one or more associated companies in respect of the same accounting period to an aggregate amount exceeding its deficit for tax purposes during that period, or if a company makes subvention payments to one or more associated companies to an aggregate amount exceeding its surplus for tax purposes in the period which is the corresponding period in relation to those payments, the excess shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section; and, where payments to or from more than one company are in question, the payments shall be treated as abating in such manner as may be agreed between all the companies concerned or, in default of agreement, determined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue:

Provided that where the period which is the corresponding period in relation to any subvention payment made by a company includes the whole or part of the ,period which is the corresponding period in relation to another subvention payment made by it, this subsection shall apply to those payments as if the whole period comprised in the said periods were the corresponding period in relation to those payments.

(4) Where a subvention payment is made to a company in respect of more than one accounting period of the company, or is made to or by a company canying on more than one trade, the payment shall be apportioned in such manner as appears to the Commissioners concerned to be just in order to determine the part to be attributed for the purposes of this section to any period or trade.

(5) For the purposes of this section the question, as respects any period, whether a company has a deficit or surplus for tax purposes, or what is the amount of that deficit or surplus, shall be determined by deducting from—

(a) the aggregate amount—

(i) of any profits or gains arising in that period from a trade carried on by it wholly or partly in the United Kingdom (computed in accordance with the provisions, other than this section, applicable to Case I of Schedule D); and

308

1 &2EUZ. 2

Part in —cont.

(ii) of any income for the year of assessment in which that period ends (computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts) other than profits or gains arising from any such trade;

(b) the aggregate amount—

(i) of any loss sustained by it in the period in any such trade (computed in the same manner as profits or gains under the provisions, other than this section, applicable to Case I of Schedule D); and

(ii) of any allowances in respect of any such trade under Part X or XI of the Income Tax Act, 1952. for the said year of assessment, other than those given by way of deduction in computing profits or gains or losses; and

(iii) of any payments made by it in the said year of assessment to which section one hundred and sixty-nine or one hundred and seventy of the said Act applies, other than payments to which the said section one hundred and seventy applies by virtue of section three hundred and eighteen of the said Act or which are deductible in computing the profits or gains or losses of a trade carried on by it:

Provided that, where the period is longer or shorter than a year, the amounts referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (a) and sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph of this subsection shall be proportionately increased or reduced.

(6) In relation to a subvention payment made to a company in respect of any of its accounting periods, the corresponding period of the paying company shall be—

(a) if any of its accounting periods coincides with that

accounting period of the payee company, that period; and

(b) in any other case, such period as the Commissioners of

Inland Revenue may determine, being a period of the same length as that accounting period of the payee company.

(7) Where a company makes a subvention payment to another, and the whole or part of its profits or gains arising in the period in which the expense is treated as incurred under subsection (1) of this section are, in computing tax, either—

(a) treated as profits or gains of each of two or more years

of assessment; or

(b) not treated as profits or gains of any year of

assessment;

then such adjustment (if any) shall be made, in a case to which paragraph (a) of this subsection applies, of the assessment for any year mentioned in that paragraph other than the first or, in a case to which paragraph ib) applies, of the assessment for the

1953

Finance Act, 1953

Ch. 34

year next following the end of the said period, as may be necessary to secure that (so far as may be) the aggregate amount of the assessments made on the company is reduced by an amount neither more nor less than die subvention payment.

(8) There shall be made such additional assessments, reductions of assessments or repayments of tax as may in any case be required in order to give effect to this section; and where the operation of this section in relation to any subvention payment affects a loss in respect of which a company has received a repayment of tax under section three hundred and forty-one of the Income Tax Act, 1952, so much of the repayment as would not have been made if account had been taken of the operation of this section in relation to the subvention payment may, if not otherwise made good, be assessed under Case VI of Schedule D and recovered from the company accordingly.

(9) For the purposes of this section, “ company ” includes any body corporate, but references to a company shall be taken to apply only to a company resident in the United Kingdom and carrying on a trade wholly or partly in the United Kingdom:

Provided that this section shall apply in relation to a company whose business consists mainly in the making of investments and the principal part of whose income is derived therefrom, as if that business were the carrying on of a trade, and in the case of such a company, any payment which is directed by this section to be treated as a trading receipt or a trading expense shall be treated as a payment chargeable under Case VI of Schedule D or as an expense of management, as the case may be.

(10) For the purposes of this section, a company making a subvention payment to another shall be treated as the other’s associated company if, but only if, at all times between the beginning of the payee company’s accounting period in respect of which the payment is made and the making of the payment one of them is the subsidiary of the other, or both are subsidiaries of a third company, and for this purpose “subsidiary” has the meaning assigned to it for certain purposes of the profits tax by section forty-two of the Finance Act, 1938.

(11) Sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of this section shall not be taken to apply to any part of the allowances for a year of assessment earlier than the year referred to in the sub-paragraph, notwithstanding that it is carried forward to the year so referred, to under subsection (2) of section three hundred and twenty-three or subsection (1) of section three hundred and twenty-four of the Income Tax Act, 1952.

(12) In relation to subvention payments falling to be included in computing the profits or gains or losses of the payee company for the year 1953-54 or any subsequent year of assessment this section shall apply, in the case of the paying company, to a

overseas income to the United Kingdom, either by the laws of that territory or any executive action of its Government or by the impossibility of obtaining foreign currency in that territory; and

(b) he has not realised the overseas income outside that

territory for a consideration in sterling or a consideration in some other currency which he is not prevented from transferring to the United Kingdom.

Overseas income to which this section applies is hereafter in this section referred to as unremittable.

(2) Where a person chargeable as aforesaid gives written notice of his desire to be assessed in accordance with this subsection, then, in the first instance, account shall not be taken of the overseas income to the extent to which he shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue that the following conditions are satisfied with respect to it, that is to say—

(a) that it is unremittable; and

(b) that paragraph (a) of the foregoing subsection would continue to apply notwithstanding any reasonable endeavours on his part,

and tax shall be assessed and charged on all persons concerned and for all periods accordingly; but, on the Commissioners of Inland Revenue ceasing, as respects any part of the income, to be satisfied that the said conditions are satisfied, such additional assessments, reductions of assessments and repayments of tax shall be made as may be necessary to take account of it, and of any tax payable in respect of it under the law of the territory where it arises, according to their value at the date when, in the opinion of those Commissioners, the said conditions cease to be satisfied with respect to it, and may be so made at any time not later than six years after that date.

(3) Any notice under the last foregoing subsection shall relate to all tax (whether income .tax, profits tax or excess profits levy) with which the person giving the notice is or may become chargeable by reference to the overseas income to which die notice

(4) In the case of the death of a person who, if he had not died, would, under subsection (2) of this section, have become chargeable to any income tax, the tax which would have been so chargeable shall be assessed and charged upon his executors or administrators, and shall be a debt due from and payable out of his estate.

(5) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the amount of any unremittable overseas income shall be determined by reference to the generally recognised market value in the United Kingdom (if any) or, in the absence of any such value, according to the official rate of exchange of the territory where the income arises.

(6) Any appeal against an assessment which involves a question as to the operation of this section shall be made to the Special Commissioners, and not to the General Commissioners.

(7) In relation to any profits tax or excess profits levy chargeable by reference to the profits of a body corporate, that body corporate shall be deemed to be the person chargeable for the purposes of this section, notwithstanding that the tax is chargeable on another body corporate under the provisions relating to subsidiary companies.

(8) This section shall, in the case of any person, apply to overseas income by reference to which he is chargeable to income tax for any year of assessment not earlier than the year 1952-53 (but not so as to affect tax chargeable by reference thereto for any earlier year) and, for the purposes of the profits tax and excess profits levy, also to profits arising in any chargeable accounting period in or before which any such income arises; and, where the time mentioned in subsection (3) of this section for delivering a notice under subsection (2) in relation to any overseas income has come to an end or comes to an end within three months of the commencement of this Act, the notice may be delivered at any time within those three months and, if the person entitled to give die notice has died, may be given by his executors or administrators.

(2) A claim under the said section four hundred and seventy-one with respect to any payment to which it applies by virtue only of this section shall have effect as a claim with respect to all such payments in respect of the copyright in the same work which are receivable by the claimant, whether before or after the claim; and, notwithstanding anything in subsection (4) of that section, such a claim may be made at any time not later than the fifth day of April next following the expiration of three years after the work’s first publication.

(3) Any reference in this section to a work’s first publication is a reference to the first occasion on which the work or a reproduction of it is published, performed or exhibited.

(4) This section shall apply to payments falling to be included in computing profits or gains for the year 1953-54 or any subsequent year of assessment, and in relation to such payments shall authorise the making of additional assessments for years of assessment earlier than the year 1953-54.

23.—(1) Where the whole or a substantial part of a production herd kept by a fanner for the purposes of his farming is slaughtered by the order of any Ministry, Government department or local or public authority under the law relating to diseases of animals in such circumstances that compensation is payable in respect of it, then subject to the provisions of this section an election for the herd basis thereupon made by the fanner in relation to that herd and any other production hods of the same class so kept by him shall be valid, notwithstanding that it is not made within the time required by sub-paragraph

(3) of paragraph 2 of the Twentieth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1952.

(2) Subject to subsection (6) of this section, an election for the herd basis made by virtue of this section shall only be valid if made not later than twelve months after the end of the first year of assessment for which the tax chargeable on the farmer in respect of the profits or gains of his farming finally falls to be computed by reference to the facts of a period in which the compensation is relevant:

Provided that where that year is the second year of assessment within the meaning of section one hundred and twenty-nine of

(3) An election for the herd basis made by virtue of this section shall, notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 2 of the said Twentieth Schedule, have effect for the purposes of income tax only for the year of assessment mentioned in the last foregoing subsection and subsequent years of assessment, and for the purposes of the profits tax and excess profits levy only for chargeable accounting periods not falling wholly before the period by reference to the facts of which the profits or gains are computed for the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment so mentioned:

(b) that the relief falling to be given as aforesaid in respect

of the income in question is less than it would be if the capital allowances to which the claim relates operated to reduce the income to the same extent only as the deductions or allowances so provided for.

(3) Where a person claims a postponement under this section of capital allowances for any year of assessment, then for the purpose of making the assessment for that year die amount of those allowances shall be reduced by such amount as may be necessary to secure that they operate to reduce the income only to the extent mentioned in paragraph (b) of the last foregoing subsection (or such less amount as the claimant may require), and for the purpose of making the assessment for the

to 82 of 11 & Act, 1948 (which relate to the gross value for rating purposes of

12£e°- 6. dwelling-houses as therein defined) are hereby repealed,

c. /o.

New 2.—(1) For the purpose of making or altering the first valuation

provisions for lists made after the passing of tins Act, the gross value for rating purposes of a hereditament which is either a dwellingdwelling- house or a private garage or private storage premises (as herein-houses, private after defined respectively) shall not be ascertained by reference to garages and the definition of gross value in section sixty-eight of the Rating private storage an(j Valuation Act, 1925 (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the premises. Act of 1925 ”) or in section four of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869 (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the Act of 1869 ”), but shall be an amount equal to the rent specified in the next following subsection:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply in a case where that rent exceeds the amount which would be the gross value of the hereditament if ascertained by reference to the said definition. 2

(2) The said rent is that at which the hereditament in question might reasonably have been expected on or about the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, to let from year

1953

Valuation for Rating Act, 1953

Ch. 42

475

to year if the tenant had undertaken to pay all usual tenant’s rates and taxes and if the landlord had undertaken to bear the cost of the repairs and insurance, and the other expenses, if any, necessary to maintain the hereditament in a state to command that rent.

(3) For the purposes of the last preceding subsection it shall be assumed—

(a) that the hereditament was subsisting on and about the said thirtieth day of June in the state in which it actually subsists at the time of valuation; and (b) that the locality in which the hereditament is situated was on and about the said day in the same state, as respects the other premises situated in that locality and (subject to the next following subsection) as respects the occupation and use of those premises, as respects the transport services and other facilities available to persons living or working in the locality, and as respects other matters affecting the amenities of the locality, as it is at the time of valuation.

(4) In the application of paragraph (b) of the last preceding subsection as respects the occupation and use of other premises in the locality which are used for residential purposes, and were so used on or about the said thirtieth day of June, any increase since the said day in the number of persons so using the premises shall be disregarded except in so far as it affects the amenities of the locality or of the hereditament whose gross value is being ascertained.

(5) Where in ascertaining the gross value of a dwelling-house it becomes apparent that, by reason of either or both of the following circumstances, namely—

(a) the effect of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1920 to 1938, in relation to any other dwelling accommodation, and

(b) the existence in the locality on and about the said thirtieth day of June of a marked scarcity or abundance of dwelling accommodation, or of any particular kind of dwelling accommodation,

the rent referred to in subsection (2) of this section would apart from this subsection be unduly high or unduly low in relation to the rents which prevailed on and about that day for other kinds of dwelling accommodation in the locality, or which then prevailed in neighbouring localities, then (without prejudice to the assumptions aforesaid) the said rent shall be determined as if on and about that day all the accommodation in the locality of a kind comparable with the dwelling-house had been due shortly to become available for letting free from any restrictions (whether on rent or on the recovery of possession) imposed by the said Acts of

Definitions of “ dwelling-house ”,

“ private garage ” and “ private storage premises *\

” (aa) as to the standard of quality of any goods, according to a classification commonly used or recognised in the trade, or

(ab) as to the fitness for purpose, strength, performance or behaviour of any goods, or ”.

(2) In the said section three (which also defines “ false trade description” to mean a trade description which is false in a material respect as regards the goods to which it is applied, and to include every alteration of a trade description making the description false in a material respect) that definition shall be amended by inserting after the word “false ” in the second and third places where it occurs the words “ or misleading ”.

(3) Without prejudice to the generality of those definitions as so amended, a trade description (to whichever of the matters mentioned in the definition of” trade description ” as so amended it relates) shall be deemed for the purposes of the said Act to be a false trade description if it is calculated to be misunderstood as, or mistaken for, an indication as to the same or some other such matter which would be false or misleading in a material respect as regards the goods to which the description is applied, and anything calculated to be misunderstood as, or mistaken for, an indication of any of those matters shall be deemed for those purposes to be a trade description.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in the said definition of ” false trade description”, no trade mark within the meaning of the Trade Marks Act, 1938, or part of such a trade mark, shall by

646

Ch. 48

Merchandise Marks Act, 1953 1 & 2 Eliz. 2

virtue of the foregoing subsections be treated as a false trade description in relation to any goods to which the trade mark is applied, if the following conditions are satisfied, that is to say:—

(b) the trade mark as applied is used to indicate a connection

in the course of trade between the goods and the person who is the proprietor of the trade mark or between the goods and a person who is registered under section twenty-eight of the Trade Marks Act, 1938, as a registered user of the trade mark; and

(c) the person who is the proprietor of the trade mark is the

same person as, or a successor in title of, the proprietor on the day this Act is passed.

(b) to any description applied in pursuance of the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1926, to any article included in the first column of the First Schedule to that Act.

(a) by a competent authority acting in good faith and purporting to act under the Trading with the Enemy Act, 1939 (hereinafter referred to as “ the Act of 1939 ”) or orders made thereunder, or by such an authority acting in good faith and with intent to give effect, so far as practicable, to the purposes of section seven of that Act (which relates to the collection of enemy debts and custody of enemy property) or to prevent that Act from being contravened, or

1953 Enemy Property Act, 1953 Ch. 52

(b) by any person acting in good faith and in purported compliance with a restriction or obligation imposed by or under the Act of 1939, or

(c) by any person acting in good faith and in pursuance of

a direction or request given or made by a competent authority purporting to act under the Act of 1939 or orders made thereunder, or given or made by a competent authority acting with such an intent as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

(2) For the purposes of those sections anything done by a competent authority, or by any person in purported compliance with a restriction or obligation imposed by or under the Act of 1939 or in pursuance of a direction or request of a competent authority, shall be deemed to have been done in good faith unless the contrary is proved.

2.—(1) Where at a time within the period mentioned in the foregoing section—

(a) a payment was made by or on behalf of any person to a

competent authority, or

(b) a payment was withheld (whether by way of refusal or

(c) a payment was made by a competent authority to or for

the benefit of a person as being the person who, but for the Act of 1939 or any order made thereunder, would have been entitled thereto,

(2) Where, in the case of a payment made as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (c) of the last foregoing subsection, the payment (apart from that subsection) was not authorised by or under the Act of 1939—

(b) if the payment was a payment by a competent authority as mentioned in the said paragraph (c), nothing in that subsection shall prevent that authority from exercising any right of recovery in respect of the payment, being a right exercisable apart from this section.

3,—(1) Where at a time within the period mentioned in section one of this Act any property was dealt with in any way other than the making or withholding of a payment as mentioned in the last foregoing section, and, whether by reason that the property was not enemy property at that time or for any other reason, the person who so dealt with the property was not empowered, as against all persons interested in the property, to deal with it in that way, then, if the property was so dealt with in the circumstances specified in paragraph (a), ( ) or (c) of subsection (1) of section one of this Act, the person who so dealt with it shall be deemed, as against all persons interested therein, to have been empowered by the Act of 1939 to deal with it in that way:

Provided that in a case falling within either of the two next following subsections the property shall not be deemed to have vested in the transferee otherwise than as mentioned in those subsections.

(2) If the dealing in question purported to be a transfer of the property on a sale thereof, the property shall be deemed to have vested in the transferee in accordance with the terms of the purported transfer, subject however to any incumbrances to which it would have been subject in his hands if it had then been lawfully transferred to him in those terms on a sale by the person entitled to the property.

(3) If the dealing purported to be a transfer of the property by a custodian to or for the benefit of a person as being the person who, but for the Act of 1939 or any order made thereunder, would have been entitled thereto, subsection (1) of this section shall have effect subject to the provisions of subsection

(5) thereof; but subject to the said subsection (5) the property shall be deemed to have vested in the transferee as mentioned in the last foregoing subsection.

(4) If at the time of the dealing the property was not enemy property—

thereof from a competent authority who for the time Part I being has the property or proceeds in his possession or —com. under his control, and .

(b) nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall defeat any right of recovering the property or any proceeds thereof from an administrator of enemy property, being a right exercisable in accordance with any of the post-war enactments relating to enemy property.

(5) Where the dealing was one falling within subsection (3) of this section, nothing in that subsection or in subsection (1) of this section shall affect any right of recovery from the transferee of property remaining vested in him, or of recovery from the transferee or his personal representatives of damages in respect of any dealing with the property, being a right which would be exercisable apart from this section; and if immediately before the dealing there subsisted in respect of the property a trust of which the person to or for whose benefit the transfer purported to be made was a trustee, nothing in the said subsection (1) or subsection (3) shall be construed as affecting that trust or any right or interest thereunder.

(6) If at the time of the dealing the property was enemy property, and in consequence of the dealing the property or any proceeds thereof came into the possession or under the control of a custodian, then for the purposes of the post-war enactments relating to enemy property the property or proceeds shall be deemed thereupon to have become vested in the custodian by virtue of section seven of the Act of 1939, and to have continued to be so vested while remaining in his possession or under his control.

(2) The last foregoing subsection shall be deemed to have had effect as from the coming into operation of the Trading with the Enemy (Custodian) Order, 1939, so however that it shall not be construed as authorising or requiring the repayment of any sums paid by a custodian before the passing of this Act otherwise than into the Exchequer.

(b) thereof, as the case may be, to the date of payment of the capital sum:

the passing of this Act, the right to interest thereon under this subsection shall not arise unless a claim for it in writing is made to the custodian within one year from the date of the passing of this Act and there is produced to the custodian such evidence in support of the claim as the custodian may reasonably require; and

(ii) where in such a case the person to whom the capital

sum was paid has since died, or any other event has occurred whereby the right to the interest, if vested in him immediately before that event, would thereupon have vested in some other person, the right to claim the interest shall be treated as having devolved as if that right had been vested in him immediately before his death or immediately before that event, as the case may be, and, if the right is duly exercised, die interest shall be paid to the persons claiming under him accordingly.

(4) For the purpose of making payments of interest under the last foregoing subsection a custodian who at the passing of this Act has in his hands, or thereafter receives, any income such as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section shall set aside out of that income such sums as the Treasury may from time to time direct; and out of any sums so set aside the custodian shall pay any interest becoming payable by him under the last foregoing subsection and shall pay the balance thereof (if any) into the Exchequer.

(5) In this section the expression “ money due to an enemy ” means money which would, but for the existence of a state of war, have been payable to or for the benefit of a person who was an enemy within the meaning of the Act of 1939.

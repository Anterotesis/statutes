(c) When a certificate has been lodged as aforesaid the Clerk

of Teinds shall issue a certificate of the amount of the valued

teind and such certificate shall be recorded in the Teind Office,

7. —(o) Any heritor or titular whose teinds have been valued

either in accordance with the present practice or in accordance

with the provisions of this Schedule, and whether there is or is

not a depending process of locality may, so soon as the decree

of valuation has been extracted or the certificate of the amount

of the valued teinds has been recorded, as the case may be, and

yet allocated for stipend. The Clerk of Teinds on receiving

intimation of the claim shall notify the same to the common

agent of the heritors, and if any heritor within thirty days after

the date of such notification lodges with the Clerk of Teinds a

written objection to the claim the matter shall be finally disposed

of by the Lord Ordinary. But if no such objection be lodged, the

re-allocation shall be made by the Clerk of Teinds, who shall

issue to the minister or to the General Trustees, as the case may

be, a certificate specifying the amounts of stipend payable by

the heritors whose teinds are affected by the re-allocation.

9. Any calculation as to the amount of any deficiency of

stipend caused by a surrender in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule or as to the amounts of unexhausted teinds available

to meet such deficiency shall be made—•

(a) so far as the stipend is concerned, on the basis of the

standard value thereof; and

(b) so far as the value of the teind is concerned, in

accordance with paragraph 3 of the Fifth Schedule

to this Act.

10. A heritor may have his unvalued teinds valued or

surrender valued teinds in accordance with the provisions of this

Schedule, whether he has or has not a heritable right to such

teinds:

surrender any teinds to which he has no heritable

right, he shall at the time when he gives notice of the

appointment of a valuer or lodges a minute of surrender

or a surrender as aforesaid intimate the appointment

or the surrender in writing to the titular of the teinds

who shall have the same rights of objection and

appeal as are by the provisions of this Schedule

Trustees notice of the appointment of a valuer with

respect to lands to the teinds of which he has no

heritable right, he shall forthwith intimate the

appointment in writing to the titular of the teinds,

who shall in such case have the same rights of objection

and appeal as are by the provisions of this Schedule

lump sum and children’s allowance (which shall be added

together and dealt with as a single sura) shall not in any

case exceed in the aggregate six hundred pcfunds.

(2) The lump sum shall be calculated in accordance

with the following rules:—

(i) If the workman leaves any dependants wholly

dependent on his earnings, the lump sum shall

be a sum equal to his earnings in the employment of the same employer during the three

years next preceding the injury, or the sum of

two hundred pounds, whichever of those sums

is the larger, but not exceeding in any case

three hundred pounds;

(ii) If the period of the workman’s employment

by the said employer has been less than the

said three years, the amount of his earnings

1925. Workmen's Compensation Ch. 84. 1629

Act, 1925.

during the said three years shall, for the purposes of the foregoing rule, be deemed to be one

hundred and fifty-six times his average weekly

earnings during the period of his actual

employment under the said employer;

(iii) There shall be deducted from the sum as above

calculated the amount of weekly payments (if

any) made to the workman before his death

so, however, as not to reduce the lump sum

below two hundred pounds; and if such

weekly payments have been redeemed imder

this Act, there shall also be deducted the

amoimt paid in respect of the redemption

thereof;

(iv) If the workman does not leave any dependants

wholly dependent on his earnings, but leaves

any dependants in part so dependent, the

lump sum shall be such sum not exceeding in

any case the amount payable under the foregoing rules as may be agreed upon or, in

default of agreement, may be determined by

arbitration under this Act to be reasonable and

proportionate to the injury to the said

dependants;

(v) If the workman leaves no dependants, the

lump sum shall be an amount equal to the

reasonable expenses of his medical attendance

and burial, not exceeding fifteen pounds.

(3) The amount of the children’s allowance shall be

calculated in accordance with the following rules :—

(i) If both the widow or other member of the

workman’s family and such child or children as

aforesaid were aU wholly dependent on the

workman’s earnings, the children’s allowance

shall in respect of each such child be a sum

equal to fifteen per cent, of the amount arrived

at by multiplying the average weekly earnings

of the workman, or where such earnings are

less than one poimd, then by multiplying one

pound, or where such earnings exceed two

pounds then by multiplying two pounds, by the

number of weeks in the period between the

death of the workman and the date when the

1630 Ch. 84. Worhnen'a Compensation 15 & 16 Gbo. 6.

Act, 1925.

child will attain the age of fifteen, fractions of a

week being disregarded;

(ii) If the widow or other member of the workman’s

family and such child or children as aforesaid,

or any of them, were partially dependent on

the workman’s earnings, the children’s allowance

shall be such proportion of the sum which would

have been payable under the foregoing rule if

all such persons had been wholly dependent as

may be agreed upon or in default of agreement

as may, taking into consideration the amount

of the lump sum, be determined by arbitration

under this Act to be reasonable;

(iii) No deduction shall be made from the children’s

allowance in respect of the amount of any

weekly payments which may have been made

• to the workman under this Act in respect of the

same injury, but if such weekly payments

have been redeemed the amount paid in redemption thereof, if and so far as it exceeds

the lump sum payable, shall be deducted from

the amount of the children’s allowance as

ascertained under the foregoing rules.

9.—(1) The compensation under this Act where

total or partial incapacity for work results from the

injury shall be a weekly payment during the incapacity

of an amount calculated in accordance with the rules

hereinafter contained;

Provided that—

(a) if the incapacity lasts less than fo\ir weeks,

no compensation shall be payable in respect

of the ^st three days; and

(b) in fixing the amount of the weekly payment,

regard shall be had to any payment, allowance,

or benefit which the workman may receive

from the employer during the period of his

incapacity; and

(c) the weekly payment shall in no case exceed

thirty shillings.

(2) The rules for calculating the weekly payment

in the case of total incapacity shall be—

(i) The weekly payment shall subject to rule (ii)

be a sum not exceeding fifty per cent, of the

Amount in

cases of

workman’s average weekly earnings during the

previous twelve months, if he has been so

long employed by the same employer, but

if not, then for any less period during which

he has been in the employment of the same

employer:

(ii) Where the maximum weekly payment calculated

according to rule (i) is less than twenty-five

s hillin gs, the workman shall be entitled during

such total incapacity to a weekly addition

equal to one-half of the difference between

such maximum weekly payment and the sum

of twenty-five s hillin gs or his average weekly

earnings, whichever is the less, and such

addition shall, for aU the purposes of this Act,

be treated as if it were part of the weekly

payment.

. (3) The rules for calculating the weekly payment

in the case of partial incapacity shall be—

(i) If the maximum weekly payment would, had

the incapacity been total incapacity, have

amounted to twenty-five shillings a week or

upwards, the weekly pajrment in case of partial

incapacity shall be one-half the difference between the amount of the average weekly

earnings of the workman before the accident

and the average weekly amount which he is

earning or is able to earn in some suitable

employment or business after the accident:

(ii) If the maximum weekly payment would, had

the incapacity been total incapacity, have

amounted with such addition, if any, as is

provided by rule (ii) in the case of total

incapacity, to less than twenty-five shillings,

the weekly payment in case of partial incapacity shall be a sum bearing the same proportion

to the said difference as the said maximum

weekly payment with such addition as aforesaid

bears to the amount of the average weekly

earnings of the workman before the accident.

(4) If a workman who has so far recovered from

the injury as to be fit for employment of a certain kind

proves to the satisfaction of the judge of the county

court that he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain,

1632

Act, 1925.

and has failed to obtain, such employment, and that his

failure to obtain such employment is a consequence,

wholly or mainly, of the injury, the judge shall order

that his incapacity shah, for the purposes of this Act,

continue to be treated as total incapacity for such

period, and subject to such conditions, as may be

provided by the order, without prejudice however to the right of review conferred by tlua Act;

Provided that every such order shall be made

subject to the condition that it shall cease to be in

force if the workman receives unemployment benefit.

10. For the purposes of the provisions of this Act

relating to “ earnings ” and “ average weekly earnings ”

of a workman, the following rules shall be observed :—

(i) Average weekly earnings shall be computed in

such manner as is best calculated to give the

rate per week at which the workman was being

remunerated: Provided that where by reason

of the shortness of the time during which the

workman has been in the employment of his

employer or the casual nature of the employment, or the terms of the employment, it is

impracticable at the date of the accident to

compute the rate of remuneration, regard may

be had to the average weekly amount which,

during the twelve months previous to the

accident, was being earned by a person in the

same grade employed at the same work by the

same employer, or, if there is no person so

employed, by a person in the same grade

employed in the same class of employment and

in the same district;

(ii) Where the workman had entered into concurrent

contracts of service with two or more employers

under which he worked at one time for one such

employer and at another time for another such

employer, his average weekly earnings shall be

computed as if his earnings imder all such

coqtracts were earnings in the employment of the employer for whom he was working at the

time of the accident;

(iii) Employment by the same employer shall be

taken to mean emploj^ment by the same employer

1925.

Act, 1925.

Ch. 84.

1633

in the grade in which the workman was employed

at the time of the accident, uninterrupted by

absence from work due to illness or any other

unavoidable cause;

(iv) Where the employer has been accustomed to

pay to the workman a sum to cover any special

expenses entailed on him by themature of his

employment, the sum so paid ^all not be

reckoned as part of the earnings;

(v) Upon request of the workman to the employer

liable to pay compensation, that employer shall

furnish in writing a list of the earnings of that

workman upon which the amount of the average

weekly earnings may be calculated for the

purpose of determi ni ng the amount of any

weekly payment under this Act.

11.—(1) Any weekly payment may be reviewed at Reviews of the request either of the employer or of the workman, weekly

and on such review may be ended, diminished, or increased, payments,

subject to the maximum hereinbefore in section nine

provided, and the amount of payment shall, in default of

agreement, be settled by arbitration under this Act.

(2) Where the workman was at the date of the

accident under twenty-one years of age and the review

takes place more than six months after the accident

and before the workman attains the age of twenty-

one years, the amount of the weekly payment may be

increased to such an amoimt as would have been

awarded if the workman had at the time of accident

been earning the weekly sum which he would probably

have been earning at the date of the review if he had

remained uninjured.

(3) Where the review takes place more than six

months after the accident, and it is claimed and proved

that, had the workman remained iminjured and continued

in the same class of employment as that in which he was

employed at the date of the accident, his average

weekly earnings during the twelve months immediately

preceding the review would, as a result of fluctuations in

rates of remuneration, have been greater or less by more

than twenty per cent, than his average weekly earnings

during the twelve months previous to the accident (or if

review during the twelve months previous to that review

or the last of such reviews), the weekly payment shall

be varied so as to make it such as it would have been

if the rates of remuneration obtaining during the

twelve months previous to the review had obtained

during the twelve months previous to the accident.

For the purposes of this subsection “ review ”

includes a review under the provision of any Act

repealed by this Act corresponding to this section.

12. An employer shall not be entitled otherwise

than in pursuance of an agreement or arbitration to

end or dimmish a weekly payment except in the following

cases:—

(1) where a workman in receipt of a weekly payment

in respect of total incapacity has actually

returned to work;

(2) where the weekly earnings of a workman m

receipt of a weekly payment in respect of

partial incapacity have actually been increased;

(3) where the medical practitioner who has examined

the workman under section eighteen of this Act has certified that the workman has whoUy

or partially recovered, or that the incapacity

is no longer due in whole or in part to the accident,

and a copy of the certificate (which shall set

practitioner) together with notice of the intention

of the employer at the expiration of ten clear

days from the date of the service of the notice

to end the weekly payment, or to diminish it

by such amount as is stated in the notice, has

been served by the employer upon the workman:

Provided that—

(i) in the last-mentioned case, if before the expiration of the said ten clear days the workman

sends to the employer the report of a duly qualified medical practitioner (which report shall

set out the grounds of his opinion) disagreeing

vdth the certificate so served by the employer,

the weekly payment shall not be ended or

diminished, except in accordance with such

report, or if and so far as the employer

disputes such report, except in accordance

with the certificate given by the medical

referee in pursuance of section nineteen of this Act; and

(ii) where an application has been made in pursuance of the said section nineteen to refer

the dispute to a medical referee, it shall be

lawful for the employer, pending the settlement of the dispute, to pay into court—

(a) where the notice was a notice to end

the weekly payment, the whole of each

weekly payment becoming payable in the

meantime;

(b) where the notice was a notice to

the settlement of the dispute, be paid to the

employer or to the workman according to the

effect of the certificate of the medical referee,

or, if the effect of that certificate is disputed,

as in default of agreement may be determined

by the registrar or, on appeal, the judge;

(iii) nothing in this section shall be construed as

authorising an employer to end or diminish

a weekly payment in any case in which,

or to an extent to which, apart from this

section, he would not be entitled to do so.

13. Where any weekly payment has been con- Redemption

tinned for not less than six months, the habihty therefor of weekly

may, on application by or on behalf of the employer, payioents.

(b) ther provisions of this section which fix the

amount of the lump sum for which a weekly

or appellate tribunal assesses the compensation, it shall

give a certificate of the compensation it has awarded and

the directions it has given as to the deduction of costs, and

such certificate shall have the force and effect of an award

under this Act:

Provided that an appellate tribunal may, instead

of itself assessing such compensation, remit the case

to the comity court for the assessment of the compensation, and in such case may order the county

Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

as follows:—

1. The following provisions shall be substituted for

section twenty-seven of the Land Settlement (Facilities)

Act, 1919 (which provides for the recoupment of certain

losses incurred by county councils in connection with

the acquisition of land under the Small Holdings and

Allotments Act, 1908):—

“ (1) For the purpose of this section there shall

be ascertained—

“ (a) the amount of the charges which will

fall to be met in the half-year beginning on

the appointed day and every subsequent

half-year by any council in respect of expenditure properly incurred by them before the

appointed day in respect of the acquisition,

adaptation or improvement of, or otherwise

in relation to, their small holdings estate

(in this section referred to as “ small holdings

charges”); and

“ (6) the net income which will accrue in

the year beginning on the appointed day

and in every subsequent year to the council

from the council’s small holdings estate.

“(2) The amount of a •small holdings charge

falhng to be met in any half-year shall, for the

purpose of thi^ section, be taken to be—

“ (a) in the case of a tithe redemption

annuity or any perpetual or terminable

rentcharge created on the acquisition of land,

one-half of the amount payable in the year in

respect thereof;

“ (b) in the case of an annuity issued under

section nine of this Act, one-half of the

amount of the annuity, together with one-

half of the amount which the council is

directed to set apart in the year to form a

sinking fund for the discharge of the armuity;

“ (c) in the case of a mortgage repayable

by payments of principal and interest combined, or by equal yearly or hah-yearly

instalments of principal together with

1925. Land Settlement Ch. 85.

[Facilities) Amendment Act, 1925.

interest on the balance of the principal snin

for the time being outstanding, one-half of the aggregate of the amounts so payable in

the year ;

“ (d) in the case of any other mortgage or

charge, such amount as is agreed between the

]\Iinister and the council concerned to be

payable in that half-year as interest thereon,

together with one-half of the amount which

the council is required to set apart in the

year to form a sinking fund for the discharge

of the principal sum.

“ (3) For the purpose of ascertaining the net

annual income of the council’s small holdings

estate for any year, the net annual income of

land forming part of that estate shall be taken

to be—

“ (a) in the case of land other than leasehold

land, the amount representing the estimated

average yearly rent obtainable by the council

for the land after deducting therefrom the

estimated cost of repairs, insurance, expenses

of management and other outgoings reasonably necessary to secure that rent, but

without deducting any small holdings charges

or income tax;

“ (6) in the case of leasehold land, the

difiference between the estimated average

yearly rent obtainable by the council for the

land and the estimated annual expenditure

of the council on account of rent and other

necessary outgoings in connection with the

land, including any amounts required to meet

the estimated net liability of the council to the landlord or to the tenants of the council

on the expiration of the current tenancy:

“ Provided that—

“ (i) if the amount of the estimated

average yearly rent is less than the

amount of the estimated annual expenditure, the deficiency shall be brought into

account; and

1675

1676

Ch. 85.

Land Settlement 15 & 16 Geo. 5.

{Facilities) Amendment Act, 1925.

“ (ii) no rent shall be deemed to be

obtainable by the council in respect of the land after the expiration of the

current tenancy of the council.

“ (4) Where before the appointed day a council

has properly incurred any expenditure in respect

of the acquisition, adaptation or improvement of,

or otherwise in relation to, their small holdings

estate, but has not obtained a loan under the

principal Act in respect of that expenditure, or

where a council after the appointed day has

incurred any such expenditure in respect of which

the approval of the Minister was given before the

appointed day, there shall be ascertained, on the

basis of the foregoing provisions of this section,

the amount representing the half-yearly charges

which would have become payable by the council

if the amount of the expenditure had been raised

by loan, and the amount so ascertained shall, for

the purpose of this section, be treated as if it were

a small holdings charge.

“ (5) The Minister shall, on such date as may

be agreed between him and the council, pay to

every council in respect of each half-year a sum

equal to the amount, if any, by which the

aggregate amount of the small holdings charges

payable by the council during that half-year

exceeds one-half of the net annual income of the

council’s small holdings estate for the year ascertained as aforesaid:

“ Provided that, as regards the payments to be

made in respect of the financial year ending on

the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred

and twenty-seven, and in respect of each of the

two next following years, the date to be agreed as

aforesaid shall be a date not earlier than the first

day of the financial year following the year in

respect of which the payment is to be made.

“ Any sum paid to a council under this subsection may be applied by the council in

defraying any expenditure in connection with the

council’s small holdings estate.

“ (6) There shall also be ascertained the

amount of the loss which a council will

1925. Land Settlement Ch. 85. 1077

{Facilities) Amendment Act, 1925.

necessarily or without any unreasonable default

on its part incur in respect of—

“ (a) any advance made or guaranteed

before the appointed day by the council

under section eighteen of this Act; and

“ (b) any arrears of rent due or accruing

to the council on the appointed day from

any person who is or was a tenant of land

acquired by the council under the principal

Act and of any other liabilities of such a

tenant to the council remaining undischarged on the appointed day,

and the aggregate of the amounts so ascertained

shall be paid to the council by the iVIinister in four

equal annual instalments, the first of which shall

be made on the appointed day or as soon thereafter as the loss is ascertained, and the remainder

of which shall be made on each succeeding first

day of April.

“ (7) If any question arises between the Minister

and a council with respect to any matter to

be ascertained under this section, that question

shall be determined by arbitration in accordance

with the provisions of the Second Schedule to the

Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, except that— 13 & 14

“ (a) in default of agreement, the arbitrator

shall be appointed by the Reference Committee for England and Wales, constituted

under section one of the Acquisition of Land 9 & 10

(Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and Geo. 5. c. 57.

may be a person who is not a member of the

panel formed under the said Second Schedule,

and for the purposes of this provision the

Reference Committee shall be deemed to

include the President of the Institute of

Chartered Accountants in England and Wales

as well as the persons mentioned in the said

section one; and

“(b) the Minister and the council shall

each bear their own costs and pay the costs

of the award in equal shares.

context otherwise requires—

appointed day, other than any land acquired

by them when acting in default of a district

to the payment of money into Court.

[22nd December 1925.]

B e it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

as follows:—

Amendment

of Part I. of

13 & 14

Geo. 5. c. 20

as to the

payment of

money into

Court.

1.—(1) Where under Part I. of the Mines (Working

Facilities and Support) Act, 1923 (hereinafter referred

to as the principal Act), the Railway and Canal Commission have determined that a right should be granted

subject to the payment of compensation or consideration, the Commission may in any case where they think

fit—

(a) where the amount of the compensation or consideration has been determined by them, order

the payment into Court of the whole or any

part thereof;

1925. Mines {Working Ch. 91. 1835

Facilities and Support) Act, 1925.

(6) pending the determination of the amount of the

compensation or consideration, order the payment into Court of such sum on account thereof

as the Commission think fit.

(2) Money required to he paid into Court under the

principal Act or this Act shall, subject to rules made

under Part VI. of the Supreme Court of Judicature 15 & 16

(Consohdation) Act, 1925, be paid into the Supreme Geo. 5. c. 49.

Court, and shall be subject to the Acts, rules and orders

relating to funds in the Supreme Court, except that it

may, subject to rules made under the said Part VI.,

be paid out on the order of the Railway and Canal

Commission:

Provided that the Commission shall not make an

order for payment out of money in any case where it

appears to them that the question of title involved is one

which would more properly be dealt with by the Supreme

Court.

(3) In the application of this Act to Scotland the

Court of Session shall be substituted for the Supreme

Court, Act of Sederunt shall be substituted for rules

made under Part VI. of the Supreme Coui't of Judicature

(Consohdation) Act, '1925, and references to payment

into court shall be construed as references to eonsignation.

2. This Act may be cited as the Slines (Working Short title.

Fachities and Support) Act, 1925, and the principal Act

and this Act may be cited together as the Mines

(Working Facilities and Support) Acts, 1923 and 1925.

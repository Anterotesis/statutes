respect of the earlier event.

age, in relation to any event, is the percentage equal to the

policy.

(1) above, and within the same year from the making of the
insurance, another such event happens as is mentioned therein,

The amendments made by this subsection shall not apply in
relation to transactions carried out before 10th December 1974.
( 2 ) For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that in
subsections ( 1 )(a) and (2) (a) of the said section 485 the references
to both the seller and the buyer being bodies of persons and
some other person having control over both of them include
cases where both of them are bodies of persons and are under
the control of the same persons.
( 3) The Board may, by notice in writing given to any body
corporate, require it to give to the Board, within such time ( not
being less than thirty days) as may be specified in the notice,
such particulars ( which may include details of relevant documents) as may be so specified of any related transaction which
appears to the Board-
( a) to be, or to be connected with, a transaction with
respect to which the Board might give a direction
under the said section 485 ; or
(b) to be relevant for determining whether such a direction
could or should be given in any case ; or
( c ) to be relevant for determining for the purposes of
that section what price any property sold would have
fetched had the sale been one between independent
persons dealing at arm's length .
( 4 ) For the purposes of a notice under subsection (3) above
a transaction is a related transaction if , but only if , it is one
to which the body corporate to whom the notice is given, or a
body corporate associated with that body, was a party ; and
for the purposes of this subsection two bodies corporate are
associated with one another if one is under the control of the
other or both are under the control of the same person or
persons.
(5) Where, in the case of a transaction with respect to which
it appears to the Board that a direction under the said section
485 might be given-
( a) one of the parties is a body corporate resident outside
the United Kingdom and a 51 per cent. subsidiary of
a body corporate ( in this subsection referred to as
"the parent body ") resident in the United Kingdom ;
and
(b) the other party is, or is a 51 per cent. subsidiary of,
the parent body,
the Board may, by notice in writing given to the parent body,
require it to make available for inspection any books, accounts
or other documents or records whatsoever of the parent body

which it has control which relate to that transaction, to any other
transaction (of whatever nature) in the same assets, or to trans-
actions (of whatever nature) in assets similar to those to which
the first-mentioned transaction related.
( 6) If, in a case in which under subsection (5) above the parent
body is by notice required to make available for inspection any
books, accounts, documents or records of a body of persons
resident outside the United Kingdom over which the parent body
has control, it appears to the Board, on the application of the
parent body, that the circumstances are such that the requirement
ought not to have effect, the Board shall direct that the parent
body need not comply with the requirement.
If , on such an application, the Board refuse to give a direction
under this subsection, the parent body may, by notice in writing
given to the Board within thirty days after the refusal, appeal
to the Special Commissioners who, if satisfied that the requirement in question ought in the circumstances not to have effect,
may determine accordingly.
(7) Where it appears to the Board that a body of persons
may be a party to a transaction or transactions with respect to
which a direction under the said section 485 might be given,
then, for the purpose of assisting the Board to determine whether
such a direction should be given, an inspector specifically
authorised in that behalf by the Board may, at any reasonable
time, on production if so required of his authority, enter any
premises used in connection with the relevant trade carried on
by that body of persons ( that is to say, the trade in the course
of which the transaction or transactions were effected) and
inspect there any books, accounts or other documents or records
whatsoever relating to that trade which he considers it necessary
for him to inspect for that purpose, and may require any such
books, accounts or other documents or records to be produced
to him there for inspection .
An inspector's authority for entering any premises under this
subsection shall state the name of the inspector and the name
of the body of persons carrying on the trade in connection with
which the premises are used.
( 8) If and so far as the question in dispute on an appeal
to the General Commissioners or, in Northern Ireland, to a
county court against an assessment to tax arises from a direction
of the Board under the said section 485 and the assessment is
for a chargeable period beginning after the passing of this Act,
the question shall be referred to and determined by the Special
Commissioners.

had not been so included ; and
( b) the tax (if any) that would have been so chargeable
if that part only had formed the estate of the deceased
and the deceased had made no previous chargeable
transfers ;
but in a case where (by reason of an excess over £25,000) the
part referred to in paragraph (b) above would have been a
fraction only of any property, the tax that would have been
chargeable as mentioned in that paragraph shall be taken to be
the like fraction of the tax that would have been so chargeable

one and the same time.
( 2) Schedule 10 to this Act shall have effect with respect to
the valuation of property for the purposes of capital transfer
tax and the determination of the value transferred by a transfer
of value.
Other charges
39.-( 1 ) Subject to the following provisions of this section,
where a close company makes a transfer of value, tax shall be
charged as if each individual to whom an amount is apportioned
under this section had made a transfer of value of such amount
as after deduction of tax ( if any) would be equal to the amount
so apportioned, less the amount (if any) by which the value
of his estate is more than it would be but for the company's
transfer ; but for this purpose his estate shall be treated as not
including any rights or interests in the company.
( 2) For the purposes of subsection ( 1) above the value trans-
ferred by the company's transfer of value shall be apportioned
among the participators according to their respective rights and
interests in the company immediately before the transfer, and
any amount so apportioned to a close company shall be further
apportioned among its participators, and so on ; but
( a) so much of that value as is attributable to any payment
or transfer of assets to any person which falls to be
taken into account in computing that person's profits
or gains or losses for the purposes of income tax or
corporation tax shall not be apportioned ; and
(b) if any amount which would otherwise be apportioned
to an individual who is domiciled outside the United
Kingdom is attributable to the value of any property
outside the United Kingdom, that amount shall not be
apportioned.
( 3) The persons liable for the tax chargeable under subsection
(1 ) above shall be the company and, so far as it remains unpaid
after it ought to have been paid, the persons to whom any amounts
have been apportioned under this section and any individual
( whether such a person or not ) the value of whose estate is
increased by the company's transfer ; but-
( a ) a person to whom not more than 5 per cent. of the value
transferred is apportioned shall not as such be liable
for any of the tax ; and
Finance Act 1975 c.7 97
(b) each of the other persons to whom any part of that
value has been apportioned shall be so liable only for
such part of the tax as corresponds to that part of that
value; and
( c) a person shall not as a person the value of whose estate
is increased be liable for a greater amount than the
amount of the increase.
( 4) Notwithstanding section 51 ( 2) of this Act, tax chargeable
under subsection ( 1) above shall be left out of account in determining with respect to any time after the company's transfer
what previous transfers of value have been made by a person
falling within subsection (3) (a) above.
(5) Where there is at any time an alteration in so much of
a close company's share or loan capital as does not consist of
shares or securities quoted on a recognised stock exchange or
an alteration in any rights attaching to shares in or debentures
of a close company which are not so quoted, the alteration shall
be treated as having been made by a disposition made at that
time by the participators, whether or not it would fall to be so
treated apart from this subsection.
( 6) In this section-
" alteration " includes extinguishment ;
" close company " means a company within the meaning of
the Corporation Tax Acts which is, or would, if resident
in the United Kingdom, be a close company for the pur-
poses of those Acts ;
" participator " , in relation to any company, means any per-
son who is (or would be if the company were resident
in the United Kingdom) a participator in relation to
that company for the purposes of Chapter III of Part
XI of the Taxes Act, other than a person who would be
such a participator by reason only of being a loan
creditor.
(7) In determining for the purposes of this section whether a
disposition made by a close company is a transfer of value or
what value is transferred by such a transfer section 41 of this
Act shall be disregarded.
(8) References in this section to a person's rights and interests
in a company include rights and interests in the assets of the
company available for distribution among the participators in
the event of a winding up or in any other circumstances.
(9) This section has effect subject to paragraph 24 of Schedule
5 to this Act.

money or money's worth is a transfer of value and any payments
made or assets transferred by the transferor in pursuance of the
disposition are made or transferred more than one year after the
disposition is made, tax ( if any) shall be charged as if-
( a) any payment made or asset transferred in pursuance of
the disposition were made or transferred in pursuance
of a separate disposition made, without consideration,
at the time the payment is made or the asset is trans-
ferred; and
( b) the amount of the payment made or the value of the
asset transferred in pursuance of each of those separate
dispositions were the chargeable portion of the payment or asset.
( 2) For the purposes of this section the chargeable portion of
any payment made or any asset transferred at any time shall
be such portion of its value at that time as is found by applying
to it the fraction of which-
( a ) the numerator is the value actually transferred by the
disposition first mentioned in subsection ( 1) above
( calculated as if no tax were payable on it ) ; and
(b) the denominator is the value, at the time of that dis-

arm's length between persons not connected with each other,
allows another the use of money or other property without con-
sideration in money or money's worth or for a consideration less
than could reasonably be expected in such a transaction, he shall
be treated as making a transfer of value in every chargeable
period in which he allows that use ; and-
( a ) the value transferred thereby shall be the difference
between the amount of the consideration (if any) for
that period and that of the consideration that might be
so expected ; and
(b) the transfer shall be treated as being made at the end
of the chargeable period or, if earlier, at the time when
that use comes to an end ; and
(c ) the transfer shall be treated as made out of the trans-
feror's income.
( 2 ) In this section " chargeable period ", in relation to any
use, means the period beginning when the use is begun and
ending with 5th April next following, and every subsequent
period of twelve months ending with 5th April, but no period

than the person who purchased the annuity ;
then, unless it is shown that the purchase of the annuity and the
making of the insurance (or, as the case may be, the substitution
or variation) were not associated operations, the person who
purchased the annuity shall be treated as having made a transfer
of value by a disposition made at the time the benefit of the
policy became so vested (to the exclusion of any transfer of
value which, apart from this section , he might have made as a
result of the vesting or of the purchase and the vesting being
associated operations) .
( 2) The value transferred by that transfer of value shall be
equal to whichever of the following is less, namely, -
(a ) the aggregate of-
(i ) the value of the consideration given for the
annuity ; and
(ii) any premium paid or other consideration
given under the policy on or before the transfer ;
and
( b) the value of the greatest benefit capable of being con-
ferred at any time by the policy, calculated as if that
time were the date of the transfer.
( 3) The preceding provisions of this section shall apply, with
the necessary modifications, where a contract for an annuity
payable on a person's death is on or after 27th March 1974
made or varied or substituted for or replaced by such a contract
or a policy of life insurance as they apply where a policy of life
insurance is issued, varied or substituted as mentioned in sub-
section ( 1 ) above.

time of the last of them ; but where any one or more of the
earlier operations also constitute a transfer of value made by
the same transferor, the value transferred by the earlier opera-
tions shall be treated as reducing the value transferred by all the
operations taken together, except to the extent that the transfer
constituted by the earlier operations but not that made by all
the operations taken together is exempt under paragraph 1 of
Schedule 6 to this Act.

amount is included in an individual's total income by virtue of
section 399( 1 ) (a ) follows the happening of another chargeable event
in relation to the same policy or contract , and each of the events
is such an excess as is mentioned in section 394(1)(a)(v ), 396(1) or
398(1)(iv ), subsection (3) of section 400 ( top slicing relief ) shall
have effect in relation to that amount as if the number of complete
years referred to in it were the number of complete years elapsing
between that other event (or, if more than one , the last of them )
and the first-mentioned event.
19.-- (1 ) Where such an excess as is mentioned in paragraph ( a )
or (b) of section 395(1) or paragraph ( a ) of section 397(1) would be
treated as a gain arising in connection with a policy or contract and
would form part of an individual's total income for the year of
assessment in which the final year ends, a corresponding deficiency
occurring at the end of the final year shall be allowable as a deduc-
tion from his total income for that year of assessment, so far as it
does not exceed the total amount treated as a gain by virtue of
section 395( 1 ) (d ) or 397(1)(c) on the previous happenings of
chargeable events .
( 2 ) In this paragraph " final year " has the same meaning as in
paragraph 9 above.

398( 1)(iv) which has occurred since the relevant date, the date on
which it occurred and the value of the part of or share in the rights
which have been surrendered or assigned since the relevant date.
( 3 ) Where the chargeable event is the occurrence of such an excess
as is mentioned in section 394(1)(a)(v), 396( 1) or 398(1 )(iv) , section
402 shall apply with the omission of subsection (2) (b) and the certifi-
cate shall also specify the value of the part of or share in the rights
surrendered or assigned in any year since the relevant date and the
amounts paid by way of premiums in any year since the relevant
date .
( 4 ) In this paragraph " year " has the meaning assigned to it by
paragraph 9( 9) above and " the relevant date ", in relation to any
certificate, means the date of the chargeable event in respect of
which the last certificate under section 402 was delivered or, if
none was delivered, the commencement of the policy or contract.

tive periods of account, the company's 1973 increase in stock value
shall be determined for the purposes of the principal section not
in accordance with subsection (1) of that section but by reference to
a period (in this Schedule referred to as " the 1973 reference
period") determined in accordance with this paragraph.
( 2) In any case where the beginning of a company's 1973 account-
ing period does not coincide with the beginning of aperiod ofaccount ,

above does not apply the 1973 reference period shall end at the end
of the company's 1973 accounting period .
2.- (1) In any case where paragraph 1(1) applies, a company's
1973 increase in stock value shall be determined for the purposes
of the principal section by the formula: -

above applies in relation to that company or those com-
panies, during the 1973 reference period ; and
( c ) the acquisition referred to in paragraph (a ) above takes
place in consequence or as part of a reconstruction,
reorganisation, change in trading arrangements or other
scheme which is carried out by companies forming part
of the group of companies concerned and which results in
a reduction in the trading stock held by one or more of
those companies and a corresponding increase in the trading
stock held by the other or others.
(2 ) If a claim for relief under the principal section is made by
the transferee company or the transferor company or, as the case
may be, by any of the transferee companies or transferor companies,
then the company claiming relief and all other companies which-
( a ) are either transferee companies or transferor companies, and

claiming relief,
shall be treated as one company for the purpose of determining the
aggregate of the relief to which they are entitled under the principal
section:
Provided that if paragraph 1(1) above applies in relation to the
company claiming relief , another company shall not be treated as
falling within paragraph (b) above unless paragraph 1( 1) above

may be, the aggregate of the trading incomes for that period , of all
the companies which, for that purpose, are treated as one by virtue
of that sub-paragraph.
( 4) Where the aggregate of the relief to which two or more
companies are entitled under the principal section has been determined in accordance with sub-paragraphs ( 2) and ( 3) above, the
relief shall be apportioned between them so that the relief to which
any one of them is so entitled bears to the relief to which the other or
others is or are so entitled the same proportion as the closing stock
value of that one of them bears to the closing stock value or values
of the other or others.
( 5 ) For the purposes of this paragraph, companies shall be treated
as forming part of a group of companies if and only if they would
be deemed to be members of the group for the purposes of section

principal section if its 1973 accounting period or, if that period

of which it consists were a reference to any of the accounting
periods comprised in the company's 1973 reference period.
6.- (1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph,
where a company claims relief under the principal section and,
immediately before the beginning of its 1973 accounting period, the
company was not carrying on the trade to which the claim relates
then , unless-

on a sale or transfer from another person on that person's
ceasing to carry on that trade, and
( b ) the stock so acquired is, or is included in , the company's
trading stock as valued at the beginning of its 1973 account-
ing period ,
the company shall be treated for the purposes of the principal
section and the preceding provisions of this Schedule as having at
the beginning of its 1973 accounting period trading stock of such
value as appears to the inspector to be reasonable and just.
Finance Act 1975 c. 7 123
( 2) In determining , for the purposes specified in sub-paragraph (1)
above, the value of trading stock to be attributed to a company at
the beginning of its 1973 accounting period, the inspector shall have
regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in
particular, -
( a ) to movements during the company's 1973 accounting period
in the costs of items of a kind comprised in the company's
trading stock during that period ; and

in question carried on by the company.

the beginning of its 1973 accounting period trading stock of a par-
ticular value shall, in hearing and determining the appeal, in so far
as it relates to the value of the trading stock to be so attributed,
determine such value as appears to them to be reasonable and just,
having regard to those factors to which the inspector is required to
have regard by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) above.
( 4) In any case where paragraph 1(1) above applies to a company's
1973 accounting period, for any reference in sub-paragraphs ( 1 ) to (3)
above to that accounting period there shall be substituted a reference
to the 1973 reference period.
7.- (1 ) In this Schedule " the principal section " means section 18
of this Act and " 1973 accounting period ", " trading stock " and
" trading income " have the same meaning as in the principal section.
( 2) In any case where a company's 1973 accounting period or
the 1973 reference period consists of a number of complete months
and a fraction of a month, any reference in the preceding provisions
of this Schedule to the number of months in the period shall be
construed as including that fraction of a month ( and in any case
where any such period is less than one month any such reference
shall be construed as a reference to that fraction of a month of
which the period consists) .

month in which the death occurred ; and interest under paragraph 19
below on the unpaid portion of the tax shall be added to each
instalment and paid accordingly, except as otherwise provided in
paragraph 16 below.

purposes of the business ; and in ascertaining for the purposes of
this paragraph the value of an interest in a business, no regard
shall be had to assets or liabilities other than those by reference to
which the net value of the business would have fallen to be ascer-
tained under this paragraph if the tax had been attributable to the
entire business.

value of which the tax is attributable continues to be com-
prised in the settlement ;
and shall then apply subject to the modifications mentioned in sub-
paragraph (5) below.
( 5) Where sub-paragraphs (1) to ( 3) above apply by virtue of
sub- paragraph ( 4) above they shall apply as if-
( a ) references to the time six months after the end of the month

when the tax would be due if it were not payable by instalments ; and
(b) references to the business or an interest in the business being
sold-

it shall, for the purpose of any interest to be added to each
instalment, be treated as carrying interest from the date at which
the instalment is payable.
( 2) Sub-paragraph (1) above does not apply to tax attributable
to the value of shares or securities of a company falling within
paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph ( 3) below unless it also falls within

SCHEDULE 5
SETTLED PROPERTY
Definition of " settlement" and related expressions
1 .- (1) The following provisions of this paragraph apply for determining what is to be taken for the purposes of capital transfer tax to
be a settlement , and what property is , accordingly, referred to as
property comprised in a settlement or as settled property ; and who is
the settlor and a trustee in relation to a settlement.
( 2 ) " Settlement " means anydisposition or dispositions of property ,
whether effected by instrument, by parol or by operation of law,
or partly in one way and partly in another, whereby the property is
for the time being-
( a ) held in trust for persons in succession or for any person
subject to a contingency ; or
(b) held by trustees on trust to accumulate the whole or part of
any income of the property or with power to make payments
out of that income at the discretion of the trustees or some
other person, with or without power to accumulate surplus
income ; or
( c ) charged or burdened ( otherwise than for full consideration
in money or money's worth paid for his own use or benefit
to the person making the disposition), with the payment of
any annuity or other periodical payment payable for a life
or any other limited or terminable period ;
or would be so held or charged or burdened if the disposition or
dispositions were regulated by the law of any part of the United
Kingdom ; or whereby, under the law of any other country, the
administration of the property is for the time being governed by
provisions equivalent in effect to those which would apply if the
property were so held , charged or burdened.
( 3) A lease of property which is for life or lives, or for a period
ascertainable only by reference to a death, or which is terminable on,
or at a date ascertainable only by reference to, a death, shall be
treated as a settlement and the property as settled property, unless
the lease was granted for full consideration in money or money's
worth, and where a lease not granted as a lease at a rack rent is at
any time to become a lease at an increased rent it shall be treated as
terminable at that time.
( 4 ) In relation to Scotland " settlement " also includes-
( a ) an entail ;
( b) any deed by virtue of which an annuity is charged on, or on
the rents of , any property (the property being treated as the
property comprised in the settlement ).
(5 ) In sub-paragraph ( 4 ) above, " deed" includes any disposition,
arrangement , contract, resolution, instrument or writing.
( 6 ) " Settlor ", in relation to a settlement , includes any person by
whom the settlement was made directly or indirectly , and in par-
ticular ( but without prejudice to the generality of the preceding
Section 21 .
146 Finance Act 1975
c.7
SCH. 5 1849 с. 105.
words) includes any person who has provided funds directly or
indirectly for the purpose of or in connection with the settlement
or has made with any other person a reciprocal arrangement for that
other person to make the settlement.
( 7 ) " Trustee ", in relation to a settlement in relation to which there
would be no trustees apart from this sub-paragraph, means any
person in whom the settled property or its management is for the
time being vested .
( 8) Where more than one person is a settlor in relation to a settlement and the circumstances so require, this Schedule and section
25( 3) ( d ) of this Act shall apply in relation to it as if the settled
property were comprised in separate settlements .
( 9 ) In the application of this Schedule to Scotland, any reference
to an interest in possession in settled property is a reference to an
interest of any kind under a settlement actually being enjoyed by the
person in right of that interest and the person in right of such an
interest at any time shall be deemed to be entitled to a corresponding
interest in the whole or any part of the property comprised in the
settlement.
( 10 ) In the application of this Part of this Act to Northern Ireland
this paragraph shall have effect as if references to property held in
trust for persons included references to property standing limited to
persons and as if the lease referred to in sub-paragraph (3) did not
include a lease in perpetuity within the meaning of section 1 of the
Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act 1849 or a lease to which
section 37 of that Act applies.
Excluded property
2.- (1 ) Where property comprised in a settlement is situated
outside the United Kingdom—
( a ) the property ( but not a reversionary interest in the property )
is excluded property unless the settlor was domiciled in
the United Kingdom at the time the settlement was made ;
and
( b) section 24 ( 2) of this Act applies to a reversionary interest
in the property but does not otherwise apply in relation to
the property.
( 2 ) In determining whether property comprised in a settlement
which became so comprised before 10th December 1974 is excluded
property section 45 of this Act shall be disregarded.
Interests in possession
3.- (1) A person beneficially entitled to an interest in possession
in settled property shall be treated as beneficially entitled to the
property in which the interest subsists .
( 2 ) Where the person entitled to the interest is entitled to part
only of the income (if any) of the property, the interest shall be
Finance Act 1975 c .7 147
taken to subsist in such part only of the property as bears to the
whole thereof the same proportion as the part of the income to
which he is entitled bears to the whole of the income.
( 3 ) Where the part of the income of any property to which a
person is entitled is a specified amount ( or the whole less a specified
amount ) in any period, his interest in the property shall be taken ,
subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, to subsist in such part ( or in
the whole less such part ) of the property as produces that amount
inthat period.
( 4) The Treasury may from time to time by order made by
statutory instrument prescribe a higher and a lower rate for the
purposes of this paragraph ; and where tax is chargeable in accord-
ance with sub-paragraph ( 3) above by reference to the value of the
part of a property which produces a specified amount or by reference
to the value of the remainder ( but not where chargeable transfers
are made simultaneously and tax is chargeable by reference to the
value of that part as well as by reference to the value of the
remainder) the value of the part producing that specified amount-
( a ) shall, if tax is chargeable by reference to the value of that
part, be taken to be not less than it would be if the
property produced income at the higher rate so prescribed ;
and
( b ) shall, if tax is chargeable by reference to the value of the
remainder, be taken to be not more than it would be if the
property produced income at the lower rate so prescribed ;
but the value to be taken by virtue of paragraph ( a ) above as the
value of part of a property shall not exceed the value of the whole
of the property.
( 5 ) Where the person entitled to the interest is not entitled to
any income of the property but is entitled, jointly or in common
with one or more other persons, to the use and enjoyment of the
property, his interest shall be taken to subsist in such part of the
property as corresponds to the proportion which the annual value of
his interest bears to the aggregate of the annual values of his interest
and that or those of the other or others.
( 6 ) Where, under paragraph 1( 3 ) of this Schedule, a lease of
property is to be treated as a settlement, the lessee's interest in the
property shall be taken to subsist in the whole of the property less
such part of it as corresponds to the proportion which the value of
the lessor's interest (as determined under Schedule 10 to this Act)
bears to the value of the property.
( 7 ) A statutory instrument made under this paragraph shall be
subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of
Commons.
Termination of interest in possession treated as
transfer of value
4 .- (1 ) Where a person beneficially entitled to an interest in
possession in any property comprised in a settlement disposes of his
interest the disposal-
( a ) is not a transfer of value ; but
SCH. 5
c . 7
148 Finance Act 1975
SCH. 5 ( b ) shall be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as the
coming to an end of his interest ;
and tax shall be charged accordingly under the following provisions
of this paragraph.
( 2 ) Where at any time during the life of a person beneficially
entitled to an interest in possession in any property comprised in a
settlement his interest comes to an end, tax shall be charged, subject
to the following provisions of this paragraph, as if at that time he
had made a transfer of value and the value transferred had been
equal to the value of the property in which his interest subsisted.
( 3) If the person whose interest in the property comes to an end
becomes on the same occasion beneficially entitled to the property
or to another interest in possession in the property tax shall not be
chargeable under this paragraph, except in the case mentioned in
sub-paragraph ( 10)(b) below.
( 4 ) If the interest comes to an end by being disposed of by the
person beneficially entitled thereto and the disposal is for a considera-
tion in money or money's worth, tax shall be chargeable under this
paragraph as if the value of the property in which the interest sub-
sisted were reduced by the amount of the consideration ; but in
determining that amount the value of a reversionary interest in the
property or of any interest in other property comprised in the same
settlement shall be left out of account.
( 5 ) If the interest comes to an end during the settlor's life and on
the same occasion the property in which the interest subsisted reverts
to the settlor, tax shall not be chargeable under this paragraph
unless the settlor had acquired a reversionary interest in the property
for a consideration in money or money's worth.
( 6 ) If the interest comes to an end and on the same occasion
the settlor's spouse becomes beneficially entitled to the settled
property, then if-
( a ) the settlor's spouse is then domiciled in the United Kingdom
and resident ( within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts)
in the United Kingdom in the year of assessment in which
the interest comes to an end ; and
( b) neither the settlor nor the settlor's spouse had acquired a
reversionary interest in the property for a consideration in
money or money's worth ;
tax shall not be chargeable under this paragraph.
(7 ) Where the person beneficially entitled to the interest is the
surviving spouse of a person who has died before 13th November
1974, tax shall not be chargeable under this paragraph if the value
of the property in which the interest subsists would, by virtue of
section 22( 4) of this Act, have been left out of account in determin-
ing the value of his estate had he died immediately before the
coming to an end of the interest.
( 8) The tax chargeable under this paragraph in a case where-
( a ) the settlement was made before 27th March 1974 ; and
Finance Act 1975 149
c . 7
( b )the interest comes to an end before 10th December 1974 ;
shall not in any case exceed the tax that would be so chargeable if
the values transferred by previous chargeable transfers made by the
person beneficially entitled to the interest had been equal to the
values (if any ) on which tax is chargeable under this paragraph on
the earlier termination of an interest in the settled property.
( 9 ) Where a transaction is made between the trustees of the
settlement and a person who is , or is connected with, -
( a ) the person beneficially entitled to an interest in the
property ; or
( b) a person beneficially entitled to any other interest in that
property or to any interest in any other property comprised
in the settlement ; or
( c ) a person for whose benefit any of the settled property may
be applied,
and, as a result of the transaction, the value of the first- mentioned
property is less than it would be but for the transaction, a corres-
ponding part of the interest shall be deemed for the purposes of this
paragraph to come to an end , unless the transaction is such that,
were the trustees beneficially entitled to the settled property, it
would not be a transfer of value.
(10) References in this paragraph to any property and to an
interest in any property include references to part of any property or
interest ; and-
( a ) the tax chargeable under this paragraph on the coming to an
end of part of an interest shall be charged as if the value
of the property ( or part ) in which the interest subsisted
were a corresponding part of the whole thereof ; and
( b) if the value of the property (or part) to which or to an
interest in which a person becomes entitled as mentioned in
sub- paragraph ( 3) above is less than the value on which
tax would be chargeable apart from that sub-paragraph,
tax shall be chargeable on a value equal to the difference.
(11) Tax shall not be chargeable under this paragraph if the settled
property is excluded property .
Relief for successive charges on interest in possession
5.- (1 ) Where the value transferred by a chargeable transfer falls
to be determined by reference to the value of any settled property
in which there subsists an interest in possession to which the trans-
feror is entitled, and-
( a ) the value transferred by an earlier chargeable transfer also
fell to be determined by reference to the value of that
property ; and
(b ) that earlier transfer either was or included the making of the
settlement or was made after the making of the settlement ;
SCH. 5
150 Finance Act 1975
c .7
SCH. 5 then , if the period between those transfers is not more than four
years, tax shall be charged as if the value of that property were
reduced-
(i ) by 80 per cent. if that period is one year or less ;
(ii ) by 60 per cent. if that period is more than one year but not
more than two years ;
(iii ) by 40 per cent . if that period is more than two years but
not more than three years ; and
(iv ) by 20 per cent . if that period is more than three years .
( 2 ) Where the transferor became entitled to the interest on the
death of a person and estate duty was payable on that death in
respect of the settled property sub- paragraph (1) above shall apply
as if the period referred to therein were the period between the
death and the chargeable transfer.
Charge on capital distributions of settled property
6.- (1 ) Where a distribution payment is made out of property
comprised in a settlement and at the time the payment is made no
interest in possession subsists in the property or in the part of it out
of which the payment is made, the payment is in this Schedule
referred to as a capital distribution.
( 2) Where a person becomes entitled to an interest in possession
in the whole or any part of the property comprised in a settlement
at a time when no such interest subsists in the property or that
part, a capital distribution shall be treated as being made out of the
property or that part of the property ; and the amount of the
distribution shall be taken to be equal to the value at that time of
the property or, if the interest is in part only of that property, of
that part .
(3) Where, at a time when no interest in possession subsists in
property comprised in a settlement or in a part of that property,
a transaction is made between the trustees of the settlement and a
person who is, or is connected with, -
( a ) a person beneficially entitled to an interest in any of the
settled property ; or
( b) a person for whose benefit any of the settled property may
be applied ;
and, as a result of the transaction, the value of the property or part
is less than it would be but for the transaction, a capital distribution
shall be treated as being made out of the property or part of an
amount equal to that by which that value is less, unless the trans-
action is such that, were the trustees beneficially entitled to the
settled property, it would not be a transfer of value.
( 4) Tax shall be charged on any capital distribution as on the
value transferred by a chargeable transfer where-
( a ) the value transferred less the tax payable on it is equal to
the amount of the capital distribution ; and
Finance Act 1975 c . 7 151
( b ) the rate applicable is that specified in paragraphs 7 to 9
below;
and in those paragraphs " the assumed transferor " means the person
who would be the transferor in relation to the chargeable transfer
assumed by this sub-paragraph and the appropriate Table for the
purposes of those paragraphs (including the calculation of any tax
that would have been chargeable as mentioned in paragraph 7( 2)(a)
below) is the Second Table set out in section 37( 3) of this Act.
( 5 ) The reference in sub-paragraph 4( a) above to the tax payable
on a capital distribution does not include any tax which is payable
by a person to whom a distribution payment is made ; and in
relation to a capital distribution treated as made under sub-paragraph
( 2) or (3) above or paragraph 12, 15( 3) or 24( 2) below, sub-
paragraph ( 4)(a) above shall have effect as if the words " less the tax
payable on it " were omitted.
( 6 ) Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (1) above, a distribution payment which is made to the settlor or the settlor's spouse shall not
be a capital distribution if the settlor or , as the case may be, the
settlor's spouse is domiciled in the United Kingdom at the time the
payment is made and resident ( within the meaning of the Income
Tax Acts) in the United Kingdom in the year of assessment in
which it is made.
( 7 ) Sub-paragraph ( 2 ) above shall not be taken to apply in the
case of a person who, on surviving another person for a specified
period, becomes entitled to an interest in possession as from the
other person's death.
( 8) Where a person entitled to an interest in possession in part
of the property comprised in a settlement became so entitled as a
member of a class, sub-paragraph ( 2) above shall not apply on his
becoming entitled, as such a member, to an interest in possession
in another part of that property, if he becomes so entitled on the
death under full age of another member of that class.
Rates of charge on capital distributions following chargeable
transfers
7.- (1) This paragraph applies where, at or after the relevant time
and before the capital distribution, there has been a transfer of value
which satisfies the conditions stated in paragraph 11( 2 ) below.
( 2) So far as the amount on which tax is chargeable, when added
to the amount of all previous distribution payments made out of
property comprised in the settlement, does not exceed the initial
value, the rate chargeable shall be equal to the fraction of which-
( a ) the numerator is the amount of the tax which would have
been charged on the value transferred by the relevant
transfer, or such part of that amount as is attributable to
the initial value, if the value so transferred had been equal
to the aggregate of the initial values of the settlement and
any related settlement ; and
( b ) the denominator is the initial value.
SCH. 5
c .7
152 Finance Act 1975
SCH. 5 ( 3 ) So far as the amount on which tax is chargeable, when so
added, exceeds the initial value, the rate or rates chargeable shall
be the rate or rates that would be applicable if the assumed transferor
had made previous chargeable transfers and the aggregate of the
values transferred by them were equal to the aggregate of-
( a ) the values transferred by any chargeable transfers which the
person who made the relevant transfer had made before
the relevant transfer ;
( b ) the aggregate of the initial values of the settlement and any
related settlement ; and
( c ) the amounts of any previous distribution payments out of
property comprised in the settlement, so far as the tax
( if any ) chargeable thereon is chargeable in accordance
with this sub-paragraph.
Rate of charge on other capital distributions
8.- (1 ) This paragraph applies where paragraph 7 above does
not apply.
( 2) The rate or rates chargeable shall be the rate or rates that
would be applicable if the assumed transferor-
( a ) had made previous chargeable transfers in any case where
there had been previous distribution payments made on or
after 27th March 1974 out of the settled property ; but
( b ) had made no previous chargeable transfers in any other
case;
and, where paragraph (a) above applies, the aggregate of the values
transferred by the previous chargeable transfers were equal to the
aggregate amounts of the previous distribution payments mentioned
therein .
Further property added by settlor
9.- (1 ) The following provisions of this paragraph apply where,
by a transfer of value made by the settlor at any time after the
making of the settlement and after 26th March 1974 (in this para-
graph referred to as " the subsequent transfer ") further property is
added to the property comprised in the settlement immediately
before the subsequent transfer (in this paragraph referred to as "the
previous property ") .
( 2) The subsequent transfer shall be treated for the purposes of
paragraphs 6 to 8 above as the making of a separate settlement and
the further property as property comprised in that separate settlement, and the following provisions of this paragraph shall apply for
determining the property out of which any capital distributions made
after the subsequent transfer are to be treated as made.
( 3) If paragraph 7 above would have applied to a capital distribu-
tion made immediately before the subsequent transfer, any capital
distribution made after the subsequent transfer shall be treated as
made-
( a ) out of the previous property, if or to the extent that the
amount of the distribution, when added to the amount of all
Finance Act 1975 153
c .7
previous distribution payments made out of the settled
property , does not exceed the previous value defined in sub-
paragraph ( 4 ) below ; and
(b ) out of the further property in any other case.
( 4 ) For the purposes of sub-paragraph ( 3) above the previous
value is the initial value, increased, if there was an earlier transfer
which is a " subsequent transfer " as defined above, by the value,
immediately after the earlier transfer, of any property added by it to
the settled property.
( 5 ) If paragraph 7 above would not have applied to a capital
distribution made immediately before the subsequent transfer, any
capital distribution made after the subsequent transfer shall be treated
as made-
( a ) out of the previous property, if or to the extent that the
amount of the distribution, when added to the amount of
any previous distribution payment made since the subse-
quent transfer, does not exceed the value of the settled
property immediately before the subsequent transfer ; and
( b) out of the further property in any other case ;
and accordingly, where paragraph (b) above applies, the rate or rates
chargeable shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 7 above
( and, where there is a further subsequent transfer, in accordance
with sub-paragraphs ( 3) and (4) above).
Capital distributions after termination of interest of settlor or
settlor's spouse
10. Where, after the termination of an interest in possession in a
part (in this paragraph referred to as the chargeable part) of any
property comprised in a settlement made after 26th March 1974,
a capital distribution is made out of the chargeable part, and-
( a ) the settlor or the settlor's spouse was the person entitled to
the interest before its termination, and either the settlor or
the settlor's spouse was entitled to an interest in possession
in the chargeable part immediately after the making of the
settlement ; and
( b ) the making of the settlement either was not a transfer of
value or was an exempt transfer or a transfer exempt to the
extent of the value of the chargeable part ;
paragraphs 6 to 9 above shall apply as if the chargeable part were
comprised in a separate settlement made by the person entitled to the
first- mentioned interest on its termination and the termination of the
interest were the relevant transfer ; and as if the subsequent termi-
nation of any interest of his in any other part of the settled property

c. 7
SCH. 5 ( 2) The relevant transfer, in relation to any settlement, is the first
transfer of value made at or after the relevant time which satisfies
the conditions-
( a ) that the value of the property comprised in the settlement
or of that part of it out of which the capital distributions
are made was taken into account in determining the value
transferred ; and
( b) that the transfer was, or would but for paragraph 19(2)
below or paragraphs 2 to 7 of Schedule 6 to this Act have
been, a chargeable transfer ; and
( c ) that , if the settlement was made before 27th March 1974,
the transfer was made neither under paragraph 4 above nor
ondeath ;
and where it was not a chargeable transfer the reference in para-
graph 7(2 )(a ) above to the tax which would have been charged is a
reference to the tax which would have been charged but for para-
graph 19( 2) below or paragraphs 2 to 7 of Schedule 6 to this Act.
( 3 ) The relevant time, in relation to any settlement, is, if the
settled property became comprised in the settlement on the death
of any person, the time immediately before his death, and, in any
other case, the time when the settlement was made.
( 4 ) Where, by the same disposition, property ceases to be com-
prised in one settlement and becomes comprised in another settlement, the property shall be treated as remaining comprised in the
first settlement.
( 5) The amount of any distribution payment which is a capital dis-
tribution shall be taken ( except for the purposes of paragraph
6 ( 4)(a)) to be the amount on which tax is chargeable in respect of it.
( 6 ) A settlement is related to another if the same transfer of value
is the relevant transfer in relation to both ; and for this purpose trans-
fers of value made by the same person on the same day shall be
treated as one.
( 7 ) " Distribution payment " means, subject to sub- paragraph (8)
below, any payment which
( a ) is not income of any person for any of the purposes of
income tax and would not for any of those purposes be
income of a person not resident in the United Kingdom if
he were so resident ; and
(b ) is not a payment in respect of costs or expenses ;
and " payment " includes the transfer of assets other than money.
( 8) The amount of any capital distribution treated as made under
paragraph 6(2) or (3) above or paragraph 15( 3) or 24(2) below shall
also be deemed to be a distribution payment ; but where, after an
amount has been taken into account by virtue of this sub -paragraph
as a distribution payment made out of the whole or part of any
property, one or more distribution payments are made ( otherwise
than under this sub-paragraph) out of that property or part, the
amount so taken into account shall be treated as reducing the amount
of those payments .
c. 7

( 9) " Initial value ", in relation to any settlement, means the SCH. 5
value , immediately after the relevant transfer, of the property then

which an individual is beneficially entitled or, if the following condi-
tions are satisfied, an interest in possession to which a company is
beneficially entitled, the conditions being-

the acquisition of interests in settled property ; and
( b) that the company has acquired the interest for full considera-
tion in money or money's worth from an individual who
was beneficially entitled to the interest.

only to property which is not excluded property.
Periodic charge to tax
12.- ( 1 ) Where, at a relevant anniversary, no interest in possession
subsists in the property comprised in a settlement or in a part of
that property, a capital distribution of an amount equal to the
value immediately before that anniversary of that property or part
shall be treated as made out of that property or part, and tax shall
be charged on a capital distribution so treated as made at 30 per
cent. of the rate at which it would be chargeable under paragraphs
6 to 10 above on a capital distribution of the same amount made at
the same date, but subject to any reduction under sub-paragraph
( 4 ) below.
( 2 ) Where the trustees of the settlement are not resident in the
United Kingdom a capital distribution of a corresponding amount
shall also be treated as made if no interest in possession subsists
in the property or in a part thereof at the end of any year in the
period of ten years ending with a relevant anniversary, except the
last and except any year ending before 1st January 1976 ; and tax
shall be charged on a capital distribution so treated as made at 3
per cent. of the rate at which it would be chargeable under para-
graphs 6 to 10 above on a capital distribution of the same amount
made at the same date.
( 3) Any tax charged by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) above shall
be allowed as a credit against the tax chargeable on the next capital
distribution made, or treated by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) above
as made, out of the property or, as the case may be, out of the part
concerned.
( 4) Where the whole or part of the value mentioned in sub-
paragraph ( 1) above is attributable to property-
( a ) which was added by the settlor after the end of the first of
the ten years ending with the relevant anniversary ; or
( b ) in which an interest in possession subsisted throughout at
least one of those ten years ;
the rate at which, under sub- paragraph (1) above, tax is chargeable
on that value or that part of it shall be reduced by one-tenth for each
of those ten years throughout which either the settled property did
not include that property, or an interest in possession subsisted in
that property .

the time being resident in the United Kingdom.

from this paragraph, tax would be chargeable on any capital distribu-
tion made out of that property on or not later than twenty years
after that relevant anniversary .
( 2 ) The amounts by which tax on any capital distribution is reduced
under sub-paragraph (1) above by reason of any tax charged under

after 26th March 1974 ) shall be the following percentage of the rate
at which it would be chargeable apart from this paragraph, that is to

tion is made it shall be charged on an amount (in this sub- paragraph
referred to as the first amount) equal to the proper proportion
of the current value of the property out of which the capital distri-

the next relevant anniversary and, accordingly, more than one
deferred tax becomes chargeable-

distribution made at the time of the transfer ;

property paragraphs (a ) and ( b) above shall apply with the necessary
adjustments of the values and amounts referred to therein.

incurred by the transferor shall be taken into account only to the
extent that it was incurred for a consideration in money or money's

an asset and on the disposal a gain accrues to the transferor for
the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965, then, if-
( a ) the whole or part of the gain is a chargeable gain or a
development gain ; and
( b) the whole or part of any capital gains tax or income tax
chargeable on the gain is borne by the donee ( within the
meaning of paragraph 19 of Schedule 7 to that Act) ;
the amount of the tax so borne shall be treated as reducing the value

( 2 ) Where the chargeable transfer is made under Schedule 5 to
this Act, sub -paragraph (1) above shall have effect as if for the
reference to the transferor there were substituted a reference to the
trustee.
Restriction on freedom to dispose
5.- (1 ) Where, by a contract made at any time, the right to dispose
of any property has been excluded or restricted, then, in determining
the value of the property for the purpose of the first relevant event
happening after that time, -
( a ) the exclusion or restriction shall be taken into account only
to the extent ( if any ) that consideration in money or
money's worth was given for it ; but
(b ) if the contract was a chargeable transfer or was part of
associated operations which together were a chargeable
transfer, an allowance shall be made for the value trans-
ferred thereby (calculated as if no tax had been chargeable
on it ) or by so much thereof as is attributable to the
exclusion or restriction.
( 2) Where the contract was made before 27th March 1974 sub-
paragraph (1) above applies only if the first relevant event is a
transfer made on death.
( 3 ) In this paragraph " relevant event ", in relation to any pro-
perty, means-
( a ) a chargeable transfer in the case of which the whole or
part of the value transferred is attributable to the value
of the property ; and

treated as reducing the value transferred.
c. 7
Finance Act 1975 191
Valuation of related property
7.- (1) Where the value of any property comprised in a person's
estate would be less than the appropriate portion of the value of
the aggregate of that and any related property, it shall be the
appropriate portion of the value of that aggregate.
( 2) For the purposes of this paragraph, property is related to the
property comprised in a person's estate if-

made by him or his spouse before 27th March 1974,
and no interest in possession subsists in that property or
part .
( 3) The appropriate portion of the value of the aggregate mentioned
in sub-paragraph ( 1) above is such portion thereof as would be
attributable to the value of the first-mentioned property if the value
of that aggregate were equal to the sums of the values of that and
any related property, the value of each property being determined
as if it did not form part of that aggregate.
( 4 ) For the purposes of sub-paragraph ( 3) above the proportion
which the value of a smaller number of shares of any class bears
to the value of a greater number thereof shall be taken to be that
which the smaller number bears to the greater ; and similarly with
stock, debentures and units of any other description of property.

if dealt with on such a stock exchange.
Value of lessor's interest
8. Where, under paragraph 1( 3) of Schedule 5 to this Act,
a lease of property is to be treated as a settlement, the value of the
lessor's interest in the property shall be taken to be such part of the
value of the property as bears to it the same proportion as the value
of the consideration, at the time the lease was granted, bore to what
would then have been the value of a full consideration in money or
money's worth.
Value transferred on death
9.- (1) In determining the value of a person's estate immediately
before his death-
( a ) changes in the value of his estate which have occurred by
reason of the death and fall within sub-paragraph ( 2 ) below
shall be taken into account as if they had occurred before
the death ; and
(b ) allowance shall be made for reasonable funeral expenses ;
and
(c ) where there is a liability to make payments or transfer
assets under such a disposition as is me mentioned in section
40 of this Act, the liability shall be computed as if the
amount or value of the payments or assets were reduced by
SCH. 10
c. 7
192 Finance Act 1975
SCH. 10 the chargeable portion thereof (as defined in that section) ;
and
( d ) an allowance against the value of property situated outside
the United Kingdom shall be made for any expense incurred
in administering or realising the property which is shown
to be attributable to the situation of the property, but the
allowance shall not exceed five per cent. of the value of
the property.
( 2) A change falls within this sub-paragraph if it is an addition to
the property comprised in the estate or an increase or decrease
of the value of any property so comprised; but the termination on
the death of any interest or the passing of any interest by survivorship
does not fall within this sub-paragraph.
( 3) Part II of this Schedule shall apply with respect to the valua-
tion of qualifying investments ( as defined in that Part ) which are
comprised in a person's estate immediately before his death and are
sold by the appropriate person ( as so defined ) within the period of
twelve months immediately following the date of the death.
Value of amounts due
10. In determining the value of a right to receive a sum due under
any obligation it shall be assumed that the obligation will be duly
discharged, except if or to the extent that recovery of the sum is
impossible or not reasonably practicable and has not become so by
any act or omission of the person to whom the sum is due.
Value of life policies, etc.
11 .- (1 ) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, in
determining in connection with a transfer of value the value of a
policy of insurance on a person's life or of a contract for an annuity
payable on a person's death, that value shall be taken to be not less
than-
( a ) the total of the premiums or other consideration which, at
any time before the transfer of value, has been paid under
the policy or contract or any policy or contract for which
it was directly or indirectly substituted ; less
( b ) any sum which, at any time before the transfer of value,
hasbeenpaid under, or in consideration for the surrender of
any right conferred by, the policy or contract or a policy
or contract for which it was directly or indirectly substituted.
(2 ) Sub- paragraph (1) above does not apply where the transfer of
value is made on the death of the person whose life was insured or,
as the case may be, on whose death the annuity is payable.
( 3) Sub-paragraph ( 1) above does not apply where the policy is
one under which the sum assured becomes payable only if the person
whose life is insured dies before the expiry of a specified term or
both before the expiry of a specified term and during the life of a
specified person and which, if that specified term ends, or can, under
the policy, be extended so as to end, more than three years after
the making of the insurance, satisfies the condition that, if neither
c .7
Finance Act 1975 193
the person whose life is insured nor the specified person dies before the expiry of the specified term-
( a ) the premiums are payable during at least two-thirds of that
term and at yearly or shorter intervals ; and
( b ) the premiums payable in any one period of twelve months
are not more than twice the premiums payable in any
other such period.
( 4 ) Where the policy is one under which-
( a ) the benefit secured is expressed in units the value of which
is published and subject to fluctuation ; and
( b) the payment of each premium secures the allocation to the
policy of a specified number of such units ;
then , if the value, at the time of the transfer of value, of the units
allocated to the policy on the payment of premiums is less than the
aggregate of what the respective values of those units were at the
time of allocation, the value to be taken under sub-paragraph (1 )
above as a minimum shall be reduced by the amount of the difference.
Farm cottages
12. In determining the value of any agricultural property which
includes cottages occupied by persons employed solely for agricultural
purposes in connection with the property, no account shall be taken
of any value attributable to the fact that the cottages are suitable for
the residential purposes of persons not so employed.
Open market price of unquoted shares and securities
13.- (1) In determining the price which unquoted shares or
securities might reasonably be expected to fetch if sold in the open
market it shall be assumed that in that market there is available
to any prospective purchaser of the shares or securities all the
information which a prudent prospective purchaser might reasonably
require if he were proposing to purchase them from a willing
vendor by private treaty and at arm's length.
( 2 ) In this paragraph " unquoted shares or securities " means shares
or securities which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange.

The relief
15. On a claim being made in that behalf by the appropriate
person there shall be determined for the purposes of this Part of this
Schedule the amount (if any) by which-
( a ) the aggregate of the values which, apart from this Part of
this Schedule, would be the values for the purposes of tax
of all the qualifying investments comprised in a person's
estate immediately before his death which are sold by the
appropriate person within the period of twelve months
immediately following the date of the death
exceeds
( b) the aggregate of the values of those investments at the time
they were so sold, taking the value of any particular investments for this purpose as the price for which they were

in the same capacity as that in which he makes the claim, the loss
on sale of the investments to which the claim relates shall be treated
for the purposes of paragraph 16 above as reduced by the propor-
tion which the aggregate of the purchase prices of all the qualifying
Finance Act 1975 c. 7 195
investments so purchased bears to the aggregate of the values referred
to in paragraph 15( b) above ( or, if the aggregate of those purchase
prices equals or exceeds the aggregate of those values, the loss on
sale shall be extinguished ).
18.- (1) If a claim is made under this Part of this Schedule by
any person in a capacity other than that of personal representative
or trustee-
( a ) paragraph 17 above shall have effect in his case as if for
the words " in the same capacity as that in which he makes
the claim " there were substituted the words " otherwise

qualifying investments purchased by him unless they are
of the same description as one of the qualifying investments
to which the claim relates.

graphs, two investments, not being investments in an authorised
unit trust or common investment fund, shall not be treated as of
the same description if they are separately quoted on a recognised

any reference in the preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule
to qualifying investments which are sold by him is a reference to
investments which, immediately before their sale, were held by him
in the capacity in which he makes the claim.
Valuation on sale and purchase
21. In any case where, for the purposes of this Part of this
Schedule, it is necessary to determine the price at which any investments were purchased or sold or the best consideration that could
reasonably have been obtained on the sale of any investments, no
account shall be taken of expenses (whether by way of commission,
stamp duty or otherwise) which are incidental to the sale or purchase.
22.- ( 1 ) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 2 ) below, for the purposes of
this Part of this Schedule where any investments are sold or pur-
chased by the appropriate person the date on which they are so sold
G2
SCH. 10
196 Finance Act 1975
c. 7
SCH. 10 or purchased shall be taken to be the date on which he entered
into a contract to sell or purchase the investments.
( 2 ) If the sale or purchase of any investments by the appropriate
person results from the exercise (whether by him or by any other
person ) of an option, then, for the purposes of this Part of this
Schedule, the date on which the investments are sold or purchased
shall be taken to be the date on which the option was granted.
Value of part of a fund
23 .- (1) In any case where-
( a ) part only of a holding of qualifying investments is comprised
in a person's estate, and
( b) investments included in that holding are sold by the appro-
priate person within the period of twelve months
immediately following the date of the death,
this Part of this Schedule shall apply as if the entirety of the holding
were comprised in the estate and, if a claim is made under paragraph
15 above in respect of the investments referred to in paragraph ( b )
above, the taxable fraction of the value of the investments to which
the claim relates, as determined under this Part of this Schedule,
shall be the value of that part of those investments which is com-
prised in the estate.
( 2 ) In sub- paragraph ( 1) above, " taxable fraction " means the
fraction of which the numerator is the value, as determined apart
from this Part of this Schedule, of the part of the holding referred
to in paragraph ( a ) of that sub- paragraph and the denominator is
the value, as so determined, of the entirety of that holding.
Exchanges of qualifying investments
24.- (1 ) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 3) below, if , within the period
of twelve months immediately following the date of the death in
question, the appropriate person exchanges ( with or without any
payment by way of equality of exchange) any qualifying investments
comprised in the deceased's estate immediately before his death,
then, regardless of the nature of the property taken in exchange, if
the market value of those investments is at the date of the exchange
greater than their value on death, they shall be treated for the
purposes of this Part of this Schedule as having been sold at the
date of the exchange for a price equal to that market value.
( 2) For the purposes of this paragraph, the market value of
any investments at any time means the value which they would
( apart from this Part of this Schedule) have for the purposes of
tax if they were comprised in the estate of a person who died at
that time.
(3) This paragraph does not apply in any case where the exchange
falls within paragraph 27(1) below.

after the expiry of the period of twelve months immediately
Finance Act 1975 197
c. 7
following the date of the death ) the appropriate person
receives any capital payment or payments which is or are
attributable to any qualifying investments comprised in
the deceased's estate immediately before his death, and
(b ) those investments are sold by him within that period ;
the price for which those investments were sold or, as the case
may be, the best consideration referred to in paragraph 15( b) above
shall be taken to be increased by an amount equal to the capital
payment or, as the case may be, the aggregate of the capital payments,
referred to in paragraph ( a) above.
( 2 ) If the appropriate person receives or becomes entitled to
receive in respect of any qualifying investments a provisional allotment of shares in or debentures of a company and he disposes
of his rights, the amount of the consideration for the disposal shall
be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as a capital payment
attributable to those investments .
( 3) In this paragraph " capital payment " , in relation to any
investment, does not include the price paid on the sale of the
investments but, subject to that, includes any money or money's
worth which does not constitute income for the purposes of income
tax .

Payment of calls
26. For the purposes of paragraph 15(a ) above if-
( a ) at any time after the death in question ( whether during
or after the expiry of the period of twelve months
immediately following the date of the death ) the appropriate
person pays an amount in pursuance of a call in respect
of any qualifying investments comprised in the deceased's
estate immediately before his death, and
( b) those investments are sold by the appropriate person within
that period,
the value on death of those investments shall be the aggregate of
the amount so paid and their value as determined apart from this
Part of this Schedule.
Effect of changes in a holding between death and sale
27.- (1) This paragraph applies in any case where, within the
period of twelve months immediately following the date of the

an arrangement as is referred to in paragraph 7 of that
Schedule ;
or any transaction relating to a unit trust scheme which corresponds
to any of the transactions referred to in paragraphs (a ) to (d ) above

section 45( 8) of the Finance Act 1965.
( 2 ) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 3) below, where this paragraph
applies the holding of investments which, as the result of the
transaction, constitutes a new holding, within the meaning of para-
graph 4 of the said Schedule 7, shall be treated for the purposes
of this Part of this Schedule as being the same as the original
holding ; and references in the following provisions of this paragraph
to the new holding shall be construed accordingly.
( 3) If, in a case where this paragraph applies, the appropriate
person gives, or becomes liable to give, as part of or in connection
with the transaction concerned, any consideration for the new holding
or any part of it , then, for the purposes of sub-paragraph ( 5) below,
the value on death of the new holding shall be treated as the
aggregate of-
( a ) the value on death of the original holding, and
( b ) an amount equal to that consideration,
and in any other case the value on death of the new holding shall
be taken to be the same as the value on death of the original
holding .
( 4 ) For the purposes of sub-paragraph ( 3) above, there shall not
be treated as consideration given for the new holding or any part
of it-
( a ) any surrender, cancellation or other alteration of any of
the investments comprised in the original holding or of the
rights attached thereto, or
( b ) any consideration consisting of any application, in paying
up the new holding or any part of it , of assets of the
company concerned or of any dividend or other distribution
declared out of those assets but not made.
( 5 ) If , in a case where this paragraph applies, the appropriate
person sells, within the period referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above,
any investments comprised in the new holding, the value on death
ofthose investments shall be determined by the formula-
Vs(H- S )
( Vs +Vr)
where-
Vsis the sale value of the investments,
Vr is the market value at the time of the sale of any investments
remaining in the new holding after the sale,
Finance Act 1975 199
c. 7
His the value on death of the new holding, and
S is the value on death of any investments which were originally
comprised in the new holding but have been sold on a
previous occasion or occasions.

purposes of sub-paragraph ( 5) above as it applies for the purposes
of that paragraph.
Effect of purchase, etc., of investments of the same description
28.- (1 ) If, at any time within the period of twelve months immedi-
ately following the date of the death in question, the appropriate
person sells any investments which form part of a holding of investments which are all of the same description and consist of-
( a ) investments comprised in the deceased's estate immediately
before his death, and
(b) investments acquired by the appropriate person, by pur-
chase or otherwise, after the death but not in the circum-
stances in which paragraph 27 above applies,
the investments so sold shall be apportioned for the purposes of
this Part of this Schedule between those falling within paragraph (a)
and those falling within paragraph (b) above in the same proportion
as, immediately before the sale, the investments comprised in the
holding and falling within paragraph (a) above bore to the investments
so comprised and falling within paragraph ( b) above.
( 2) For the purposes of this paragraph, if the appropriate person
holds investments of any description in the capacity of personal
representative or trustee, the investments shall not be treated as
forming part of the same holding as investments which, though of
the same description, are held by him otherwise than in that
capacity .

Attribution of values to specific investments
29.- (1 ) This paragraph shall have effect in determining the value
for the purposes of tax (and, accordingly, the market value for the
purposes of capital gains tax under section 26 of the Finance Act 1965 c . 25 .
1965) of any investment ( in this paragraph referred to as a " specific
investment ") which is included among the investments to which a
claim relates .
( 2 ) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the
value of a specific investment shall be its sale value.
( 3) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, in a
case where the calculation of the loss on sale of the investments to
which a claim relates is affected by paragraph 17 above-
( a ) if the value on death of a specific investment exceeds its
sale price, the value of that investment shall be the aggre-
gate of its sale value and an amount equal to the relevant
proportion of the difference between its sale price and its
value on death ; and
G4
200 Finance Act 1975
c.7
SCH. 10
Section 49.
1969 с. 32.
( b ) if the sale price of a specific investment exceeds its value on
death, the value of the investment shall be its sale value
less an amount equal to the relevant proportion of the
difference between its value on death and its sale price.
( 4 ) For the purposes of sub-paragraphs ( 2) and (3) above, the sale
value of a specific investment in respect of which an amount has
been paid in pursuance of a call, as mentioned in paragraph 26
above, shall be reduced by the amount so paid in respect of that
investment.
( 5 ) In a case where, by virtue of sub- paragraph ( 3) of paragraph
27 above, the value on death of the new holding, within the meaning
of that paragraph, includes an amount equal to the consideration
referred to in that sub-paragraph, the sale value of any specific
investment comprised in the new holding shall be reduced, for the
purposes of sub-paragraphs ( 2 ) and ( 3) above, by an amount which
bears to that consideration the like proportion as the value on death
of the specific investment sold bears to the value on death of the
whole of the new holding.
( 6 ) In sub-paragraph ( 3) above " sale price ", in relation to a
specific investment, means the price for which the investment was
sold by the appropriate person or, if it is greater, the best con-
sideration which could reasonably have been obtained for the
specific investment at the time of the sale ; and paragraph 25 above
shall apply for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as it applies for
the purposes of paragraph 15(b) above.
Limitation of loss on sale
30. In any case where, apart from this paragraph, the loss on sale
of any investments-
( a ) in respect of which an amount has been paid in pursuance
of a call as mentioned in paragraph 26 above, or
(b ) which are sold as mentioned in paragraph 27( 5 ) above,
would exceed their value as determined apart from this Part of this
Schedule, their sale value shall be treated for the purposes of para-
graphs 16 and 29 above as being of such an amount that the loss
on sale would be equal to their value as so determined.

mentioned in section 3(1)(a) and (c) above (except the sum
specified for age addition ) for the purpose of determining
whether they have retained their value in relation to the general
level of earnings or prices obtaining in Great Britain .
( 2 ) For the purposes of any such review the Secretary of State
shall estimate the general level of earnings and prices in such
manner as he thinks fit and shall have regard either to earnings
or prices according to which he considers more advantageous
to beneficiaries, except that he shall have regard only to prices
as respects the sums specified in-

any of the sums in question have not retained their value as
aforesaid he shall prepare and lay before each House of Parliament the draft of an order under section 3 above increasing
those sums at least to such extent as he thinks necessary to
restore their value ; and if on any such review the Secretary of
State determines that he is not required to prepare and lay the

State to provide for an increase in any case in which it appears
to him that the amount of the increase would be inconsiderable ;

pursuance of that subsection, adjust the amount of the increase
so as to secure that the sums specified for any particular benefits
continue to differ from each other by the same amount or so
as to round any sum up or down to such extent as he thinks
appropriate having regard to the nature and the rate or amount
of the benefit in question.
(5) A draft order prepared under subsection (3) above shall be
framed so as to bring the increase of any sum to which it
relates into force not later than the expiration of the period of
twelve months beginning with the date on which the provision
fixing the current amount of that sum came into force ; but if
since that date there have been laid before Parliament under
that subsection one or more reports , or one or more draft orders
not increasing that sum, that period shall be extended by a
further twelve months for each such report or draft order .
(6 ) The Secretary of State shall lay with any report under
subsection (3) above a copy of a report by the Government
Actuary giving the latter's opinion on the likely effect on the

13.- (1 ) In the case of the benefits specified in section 12( 1)

с.14
Social Security Act 1975 311
of the classes specified in subsection (1) above; and this shall
be for the purposes-
( a ) of establishing entitlement to any benefit specified in that
subsection by reference to satisfaction of contribution
conditions ; and
(b) of arriving at the weekly rate-
(i ) of earnings-related supplement of unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or a maternity allow-
ance, or
(ii ) of earnings-related addition to a widow's
allowance.
(3) No earnings factor shall be derived from primary Class 1

any class for the purpose of bringing a person's earnings factor
for any tax year to a figure which will enable him to satisfy

related supplement of, or addition to, any benefit .
(5) Earnings factors derived from a person's contributions in
respect of any tax year shall be expressed as whole numbers of
pounds and be made ascertainable from tables or rules to be
drawn up by the Secretary of State and embodied in regulations ;
and such tables and rules shall be drawn up so that in general-
( a ) any amount of Class 1 contributions in respect of a tax
year gives rise to an earnings factor for that tax year
equal or approximating to the minimum actual earnings
sufficient to yield contributions of that amount ; and
( b) any number of Class 2 or Class 3 contributions in
respect of a tax year gives rise to an earnings factor for
that tax year equal or approximating to that year's
lower earnings limit for Class 1 contributions multiplied
by the number of contributions ;
and separate earnings factors shall be derived from contributions
of different classes paid or credited in the same tax year, and
from contributions which have been actually paid, as opposed to
those not paid but credited.

any official recommendations given to him with a view
to assisting him to find suitable employment, being
recommendations which were reasonable having regard
to his circumstances and to the means of obtaining
that employment usually adopted in the district in
which he resides ; or
( e ) he has without good cause refused or failed to avail
himself of a reasonable opportunity of receiving train-
ing approved by the Secretary of State in his case for
the purpose of becoming or keeping fit for entry into,
or return to, regular employment.
( 2) Regulations may provide for disqualifying a person for
receiving sickness benefit or invalidity benefit for such period
not exceeding 6 weeks as may be determined in accordance with
sections 97 to 104 if-
( a ) he has become incapable of work through his own
misconduct ; or
( b) he fails without good cause to attend for , or to submit
himself to, such medical or other examination or treatment as may be required in accordance with the
regulations, or to observe any prescribed rules of

( 3) Regulations may also provide for imposing, in the case of
any prescribed category of persons, additional conditions with
respect to the receipt of unemployment benefit, sickness benefit
or invalidity benefit, and restrictions on the rate and duration
thereof, if, having regard to special circumstances, it appears to
the Secretary of State necessary to do so for the purpose of
preventing inequalities, or injustice to the general body of
employed earners, or of earners generally, as the case may be.
( 4 ) For the purposes of this section, employment shall not be
deemed to be employment suitable in the case of any person if
it is either-
( a) employment in a situation vacant in consequence of a
stoppage of work due to a trade dispute ; or
(b) employment in his usual occupation in the district
where he was last ordinarily employed at a rate of
remuneration lower, or on conditions less favourable,
than those which he might reasonably have expected
to obtain having regard to those which he habitually
obtained in his usual occupation in that district, or
would have obtained had he continued to be so
employed ; or
( c ) employment in his usual occupation in any other district
at a rate of remuneration lower, or on conditions less

favourable, than those generally observed in that
district by agreement between associations of em-

ployers and of employees or, failing any such agreement, than those generally recognised in that district
by good employers ;
but, after the lapse of such an interval from the date on which
he becomes unemployed as in the circumstances of the case is
reasonable, employment shall not be deemed to be unsuitable
by reason only that it is employment of a kind other than
employment in his usual occupation if it is employment at a
rate of remuneration not lower, and on conditions not less
favourable, than those generally observed by agreement between
associations of employers and of employees or, failing any
such agreement, than those generally recognised by good
employers.
( 5 ) For the purposes of this section the following definitions

Adjudication in relation to industrial injuries, etc.
107.-( 1 ) Where, in connection with any claim for industrial
injuries benefit, it is determined that the relevant accident was or
was not an industrial accident, an express declaration of that

below ) a claimant shall be entitled to have the question whether
the relevant accident was an industrial accident determined
notwithstanding that his claim is disallowed on other grounds.
(2) Subject to subsection (3) below, and to section 117 ( finality
of decisions) , any person suffering personal injury by accident
shall be entitled, if he claims the accident was an industrial
accident, to have that question determined, and a declaration
made and recorded accordingly, notwithstanding that no claim
for benefit has been made in connection with which the question
arises ; and this Part of this Act applies for that purpose as if
the question had arisen in connection with a claim for benefit.
( 3) The insurance officer, local tribunal or Commissioner (as
the case may be) may refuse to determine the question whether
an accident was an industrial accident if satisfied that it is
unlikely that it will be necessary to determine the question for
the purposes of any claim for benefit ; but any such refusal
of an insurance officer or local tribunal shall be subject to
appeal to the local tribunal or Commissioner, as the case may
be.
( 4 ) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act as to
appeal and review, any declaration under this section that an
accident was or was not an industrial accident shall be con-
clusive for the purposes of any claim for industrial injuries

is the person at whose instance the declaration was made.

section 104 above-
( a) applies to a decision under this section that an accident
was an industrial accident as it applies to a decision
under sections 99 to 101 if , but only if , the insurance
officer or local tribunal (as the case may be) is satisfied
by fresh evidence that the decision under this section
was given in consequence of any wilful non- disclosure
or misrepresentation of a material fact ; but
( b ) does not apply to a decision under this section that an
accident was not an industrial accident.

( 3) Schedule 12 to this Act has effect with respect to medical
boards and medical appeal tribunals, and their proceedings .
(4) Where the case of a claimant for disablement benefit has
been referred by the insurance officer to a medical board for
determination of the disablement questions and, on that or any
other subsequent reference, the extent of the disablement is
provisionally assessed, the case shall again be so referred not
later than the end of the period taken into account by the
provisional assessment.

medical board, nor where the period taken into account by the
assessment falls wholly within those 2 years.
( 3) If the Secretary of State notifies the insurance officer
within the prescribed time that he is of opinion that any decision
of the medical board ought to be considered by a medical
appeal tribunal, the insurance officer shall refer the case to a
medical appeal tribunal for their consideration, and the tribunal
may confirm, reverse or vary the decision in whole or in part
as on an appeal.
110.-( 1) Any decision under this Part of this Act of a
medical board or a medical appeal tribunal may be reviewed at
any time by a medical board if satisfied by fresh evidence that
the decision was given in consequence of the non- disclosure or
misrepresentation by the claimant or any other person of a
material fact (whether the non- disclosure or misrepresentation
was or was not fraudulent) .
( 2) Any assessment of the extent of the disablement resulting
from the relevant loss of faculty may also be reviewed by a
medical board if the board are satisfied that since the making
of the assessment there has been an unforeseen aggravation
of the results of the relevant injury.
( 3) Where in connection with a claim for disablement benefit
made after 25th August 1953 it is decided that the relevant
accident has not resulted in a loss of faculty, the decision-
( a ) may be reviewed under subsection (2) above as if it
were an assessment of the extent of disablement result-
ing from a relevant loss of faculty ; but
( b ) subject to any further decision on appeal or review, shall
be treated as deciding the question whether the relevant
accident has so resulted both for the time about which
the decision was given and for any subsequent time.
( 4 ) For the purposes of subsection (3) above, a final assessment of the extent of the disablement resulting from a loss of
faculty made for a period limited by reference to a definite date
shall be treated as deciding that at that date the relevant accident
has not resulted in a loss of faculty.
(5) An assessment made, confirmed or varied by a medical
appeal tribunal shall not be reviewed under subsection (2)
above without the leave of a medical appeal tribunal, and (not-
withstanding the provisions of Chapter IV of Part II of this Act)
on a review under that subsection the period to be taken into
account by any revised assessment shall only include a period
before the date of the application for the review if and in so
far as regulations so provide .

(2 ) Subsection ( 1) above shall not make any finding of fact
or other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision,
or on which it is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further
decision.
(3) A decision (given under section 107(2) of this Act or
otherwise) that an accident was an industrial accident is to be
taken as determining only that paragraphs ( a), (b) and ( c) of
section 107 ( 5) are satisfied in relation to the accident, and neither
any such decision nor the reference to a medical board or
medical appeal tribunal under section 108 of the disablement
questions in connection with any claim to or award of disablement benefit is to be taken as importing a decision as to the
origin of any injury or disability suffered by the claimant,
whether or not there is an event identifiable as an accident apart
from any injury that may have been received ; but-
(a) a decision that on a particular occasion when there was
no such event a person had an industrial accident by
reason of an injury shall be treated as a decision that,
if the injury was suffered by accident on that occasion,
the accident was an industrial accident ; and
(b) a decision that an accident was an industrial accident
may be given, and a declaration to that effect be made
and recorded in accordance with section 107, without
its having been found that personal injury resulted
from the accident (saving always the discretion under
section 107(3) to refuse to determine the question if
it is unlikely to be necessary for the purposes of a
claim for benefit ) .

in whole or in part from the accident, then for purposes of

finding shall be conclusive that the injury did so result.
The reference in this subsection to a medical board includes
a medical practitioner determining disablement questions on a
reference under section 111 .
( 5 ) Subsections ( 2) to (4 ) above shall apply as regards the

112 from a decision of a medical appeal tribunal given before
the passing of that Act , nor affect any proceedings consequent
on such an appeal from a decision so given ; and accordingly-

claimant was not entitled to industrial death benefit

any purpose as having a family including a child or

(3) Where a question to which this section applies arises with
respect to benefit, the question shall be determined in accord-
ance with the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Act, subject
to any prescribed modifications and adaptations.

in any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the person
or tribunal determining the appeal or review that in the obtain-
ing and receipt of the benefit the beneficiary, and any person
acting for him, has throughout used due care and diligence to
avoid overpayment.
(3) Regulations may make provision as respects matters
arising-
( a ) pending the determination under this Act (whether in
the first instance or on an appeal or reference, and
whether originally or on review ) of any claim for benefit
or of any question affecting any person's right to benefit

more employed earner's employments under the same
employer shall be aggregated and treated as a single
payment of earnings in respect of one such employment ;
and

different persons in respect of different employed earner's
employments shall in prescribed circumstances be aggregated
and treated as a single payment of earnings in respect of one
such employment.
( 2) Where any single payment of earnings is made in respect of
two or more employed earner's employments under different
employers, liability for Class 1 contributions shall be determined by
apportioning the payment to such one or more of the employers as
may be prescribed, and treating a part apportioned to any employer
as a separate payment of earnings by him.
( 3 ) Where earnings are aggregated under sub- paragraph (1 )(b)
above, liability (if any) for the secondary contribution shall be
apportioned, in such manner as may be prescribed, between the
secondary Class 1 contributors concerned.

respect of that payment liability arises for primary and secondary
Class 1 contributions, the secondary contributor shall ( except in pre-
scribed circumstances) , as well as being liable for his own secondary
contribution, be liable in the first instance to pay also the earner's
primary contribution, on behalf of and to the exclusion of the earner ;

contributor on behalf of the earner shall be deemed to be
contributions paid by the earner.

conditions as to a person's age or retirement, shall be
determined as at the beginning of the week or as at the
end of it ;
( c ) for securing that liability is not avoided or reduced by a
person following in the payment of earnings any practice
which is abnormal for the employment in respect of which
the earnings are paid ; and
( d ) without prejudice to the foregoing sub- paragraph, for
enabling the Secretary of State, where he is satisfied as to
the existence of any practice in respect of the payment of
earnings whereby the incidence of Class 1 contributions

payments, to give directions for securing that such con-
tributions are payble as if that practice were not followed .
Power to combine collection of contributions with tax

(1) above there falls to be made in computing his total income for
income tax purposes, or that of a person's wife or, as the case may
be , a person's husband, a deduction in respect of any loss, and the
deduction or part of it falls to be so made from income other than
profits or gains of a trade, profession or vocation, the amount of the

purpose of the charge to Class 4 contributions) for subsequent years
( being deducted as far as may be from those of the immediately

gains of any subsequent year (being deducted or set off as far as may
be from or against the profits or gains of the immediately following
year, whether or not relief can be claimed under this paragraph for
that year, and so far as it cannot be so deducted, from or against
those of the next year, and so on).

persons jointly , the liability of any one of them in respect of Class 4

aggregated with his share of the profits or gains of any other trade,
profession or vocation (so far as immediately derived by him from
carrying it on or exercising it) .
( 2 ) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies, the Class 4 contribu-
tions for which a person is liable in respect of the profits or gains
of the trade or profession carried on jointly (aggregated, where appro-
priate, as mentioned in that sub-paragraph) may either be charged
on him separately or ( to the extent only that the liability arises in
respect of the profits or gains of that partnership ) be the subject of
a joint assessment to contributions made in the partnership name ;
and Chapter VI of Part VI of the Act of 1970 shall apply accord-
ingly, but substituting this paragraph for section 152.
Trustees, etc.
6. In any circumstances in which apart from this paragraph a
person would-
( a ) under section 72 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 be 1970 с. 9.

of Class 4 contributions as it applies in relation to income tax ; but
section 86 of that Act ( interest on amounts overdue) shall not apply.
8. Where an assessment has become final and conclusive for the
purposes of income tax for any year, that assessment shall also be
final and conclusive for the purposes of computing liability for
Class 4 contributions ; and no allowance or adjustment of liability,
on the ground of diminution of income or loss, shall be taken into
account in computing profits or gains chargeable to Class 4 con-
tributions unless that allowance or adjustment has previously been
made on an application under the special provisions of the Income
Tax Acts relating thereto, or falls to be allowed under paragraph 3( 4)
of this Schedule.
9. The provisions of Part V of the Taxes Management Act 1970
( appeals, etc.) shall apply with the necessary modifications in relation
to Class 4 contributions as they apply in relation to income tax ;
but nothing in the Income Tax Acts shall apply with respect to the
determination of any question arising-
( a ) under section 9( 7) of this Act or section 9( 4 ) of the
Social Security ( Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 as to whether
by regulations under that subsection a person is excepted
from liability for Class 4 contributions, or his liability

(b ) under regulations made by virtue of section 9( 9) or 10 of
this Act or section 9(6 ) or 10 of the Social Security

1.- (1) The weekly rate of earnings-related supplement of
unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or a maternity allowance shall
be ascertained by reference to the claimant's reckonable weekly earn-

"
means-

entitlement any reckonable contribution years of the husband, that
is to say years for which his own earnings factor was sufficient for
satisfaction of paragraph ( b) of the second contribution condition ;
and the widow shall be treated as satisfying that paragraph if the
number of years arrived at either under paragraph 2 or under para-
graph 3 below is equal to or exceeds that which is in her case the

means the second of the
conditions for a Category A retirement pension specified

reckonable contribution years , and
c .14

life ;
( b ) if the resultant quotient is not a whole number, rounding
it up to the nearest whole number; and
( c ) adding to the number of years arrived at under sub-
paragraphs (a) and (b) above any number of years following

SCHEDULE 8
ASSESSMENT OF EXTENT OF DISABLEMENT
General provisions as to method of assessment
1. For the purposes of section 57 of this Act, the extent of disablement shall be assessed, by reference to the disabilities incurred by the
claimant as a result of the relevant loss of faculty, in accordance
with the following general principles : -
( a ) save as hereafter provided in this paragraph, the disabilities
to be taken into account shall be all disabilities so incurred
( whether or not involving loss of earning power or additional
expense) to which the claimant may be expected, having
regard to his physical and mental condition at the date of
the assessment, to be subject during the period taken into
account by the assessment as compared with a person of
the same age and sex whose physical and mental condition
is normal ;
SCH. 7
Section 57( 3) .
c . 14
458 Social Security Act 1975
SCH. 8 ( b ) regulations may make provision as to the extent (if any) to
which any disabilities are to be taken into account where
they are disabilities which, though resulting from the rele-
vant loss of faculty, also result , or without the relevant
accident might have been expected to result, from a cause
other than the relevant accident ;
( c ) the assessment shall be made without reference to the par-
ticular circumstances of the claimant other than age, sex,
and physical and mental condition ;
( d ) the disabilities resulting from such loss of faculty as may
be prescribed shall be taken as amounting to 100 per cent.
disablement and other disabilities shall be assessed accord-
ingly .
2. Provision may be made by regulations for further defining the
principles on which the extent of disablement is to be assessed and
such regulations may in particular direct that a prescribed loss of
faculty shall be treated as resulting in a prescribed degree of disablement ; and, in connection with any such direction, nothing in para-
graph 1(c ) above prevents the making of different provision, in the
case of loss of faculty in or affecting hand or arm, for right-handed
and for left- handed persons.
3. Regulations under paragraph 1( d ) or 2 above may include
provision-
( a ) for adjusting or reviewing an assessment made before the
date of the coming into force of those regulations ;
( b ) for any resulting alteration of that assessment to have effect
as from that date ;
so however that no assessment shall be reduced by virtue of this
paragraph.
4. The period to be taken into account by an assessment of the
extent of a claimant's disablement shall be the period ( beginning not
earlier than the end of the injury benefit period, and limited by refer-
ence either to the claimant's life or to a definite date ) during which
the claimant has suffered and may be expected to continue to suffer
from the relevant loss of faculty :
Provided that if on any assessment the condition of the claimant
is not such, having regard to the possibility of changes therein
( whether predictable or not), as to allow of a final assessment being
made up to the end of the said period-
(a) a provisional assessment shall be made, taking into account
such shorter period only as seems reasonable having regard
to his condition and that possibility ; and
( b) on the next assessment the period to be taken into account
shall begin with the end of the period taken into account
by the provisional assessment .
5. An assessment shall state the degree of disablement in the form
of a percentage and shall also specify the period taken into account
thereby and, where that period is limited by reference to a definite
date, whether the assessment is provisional or final ;
c . 14
Social Security Act 1975 459
Provided that-
( a ) the percentage and period shall not be specified more par-
ticularly than is necessary for the purpose of determining
in accordance with section 57 of this Act the claimant's
rights as to disablement benefit ; and
( b ) a percentage between 20 and 100 which is not a multiple of
10 shall be treated-
(i ) if it is a multiple of 5, as being the next higher
percentage which is a multiple of 10 ;
(ii ) if it is not a multiple of 5, as being the nearest
percentage which is a multiple of 10.
Special provision as to entitlement to constant
attendance allowance, etc.
6.- (1) For the purpose of determining whether a person is
entitled-
( a ) to an increase of a disablement pension under section 61
of this Act (constant attendance allowance) ; or
( b ) to a corresponding increase by virtue of section 159( 3)(b) of
this Act or section 7( 3)(b) of the Old Cases Act of any
other benefit,
regulations may provide for the extent of the person's disablement
resulting from the relevant injury or disease to be determined in
such manner as may be provided for by the regulations by reference
to all disabilities to which that person is subject which result either
from the relevant injury or disease or from any other injury or disease
in respect of which there fall to be made to the person payments
of any of the descriptions listed in sub-paragraph ( 2) below.
( 2 ) Those payments are-
( a ) payments by way of disablement pension under Part II of
this Act, Chapter IV or V;
( b) payments such as are referred to in section 159(1) of this
Act;
( c ) payments by way of benefit under section 5 of the Old Cases
Act ;
( d ) payments in such circumstances as may be prescribed by
way of such other benefit as may be prescribed (being
benefit in connection with any hostilities or with service
as a member of Her Majesty's forces or of such other
organisation as may be specified in the regulations).

either by excluding from the right to a gratuity some of the persons
satisfying the conditions for receipt thereof, or by reducing in any
proportions the gratuities payable to those persons, or partly in one
way and partly in the other ; and regulations may make provision
as to the manner in which any of the limits imposed by this paragraph
are to be applied in any prescribed circumstances .

the solvency of the fund constituted under the scheme.
4. No part of the funds required for providing benefits under a
supplementary scheme, or otherwise in connection therewith, shall

ably sufficient to discharge its liabilities ,

the administration of a supplementary scheme, may make an order
under this paragraph for the purpose of consolidating the provisions
of the scheme as for the time being amended, varied or modified.

10.- ( 1 ) Where a person who has received a payment in respect of
any period under a supplementary scheme is subsequently found
to be entitled in respect of that period to a payment by way of

been entitled to the whole or part of the amount of that payment of
benefit, any payment under the scheme in respect of that period may,
at the discretion of the person by whom the payment falls to be
made, be abated by the amount of benefit overpaid or so much
thereof as has not been-
( a) repaid or otherwise recovered, or
( b ) treated as having been paid on account of any other
benefit payable in respect of that period, or on account of
an allowance under the Family Allowances Act so payable.
12. The amount by which a payment to any person is abated

was made.

respect of a tax year gives rise to an earnings factor for

inequalities, or injustice to the general body of employed earners,
or of earners generally, as the case may be.
( 4) For the purposes of this section, employment shall not be
deemed to be employment suitable in the case of any person if
it is either-

would have obtained had he continued to be so
employed ; or
( c ) employment in his usual occupation in any other district
at a rate of remuneration lower, or on conditions less
favourable, than those generally observed in that district
by agreement between associations of employers and of
employees or, failing any such agreement, than those
generally recognised in that district by good employers ;
but, after the lapse of such an interval from the date on which
he becomes unemployed as in the circumstances of the case is
reasonable, employment shall not be deemed to be unsuitable
by reason only that it is employment of a kind other than
employment in his usual occupation if it is employment at a
rate of remuneration not lower, and on conditions not less
favourable, than those generally observed by agreement between
associations of employers and of employees or, failing any
such agreement, than those generally recognised by good
employers.

subsection) be treated as having retired from regular employment
at any time after he has attained pensionable age-

( b) notwithstanding that he is, or intends to be, an earner,
if-
( i) he is or intends to be so only occasionally or
to an inconsiderable extent, or otherwise in circum-
stances not inconsistent with retirement, or
(ii) his earnings can be expected not to exceed, or
only occasionally to exceed, the amount any excess
over which would, under section 30(1) below
( earnings rule), involve a reduction of the weekly
rate of his pension ;
and a person so treated under this subsection shall not cease to
be so treated except in pursuance of an election under section
30(3) below (return to work after retirement) .
( 4) Subject to the following subsection, a person shall not be
treated as having retired from regular employment unless he has

notice of the date of his retirement; and where the date of
Social Security (Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 с. 15 513
retirement specified in the notice falls before the date when

and (subject to section 30( 1) of this Act ( earnings rule) ) be
payable for the pensioner's life .
( 2) A woman who on attaining pensionable age is married
shall not be entitled to a Category A retirement pension unless
either-

attaining that age ) took place on or after the date on
which she attained the age of 55 ; or
(b ) the number of years of her working life ( disregarding the
year in which that marriage took place and any previous
year ) for which her earnings factor was sufficient for
satisfaction by her of paragraph (b) of the second
contribution condition for a Category A retirement
pension specified in Schedule 3, Part I, paragraph 5,
was at least-
( i) one half of the number of complete years
between (exclusive) the year in which that marriage

( 3) Where a woman is a widow at the time when she attains
pensionable age and does not with her own contributions satisfy
the second contribution condition for a Category A retirement
pension specified in Schedule 3, Part I, paragraph 5, then the
contributions of her late husband may, to the extent provided by
Schedule 7 to this Act, be treated as if they were contributions
of her own.
( 4) The weekly rate of a Category A retirement pension shall
be increased by 1/8th per cent. of its rate apart from this
subsection for every 6 days (excluding Sundays) which-
( a) fall in the period beginning with the day on which
the pensioner attained pensionable age and ending with
the day before that of his retirement ; and
( b) are treated by regulations as being, in relation to him
and his pension, days of increment under this
subsection,
but only if the number of such days is at least 48; and a day
may be so treated by reference to the pensioner or some other
person having received, or not having received, benefit of any
prescribed description (whether or not under this Act ) in respect
of that day or a period in which it falls or by reference to any
other circumstances whatsoever.
(5) In the case of a woman entitled to a Category A retirement

number of such days is at least 48 .

and the increase shall be of an amount equal to the weekly
rate of the invalidity allowance ( whether the higher, the middle
or the lower rate ) to which he was entitled on that day.
( 8) In ascertaining-
( a ) for the purposes of subsection (5) above, the rate of the
pension of a woman's former husband ; and
( b ) for the purposes of subsection ( 7) above, the rate of a
pensioner's invalidity allowance,
regard is to be had to the rates in force from time to time as

until after the third day of the period of 156 days (disregarding
Sundays) beginning with the day of the relevant accident nor

if on any day of that period not earlier than the making of the
claim he is not so incapable of work, the fact that he is or may
be so incapable on a subsequent day of the period shall be
disregarded for the purposes of this subsection.
( 5 ) Where the extent of the disablement is assessed for the
period taken into account as amounting to less than 20 per
cent . , disablement benefit shall be a disablement gratuity-
( a) of an amount fixed , in accordance with the length of
the period and the degree of the disablement, by a
prescribed scale, but not in any case exceeding the
amount specified in Schedule 4, Part V, paragraph 2 ;
and
( b) payable, if and in such cases as regulations so provide,

as the result of the relevant loss of faculty the beneficiary is
incapable of work and likely to remain so permanently, be
increased by the appropriate amount specified in Schedule 4,
Part V, paragraph 4.
( 2) An increase of pension under this section is referred to
in this Act as an " unemployability supplement ".
( 3) For the purposes of this section, a person may be treated
as being incapable of work and likely to remain so permanently,
notwithstanding that the loss of faculty is not such as to prevent
him being capable of work, if it is likely to prevent his earnings

( 4 ) An unemployability supplement shall be payable for such
period as may be determined at the time it is granted, but may

paragraph 5.
( 2) In this section " the qualifying date " means, subject to
subsections (3) and ( 4) below, the beginning of the first week

( 3) If the incapacity for work in respect of which unemploy-
ability supplement is payable forms part of a period of interrup-
tion of employment which has continued from a date earlier than
the date fixed under subsection (2) above, the qualifying date
means the first day in that period which is a day of incapacity for
work, or such earlier days as may be prescribed.
( 4) Subject to subsection (3) above, if there have been two
or more periods for which the beneficiary was entitled to un-
employability supplement, the qualifying date shall be, in relation
to unemployability supplement for a day in any one of those
periods, the beginning of the first week of that period.
For the purposes of this subsection a break of more than
13 weeks in entitlement to unemployability supplement means
that the periods before and after the break are different periods,
and a break of 13 weeks or less is to be disregarded.
( 5 ) In this section " period of interruption of employment "
has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of unemployment benefit.

of following his regular occupation ; and
( b ) is incapable of following employment of an equivalent
standard which is suitable in his case,
or if as the result of the relevant loss of faculty the beneficiary
is, and has at all times since the end of the injury benefit period
been, incapable of following that occupation or any such
employment.

( b) the reference to employment of an equivalent standard
is to be taken as not including employment other than
employed earner's employment ;
and in assessing the standard of remuneration in any employment, including a person's regular occupation, regard is to be
had to his reasonable prospects of advancement.
( 3) For the purposes of this section, a person's regular occupa-
tion is to be treated as extending to and including employment
in the capacities to which the persons in that occupation ( or a
class or description of them to which he belonged at the time
of the relevant accident) are in the normal course advanced, and
to which, if he had continued to follow that occupation without
having suffered the relevant loss of faculty, he would have had
at least the normal prospects of advancement ; and so long as
he is, as a result of the relevant loss of faculty, deprived in whole
or in part of those prospects, he is to be treated as incapable
of following that occupation.
( 4 ) Regulations may for the purposes of this section provide
that a person is not to be treated as capable of following an
occupation or employment merely because of his working
thereat during a period of trial or for purposes of rehabilitation
or training or in other prescribed circumstances .
(5 ) An unemployability supplement and an increase of
pension under this section shall not be payable for the same
period.
(6 ) Subject to subsection (5) above, an increase of pension
under this section shall be payable for such period as may be
determined at the time it is granted , but may be renewed from
time to time, and the amount of the increase shall be determined
by reference to the beneficiary's probable standard of remunera-
tion during the period for which it is granted in the employed
earner's employments, if any, which are suitable in his case and
which he is likely to be capable of following as compared with
that in his regular occupation within the meaning of subsection
(1) above.
( 7 ) Regulations may make as respects a disablement gratuity
provision corresponding to that made by this section as respects
a disablement pension, and may include provision for payment
of a pension in lieu of a gratuity.
61.-( 1 ) Where a disablement pension is payable in respect
of an assessment of 100 per cent. , then, if as the result of the
relevant loss of faculty the beneficiary requires constant atten-
dance, the weekly rate of the pension shall be increased by an
amount, not exceeding the appropriate amount specified in
Social Security (Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 с. 15 543
Schedule 4, Part V, paragraph 7, determined in accordance with
PART II
regulations by reference to the extent and nature of the CHAPTER IV
attendance required by the beneficiary.

for such period as may be determined at the time it is granted,
but may be renewed from time to time.

that period, whether before or after the making of the assessment or the award of benefit, during which he receives, as an
in-patient in a hospital or similar institution, medical treatment
for the relevant injury or loss of faculty.
( 2) Where the extent of the disablement is assessed for that
period at less than 20 per cent. , subsection (1 ) above shall not
affect the operation of section 57(5) of this Act; but, in the case
of a disablement pension payable by virtue of this section to a
person awarded a disablement gratuity wholly or partly in
respect of the same period, the weekly rate of the pension (after
allowing for any increase under this Chapter) shall be reduced
by the amount prescribed as being the weekly value of his
gratuity .

qualifying him for such an increase at a weekly rate in
excess of that amount is likely to be permanent,
the weekly rate of the pension shall, in addition to any increase
under section 61, be further increased by the amount specified
in Schedule 4, Part V, paragraph 8.

having been contracted or received afresh .

to benefit in respect of a disease which is a personal injury by
accident within the meaning of Chapter IV, except that a person
shall not be entitled to benefit in respect of a disease as being
an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of any
employment if at the time of the accident the disease is in
relation to him a prescribed disease by virtue of the occupation
in which he is engaged in that employment.

may provide-
( a ) for modifying provisions of this Act relating to injury
benefit and disablement benefit , and the administration
of such benefit ; and

regulations thereunder may in particular include provision-
( a) for presuming any prescribed disease or injury-
(i ) to be due, unless the contrary is proved, to the
nature of a person's employment where he was
employed in any prescribed occupation at the time
when, or within a prescribed period or for a pre-
scribed length of time ( whether continuous or not)
before, he developed the disease or injury,
( ii ) not to be due to the nature of a person's

Provided that an appeal shall not lie against a provisional
assessment of the extent of disablement before the expiration
of 2 years from the date of the first reference of the case to a
medical board, nor where the period taken into account by the
assessment falls wholly within those 2 years .
( 3) If the Department notifies the insurance officer within
the prescribed time that it is of opinion that any decision of
the medical board ought to be considered by a medical appeal
tribunal, the insurance officer shall refer the case to a medical
appeal tribunal for their consideration, and the tribunal may

accident has not resulted in a loss of faculty, the decision-
( a) may be reviewed under subsection ( 2) above as if it
were an assessment of the extent of disablement result-
ing from a relevant loss of faculty ; but

accident has so resulted both for the time about which
the decision was given and for any subsequent time.
( 4) For the purposes of subsection (3) above, a final assessment of the extent of the disablement resulting from a loss of
faculty made for a period limited by reference to a definite date

( 5 ) An assessment made, confirmed or varied by a medical
appeal tribunal shall not be reviewed under subsection ( 2)
above without the leave of a medical appeal tribunal, and ( not-

account by any revised assessment shall only include a period
before the date of the application for the review if and in so
far as regulations so provide.

( 3) A decision ( given under section 107( 2) of this Act or
otherwise) that an accident was an industrial accident is to be
taken as determining only that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of
section 107( 5) are satisfied in relation to the accident, and neither
any such decision nor the reference to a medical board or
medical appeal tribunal under section 108 of the disablement
questions in connection with any claim to or award of disablement benefit is to be taken as importing a decision as to the
origin of any injury or disability suffered by the claimant,
whether or not there is an event identifiable as an accident apart
from any injury that may have been received ; but-
( a) a decision that on a particular occasion when there was
no such event a person had an industrial accident by
reason of an injury shall be treated as a decision that
if the injury was suffered by accident on that occasion,
the accident was an industrial accident ; and
( b) a decision that an accident was an industrial accident
may be given, and a declaration to that effect be made
and recorded in accordance with section 107, without
its having been found that personal injury resulted
from the accident (saving always the discretion under
section 107(3) to refuse to determine the question if
it is unlikely to be necessary for the purposes of a
claim for benefit ) .
(4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2) or (3) above

appeal and review), where for purposes of disablement benefit
in respect of an accident it has been found by a medical board
or medical appeal tribunal, on the determination or last determination of the disablement questions, that an injury resulted
in whole or in part from the accident, then for purposes of
industrial death benefit in respect of that accident (including
benefit on a death occurring before the passing of this Act) the
finding shall be conclusive that the injury did so result.
The reference in this subsection to a medical board includes
a medical practitioner determining disablement questions on a
reference under section 111.

effect to be given in any proceedings to any decision, or to a
reference under section 108 of this Act, whether the decision
was given or reference made or the proceedings were commenced
before or after the passing of the National Insurance Act 1972

( a) any decision given before the passing of that Act that a

( b) to the question whether a person is to be treated for

SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS RELATING TO CONTRIBUTIONS
OF CLASSES 1 , 2 AND 3
Class 1 contributions where earner employed in more than one
employment
1. (1 ) For the purposes of determining whether Class 1 contri-
butions are payable in respect of earnings paid to an earner in a given
week and, if so, the amount of the contributions-
( a ) except as may be provided by regulations, all earnings paid
to him or for his benefit in that week in respect of one or
more employed earner's employments under the same
employer shall be aggregated and treated as a single
payment of earnings in respect of one such employment ;
and
(b) earnings paid to him or for his benefit in that week by
different persons in respect of different employed earner's
employments shall in prescribed circumstances be aggregated
and treated as a single payment of earnings in respect of one
such employment.
( 2) Where any single payment of earnings is made in respect of
two or more employed earner's employments under different
employers' liability for Class 1 contributions shall be determined by
apportioning the payment to such one or more of the employers as
may be prescribed, and treating a part apportioned to any employer
as a separate payment of earnings by him.
( 3) Where earnings are aggregated under sub-paragraph ( 1 )(b)
above, liability (if any ) for the secondary contribution shall be
apportioned, in such manner as may be prescribed, between the
secondary Class 1 contributors concerned.
Earnings not paid at normal intervals
2. Regulations may, for the purposes of Class 1 contributions,
make provision as to the intervals at which payments of earnings are
to be treated as made.
Method of paying Class 1 contributions
3 .- (1 ) Where earnings are paid to an employed earner and in
respect of that payment liability arises for primary and secondary
Class 1 contributions, the secondary contributor shall (except in pre-
scribed circumstances), as well as being liable for his own secondary
contribution, be liable in the first instance to pay also the earner's
primary contribution, on behalf of and to the exclusion of the earner ;
and for the purposes of this Act contributions paid by the secondary
contributor on behalf of the earner shall be deemed to be
contributions paid by the earner.
( 2 ) Notwithstanding any contract to the contrary, no secondary
Class 1 contributor shall be entitled to make, from earnings paid by
Social Security (Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 c .15 613
him any deduction in respect of his own or any other person's
secondary Class 1 contributions, nor otherwise to recover such con-
tributions from any earner to whom he pays earnings ; and a
secondary Class 1 contributor who deducts or attempts to deduct
the whole or any part of such a contribution from earnings shall be
liable on summary conviction to a fine not more than £50.
( 3) A secondary Class 1 contributor shall be entitled, subject to and
in accordance with regulations, to recover from an earner the amount
of any primary Class 1 contribution paid or to be paid by him on
behalf of the earner ; and notwithstanding anything in any enactment,
regulations under this sub-paragraph shall provide for recovery to
be made by deduction from the earner's earnings, and for it not to
be made in any other way.
SCH. 1
General provisions as to Class 1 contributions
4. Regulations may, in relation to Class 1 contributions, make
provision-
( a ) for calculating the amounts payable according to a pre-
scribed scale or otherwise adjusting them so as to avoid
fractional amounts or otherwise facilitate computation ;
( b) for requiring that the liability in respect of a payment made
in a tax week, in so far as the liability depends on any
conditions as to a person's age or retirement, shall be
determined as at the beginning of the week or as at the
end of it ;
( c ) for securing that liability is not avoided or reduced by a
person following in the payment of earnings any practice
which is abnormal for the employment in respect of which
the earnings are paid ; and
(d ) without prejudice to the foregoing sub-paragraph, for
enabling the Department, where it is satisfied as to the
existence of any practice in respect of the payment of
earnings whereby the incidence of Class 1 contributions
is avoided or reduced by means of irregular or unequal
payments, to give directions for securing that such con-
tributions are payable as if that practice were not followed.
Power to combine collection of contributions with tax
5.- (1 ) Regulations made with the concurrence of the Inland
Revenue may-
( a ) provide for Class 1 or Class 2 contributions to be paid,

so to pay any particular contribution.
( 3) The Inland Revenue shall, at such times and in such manner
as the Department of Finance may direct, account to the Department

paragraph.

as may be prescribed, records-

the records for so long as may be prescribed ;
( b) for treating primary Class 1 contributions, when payable
on the primary contributor's behalf by the secondary con-

SCHEDULE 2 TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT 1975 :
LEVY OF CLASS 4 CONTRIBUTIONS WITH INCOME TAX
Interpretation
1. In this Schedule-
(a ) " the Act of 1968 " means the Capital Allowances Act 1968 ;
( b ) " the Act of 1970 " means the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1970 ; and
( c ) " year " means year of assessment within the meaning of
the Act of 1970.
Method of computing profits or gains
2. Subject to the following paragraphs, Class 4 contributions
shall be payable in respect of the full amount of all profits or
gains of any relevant trade, profession or vocation chargeable to
income tax under Case I or II of Schedule D, subject to
( a ) deductions for-
(i) allowances which under section 70( 2) of the Act
of 1968 fall to be made as a deduction in charging
the profits or gains to income tax, and
(ii) any allowance the amount of which falls to be
given by way of discharge or repayment of income tax
under section 71 of that Act,
where in either case the allowance arises from activities of
any relevant trade, profession or vocation ; and
(b) additions for any such charges as under section 70(6) of
that Act fall to be made for purposes of income tax on the
profits or gains .
Reliefs
3. (1 ) For the purposes of computing the amount of profits
or gains in respect of which Class 4 contributions are payable, relief
shall be available under, and in the manner provided by, the
following provisions of the Act of 1970, that is to say-
(a) section 168 (set-off of trade losses against general income),
but only where loss arises from activities the profits or gains
of which would be brought into computation for the pur-
poses of Class 4 contributions ;
( b) section 169 (extension of right of set- off to capital allow-
ances) ;
(c ) section 171 (carry-forward of loss against subsequent profits);
( d ) section 174 (carry-back of terminal losses) .
(2 ) The following relief provisions shall not apply, that is to say-

sideration under annuity contracts and trust schemes) ;
Social Security (Northern Ireland) Act 1975 с. 15 617
( c ) section 75 of the Finance Act 1972 (relief for payment of

( 3) Where in a year beginning on or after 6th April 1975 for which
a person claims and is allowed relief by virtue of sub-paragraph
(1) above there falls to be made in computing his total income for
income tax purposes, or that of a person's wife or, as the case may
be, a person's husband, a deduction in respect of any loss, and the
deduction or part of it falls to be so made from income other than
profits or gains of a trade, profession or vocation, the amount of the
deduction made from the other income shall be treated as reducing
the person's profits or gains ( that is to say the profits or gains of
any relevant trade, profession or vocation as computed for the
purpose of the charge to Class 4 contributions) for subsequent years
( being deducted as far as may be from those of the immediately
following year, whether or not he claims or is entitled to claim
relief under this paragraph for that year, and, so far as it cannot be
so deducted, then from those of the next year, and so on).
( 4 ) Relief shall be allowed, in respect of-
( a ) payments under section 52 or 53 of the Act of 1970 (annuities
and other annual payments, etc.) ; or
( b ) payments under section 75 of the Finance Act 1972 (relief
for payment of interest ), being payments for which relief
from income tax is or can be given,
so far as incurred wholly or exclusively for the purposes of any
relevant trade, profession or vocation, by way of deduction from or
set-off against profits or gains chargeable toClass 4 contributions for
the year in which the payments are made ; and, in the case of any
insufficiency of the profits or gains of that year, the payments shall be
carried forward and deducted from, or set off against , the profits or
gains of any subsequent year ( being deducted or set off as far as may
be from or against the profits or gains of the immediately following
year, whether or not relief can be claimed under this paragraph for
that year, and so far as it cannot be so deducted, from or against
those of the next year, and so on ).
Husband and wife
4.- (1) Chapter IV of Part I of the Act of 1970 shall apply for
the purposes of Class 4 contributions as it applies for those of
income tax ; and an application by a husband or wife for separate
assessment under section 38 of that Act, and an election by them
under section 23 of the Finance Act 1971 (separate taxation of wife's 1971 с. 68.
earnings) shall operate as respects liability for such contributions as it
does for income tax, the wife being liable for Class 4 contributions in
respect of her own profits or gains.
( 2 ) Such an application or election as is referred to in sub-
paragraph (1 ) above shall not be made separately for the purposes
ofClass 4 contributions apart from those of income tax.

( 3) Where section 37 of the Act of 1970 applies and there is no
separate assessment under section 38 of that Act and no election
under section 23 of the Finance Act 1971, the wife's profits and
gains are to be computed, for the purposes of Class 4 contributions,
as if section 37 did not apply, but the contributions shall be assessed
on, and recoverable from, the husband.
Partnerships
5.- ( 1 ) Where a trade or profession is carried on by two or more
persons jointly, the liability of any one of them in respect of Class 4
contributions shall arise in respect of his share of the profits or
gains of that trade or profession (so far as immediately derived by
him from carrying it on ) ; and for this purpose his share shall be
aggregated with his share of the profits or gains of any other trade,
profession or vocation ( so far as immediately derived by him from
carrying it on or exercising it) .
( 2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies, the Class 4 contribu-
tions for which a person is liable in respect of the profits or gains
of the trade or profession carried on jointly (aggregated, where appro-
priate, as mentioned in that sub-paragraph ) may either be charged
on him separately or (to the extent only that the liability arises in
respect of the profits or gains of that partnership) be the subject of
a joint assessment to contributions made in the partnership name ;
and Chapter VI of Part VI of the Act of 1970 shall apply accord-
ingly, but substituting this paragraph for section 152.
Trustees, etc.
6. In any circumstances in which apart from this paragraph a
person would-
( a ) under section 72 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 be
assessable and chargeable to Class 4 contributions as trustee,
guardian, tutor, curator, or committee of an incapacitated
person in respect of the profits or gains of a trade,
profession or vocation ; or
(b ) by virtue of section 114 of the Act of 1970 be assessed
and charged to such contributions in respect of profits or
gains received or receivable by him in the capacity of
trustee,
such contributions shall not be payable either by him or by any
other person .
Other provisions
7. Section 88( 1 ), (4) and (5)(a) and (b) of the Taxes Management
Act 1970 (interest on tax recovered to make good loss due to tax-
payer's fault) shall apply in relation to any amount due in respect
of Class 4 contributions as it applies in relation to income tax ; but
section 86 of that Act (interest on amounts overdue ) shall not apply.
8. Where an assessment has become final and conclusive for the
purposes of income tax for any year, that assessment shall also be
final and conclusive for the purposes of computing liability for
Social Security ( Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 с.15 619
Class 4 contributions ; and no allowance or adjustment of liability,
SCH. 2
on the ground of diminution of income or loss, shall be taken into
account in computing profits or gains chargeable to Class 4 con-
tributions unless that allowance or adjustment has previously been
made on an application under the special provisions of the Income
Tax Acts relating thereto, or falls to be allowed under paragraph 3( 4)
of this Schedule.
9. The provisions of Part V of the Taxes Management Act 1970 1970 c. 9.
( appeals, etc.) shall apply with the necessary modifications in relation
to Class 4 contributions as they apply in relation to income tax ;
but nothing in the Income Tax Acts shall apply with respect to the
determination of any question arising-

regulations under that subsection a person is excepted

this Act or section 9( 6 ) or 10 of the Social Security ( Northern

SCHEDULE 8
ASSESSMENT OF EXTENT OF DISABLEMENT
General provisions as to method of assessment
1. For the purposes of section 57 of this Act, the extent of disablement shall be assessed by reference to the disabilities incurred by the
claimant as a result of the relevant loss of faculty, in accordance
with the following general principles : -
( a ) save as hereafter provided in this paragraph, the disabilities
to be taken into account shall be all disabilities so incurred
( whether or not involving loss of earning power or additional
expense) to which the claimant may be expected, having
regard to his physical and mental condition at the date of
the assessment, to be subject during the period taken into
account by the assessment as compared with a person of
the same age and sex whose physical and mental condition
is normal ;
Social Security (Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 с.15
633
(b ) regulations may make provision as to the extent (if any) to
which any disabilities are to be taken into account where
they are disabilities which, though resulting from the rele-
vant loss of faculty, also result, or without the relevant
accident might have been expected to result, from a cause
other than the relevant accident ;
( c ) the assessment shall be made without reference to the par-
ticular circumstances of the claimant other than age, sex,
and physical and mental condition ;
( d ) the disabilities resulting from such loss of faculty as may
be prescribed shall be taken as amounting to 100 per cent.
disablement and other disabilities shall be assessed accord-
ingly .
2. Provision may be made by regulations for further defining the
principles on which the extent of disablement is to be assessed and
such regulations may in particular direct that a prescribed loss of
faculty shall be treated as resulting in a prescribed degree of disablement ; and, in connection with any such direction, nothing in para-
graph 1( c) above prevents the making of different provision, in the
case of loss of faculty in or affecting hand or arm, for right- handed
and for left-handed persons.
3. Regulations under paragraph 1( d ) or 2 above may include
provision-
(a ) for adjusting or reviewing an assessment made before the
date of the coming into force of those regulations ;
( b) for any resulting alteration of that assessment to have effect
as from that date ;
so however that no assessment shall be reduced by virtue of this
paragraph.
4. The period to be taken into account by an assessment of the
extent of a claimant's disablement shall be the period ( beginning not
earlier than the end of the injury benefit period, and limited by refer-
ence either to the claimant's life or to a definite date ) during which
the claimant has suffered and may be expected to continue to suffer
from the relevant loss of faculty :
Provided that if on any assessment the condition of the claimant
is not such, having regard to the possibility of changes therein
( whether predictable or not ), as to allow of a final assessment being
made up to the end of the said period-
( a ) a provisional assessment shall be made, taking into account
such shorter period only as seems reasonable having regard
to his condition and that possibility ; and
( b) on the next assessment the period to be taken into account
shall begin with the end of the period taken into account
by the provisional assessment.
5. An assessment shall state the degree of disablement in the form
of a percentage and shall also specify the period taken into account
thereby and, where that period is limited by reference to a definite
date, whether the assessment is provisional or final :
SCH. 8
634 с. 15
Social Security ( Northern Ireland ) Act 1975
SCH. 8 Provided that-
( a ) the percentage and period shall not be specified more par-
ticularly than is necessary for the purpose of determining
in accordance with section 57 of this Act the claimant's
rights as to disablement benefit ; and
( b) a percentage between 20 and 100 which is not a multiple of
10 shall be treated-
( i ) if it is a multiple of 5, as being the next higher
percentage which is a multiple of 10 ;
(ii ) if it is not a multiple of 5, as being the nearest
percentage which is a multiple of 10.
Special provision as to entitlement to constant
attendance allowance, etc.
6.- (1) For the purpose of determining whether a person is
entitled-
(a ) to an increase of a disablement pension under section 61
of this Act ( constant attendance allowance) ; or
( b ) to a corresponding increase by virtue of section 150(3 )(b) of
this Act of any other benefit,
regulations may provide for the extent of the person's disablement
resulting from the relevant injury or disease to be determined in
such manner as may be provided for by the regulations by reference to
all disabilities to which that person is subject which result either
from the relevant injury or disease or from any other injury or disease
in respect of which there fall to be made to the person payments
of any of the descriptions listed in sub-paragraph ( 2) below.
( 2 ) Those payments are-
( a ) payments by way of disablement pension under Part II of
this Act, Chapter IV or V ;
( b) payments such as are referred to in section 150(1) of this
Act;
( c) payments in such circumstances as may be prescribed by way
of such other benefit as may be prescribed ( being benefit in
connection with any hostilities or with service as a member
of Her Majesty's forces or of such other organisation as may
be specified in the regulations).

( 3) The limits imposed by sub-paragraph (2 ) above may be applied
either by excluding from the right to a gratuity some of the persons
satisfying the conditions for receipt thereof, or by reducing in any
proportions the gratuities payable to those persons, or partly in one
way and partly in the other ; and regulations may make provision
as to the manner in which any of the limits imposed by this paragraph
are to be applied in any prescribed circumstances.
7 .- (1) A person shall be treated for the purposes of this Schedule
as satisfying the conditions for the receipt of a pension under
section 72, notwithstanding that he is a child, if he may satisfy those

this Act:
Provided that, where an award of benefit in respect of the
deceased's death, based on the fact that that person was or might
become so entitled, has been made in favour of some other person,

of the fund constituted under the scheme.
4. No part of the funds required for providing benefits under a
supplementary scheme, or otherwise in connection therewith, shall
be derived from money appropriated by Measure of the Northern
Ireland Assembly ; but this paragraph does not prevent the making,

may be, sufficient or no more than reasonably sufficient to
discharge its liabilities .
7. An order under paragraph 6 above with respect to any supplementary scheme may replace all or any of the provisions of the
scheme (whether or not previously amended, varied or modified
under that paragraph ) with new provisions consolidating those pro-
visions as they are to have effect with the amendments, variations
or modifications to be made by the order.
8. The Department, after consulting the body charged with the
administration of a supplementary scheme, may make an order under
Social Security (Northern Ireland ) Act 1975 с.15 649

scheme so far as they are superseded by the consolidation or have
otherwise become obsolete or unnecessary.

10.- (1) Where a person who has received a payment in respect of
any period under a supplementary scheme is subsequently found to
be entitled in respect of that period to a payment by way of benefit,

been entitled to the whole or part of the amount of that payment
of benefit , any payment under the scheme in respect of that period
may, at the discretion of the person by whom the payment falls to be
made, be abated by the amount of benefit overpaid or so much
thereof as has not been-
( a ) repaid or otherwise recovered, or
(b ) treated as having been paid on account of any other benefit
payable in respect of that period, or on account of an
allowance under the Family Allowances Act so payable.
12. The amount by which a payment to any person is abated
under paragraph 10 or 11 above on account of some other payment

c. 16 Industrial Injuries and Diseases (Old Cases) Act 1975
( 2 ) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the right to such an
allowance or to a payment on account thereof shall be subject
to such conditions, and the rate of the allowance shall be such,
as may be provided by a scheme under subsection ( 1 ) of this
section.
( 3) The allowances for the payment of which a scheme under
subsection ( 1 ) of this section may make provision shall be-
( a) where the relevant accident happened before 1st January
1924, an allowance (in this section referred to as a
" basic allowance ") in respect of any period such as is
mentioned in subsection (7) below ;
( b) an allowance in respect of any period such as is men-
tioned in subsection (7)(a) (in this section referred to
as a " major incapacity allowance " ) ;
( c ) subject to subsections (4) and (5) below, an allowance
in respect of any period such as is mentioned in sub-
section (7) (b) (in this section referred to as a " lesser
incapacity allowance " ) ;
and a major incapacity allowance or lesser incapacity allowance
in respect of any period shall be payable whether or not a basic
allowance is also payable in respect of that period.
( 4) A lesser incapacity allowance-
( a) shall not be payable to any person in respect of any
period unless there is or may be expected to be (or,
but for the cesser at a time after 1st March 1966 of
that person's entitlement to workmen's compensation,
would or might be expected to have been) payable to
that person in respect of that period either a weekly
payment by way of basic allowance or a weekly payment by way of workmen's compensation which is not
a notional payment ;
( b) except to a person who immediately before 1st March
1966 was receiving an allowance under a scheme made
under the Workmen's Compensation ( Supplementation)
Act 1951 , shall not be payable if the relevant accident
happened after 31st December 1923 and the claimant's
entitlement to workmen's compensation in conse-
quence thereof ceased before 1st March 1966.
( 5) For the purposes of a lesser incapacity allowance, a weekly
payment by way of workmen's compensation shall be treated as
a notional payment if awarded or paid for the purpose of safe-
guarding a potential entitlement to compensation and not related
to any existing loss of earnings ; and a scheme under subsection
(1) above may provide that-
( a) in such circumstances or cases as may be specified in
the scheme : and
Industrial Injuries and Diseases (Old Cases) Act 1975 c. 16 659
( b ) in particular, in cases where weekly payments by way
of such compensation are being paid to a person to
whom such payments were not made, or were made at a
lower rate, during the period of 12 months immediately
preceding such date not earlier than 30th November
1965 as may be specified in the scheme,
a weekly payment by way of such compensation shall be deemed
to be a notional payment unless the contrary is proved.
(6 ) The weekly rate-
(a ) of a basic allowance shall not exceed £2 less the amount
of the recipient's workmen's compensation and, in
respect of a period such as is mentioned in subsection
( 7) (b) below which is a period of partial incapacity
only, shall also not exceed the difference between
2/3rds of the amount representing his weekly loss of
earnings determined in accordance with a scheme
under subsection ( 1) and the amount of his workmen's
compensation ;
( b) of a major incapacity allowance shall be the correspond-
ing disablement pension rate less the amount of the
recipient's workmen's compensation and less the
amount of his basic allowance, if any ;
( c) of a lesser incapacity allowance shall not exceed £7.
( 7) The periods referred to in the foregoing provisions of this
section are-
(a) any period during which the person claiming or receiv-
ing an allowance under this section-
(i) being or having been entitled to his workmen's
compensation in respect of any injury or disease
other than pneumoconiosis or byssinosis, is as a
result of that injury or disease totally incapable of
work and likely to remain so incapable for a
considerable period ; or
(ii ) being or having been entitled to his workmen's
compensation in respect of pneumoconiosis, is

(iii ) is, or but for the determination of his right
would be, entitled to his workmen's compensation
in respect of byssinosis ; or
( iv ) being or having been entitled to his workmen's compensation in respect of two or more
injuries or diseases such as are mentioned in the
three foregoing sub- paragraphs, is as the joint result
of those injuries or diseases totally incapable of
work and likely to remain so incapable for a con-
siderable period ;
( b ) any period which, not being a period such as is men-
tioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection, is a period
of total or partial incapacity for work resulting from
the relevant injury or disease.
3.- (1) For the purposes of section 2 of this Act-
( a ) the expressions " relevant accident " and " relevant
injury or disease " mean the accident in consequence
of which or, as the case may be, the injury or disease
in respect of which, an entitlement to weekly payments
by way of workmen's compensation arose ;
( b) any reference to the happening of an accident shall, in
relation to a case of disease, be construed in the same
way as for the purposes of the Workmen's Com-
pensation Acts ;
( c) a payment-
( i) under the Workmen's Compensation (War
Addition) Acts 1917 and 1919 ; or
(ii ) under the Workmen's Compensation ( Supplementary Allowances) Act 1940 as amended by the
Workmen's Compensation (Temporary Increases)
Act 1943,
shall be treated as a weekly payment by way of workmen's compensation.
( 2 ) For the purposes of section 2( 1), a person shall be deemed
to be or have been entitled to weekly payments by way of
workmen's compensation at any time if he would be or, as the
case may be, have been so entitled at that time if-
( a) the amount of any payment, allowance or benefit
received by him otherwise than by way of workmen's
compensation ; or
(b) where the relevant accident happened before 1st January
1924, either that amount, or the amount he is earning
Industrial Injuries and Diseases (Old Cases ) Act 1975 c. 16 or able to earn in some suitable employment or
business, or both those amounts,
were sufficiently reduced.
( 3) Subject to subsection (7) below, for the purpose of the
reference in section 2( 7 )(b) to a period of total incapacity for
work resulting from the relevant injury or disease, a person who
is or has been unable to obtain employment shall be treated
as subject to such an incapacity if he is treated as being so for
the purposes of his workmen's compensation in respect of the
relevant injury or disease and in such other circumstances as
may be provided by a scheme under section 2.
( 4) Any reference in section 2 or this section to the amount
of a person's workmen's compensation shall (subject to sub-
sections (5) to (7) below) be taken as referring to the amount,
if any, of the weekly payments to which for the time being he
is, or would but for the determination of his right be, entitled
in respect of the relevant injury or disease ;
Provided that-
( a ) where in fixing the amount of those weekly payments
under the provisions relating thereto regard was had
to any payment, allowance or benefit which he might
receive during the period of his incapacity from the
person liable for the compensation, and the amount is
shown to have been reduced in consequence, the
amount of those weekly payments shall for the purposes
of this subsection be taken to be the reduced amount
so fixed with the addition of the amount of the
reduction ; and
( b ) where the amount of those weekly payments has not
been fixed under the said provisions, it shall be fixed
for the purposes of this subsection without regard to
any such payment, allowance or benefit as aforesaid.
( 5) A scheme under section 2 may include provision that, in
such special circumstances or cases and for such purposes as
may be specified in the scheme, any reference in section 2 or
this section to the amount of a person's workmen's compensation
shall be taken as referring to such amount as it may be
determined in manner provided by the scheme ought reasonably
and properly to have been the amount of the weekly payments
referred to in subsection ( 4 ) of this section.
( 6 ) Where a person is, or has at any time after 20th March
1951 been, entitled to payments under the enactments referred
to in subsection ( 1)(c ) (i) or (ii) of this section but ceased before
21st March 1951 to be entitled to any other weekly payments
by way of workmen's compensation in respect of the relevant

c. 16 Industrial Injuries and Diseases (Old Cases ) Act 1975
injury or disease, the amount of his workmen's compensation
shall for the purposes of section 2 be calculated as if he had not
ceased to be entitled to such other payments.
(7 ) A scheme under section 2 may provide for modifying the
operation of subsections (3) to ( 5) of this section in relation to a
person whose workmen's compensation is or was compensation
under a contracting- out scheme in such manner as appears to the
Secretary of State to be proper having regard to the provisions
of the contracting- out scheme.
4.- ( 1 ) The provisions of this section shall have effect with
respect to schemes under section 2 of this Act, and any such
scheme is hereafter in this section referred to as " a scheme. "
(2) A scheme may make such incidental or supplementary
provision as appears to the Secretary of State to be necessary or
expedient for the purposes of section 2 and may vary or revoke
any earlier scheme.
( 3) A scheme shall in particular make provision with respect
to the making of claims for allowances, with respect to the determination of questions arising on or in connection with any such
claim or the payment of allowances, and with respect to any
other matters necessary for the proper administration of any
scheme ; and, subject to any provisions of a scheme for review-
ing decisions, the decision in accordance with a scheme of any
question arising under a scheme shall be final for the purposes of
section 2.
( 4) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) above,
a scheme may make provision-
( a) for the constitution of a board to be charged with the
general administration of any scheme and (subject to
any provisions of a scheme) with the determination of
questions arising under any scheme, and for enabling
the decision of the board on any such question to be
proved in legal proceedings by means of a certificate
or otherwise ;
(b) for enabling any class or description of such questions
to be determined as if they had arisen under the Social .
Security Act ;
( c) for applying, with or without modifications-
( i ) section 87( 1) and (2) of the Social Security Act
( benefit to be inalienable), or
(ii) any regulations under section 81 of that Act
( payment of benefit) , subsections ( 1) , (2) or (4) (b), (c)

( e) for requiring the repayment to the National Insurance
Fund in whole or in part of payments under section 2
subsequently found not to have been due, for the
deduction of any sums so required to be repaid from

the deduction from payments under section 2 of any
sums which may by virtue of any provision of that
Act be recovered by deduction from any payment by

may make such other payments in connection with the admini-
stration of any scheme (including payments on account of
travelling expenses or loss of remunerative time or both to
persons required to undergo medical or other examination or to
attend any hearing for the purpose of determining questions
arising under any such scheme), as he may with the consent of the
Minister for the Civil Service determine.
(6) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a scheme shall not
require a person to submit himself to medical treatment.
(7) A scheme varying an earlier scheme may do so in such a
way as to make allowances payable, or payable at an increased
rate, under the earlier scheme in respect of periods before the
making of the later scheme.
( 8) The power to make a scheme shall be exercisable by
statutory instrument, and a scheme-
(a ) except when made for the purpose only of replacing
provisions of previous schemes with new provisions to
the same effect, or of making provision consequential
on the making of an up-rating order under the Social
Security Act, shall not be made unless a draft of the
scheme has been laid before Parliament and approved
by resolution of each House ;
(b) when made for that purpose only, shall be subject to
annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House
of Parliament.

following consolidation Acts, namely-
amendments
of statute
the Social Security Act 1975,
book.

2.-(1) The provisions of Part I of Schedule 3 to this Act
( which essentially reproduce those of Schedule 26 to the Social
Security Act 1973) shall have effect with respect to the transition
from the operation of the National Insurance Acts 1965 to 1974
and the corresponding Northern Ireland legislation, and the
other enactments repealed by the 1973 Act, to the operation
of-
(a ) Parts II and III of the 1973 Act ; and
( b ) so much of the new Act as replaces by consolidation
provisions of the 1973 Act and the legislation amending
it .
( 2) In connection with the consolidations, and with the repeals
made by this Act, the further transitional provisions and savings
contained in Parts II and III of Schedule 3 to this Act shall
have effect ; but no specific provision in Part III is to be regarded
as prejudicing any general provision elsewhere in this Act.
( 3) Where any provision of Schedule 3 to this Act confers
power to make an Order in Council or regulations, then-
( a ) in so far as the power is exercisable in relation to Great
Britain, or to the United Kingdom as a whole, sections
166 and 167(3) of the Social Security Act 1975 apply
to the power, and to any instrument by means of which
the power is exercised, as if the provision were
contained in that Act ; and

Northern Ireland only, sections 155 and 156( 4) to (6)
of the Social Security ( Northern Ireland) Act 1975
apply to the power, and to any instrument by means
of which the power is exercised, as if the provision
were contained in that Act.

repeals) -
( a) has effect in relation to any enactment repealed by this
Act and re-enacted in any of the consolidations as if
the repeal were made by the consolidation and not by
this Act;
Social Security (Consequential Provisions ) Act 1975 c. 18 685
( b) has the same operation in relation to any repeal by
this Act of an enactment of the Parliament of Northern
Ireland or of the Northern Ireland Assembly (or of
any provision of an Order made under, or having the
same effect as, such an enactment) as it has in relation
to the repeal of an Act of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom (references in section 38 of the 1889 Act to
Acts and enactments being construed accordingly) ;
but nothing in this subsection or in Schedule 3 to this Act affects
the general operation of section 38 of the 1889 Act with regard
to the effect of repeals .

provides for an enactment repealed by that Act or this Act to

or has the effect of it so doing.
( 4) Where any provision of the 1973 Act is re - enacted in the
consolidations with amendments made by the Social Security
Benefits Act 1975, having come into force subject to any modifi-
cation contained in an order under Part I of Schedule 5 to the
said Act of 1975 (commencement etc.), the provision as

entitled to give notice to the Lord Advocate through the
Crown Agent that, if he is not served with an indictment within
14 days of such notice, the prosecutor will be called on to
show cause before the High Court why such accused person
should not be released from prison and, upon a note being
presented to that court setting forth that such notice has been
given and that no indictment has been served within that period
of 14 days, the court shall ordain the prosecutor forthwith to
show cause as aforesaid and, where cause is not shown to the
satisfaction of the court, the court shall grant warrant ordering
such person to be released at the expiry of three days from the
issuing of such order, unless within said three days an indictment
be served upon him.

shall be competent for the prosecutor to raise an indictment
against him, and to obtain from a judge of the jurisdiction to
which he is cited for the second diet, or a judge of the High
Court, a warrant authorising his apprehension and recommitment
to prison to await his trial on such indictment, and in the event

or postponed by the court, the High Court shall, upon the
application of the accused, made by a note addressed to the
court, and after hearing parties, consider the whole circum-
stances of the case, and may in its discretion order the immediate
release of the accused, or may grant warrant ordering him to
be released on a day named in the warrant, unless he shall on
or before such day be remitted to the knowledge of an assize
on indictment, or may decline to pronounce any order.
(3) Where the accused has been incarcerated for 80 days,
and an indictment is served upon him, and he is detained in
custody after expiry of that period of 80 days, then, unless
he is brought to trial and the trial concluded within 110 days
of the date of his being committed till liberated in due course
of law, he shall be forthwith set at liberty and declared for

out in Schedule M to the said Act of 1887 or in an Act of
Adjournal under this Act or as nearly as may be in such form,

further notice, before the High Court for sentence at any
sitting at any place that may be convenient, as the Lord
Advocate may order, and the original warrant of commitment
of such person till liberated in due course of law shall remain
in force until he is brought before the High Court for sentence.
(3) If the accused when brought before the sheriff on such
indictment shall plead not guilty to the charge or plead guilty
only to a part of the charge, and the procurator fiscal shall

against the accused may be according to the other provisions
of this Part of this Act.

COMPOSITION OF JURIES
Summoning of Jurors. Lists of Assize
1. Where a list of assize falls to be returned upon requisition of the
Clerk of Justiciary for a criminal trial in which the second diet is to
be held before the High Court, or falls to be prepared by the clerk
of the district where the second diet is to be held in cases in which
the second diet is to be in a sheriff court, the following provisions
shall apply, namely : -
( a) Where according to the existing law and practice the number
of jurors in any list to be requisitioned by the Clerk of
Justiciary would not exceed 45 in the case of a sitting of
the High Court, the Clerk shall make requisition for a
return of such a number of jurors -not exceeding 90, nor
fewer than 60 where 45 would be requisitioned, and in the
like proportion in other cases as he may deem requisite :
and the sheriffs responsible for making the return shall
return such increased number accordingly, returning as
nearly as possible the names of men and women equally.
(b) Where a number of jurors in excess of the numbers specified
in the preceding subparagraph is to be requisitioned, the
Act of Adjournal or the Lord Commissioner of Justiciary
making the direction for the return shall specify the number
of jurors to be returned ; and of the number so specified,
men and women respectively shall be returned as nearly as
may be equally.
( c ) The provisions of this Act regulating the proportions in
which jurors are to be drawn from the various districts
included in any area for which a return is made by a sheriff,
shall extend to and be observed in the return of women
as well as of men.
( d ) In making his return the sheriff shall group the men and
women respectively returned by him separately, by placing
their names in different columns, or in some other con-
venient manner.
(e ) The clerk charged with the preparation of any list of assize
for a trial of which the second diet is appointed to be
held in a sheriff court, shall, in preparing the same, include
such equal number of women as of men therein as shall
seem to him to be reasonably sufficient to ensure the
attendance of a number of jurors of each sex so as to
provide a jury of that sex only, if such should be required
for the trial of such case or cases .
( f ) Ahusband and wife shall not be returned in any case on the
same list of assize .
Criminal Procedure ( Scotland ) Act 1975 с.21
965
Jury of Men only, or of Women only
2. Any application by a prosecutor or by the accused in terms of
section 100 of this Act for a jury of men only , or of women only,
must be made at the first ( pleading ) diet immediately after the
recording of a plea or pleas of " not guilty " (or where no plea
is taken because of preliminary objections held by the sheriff not
to be frivolous, then immediately after such objections have been
certified by the sheriff under section 105 of this Act or otherwise
disposed of by him ). An entry recording the making of the application
shall be entered on the record copy of the indictment, and signed
by the presiding sheriff .
3. If the second diet is appointed to be held in the sheriff court,
and the judge presiding at the first diet is a sheriff having jurisdiction
to try the case, he may, if so advised, forthwith deal with the
application in the manner in which as hereinafter provided it may be
dealt with by a judge of the court of the second diet, or he may
at his own instance make an order as to the composition of the
jury in respect of sex conform to the said subsection, and in that case
his decision shall be recorded as aforesaid and shall be final ; or he
may reserve consideration for the question to be dealt with as
aftermentioned.
4. In all cases in which such an application shall be made as
hereinbefore provided for, but not dealt with by the judge presiding
at the first diet in terms of the immediately preceding paragraph
after transmission of the record copy of the indictment in terms
of section 103 or 105 of this Act, or on receipt of the telegraphic
intimation of the presentation of an application hereinafter provided
for, the Clerk of Justiciary, or the clerk of the court of the second
diet, shall on the third lawful day after the date of the first
diet submit the report of the proceedings at the first diet to a
Lord Commissioner of Justiciary, or, where the second diet is in
a sheriff court, to a sheriff having jurisdiction to try the case, who
shall deal with it as follows :
( a ) The application shall be disposed of by him summarily,
in court, or in chambers, after such intimation to parties,
enquiry, or hearing (if any ) as to him shall seem just,
by order granting or refusing the same, which order shall
be entered on the record copy of the indictment and signed
by the judge making it , and shall be final : provided,
however, that if any party ( including any person accused in
the same indictment as the applicant ) shall have given
notice, either at the time of making the application or
by letter received by the clerk before the proceedings are
reported to the judge, intimating that he desires to be
heard in support of or against the application, then the
judge shall not proceed to dispose of the application
without giving the party who has so given notice, or his
agent, such intimation and opportunity of being heard
by counsel or by an agent qualified to practise in the
court of the second diet as shall seem to him to be
2H2
SCH. 3
966 c .21
Criminal Procedure (Scotland ) Act 1975
SCH. 3 reasonable in the circumstances. But nothing herein
contained shall confer any right on the accused to be
personally present at the disposal of the application.
( b ) Where owing to defective postal facilities or other cause
the record copy of the indictment appointed under this
Act to be transmitted to the Clerk of Justiciary or the
clerk of the district of the court of the second diet shall
not be in the hands of the said clerk on the morning of
the third lawful day after the first diet, the procedure
hereinbefore directed to be taken before a judge on said
third lawful day may competently proceed upon telegraphic
or telephonic intimation given to the clerk of court of
the proceedings at the first diet bearing upon-
(i ) the plea recorded (if any) ;
( ii ) any application then made for a jury of one sex
only ; and
(iii) any special defence of which notice may have
been given ;
and in that case any order by the judge may, pending
receipt of the record copy of the indictment, be made and
signed by the judge making it on a separate copy of the
indictment or in the books of the court, but shall after-
wards be endorsed on the record copy of the indictment.
( c ) Where having regard to the usual course of post, or to
any exceptional circumstances existing at the time, there
is reason to believe that the record copy of the indictment
may not reach the said clerk by the morning of the third
day after the first diet, it shall be the duty of the clerk
of the court of the first diet to send to the said clerk
for the second diet by telegraph or telephone intimation
in terms of the preceding subparagraph immediately after
the first diet.
5. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, it shall nevertheless
be competent, in any case in which no such application has been
made and disposed of as hereinbefore provided for, for the judge
appointed to preside at the trial of the case, at any stage prior
to the empanelling of the jury to make an order, if in his discretion
he shall think proper so to do, that the jury for trial of the case
shall be composed of men only or of women only, subject always
to the condition that no such order shall be made or take effect unless
there are a sufficient number of men or women ( as the case may be)
on the assize list and present and available to form a jury of the
composition contemplated.
Summoning of Jurors. Citation
6.- (1) If, prior to the date of citation of the jurors for any diet,
an order shall have been made directing that all the cases appointed
for trial at such diet shall be tried by a jury or juries composed of
men only, or of women only, as the case may be, the clerk of court
may reduce the list of assize by striking out the names of the persons
of the other sex from the list of assize, and it shall not be necessary
to cite any of these persons as jurors .
Criminal Procedure (Scotland ) Act 1975 с.21
967
( 2 ) Where no such application as is hereinbefore provided for in
respect of any of the cases appointed for trial at a sitting to which
any list of assize applies has been made at the first diet, the clerk
of court may forthwith reduce the list of assize to such number as
would fall to be cited according to former law and practice. This
he shall do by striking out of the list of assize the names of men
and women, in equal numbers so far as may be, commencing with
the names lowest on the list returned for each district, and only the
assizors whose names remain on the list when so reduced shall be
cited. Provided, however, that if intimation shall have been given
of any special defence which shall appear to the clerk of court to
be of such a nature as to involve enquiry into an issue which may
be suited for trial before a jury of persons of one sex only, he shall,
before proceeding to reduce the list of assize take the instructions of
ajudge competent to try the case.
( 3) Where applications have been made at the first diet as here-
inbefore provided for in any cases appointed for trial at any such
sitting and these applications shall all have been dealt with and
refused prior to the date of citation of the jury, the clerk of court
shall, upon the refusal of said applications, proceed as provided in
the preceding subparagraph.
( 4 ) In all other cases ( subject to the provisions of section 97 of
this Act as to summoning only so many jurors as may be necessary ),
the persons whose names appear on the list of assize shall be
summoned, men and women equally.
( 5 ) Where, owing to change of circumstances, by reason of the
withdrawal of charges or otherwise, after the citation of jurors the
conditions are found to be such that if they had existed prior to the
citation the provisions of subparagraphs (1 ), (2) or (3) of this para-
graph would have been applicable, the clerk of court may thereupon,
notwithstanding citation, proceed to reduce the list of assize as in these
subparagraphs provided for, and to countermand the citations of
those jurors whose names are struck out of the list when reduced.
( 6 ) In this paragraph " clerk of court " shall mean and include the
clerk of court of the second diet, and in cases in which the second
diet is before a sheriff, the sheriff-clerk of the district of the court
of the second diet, and in any case falling to be tried in the High
Court, the Clerk of Justiciary.
( 7 ) Jurors whose names are struck out in reducing the list of assize,
or whose citations are countermanded as above provided for shall
be liable to future service as jurors as if their names had not been
included in the particular list of assize.
Selection of Jurors from the Panel
7.- ( 1 ) Where any case shall be remitted to an assize in which an
order shall have been made as aforesaid that it shall be tried before
a jury composed of men only or of women only, then in balloting
for the jury in that case there shall be placed in the box or glass
used for containing the slips of the names of jurors (as provided in
section 129 of this Act ) the slips containing the names of all the
2H3
SCH. 3
968 с. 21
Criminal Procedure (Scotland ) Act 1975
SCH. 3 jurors who have been summoned ; but in balloting for the jury,
persons whose names shall be drawn who are not of the sex of which
the jury has been directed to be composed, shall be passed over and
not called on to serve on that particular jury ; but the jury shall
consist of the 15 persons of the sex of which it has been ordered
to be composed whose names shall be first drawn and who shall not
be successfully challenged. The slips containing the names of persons
passed over under this provision shall be laid aside and returned to
the ballot glass before another jury is balloted for.
( 2) Where no order such as is mentioned in the preceding sub-
paragraph shall have been made, then the names of all the persons
appearing on the list of assize and summoned to attend shall be
placed in the box or glass irrespective of whether they are men or
women ; and the ballot shall be carried through according to the
method presently in use without distinguishing between men and
women.
Exemptions
8. Any woman summoned to serve on a jury shall be entitled to
apply to be exempted from service on account of pregnancy or other
feminine condition or ailment, subject to the following conditions : -
( a ) Application for exemption shall be made by her to the clerk
of the court in which the second diet is to be called, or in
any case in the High Court to the Clerk of Justiciary, as
soon as may be after receipt of the citation, and unless on
special cause shown not later than the third day before the
date of said diet, and the same shall be supported by
evidence (by a medical certificate or otherwise ) vouching to
the satisfaction of the said clerk that the applicant is or
will be, by reason of pregnancy or some other feminine
condition or ailment, unfit to attend and serve as a juror at
the trial.
( b) Applications duly made as herein provided for shall be dealt
with by the said clerk, who shall have power to dispose of
them after such consultation with a judge competent to try
the case as he may think necessary. Intimation of the
granting or refusal of the application shall be made to the
applicant by the clerk.
( c) Any such juror whose application for exemption is granted
shall as regards liability for future jury service be in the
same position as if she had not been included in the list of
the assize on which she is exempted from serving.
9. Every citation upon a woman to attend as a juror shall contain
a notification as nearly as may be in terms of the appropriate form
contained in an Act of Adjournal under this Act.
10. Nothing herein contained shall prejudice-
( a ) the right of the judge presiding at any trial at any time before
the jury is empanelled to grant exemption in his discretion
to a woman from serving as a juror in any case in respect
of any of the reasons provided for in section 100 of this
Act; nor
Criminal Procedure ( Scotland ) Act 1975 с . 21
969
(b ) any power presently exercised by any clerk of court or the
Clerk of Justiciary, or by any judge presiding at a trial,
to excuse at any time any person summoned to attend as
ajuror from attendance.

( b ) that the probationer needs different treatment, being treatment
of a kind to which he could be required to submit in
pursuance of a probation order ; or
( c ) that the probationer is not susceptible to treatment ; or
( d ) that the probationer does not require further treatment,
or where the practitioner is for any reason unwilling to continue to
treat or direct the treatment of the probationer, he shall make a
report in writing to the effect to the officer supervising the probationer
and the supervising officer shall apply to the court which made the
order or to the appropriate court for the variation or cancellation of
the requirement.
General
5. Where the court which made the order or the appropriate court
proposes to amend a probation order under this Schedule, otherwise
than on the application of the probationer, it shall cite him to appear
before the court ; and the court shall not amend the probation order

requirements of the order as amended :
Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to an order cancelling
a requirement of the probation order or reducing the period of any
requirement, or substituting a new area of a local authority for the
area named in the probation order.

order, the clerk of the court shall forthwith give copies of the dis-
charging or amending order to the officer supervising the probationer ;

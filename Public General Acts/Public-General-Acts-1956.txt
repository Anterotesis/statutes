Part I

New Arrangements as to Administration of Justicb in Lancashire

Establishment of new courts at Liverpool and

Manchester for criminal trials.

1.—(1) There may be set up in accordance with this section two new courts for the purpose of exercising such jurisdiction as is commonly conferred on courts of assize by the commissions of oyer and terminer and of gaol delivery, namely—

(a) a court to act in and for the West Derby division of Lancashire and to be known as “ the Crown Court at Liverpool ”; and

(b) a court to act in and for the Salford division of Lancashire, and to be known as “ the Crown Court at Manchester

(2) Each of the courts shall be set up by Her Majesty’s commissions of oyer and terminer and gaol delivery for the court’s division, addressed to the judges for the time being of the High Court and to the recorders for the time being of Liverpool and Manchester, and assigning to them the duty to exercise jurisdiction under the commissions as judges of the court.

Ch. 34

161

(3) In addition to those judges and recorders, the commissions Part I may name as judges of the court any persons who may be named —cont. as commissioners in commissions of assize.

(4) The court so set up shall be a superior court of record, and shall have a seal; and, subject to the provisions of this Act, references in any enactment to a court of assize and to assizes (including references in this Act and in enactments passed after this Act) shall respectively include the court and its sessions, except in so far as the context otherwise requires.

(5) Unless otherwise directed by the Lord Chancellor, sessions of the court shall be held at least eleven times in every year, at times to be fixed by the court or a judge thereof.

(6) The court may sit in more than one division simultaneously, and the jurisdiction of the court may be exercised by any one or more of the judges of the court.

(7) Any judge of the court when acting as such shall have the same powers as a judge of the High Court has when so acting (including the power to direct or consent to the preferment of a bill of indictment before the court); and sections eight and fourteen of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948 (which relate to the powers exercisable in relation to a person convicted after a probation order or order of conditional discharge has been made in his case, and in relation to fines and forfeited recognizances), shall apply to the court as they apply to the Central Criminal Court and not as they apply to other courts of assize.

(8) Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this subsection, a judge of the court may, in any case where he thinks fit, make such order postponing a trial before the court as appears necessary in order to enable the trial to take place before a judge of the High Court, and any such order may include such provision as the judge making it thinks fit as to admitting the accused person to ball, as to the enlargement of recognizances, and otherwise.

(9) A judge of the court shall, when engaged in the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction under this section, be deemed to constitute a court of the High Court.

(10) Commissions under this section shall be issued in the same manner as commissions of assize, and may be revoked by Order in Council, and, if not so revoked, shall continue in force until superseded by new commissions under this section.

2.—(1) The following provisions of this section shall have Effect of effect so long as commissions under the foregoing section are in establishment

1956

Part I (2) There shall be no general commission of assize for the

—cont. dispatch of criminal business for the West Derby division or

for the Salford division, or for any area wholly or partly comprised in either of those divisions; but (subject to any Order in Council under this Act or under section seventy-two of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925) there shall be general commissions of assize for the Northern division of Lancashire for the dispatch of criminal business at Lancaster instead of commissions for the whole county.

(3) The courts of quarter sessions for Liverpool and Manchester shall not sit; but for the purposes of the enactments relating to the committal of persons for trial at assizes or quarter sessions and to matters connected therewith the Crown Court at Liverpool shall be regarded not only as a court of assize for the West Derby division but also as a court of quarter sessions for Liverpool, and the Crown Court at Manchester not only as a court of assize for the Salford division but also as a court of quarter sessions for Manchester.

Liverpool and Manchester shall continue to be treated as boroughs having a separate court of quarter sessions, notwithstanding that the sittings of the court are suspended under this subsection.

(4) (a) Jurors to serve at the Crown Court at Liverpool or at Manchester or at any other court of assize in Lancashire (not being a court held by virtue of any special commission of assize) shall be summoned by the sheriff or other officer charged with the return of jurors in pursuance of precepts issued by die clerk of assize; and, where it appears that civil and criminal assizes will be in progress at any place at the same time (whether or not they are to begin together), a single precept may be issued for those assizes, directing that jurors be summoned for the trial of all issues, whether civU or criminal, which may come on for trial at those assizes.

(b) The sheriff or other officer summoning jurors to serve as aforesaid shall have regard to the convenience of the persons summoned, as to their respective places of residence, and in the case of jurors to serve at either of the Crown Courts shall have regard also to the fact that the court deals with cases which, but for this Act, would be dealt with by the court of quarter sessions for Liverpool or Manchester, as die case may be.

(c) For the purposes of the Juries Act, 1949, the Crown Court and any other court of assize at Liverpool or Manchester shall be treated as a court of assize held for the city; and, where by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection a single precept is issued for civil and criminal assizes at the same place in Lancashire, section five of the Juries Act, 1949 (which provides for

1956

Criminal Justice Administration

Act, 1956

Ch. 34

163

the reimbursement to local authorities of payments attributable to civil business at assizes), shall apply as if the business of those assizes were the business of a single court of assize.

(5) Where it appears to Her Majesty that, by reason of the small number of prisoners or otherwise, it is usually inexpedient to hold separate winter or spring assizes in a county or division adjoining the division for which the Crown Court at Liverpool or the Crown Court at Manchester acts. Her Majesty may by Order in Council direct that those assizes shall not be held in that county or division, but that at such sessions of that court as may be specified in the Order the jurisdiction of that court under section one of this Act shall extend to that county or division as if it formed part of the division for which die court acts; and the Order in Council may include any such supplementary provisions as may be included in an Order in Council under section seventy-two of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, uniting one county to another for the purpose of winter or spring assizes.

Subsections (3) to (5) of the said section seventy-two (which relate to revocation, publication and other incidental matters) shall apply to an Order in Council under this subsection as they apply to an Order in Council under that section.

(6) The West Derby division, the Salford division and the Northern division shall, in relation to offences tried in the Crown Court at Liverpool or Manchester or any court of assize in the Northern division, be deemed to be separate counties for the purposes of sections twelve and thirteen of the Criminal Law Act, 1826 (which relate to offences committed on boundaries of counties or during a journey); and, subject to the next following subsection, each of those courts and any judge thereof shall have, in relation to the division for which the court acts, the same jurisdiction and powers as if the court were a court for the whole of a county.

(7) For the purposes of section three of the Assizes Relief Act, 1889 (which enables proceedings to be taken in a court of assize for the discharge or trial of a person committed to gaol for trial at any quarter sessions, but not tried at those sessions), the jurisdiction of a court of assize for the Northern division shall extend to the whole of Lancashire, and references in that section to a court of oyer and terminer or gaol delivery shall not include the Crown Court at Liverpool or Manchester. 8

(8) In the case of Liverpool and Manchester section two hundred and nine of the Lunacy Act, 1890 (which requires special sessions in a borough to be held for the purposes of Part VIII of that Act at the same time as the quarter sessions), shall not apply, but special sessions for the purposes of that Part of that Act shall be held once in every quarter of a year.

Dark Smoke

Prohibition of 1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, dark smoke shall

dark smoke not be emitted from a chimney of any building, and if, on any from chimneys. (jayf dark smoke is so emitted, the occupier of the building shall be guilty of an offence.

(2) Emissions of smoke from any chimney lasting for not longer than such periods as may be specified by the Minister by regulations shall, in such classes of case and subject to such limitations as may be so specified, be left out of account for the purposes of this section.

(3) In any proceedings for an offence under this section, it shall be a defence to prove either—

(a) that the contravention complained of was solely due to the lighting up of a furnace which was cold and that all practicable steps had been taken to prevent or minimise the emission of dark smoke; or (b) that the contravention complained of was solely due to some failure of a furnace or of apparatus used in connection with a furnace, that that failure could not reasonably have been foreseen, or, if foreseen, could not reasonably have been provided against, and that the contravention could not reasonably have been prevented by action taken after the failure occurred; or

(c) that the contravention complained of was solely due to the use of unsuitable fuel, that suitable fuel was

1956

Clean Air Act, 1956

Ch. 52

381

unobtainable, that the least unsuitable fuel which was available was used and that all practicable steps had been taken to prevent or minimise the emission of dark smoke as the result of the use thereof; or id) that the contravention complained of was due to the combination of two or more of the causes specified in paragraphs ( a)to (c) of this subsection and that the other conditions specified in those paragraphs are satisfied in relation to those causes respectively.

(4) This section shall apply in relation to a chimney serving the furnace of any boiler or industrial plant (being a boiler or plant attached to a building or for the time being fixed to or installed on any land) as it applies in relation to a chimney of a building:

Provided that in relation to any such chimney as aforesaid which is not a chimney of a building, the reference in this section to the occupier of the building shall be construed as a reference to the person having possession of the boiler or plant.

2.—(1) In any proceedings for an offence under section one Temporary of this Act for any contravention of that section occurring not more than seven years from the passing of this Act, being a 00

contravention occurring in relation to the chimney of a building, it shall be a defence to prove—

(a) that the contravention was due to the nature of the build-

ing or its equipment and was not due to any failure properly to maintain the building or properly to maintain and use the equipment of the building; and

(b) that it had not been practicable to alter or equip the

building so as to enable it to be used or fully used for the purpose for which it was intended without the likelihood of contraventions of the said section one.

(2) If, at any time before the expiration of the said seven years, the local authority are satisfied, on the application of any person interested in any building, that it has not been practicable to alter or equip the building so as to enable it to be used or fully used as aforesaid, the local authority may, if they think fit, issue from time to time a certificate to that effect, and while such a certificate is in force, it shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated for the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section.

(3) A certificate under subsection (2) of this section shall be in force for one year from the date of the issue thereof or for such shorter period as may be specified therein, so, however that a certificate issued after the expiration of six, but before the expiration of seven, years from the passing of this Act shall not remain in force after the expiration of the said seven years.

(iii) in a case where such approved external service is partly of the kind described in the said paragraph ( )and partly of the kind described in the said paragraph (b), the same proportion of the said excess as the teacher’s recognised or contributory service bears to the aggregate of that service and his service of the kind described in the said paragraph (a).

2. In relation to an additional allowance payable to a teacher whose aggregate service falls partly before and partly after the commencement of this Act, the foregoing paragraph of this Schedule shall have effect as if for the reference to forty years there were substituted a reference to the period which, if the whole of the teacher’s aggregate service were contributory service, would produce the highest additional allowance authorised, in respect of his service before attaining the age of sixty years, by subsection (2) of section five of this Act.

(1) of section two hundred and seventy-one of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which defines an industrial building or structure);

(7) Where a person incurs capital expenditure for the purposes of a trade or part of a trade not yet carried on by him but with a view to carrying it on, or incurs capital expenditure in connection with a dock or other premises not yet occupied by him for the purposes of a qualifying trade but with a view to so occupying the dock or premises, the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply as if he had been carrying on the trade or part of the trade or occupying the dock or premises for the purposes of the qualifying trade, as the case may be, at the time when the expenditure was incurred.

— to the widening of an inland waterway in the interests of

navigation as it applies to dredging.

(11) No allowance shall be made by virtue of this section in respect of any expenditure if for the same or any previous or subsequent year of assessment an allowance is or can be made in respect of it under any of the provisions of Chapter I or II of Part X of the Income Tax Act, 1952.

18.—(1) The Income Tax Acts shall have effect and be deemed always to have had effect as if in subsection (2) of section seven of the Income Tax Act 1945 (which provides that the allowances under section fifteen of the Finance Act 1937, in respect of mills, factories and other similar premises shall cease in all cases after the year 1955-56), for the words “ the next nine years of assessment ” there had in both places been substituted the words “ the next twelve years of assessment ”.

(2) The reference in this section to section seven of the Income Tax Act 1945, shall be construed as referring to that section as set out in Part I of the Eleventh Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1952.

Ch. 54

475

(b) in ascertaining for the purposes of Part XIX of the Income Tax Act, 1952, the residuary income of his estate for any year of assessment,

that residuary income shall be treated as reduced, by an amount calculated in accordance with the following provisions of this section, in ascertaining the liability to surtax of any person having an absolute interest in the residue of that or any other estate or part thereof.

(2) The amount of the reduction shall be an amount which, after deduction of income tax at the standard rate for the said year of assessment, would equal the amount of estate duty payable in respect of so much of the income taken into account as mentioned in the foregoing subsection as exceeds any liabilities so taken into account.

(3) The amount of estate duty payable in respect of any income taken into account in estimating the principal value of an estate shall be taken to be an amount which bears the same proportion to the total duty payable in respect of that estate as the amount of the income bears to the principal value of that estate, subject however to any correction falling to be made under the next following subsection.

(4) The said proportion shall be corrected by adding to or subtracting from the amount of the total duty such amounts (if any) as may be necessary to adjust the amount of the total duty to what it would have been if—

(a) duty on all the property taken into account in estimating the principal value of the estate had been payable at the highest rate at which duty on any of that property was payable; and

(b) no duty had been payable on any property not so taken into account;

and, where the estate includes an interest in expectancy and duty in respect of that interest is not paid with the duty in respect of the rest of the estate, by excluding from the total duty the duty payable in respect of the interest when it falls into possession, and from the principal value of the estate the value of that interest.

(5) The amount of any income accruing before the death of any person and taken into account in estimating the principal value of an estate shall (whether or not the income was valued separately or its amount known at the date of the death) be taken to be the actual amount so accruing less income tax at the standard rate for the year of assessment in which the death occurred.

(4) So much of subsection (1) of this section as provides that an annuity shall be treated, in whole or in part, as earned income of the annuitant shall apply only in relation to the annuitant to whom the annuity is made payable by the terms of the contract.

(5) The foregoing provisions of this section shall apply in relation to a contribution under a trust scheme approved by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue as they apply in relation to a premium under an annuity contract so approved, with the modification that, for the condition as to the person with whom the contract is made, there shall be substituted a condition that the scheme—

(a) is established under the law of any part of, and adminis-

tered in, the United Kingdom; and

(b) is established for the benefit of individuals engaged in or connected with a particular occupation (or one or other of a group of occupations), and for the purpose of providing retirement annuities for them, with or without subsidiary benefits for their families or dependants; and

of any scheme so approved, withdraw that approval on such grounds and from such date as may be specified in the notice.

(7) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, a married woman's relevant earnings shall not be treated as her husband's relevant earnings, notwithstanding that her income chargeable to tax is treated as his income.

(8) Subject to the last foregoing subsection, “ relevant earnings ” in relation to any individual means for the purposes of this Part of this Act any income of his chargeable to tax for the year of assessment in question, being either—

(a) income arising in respect of remuneration from an office

or employment of profit held by him other than a pensionable office or employment; or

(b) income from any property which is attached to or forms

part of the emoluments of any such office or employment of profit held by him; or

(c) income which is chargeable under Schedule B or

Schedule D and is immediately derived by him from the carrying on or exercise by him of his trade, profession or vocation either as an individual or, in the case of a partnership, as a partner personally acting therein; or

(d) income treated as earned income by virtue of paragraph

() (which relates to patent rights) of subsection (2) of section five hundred and twenty-five of the Income Tax Act, 1952:

but does not include any remuneration as director of an investment company (as defined in section two hundred and fifty-seven of the Income Tax Act, 1952) of which he is a controlling director (as defined in subsection (1) of section three hundred and ninety of that Act).

(9) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, an office or employment is a pensionable office or employment if, and only if, service in it is service to which a sponsored superannuation scheme relates (not being a scheme under which the benefits provided in respect of that service are limited to a lump sum payable on the termination of the service through death or disability before the age of seventy or some lower age); but references to a pensionable office or employment apply whether or not the duties are performed wholly or partly in the United Kingdom or the holder is chargeable to tax in respect of it.

Service in an office or employment shall not for the purposes of this definition be treated as service to which a sponsored superannuation scheme relates by reason only of the fact that

Nature and amount of relief for qualifying premiums

the holder of the office or employment might (though he does not) participate in the scheme by exercising or refraining from exercising an option open to him by virtue of that service.

(10) In the last foregoing subsection “ a sponsored superannuation scheme ” means a scheme or arrangement relating to service in particular offices or employments and having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving therein against future retirement or partial retirement, against future termination of service through death or disability, or against similar matters, being a scheme or arrangement under which any part of the cost of the provision so made is or has been borne otherwise than by those persons by reason of their service (whether it is the cost or part of the cost of the benefits provided, or of paying premiums or other sums in order to provide those benefits, or of administering or instituting the scheme or arrangement); but for this purpose a person shall be treated as bearing by reason of his service the cost of any payment made or agreed to be made in respect of his service, if that payment or the agreement to make it is treated under the Income Tax Acts as increasing his income, or would be so treated if he were chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule E in respect of his emoluments from that service.

(11) Nothing in sections four and six of the Policies of Assurance Act, 1867 (which put on assurance companies certain obligations in relation to notices of assignment of policies of life assurance), shall be taken to apply to any contract approved under this section.

23.—(1) Where relief is to be given under this section in respect of any qualifying premium paid by an individual, the amount of that premium shall be deducted from or set off against his relevant earnings for the year of assessment in which the premium is paid:

Provided that the amount which may be deducted or set off in any year of assessment (whether in respect of one or more qualifying premiums) shall not be more than the sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds, nor more than one-

tenth of his net relevant earnings for that year, and, where the condition in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of the last foregoing section is satisfied as respects part only of that year, then for the said sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds there shall be substituted the sum which bears to it the same proportion as that part bears to the whole year (but so that in the case of individuals holding a pensionable office or employment, and of individuals bom in or before the year nineteen hundred and fifteen, this proviso shall have effect subject to the provisions of the Third Schedule to this Act).

1956

(2) If in any year of assessment a reduction or a greater reduction would be made under this section in die relevant earnings of an individual but for an insufficiency of net relevant earnings, the amount of the reduction which would be made but for that insufficiency, less the amount of any reduction which is made in that year, shall be carried forward to the next following year, and shall be treated for the purposes of relief under this section as the amount of a qualifying premium paid in that following year, and so on for succeeding years (if necessary).

(3) Where, on the making of an assessment for any year on an individual’s relevant earnings or on the profits or gains of a partnership from which he derives relevant earnings, notice of assessment is given after or within six months before the end of the year of assessment, and the individual pays a qualifying premium after the end of that year but within the period beginning with the date of the notice and ending six months after the date on which the assessment becomes final and conclusive, he may within that period elect that for the purposes of relief under this section the premium shall be treated as paid in that year and not in the year in which it is paid, and where he does so elect, any relief given in consequence of the election for the earlier year shall be given by repayment of tax:

Provided that where either—

(a) the amount of that premium, together with any quali-

fying premiums paid by him in the year to which the assessment relates (or treated as so paid by virtue of any previous election under this subsection), exceeds the maximum amount of the reduction which may be made under this section in his relevant earnings for that year; or

(b) the amount of that premium itself exceeds the increase

in that maximum amount which is due to taking into account the income on which the assessment is made;

then the election shall have no effect as respects the excess.

(4) For the purposes of relief under this section, an individual’s relevant earnings are those earnings before giving effect to allowances falling to be made under Part X or XI of the Income Tax Act, 1952, other than deductions allowable in computing profits or gains (but after taking into account the amounts on which charges fall , to be so made), and references to income in the following provisions of this section (other than references to total income) shall be construed similarly.

(5) Subject to the following provisions of this section, “ne* relevant earnings” means, in relation to any individual, the amount of his relevant earnings for the year of assessment in question, less the amount of any deductions falling to be made

(a) deductions in respect of payments made by him; or

(b) deductions in respect of losses or of allowances under

Part X or XI of the Income Tax Act, 1952, being losses or allowances arising from activities profits or gains of which would be included in computing relevant earnings of the individual or of the individual's wife or husband for the year 1956-57 or a later year of assessment.

(6) Where, in any year of assessment for which an individual claims and is allowed relief under this section, there falls to be made in computing the total income of the individual or that of the individual's wife or husband a deduction in respect of any such loss or allowance of the individual as is mentioned in paragraph (b) of the last foregoing subsection, and the deduction or part of it falls to be so made from income other than relevant earnings, the amount of the deduction made from that other income shall be treated as reducing the individual's net relevant earnings for subsequent years of assessment (being deducted as far as may be from those of the immediately following year, whether or not he claims or is entitled to claim relief under this section for that year, and so far as it cannot be so deducted, then from those of the next year, and so on).

(7) Where an individual's income for any year of assessment consists partly of relevant earnings and partly of other income, then as far as may be any deductions which fall to be made in computing his total income, and which may be treated in whole or in part either as made from relevant earnings or as made from other income, shall be treated for the purposes of this section as being made from those relevant earnings in so far as they are deductions in respect of any such loss or allowance as is mentioned in paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of this section, and otherwise as being made from that other income.

(8) An individual's net relevant earnings for any year of assessment are to be computed without regard to any relief which falls to be given for that year under this section either to the individual or to the individual's wife or husband.

(9) An individual's relevant earnings, in the case of partnership profits, shall be taken to be his share of the partnership income, estimated in accordance with the Income Tax Acts, but the amount to be included in respect of those earnings in arriving at his net relevant earnings shall be his share of that income after making therefrom all such deductions (if any) in respect of payments made by the partnership, or in respect of allowances , falling to be made to the partnership under Part X or XI of the

(10) Where relief under this section for any year of assessment is claimed and allowed (whether or not relief then falls to be given for that year), and afterwards there is made any additional assessment, alteration of an assessment, or other adjustment of the claimant's liability to tax, there shall be made also such adjustments, if any, as are consequential thereon in the relief allowed or given under this section for that or any subsequent year of assessment.

(11) Where relief under this section is claimed and allowed for any year of assessment in respect of any payment, relief shall not be given in respect of it under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts for the same or a later year of assessment nor (in the case of a payment under an annuity contract) in respect of any other premium or consideration for an annuity under the same contract; and references in the Income Tax Acts to relief in respect of life assurance premiums shall not be taken to include relief under this section.

(12) The allowances mentioned in paragraph (b) of subsection

(5) or in subsection (9) of this section shall not be treated as including amounts carried forward from a year of assessment earlier than the year 1956-57.

(13) Without prejudice to subsection (3) of this section, a person who pays a qualifying premium in the year 1957-58 may elect that it or part of it shall be treated for the purposes of this and the last foregoing section as a qualifying premium paid in the year 1956-57, and shall be treated (subject to subsection

(4) Where an assurance company not having its head office in the United Kingdom carries on life assurance business through any branch or agency in the United Kingdom, then any charge to tax under subsection (2) of this section for any year of assessment on the profits arising to the company from pension annuity business, or from general annuity business,—

(a) shall extend only to a part of those profits bearing to

the total amount thereof the same proportion as, under section four hundred and thirty of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which relates to the taxation of the income from investments of the company's life assurance fund, excluding the annuity fund), the part of that income charged to tax under Case III of Schedule D bears in that year to the total amount of that income; and

(b) shall not be treated as a charge to tax in respect of

(2) Subject as aforesaid, where, for the chargeable accounting period in which a reduction falls to be made, there is a distribution charge (or would be but for the reduction), then in relation to that reduction the expression “ the amount corresponding to the increase * in the said subsection (3) shall mean—

(a) if the tax originally ascribable to the loan was not greater

than the distribution charge which would be made but for the reduction, such amount as will diminish the distribution charge by the amount of that tax; and

(b) if the tax originally ascribable to the loan was greater than the distribution charge which would be made as aforesaid, an amount equal to the amount on which the distribution charge would be so made plus the amount tax on which, at the current rate of reliefs for non-distribution, would be equal to the difference between the tax originally ascribable to the loan and the distribution charge.

(3) Where, by reason of a carry-forward under the said subsection

(3), a reduction in respect of a repayment falls to be made wholly or partly in a chargeable accounting period after that in which the repayment was made, the reduction in the later chargeable accounting period (and any further carry-forward therefrom) shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing sub-paragraphs as if the repayment or, as the case may be, the part giving rise to the carry-forward to that period had been made in that period.

(4) This paragraph shall apply in relation to loans made before the end of the year nineteen hundred and fifty-one with the substitution for references to the tax originally ascribable to the loan of references to half the amount of that tax.

(5) In this paragraph—

“the current rate of reliefs for non-distribution*' means, in relation to any reduction, the rate at which a relief for non-distribution would be given for the chargeable accounting period in which the reduction falls to be made; and

“ the tax originally ascribable to the loan *' means the amount by which the tax for any chargeable accounting period has been increased by reason of the loan being treated as part of the gross relevant distributions to proprietors for that period.

(a) in determining the gross relevant distributions to proprietors for the chargeable accounting period beginning at the end of March, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, or for that in which they are paid, whichever is the later, be included as a distribution for that chargeable accounting period;

(b) in determining those for any chargeable accounting period other than the one last mentioned, be left out of account.

(2) The governing total for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph is, in relation to any accounting period of a body corporate, society or other body, the total of the dividends assignable to the immediately preceding accounting period thereof:

Provided that—

(a) where the amount of any class of paid-up share capital on

which dividends assignable to the preceding accounting period are paid is less than the amount of that class of paid-up share capital on which dividends assignable to the succeeding accounting period are paid, then (subject to sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph) the dividends on that class of capital assignable to the said preceding period shall, if the person carrying on the trade or business so elects, be treated for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as correspondingly increased; and

(b) where the preceding accounting period is longer or shorter than the succeeding accounting period, the total dividends assignable to the said preceding period shall be treated for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as correspondingly reduced or increased.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of the proviso to sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, any increase in the amount of any class of paid-up share capital on which dividends are paid shall be disregarded in so far as it represents shares which were previously unissued or not paid up but which have since been issued, or been treated as paid up, wholly or partly in consideration of the retention by the body or society, by way of set-off or otherwise, of sums distributable by way of dividend.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, the dividends assignable to any accounting period are those expressed to be paid in respect of that period or any part thereof:

Provided that dividends declared after the sixteenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, which either—

(< a) are not expressed to be paid in respect of any period; or

(5) In this paragraph “ dividend ” includes an interim dividend, and a dividend shall be treated as being declared—

(a) in the case of a dividend declared by a body or society in general meeting, at the date of the declaration;

(b) in any other case, at the date on which it is paid:

Provided that—

(i) where a dividend is declared in general meeting in accordance

with a recommendation of the directors and the directors' decision to make that recommendation was, with the authority of the directors, publicly announced at an earlier date, the dividend shall, for the purposes of this paragraph, be treated as declared at that earlier date; and

(ii) where a dividend not so declared is paid in accordance with a decision of the directors and that decision was, with their authority, publicly announced at an earlier date, the dividend shall, if the body or society so elects, for the purposes of this paragraph be treated as declared at that earlier date.

6.—(1) Where the dividends of a body corporate, unincorporated society or other body which are assignable to any accounting period beginning before the end of October, nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and were declared before the seventeenth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-six,—

(a) exceed the governing total for that accounting period; and

(b) include dividends declared after the twenty-fifth day of the said month of October, and paid after the beginning of the said month of April;

then, notwithstanding anything in paragraph 4 of the Second Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1955, the dividends so declared and paid (if the body or society so elects) shall to the extent of the excess—

(i) in determining the gross relevant distributions to proprietors

for the chargeable accounting period ending at the end of March, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, be included as a distribution for that chargeable accounting period; and

(ii) in determining those for any other chargeable accounting period, be left out of account.

(2) Sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) of the said paragraph 4 (which define “the governing total” and other expressions) shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph as they apply for the purposes of that.

public as purchasers, consumers or users of any goods other specific and substantial benefits or advantages enjoyed or likely to be enjoyed by them as such, whether by virtue of the restriction itself or of any arrangements or operations resulting therefrom;

measures taken by any one person not party to the agreement with a view to preventing or restricting competition in or in relation to the trade or business in which the persons party thereto are engaged;

(e) that, having regard to the conditions actually obtaining

or reasonably foreseen at the time of the application, the removal of the restriction would be likely to have a serious and persistent adverse effect on the general level of unemployment in an area, or in areas taken together, in which a substantial proportion of the trade or industry to which the agreement relates is situated; (/) that, having regard to the conditions actually obtaining or reasonably foreseen at the time of the application, the removal of the restriction would be likely to cause a reduction in the volume or earnings of the export business which is substantial either in relation to the whole export business of the United Kingdom or in relation to the whole business (including export business) of the said trade or industry; or

(g) that the restriction is reasonably required for purposes connected with the maintenance of any other restriction accepted by the parties, whether under the same agreement or under any other agreement between them, being a restriction which is found by the Court not to be contrary to the public interest upon grounds other than those specified in this paragraph, or has been so found in previous proceedings before the Court, and is further satisfied (in any such case) that the restriction is not unreasonable having regard to the balance between those circumstances and any detriment to the public or to persons not parties to the agreement (being purchasers, consumers or users of goods produced or sold by such parties, or persons engaged or seeking to become engaged in the trade or business of selling such goods or of producing or selling similar goods) resulting or likely to result from the operation of the restriction.

that those persons will cause those works to be so transmitted in consequence of their being so broadcast,

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WE, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled, have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and grant unto Your Majesty the increased duties hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) As from six o’clock in the evening of the fourth day of December, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, the rate of the customs duty chargeable under section two of the Finance Act, 1928, on hydrocarbon oils shall be three shillings and sixpence a gallon (instead of two shillings and sixpence a gallon as provided by section one of the Finance Act, 1952), and any Act or order which fixes by reference to the rate of that duty the rate of the excise duty on hydrocarbon oils, on petrol substitutes or on spirits used in making power methylated spirits, or the rate of any rebate from the customs or excise duty on hydrocarbon oils, shall have and be deemed to have had effect accordingly: Provided that, if it appears to the Treasury expedient having regard to the circumstances giving rise to the present increase in the customs duty on hydrocarbon oils and to any change of circumstances, the Treasury may by order made by statutory instrument direct that the rate of that duty shall again be two shillings and sixpence a gallon, and on the coming into force of any such order the rate of that duty and the other rates above-mentioned shall be reduced accordingly.

(2) If no order is made by the Treasury under this section so as to come into force at or before the expiration of one month beginning with the first day after the passing of this Act on which no petrol-rationing order is in force, this Act shall have effect as if the Treasury had made an order under this section to come into force at the expiration of that month.

Act, 1930 (and may be so increased notwithstanding that the scheme is made or varied, or the licence is granted or the relevant conditions attached or varied, after the passing of this Act), but shall not be increased beyond the fares permitted as aforesaid in any way which, according to the best of the judgment of the British Transport Commission, will increase the aggregate gross receipts from passenger fares on services provided by the Executive (exclusive of services provided by contract carriages) by more than the appropriate fraction of what, with the fares so permitted, the gross receipts would have been from passenger fares on stage and express carriages operated by the Executive.

(3) The appropriate fraction for the purposes of this section is one-twelfth, except that it shall be one-eighth for the purposes of subsection (1) in its application to any holder of a road service licence who is the owner (within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, 1930)—

(5) The powers of the Court under this section shall not be affected by the determination of an agreement effected after the commencement of the proceedings, and where an agreement is varied after the commencement of the proceedings, the Court may make a declaration and, if it thinks fit an order under subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section, either in respect of the agreement as at the commencement of the proceedings or in respect of the agreement as varied, or both.

(6) The Registrar shall cause notice of any declaration or order made under this section to be entered in the register.

21.—(1) For the purposes of any proceedings before the Court under the last foregoing section, a restriction accepted in pursuance of any agreement shall be deemed to be contrary to the public interest unless the Court is satisfied of any one or more of the following circumstances, that is to say—

(a) that the restriction is reasonably necessary, having regard

to the character of the goods to which it applies, to protect the public against injury (whether to persons or to premises) in connection with the consumption, installation or use of those goods;

(b) that the removal of the restriction would deny to the

public as purchasers, consumers or users of any goods other specific and substantial benefits or advantages enjoyed or likely to be enjoyed by them as such, whether by virtue of the restriction itself or of any arrangements or operations resulting therefrom;

(c) that the restriction is reasonably necessary to counteract

measures taken by any one person not party to the agreement with a view to preventing or restricting competition in or in relation to the trade or business in which the persons party thereto are engaged;

1956 Restrictive Trade Practices Ch. 68

Act, 1956

() that the restriction is reasonably necessary to enable

the persons party to the agreement to negotiate fair terms for the supply of goods to, or the acquisition of goods from, any one person not party thereto who controls a preponderant part of the trade or business of acquiring or supplying such goods, or for the supply of goods to any person not party to the agreement and not carrying on such a trade or business who, either alone or in combination with any other such person, controls a preponderant part of the market for such goods;

(e) that, having regard to the conditions actually obtaining

or reasonably foreseen at the time of the application, the removal of the restriction would be likely to have a serious and persistent adverse effect on the general level of unemployment in an area, or in areas taken together, in which a substantial proportion of the trade or industry to which the agreement relates is situated; (/) that, having regard to the conditions actually obtaining or reasonably foreseen at the time of the application, the removal of the restriction would be likely to cause a reduction in the volume or earnings of the export business which is substantial either in relation to the whole export business of the United Kingdom or in relation to the whole business (including export business) of the said trade or industry; or

(g) that the restriction is reasonably required for purposes connected with the maintenance of any other restriction accepted by the parties, whether under the same agreement or under any other agreement between them, being a restriction which is found by the Court not to be contrary to the public interest upon grounds other than those specified in this paragraph, or has been so found in previous proceedings before the Court, and is further satisfied (in any such case) that the restriction is not unreasonable having regard to the balance between those circumstances and any detriment to the public or to persons not parties to the agreement (being purchasers, consumers or users of goods produced or sold by such parties, or persons engaged or seeking to become engaged in the trade or business of selling such goods or of producing or selling similar goods) resulting or likely to result from the operation of the restriction.

(2) In this section “ purchasers ”, “ consumers ” and “ users ” include persons purchasing, consuming or using for the purpose or in course of trade or business or for public purposes; and references in this section to any one person include references to any two or more persons being inter-connected bodies corporate or individuals carrying on business in partnership with each other.

(a) that the licences are required wholly or partly for the

purpose of distributing programmes broadcast, from a place outside the United Kingdom, by an organisation other than the Corporation and the Authority, and

(b) that, under the arrangements in accordance with which

the programmes are broadcast by that organisation, charges are payable by or on behalf of the organisation to another body, as being the body entitled under the relevant copyright law to authorise the broadcasting of those works from that place,

the tribunal shall, subject to the next following subsection, exercise its powers under this Part of this Act as the tribunal may consider appropriate for securing that the persons requiring the licences are exempted from the payment of any charges for them in so far as the licences are required for the purpose of distributing those programmes.

(2) If on such a reference as is mentioned in the last preceding subsection the tribunal is satisfied as to the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) and ( b) of that subsection, but it is shown to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the charges payable by or on behalf of the organisation, as mentioned in paragraph (b) of that subsection,—

(a) make no allowance for the fact that, in consequence

of the broadcasting of the works in question by that organisation, the persons requiring the licences may be enabled to cause those works to be transmitted to subscribers to diffusion services in the United Kingdom, or

(b) do not adequately reflect the extent to which it is likely

that those persons will cause those works to be so transmitted in consequence of their being so broadcast,

the last preceding subsection shall not apply, but the tribunal shall exercise its powers under this Part of this Act so as to secure that the charges payable for the licences, in so far as the licences are required for the purpose mentioned in the last preceding subsection, are on a scale not exceeding that appearing to the tribunal to be requisite for making good the deficiency (as mentioned in paragraph (a) or paragraph ( of this subsection, as the case may be) in the charges payable by or on behalf of the organisation broadcasting the works.

(6) The last preceding subsection shall have effect, with the necessary modifications, in relation to applications under this Part of this Act as it has effect in relation to references thereunder.

1.—(1) As from six o’clock in the evening of the fourth day of December, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, the rate of the customs duty chargeable under section two of the Finance Act, 1928, on hydrocarbon oils shall be three shillings and sixpence a gallon (instead of two shillings and sixpence a gallon as provided by section one of the Finance Act, 1952), and any Act or order which fixes by reference to the rate of that duty the rate of the excise duty on hydrocarbon oils, on petrol substitutes or on spirits used in making power methylated spirits, or the rate of any rebate from the customs or excise duty on hydrocarbon oils, shall have and be deemed to have had effect accordingly: Provided that, if it appears to the Treasury expedient having regard to the circumstances giving rise to the present increase in the customs duty on hydrocarbon oils and to any change of circumstances, the Treasury may by order made by statutory instrument direct that the rate of that duty shall again be two shillings and sixpence a gallon, and on the coming into force of any such order the rate of that duty and the other rates above-mentioned shall be reduced accordingly.

(2) If no order is made by the Treasury under this section so as to come into force at or before the expiration of one month beginning with the first day after the passing of this Act on which no petrol-rationing order is in force, this Act shall have effect as if the Treasury had made an order under this section to come into force at the expiration of that month.

Act, 1930 (and may be so increased notwithstanding that the scheme is made or varied, or the licence is granted or the relevant conditions attached or varied, after the passing of this Act), but shall not be increased beyond the fares permitted as aforesaid in any way which, according to the best of the judgment of the British Transport Commission, will increase the aggregate gross receipts from passenger fares on services provided by the Executive (exclusive of services provided by contract carriages) by more than the appropriate fraction of what, with the fares so permitted, the gross receipts would have been from passenger fares on stage and express carriages operated by the Executive.

(3) The appropriate fraction for the purposes of this section is one-twelfth, except that it shall be one-eighth for the purposes of subsection (1) in its application to any holder of a road service licence who is the owner (within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, 1930)—

then in any proceedings which by virtue of section 152(1) are taken in respect of the contravention against the under-manager as such, it shall be a defence for him to prove—

(i) that the contravention did not take place at a time when

he was required by those instructions to be, or was, on duty at the mine as under-manager; and

(ii) that no act or omission of his caused or contributed to

the contravention.

in paragraph (a) above, the terms on which the separate accommodation is held are on the whole less favourable to the tenant than the previous terms, the rent shall be deemed to be increased, whether or not the sum periodically payable by way of rent is increased ;

(c) any increase of rent in respect of any such change as is

(5) Subject to subsection (6) below, while the tenant is in possession of the separate accommodation (whether as a protected or statutory tenant), any term or condition of the contract of tenancy terminating or modifying, or providing for the termination or modification of, his right to the use of any of the shared accommodation which is living accommodation shall be of no effect

(6) Where the terms and conditions of the contract of tenancy are such that at any time during the tenancy the persons in common with whom the tenant is entitled to the use of the shared accommodation could be varied, or their number could be increased, nothing in subsection (5) above shall prevent those terms and conditions from having effect so far as they relate to any such variation or increase.

(7) Subject to subsection (8) below and without prejudice to the enforcement of any order made thereunder, while the tenant is in possession of the separate accommodation, no order shall be made for possession of any of the shared accommodation, whether on the application of the immediate landlord of the tenant or on the application of any person under whom that landlord derives title, unless a like order has been made, or is made at the same time, in respect of the separate accommodation; and the provisions of section 10(1) of this Act shall apply accordingly.

(8) Without prejudice to subsection (4) above, the sheriff, on the application of the landlord, may make such order, either terminating the right of the tenant to use the whole or any part of the shared accommodation other than living accommodation, or modifying his right to use the whole or any part of the shared accommodation, whether by varying the persons or increasing the number of persons entitled to the use of that accommodation, or otherwise, as the sheriff thinks just:

Provided that no order shall be made under this subsection so as to effect any termination or modification of the rights of the tenant which, apart from subsection (5) above, could not be effected by or under the terms of the contract of tenancy.

(9) Any question arising under subsection (4) above shall be determined on the application either of the landlord or of the tenant by the sheriff whose decision shall be final and conclusive.

(10) In this section the expression “ living accommodation ” means accommodation of such a nature that the fact that it constitutes or is included in the shared accommodation is sufficient to prevent the tenancy from constituting a protected or statutory tenancy of a dwelling-house.

(3) The limit to which the rent payable in respect of a tenancy to which this paragraph applies may be increased is the standard rent as increased by the following amounts:—

(a) where the landlord has since 4th August 1914 incurred, or

after the commencement of this Act incurs, expenditure on the improvement or structural alteration of the dwelling-house let on or subject to the tenancy (including expenditure on the provision of additional or improved fixtures and fittings but not including expenditure on decoration or repairs or an amount equal to the amount of any repayment under section 12(1) of the Clean Air Act 1956), an amount calculated at a rate per annum not exceeding eight, or, in the case of such expenditure incurred after 3rd July 1962, 12£ per cent, of the amount so expended:

Provided that the tenant may apply to the sheriff for an order suspending or reducing such increase on the ground that such expenditure is or was unnecessary in whole or in part, and the sheriff may make an order accordingly; but the sheriff shall not make such an order unless the tenant proves either—

(i) that he was the tenant when the expenditure was incurred and had not given his written consent to the improvement or alteration and the expenditure thereon; or

chargeable on account thereof;

not exceeding 15 per cent of the net rent;

(d) in addition to any such amounts as aforesaid—

of a dwelling-house under a tenancy to which this paragraph applies is sub-let and that part is also a dwelling-house under such a tenancy—

(i) in respect of the dwelling-house comprised in the sub-tenancy, an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the net rent of that dwelling-house;

(ii) in respect of the dwelling-house comprised in the tenancy, an amount equivalent to 5 per cent of the net rent of the dwelling-house comprised in the sub-tenancy:

Provided that any alteration in the rateable value of any dwelling-house effected by the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956 or by this paragraph shall, in any question as to die application of this subsection in relation to k lease subsisting at the commencement of the relevant year, be disregarded.

(3) In this paragraph “ the Act of 1920 ” means the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920, “the Act of 1939 ” means the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1939 and “lease”, “relevant year” and “relevant fraction” have the same meanings as in paragraph 1(10) of Schedule 8 to this Act.

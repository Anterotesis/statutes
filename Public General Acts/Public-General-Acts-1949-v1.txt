SCHEDULE

TERMS OF UNION *

OF

NEWFOUNDLAND WITH CANADA

Memorandum of Agreement entered into on the Eleventh Day

of December, 1948, between Canada and Newfoundland

Whereas a delegation appointed from its members by the National Convention of Newfoundland, a body elected by the people of Newfoundland, consulted in 1947 with the Government of Canada to ascertain what fair and equitable basis might exist for the union of Newfoundland with Canada;

Whereas, following discussions with the delegation, the Government of Canada sent to His Excellency the Governor of Newfoundland for submission to the National Convention a statement of terms which the Government of Canada would be prepared to recommend to the Parliament of Canada as a fair and equitable basis for union, should the people of Newfoundland desire to enter into confederation;

Whereas the proposed terms were debated in the National Convention in Newfoundland and were before the people of Newfoundland when, by a majority at a referendum held on the twenty-second day of July, 1948, they expressed their desire to enter into confederation with Canada;

Whereas the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland agreed after the referendum that representatives of Canada and Newfoundland should meet and settle the final terms and arrangements for the union of Newfoundland with Canada;

And whereas authorized representatives of Canada and authorized representatives of Newfoundland have settled the terms hereinafter set forth as the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada;

It is therefore agreed as follows:

TERMS OF UNION Union

Provided that if the local authority so resolve not later than the fifteenth day of July in any year with respect to any particular premises such as aforesaid this subsection shall have effect in that year in relation to those premises with the substitution for one-half of such other fraction, not exceeding one-half and not less than one-quarter, as may be specified in the resolution.

SIXTH SCHEDULE Allowances in rbspbct of Machinery or Plant

Part I

Calculation of Annual Allowances

' The normal method

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, the annual allowance in respect of any machinery or plant for any year of assessment shall, except in the cases in which an election under paragraph 2 or paragraph 5 of this Part of this Schedule has effect,—

(a) be computed by reference to the amount by which the capital expenditure of the person to whom the allowance is to be made in providing the machinery or plant exceeds the total amount of any initial allowance, annual allowances, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to him in respect of that machinery or plant for previous years of assessment; and

(b) be five-fourths of the percentage of that amount specified in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph.

(2) The said percentage is such percentage as may be determined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to be appropriate to be applied for the purposes of this paragraph in relation to machinery or plant of the class in question for the year of assessment in question:

Provided that it shall not be necessary for the said Commissioners to redetermine every such percentage yearly, and any determination of a percentage under this sub-paragraph for any year of assessment shall apply also to subsequent years except so far as it is superseded by any subsequent determination.

(3) In determining the said percentage in relation to machinery or plant of any class, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall have regard to the anticipated normal working life of machinery or plant of that class, and shall select the percentage which in their opinion may fairly be taken as that which, if applied year by year throughout that life as a writing down percentage applicable, in the first year to the cost of such machinery or plant, in the second year to that cost as written down in the first year, in the third year to that cost as written down in the first and second years, and so on, would, at the end of that life, have caused that cost to be written down to one-tenth thereof.

(4) If, in the case of machinery or plant of any class—

(a) annual allowances for the year 1948-49 were commonly arrived at by applying five-fourths of some percentage—

(i) in the case of the first year, to the cost of the machinery or plant; and

(ii) in the case of subsequent years, to a sum less than that cost; and

(b) a particular percentage was commonly in use for so arriving

at those allowances.

1949

Finance A, 1949

Ch. 47

529

that percentage shall, unless the Commissioners of Inland Revenue determine that it is no longer an appropriate percentage, be deemed to be a percentage determined by them in relation to machinery or plant of that class under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for the year 1949-50, and the said sub-paragraph (2), including the proviso thereto, shall have effect accordingly; and if it is shown to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners that that percentage, if applied as a writing down percentage in the manner specified in sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph, would, at the end of the anticipated normal working life of the machinery or plant of that class (estimated as if during the year 1948-49), cause the cost to be written down to a fraction thereof which is smaller than one-tenth, the said sub-paragraph (3) shall have effect in relation to machinery or plant of that class as if a reference to that smaller fraction were substituted therein for a reference to one-tenth.

In this sub-paragraph, and in the subsequent provisions of this Schedule, the expression " the first year" means the year of the acquisition of the machinery or plant or other the first year for which an annual allowance could be made to the person in question in respect of the machinery or plant.

(5) If, in the case of any machinery or plant not falling within any class with respect to which a determination of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue has been or is deemed to have been made under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for the year of assessment in question—

(a) a percentage was in use for determining the annual allowance in respect thereof for the year 1948-49; and (b) that percentage is one which, multiplied by five-fourths, was intended to be applied to an amount which, except in the case of the first year, is less than the cost of providing the machinery or plant,

that percentage, or, if the Commissioners of Inland Revenue determine, as respects any year of assessment, that that percentage is no longer an appropriate percentage, such other percentage as the said Commissioners may determine, shall be deemed, in relation to that machinery or plant, to be a percentage determined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under the said sub-paragraph (2) for the year 1949-50 or the year as respects which the determination is made, as the case may be, and the said sub-paragraph (2), including the proviso thereto, shall, in relation to that machinery or plant, have effect accordingly.

(6) In this paragraph, the expression " the anticipated normal working life " means, in relation to machinery or plant of any class, the period which might be expected, when machinery or plant of that class is first put into use, to be going to elapse before it is finally put out of use as being unfit for further use, it being assumed that it is going to be used in the normal manner and to the normal extent and is going to be so used throughout that period.

(7) The reference to annual allowances in paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall not include a reference to any deduction allowed for the year 1945-46 or any previous year of assessment under section eighteen of the Finance Act, 1932, or under that section as amended by section twenty-two of the Finance Act, 1938.

Alternative method

2.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, the annual allowance in respect of any machinery or plant for any year of assessment—

(a) may, if the person to whom the allowance is to be made so elects when he makes his claim for the allowance, be computed by reference to the amount of his capital expenditure in providing the machinery or plant; and

(b) shall in that event be five-fourths of the percentage of that amount specified in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph.

(2) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph, the said percentage is such percentage as may be determined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in relation to machinery or plant of the class in question for the year of assessment in question, being a percentage which is in their opinion equal to nine-tenths of the fraction of which the numerator is one and the denominator is the number of years in the anticipated normal working life of machinery or plant of that class:

Provided that it shall not be necessary for the said Commissioners to redetermine every such percentage yearly, and every such determination of a percentage under this sub-paragraph for any year of assessment shall apply also to subsequent years except so far as it is superseded by any subsequent determination.

(3) If, in the case of machinery or plant of any class—

(a) annual allowances for the year 1948-49 were commonly arrived at by applying five-fourths of some percentage to the cost of the machinery or plant; and

(b) a particular percentage was commonly in use for so arriving at those allowances,

that percentage shall, unless the Commissioners of Inland Revenue determine that it is no longer an appropriate percentage, be deemed to be a percentage determined by them in relation to machinery or plant of that class under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for the ] year 1949-50, and the said sub-paragraph (2), including the proviso \ thereto, shall have effect accordingly; and if it is shown to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners that that percentage bears to the fraction specified in the said sub-paragraph (2) (computed by reference to an anticipated normal working life estimated as if during the year 1948-49) a higher proportion than nine-tenths, the said sub-paragraph (2) shall have effect in relation to machinery or plant of that class as if for the reference therein to nine-tenths there were substituted a reference to the said higher proportion.

(4) Machinery or plant may be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as being of a different class from other machinery or plant where the one is new when it is acquired and (he other is not new when it is acquired, or, in the case of machinery or plant which is not new when it is acquired, where different periods have elapsed between the date when the machinery or plant was made or first put into use and the date of the acquisition thereof.

1949

Finance A, 1949

Ch. 47

531

(5) In this paragraph, the expression " the anticipated normal working life " has the meaning assigned to it by sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule, except that, in relation to a class consisting of machinery or plant which is not new when it is acquired, the reference in the said sub-paragraph (6) to the first putting into use of the machinery or plant shall be construed as a reference to the first putting into use thereof after the acquisition thereof.

3. An election under paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule shall not be effective for any year of assessment in relation to any machinery or plant unless the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are satisfied that the person making the election is keeping, and will keep and make available for inspection, all such records as are necessary to secure that the Commissioners, surveyors and other officers concerned can ensure that the total annual allowances made to him for all years of assessment in respect of that machinery or plant do not exceed the limit imposed by paragraph (6) of Rule 6 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule D, due regard being had to any initial allowance, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to him in respect thereof, and to any deductions allowed to him in respect thereof for the year 1945-46 or any previous year of assessment under section eighteen of the Finance Act, 1932, or under that section as amended by section twenty-two of the Finance Act, 1938.

4. —(1) Where an election under paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule has effect with respect to any machinery or plant, and the annual allowance in respect of the same machinery or plant made to the same person for any previous year of assessment has been calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule, the annual allowance for that machinery or plant for the year of assessment with respect to which the election has effect shall be computed in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say—

(a) instead of being computed by reference to the amount of the person’s expenditure in providing the machinery or plant, it shall be computed by reference to the amount by which that amount exceeds any initial allowance, annual allowances, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to that person in respect of that machinery or plant for the years of assessment up to and including the said previous year or, if the annual allowance was calculated in accordance with the said paragraph 1 in the case of more than one previous year, up to and including the last of those previous years; and

(b) it shall be computed as if for the percentage mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) of the said paragraph 2 there were substituted such other percentage as the Commissioners of Inland Revenue may determine.

(2) The expression " annual allowances ", in paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, does not include any deduction allowed for the year 1945-46 or any previous .year of assessment under section eighteen of the Finance Act, 1932, or under that section as amended by section twenty-two of the Finance Act, 1938.

of this Schedule shall be deemed to include references to allowances for the year 1948-49 or any previous year of assessment calculated by the application of, or of five-fourths of, a percentage intended for application, or for application when multiplied by five-fourths, to a sum which, except in the case of the first year, is less than the cost of the machinery or plant.

(4) Any reference in this paragraph to paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule shall be deemed to include a reference to that paragraph as modified by the subsequent paragraphs of this Schedule.

Special method for machinery or plant used in connection

with mines, etc.

5. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, the annual allowance for any year of assessment in respect of any machinery or plant used for the purposes of a trade which consists of or includes the working of a mine, oil well or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature, being machinery or plant used in connection with the working of the source, shall, if the person to whom the allowance is to be made so elects when he makes his claim for the allowance,—

(a) be computed by reference to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 1 or paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule; but

(b) be the percentage of that amount specified in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph.

(2) The said percentage is such percentage as the Commissioners of Inland Revenue may determine having regard to the date when the source is likely to cease to be worked and the probable value of the machinery or plant at that date to the person carrying on the trade.

(3) The references in sub-paragraphs (1) and (4) of paragraph 4 of this Part of this Schedule to paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule shall be deemed to include references to this paragraph where the election thereunder is that the allowance shall be computed by reference to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of the said paragraph 1; and the references in sub-paragraph (1) of the said paragraph 4 to paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule shall be deemed to include references to this paragraph where the election thereunder is that the allowance shall be computed by reference to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (1) of the said paragraph 2.

Adjustments for special circumstances

6. If the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are satisfied that the manner in which or the extent to which any machinery or plant is used in any year of assessment is such that the wear and tear thereof is greater or less than that which might be expected to be caused by the use thereof in the normal manner and to the normal extent, they may direct that the annual allowance in respect of that machinery or plant for that year of assessment shall be ascertained as if, for the

1949

percentage specified in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 1, sub- 6th Sch. paragraph (2) of paragraph 2 or sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 5 of this Part of this Schedule, as the case may be, there were substituted such other percentage as they may determine.

7.—(1) If an annual allowance falls to be made to any person in respect of any machinery or plant in charging the profits or gains of any trade, profession, employment, vocation or office which is carried on or held by him for part only of the year of assessment, the said allowance, as computed in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Schedule, shall be proportionately reduced.

(2) If an annual allowance falls to be made to the lessor of any machinery or plant under section twenty of the Income Tax Act,

1945, and the letting continues for part only of the year of assessment, the said allowance, as computed in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Schedule, shall be proportionately reduced.

Applications to Commissioners of Inland Revenue or Board of Referees

8.—(1) If, within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under this paragraph, an application is made to the said Commissioners by or on behalf of—

Miscellaneous Amendments as to Initial, Annual and Balancing Allowances, and Balancing Charges

1. An initial allowance may be made to a person in respect of any machinery or plant in charging the profits or gains of a trade, profession, employment, vocation or office carried on or held by him notwithstanding that it appears that, during the period during which the machinery or plant will be used for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, it will also be used for other purposes, but the allowance in any such case shall be so much only of the allowance that would be made if the machinery or plant were to be used only for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office as may be just and reasonable having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in particular, to the extent to which it appears that the machinery or plant is likely to be used for the said other purposes during that period.

2. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, no initial allowance shall be made to a person in respect of any machinery or plant in charging the profits or gains of a trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, if it appears that, during the period during which the machinery or plant will be used by him for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, sums which are in respect of, or take account of, the wear and tear to that machinery or plant occasioned by its use for those purposes and do not fall to be taken into account as his income or in computing the profits or gains of any trade, profession, employment, vocation or office carried on or held by him are, or are to be, payable to him directly or indirectly by the Crown, or by any government or public or local authority, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or by any person other than the person carrying on or holding the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office:

Provided that where the sums referred to in this paragraph are in respect of, or take account of, part only of the wear and tear therein referred to—

(a) the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply; but

(b) the amount of the allowance shall be reduced to such extent

as may be just and reasonable having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case.

3. An annual allowance may be made in respect of any machinery or plant in charging the profits or gains of a trade, profession, employment, vocation or office for any year of assessment notwithstanding that the machinery or plant is also used in that year for purposes other than those of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, but where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, machinery or plant is used for purposes other than those of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, the annual allowance to be made in respect thereof shall be so much only of the allowance

that otherwise would be made as may be just and reasonable having 6th Sch. regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in particular, —cont.

to the extent of the use for the said other purposes during the said basis period.

4. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, no annual allowance shall be made to a person in respect of any machinery or plant in charging the profits or gains of a trade, profession, employment, vocation or office for any year of assessment if any sums which are in respect of, or take account of, the wear and tear to that machinery or plant occasioned by its use during the basis period for that year of assessment for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office and do not fall to be taken into account as his income or in computing the profits or gains of any trade, profession, employment, vocation or office carried on or held by him are, or are to be, payable to him directly or indirectly by the Crown, or by any government or public or local authority, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or by any person other than the person carrying on or holding the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office:

Provided that where the sums referred to in this paragraph are in respect of, or take account of, part only of the wear and tear therein referred to—

(a) the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply; but (b) the amount of the allowance shall be reduced to such extent as may be just and reasonable having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case.

5. Where an initial allowance has been made to a person in respect of any machinery or plant, but the amount thereof has been reduced under paragraph 1 or the proviso to paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule, any annual allowance falling to be made in respect of that machinery or plant to that person shall be calculated as if the reduction had not been made.

6. —(1) In determining whether any, and if so what, annual allowance falls to be made to a person for any year of assessment in respect of any machinery or plant which has been used by him during any previous year of assessment, there shall be deemed to have been made to him for every previous year of assessment (including years before the year 1949-50, years during which the machinery or plant was not used for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, and years during which the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office was not carried on or held by him) such annual allowance or greater annual allowance, if any, as would have fallen to be made to him if all the conditions specified in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph had been fulfilled in relation to every such previous year.

(2) The said conditions are as follows, that is to say—

(a) that the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office had been carried on or held, by the person in question ever since the date on which he acquired the machinery or plant and had been so carried on or held by him in such circumstances that the profits or gains or emoluments thereof were liable to assessment to income tax;

Ch. 47

Finance Act, 1949

—com.

(b) that the machinery or plant had been used by him for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office ever since that date;

(c) that a proper claim had been duly made by him for an annual allowance in respect of the machinery or plant for every relevant year of assessment; and

(d) that no question arose in connection with any year of assessment as to the machinery or plant having been wholly or partly used by him otherwise than for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, or as to there being payable to him, directly or indirectly, any sums in respect of, or taking account of, the wear and tear of the machinery or plant.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, the years for which an annual allowance is to be deemed thereunder to have been made shall not include years during which machinery or plant was used only for the purposes of activities carried on by the person in question before the commencement by him of the- working of a mine, oil well, or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature, being activities consisting of—

(a) searching for or discovering and testing deposits, or winning

access thereto; or

(b) the construction of any works which are likely to be of little

or no value when the source is no longer worked, or, where the source is worked under a foreign concession, which are likely to become valueless when the concession comes to an end to the person working the source immediately before the concession comes to an end.

Balancing allowances and charges

7. Where any machinery or plant which has been used by a person for the purposes of a trade, profession, employment, vocation or office carried on or held by him, has also been used by him for other purposes, then, in determining whether a balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made to or on him in charging the profits or gains of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, and in determining the amount of the allowance or, as the case may be, the amount on which the charge is to be made, regard shall be had to all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in particular, to the extent of the use for the said other purposes, and there shall be made to or on him an allowance of such an amount, or, as the case may be, a charge on such an amount, as may be just and reasonable.

8. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, no balancing allowance or balancing charge shall be made to or on any person in respect of any machinery or plant in charging the profits or gains of a trade, profession, employment, vocation or office if any sums which are in respect of, or take account of, the wear and tear to that machinery or plant occasioned by its use for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, and do not fall to be taken into account as his income or in computing the profits or gains of any trade, profession, employment, vocation or office carried on or held by him, were paid, or are or are to be payable, to

1949

Finance A, 1949

Ch. 47

539

him directly or indirectly by the Crown, or by any government or public or local authority, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or by any person other than the person carrying on or holding the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office:

Provided that where the sums referred to in this paragraph are in respect of, or take account of, part only of the wear and tear therein referred to—

(a) the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply; but

(b) in determining whether it is an allowance or a charge which

is to be made and the amount of the allowance or, as the case may be, the amount on which the charge is to be made, regard shall be had to all the relevant circumstances of the case and there shall be made an allowance of such an amount or, as the case may be, a charge on such an amount, as may be just and reasonable.

9.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the provisions of paragraph 6 of this Part of this Schedule shall apply for the purpose of determining whether any, and if so what, balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made to or on a person as they apply for the purpose of determining whether any, and if so what, annual allowance falls to be made to a person.

(2) The only years for which an annual allowance is to be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been made shall be years during which the machinery or plant was not used by the person in question for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office, and years during which the trade, profession, employment, vocation or office was not carried on or held by him, or was not carried on or held by him in such circumstances that the profits or gains or emoluments thereof were liable to assessment to income tax.

(3) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the provisions of subsection (4) of section seventeen, or of the proviso to section nineteen, or of subsection (2) of section twenty-three, of the Income Tax Act, 1945, but where an allowance is deemed, by virtue of the proviso to the said section nineteen, or by virtue of subsection (2) of the said section twenty-three, to have been made for any year of assessment, an allowance shall not also be deemed to have been made for the same year by virtue of this paragraph.

that percentage shall be deemed to be the percentage referred to in paragraph (b) of sub-paragraph (1) of the said paragraph 1.

4. Where—

(a) an annual allowance for the year 1947-48 or the year 1948-49 falls to be made in accordance with paragraph 2 of Part 1 of this Schedule; and

—cont. Schedule to the Finance Act, 1937 (which authorises losses to be

carried forward and deducted from profits for subsequent chargeable accounting periods) had applied only to losses if and in so

far as they exceeded the aggregate of the gross amounts of the payments, if any, made out of special reserve funds into premiums trust funds as the result of losses sustained in the business for the years in question.

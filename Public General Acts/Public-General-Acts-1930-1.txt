Schemes for

preserving

amenities of

ancient

monuments.

1.—(1) For the purpose of preserving the amenities

of any ancient monument, the Commissioners may,

subject to the provisions of this section, prepare and

confirm a scheme (hereafter in this Act referred to

as “ a preservation scheme ”) for any area comprising or

adjacent to the site of the monument, being an area

to which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, it is

necessary or expedient for that purpose that the scheme

should apply.

scheme is applicable (hereafter in this Act referred to

as “ the controlled area ”) and may provide for all or

any of the following matters, that is to say:—

(a) for prohibiting or restricting the construction,

erection or execution of buildings, structures

and other works above ground within the controlled area, or the alteration or extension of

any such buildings, structures or works in such

materials, colour and screening, and otherwise

regulating the external appearance, of buildings,

Ch. 16.

47

(c) for prohibiting or restricting the felling of trees,

quarrying and excavations within the controlled

area;

(d) /or otherwise restricting the user of land within

the controlled area to such extent as may appear

to the Commissioners to be expedient for

the purpose of preserving the amenities of the

• monument;

(e) for such other matters as appear to the Commissioners to be incidental to or consequential

on the foregoing provisions of this section

or to be necessary for giving effect to those

provisions.

(3) The provisions of the First Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to the confirmation,

variation and revocation of preservation schemes.

(4) Nothing in any preservation scheme shall affect

any building, structure or other work above ground or

any alteration or extension thereof, if it was constructed,

erected or executed before the date when notice of

intention to confirm the scheme was published in the

London Gazette under the First Schedule to this Act, and

for the purpose of this provision a building, structure

or other work and any alteration or extension thereof

shall be deemed to have been constructed, erected or

executed before that date—

(a) if its construction, erection or execution was

begun before that date; or

(b) if and so far as its construction, erection or

execution was necessary for the purpose of

performing a contract made before that date.

(5) Any person whose property is injuriously affected

by the coming into force of a preservation scheme shall

be entitled to obtain compensation in respect thereof

from the Commissioners, subject to the provisions of the

Second Schedule to this Act.

preservation scheme for the time being in force, he shall

48 Ch. 16. Ancient Monuments 21 & "1 2 Ge. 5.

Act, 1931.

twenty pounds for every day on which the contravention occurs or continues.

(7) If, after any person has been convicted of a contravention of a preservation scheme by reason that any

building, structure or other work is not in conformity

with the scheme, the contravention continues after the

expiration of such period as the court before whom

he was convicted may determine, the Commissioners

shall have power to do all such acts as, in their opinion,

are necessary for removing so much of the building,

structure or work as is not in conformity with the

scheme, or for making it conform with the scheme,

and any expenses incurred by the Commissioners in so

doing shall be recoverable summarily as a civil debt

from the person convicted.

2.—(1) If it appears to the Commissioners that a

town planning scheme approved after the commencement of this Act under the Town Planning Act, 1925,

has the effect of preserving to the satisfaction of the

Commissioners the amenities of an ancient monument,

the Commissioners may defray, either in whole or in

part, such part of the expenses incurred by any local

authority in connexion with the scheme as, in the

opinion of the Commissioners, is attributable to the

provisions of the scheme having the effect aforesaid.

(2) In this section the expression “local authority ”

means a local authority as defined by the Town Planning

Act, 1925, or a county council.

ascertained, as at that date, the land value of every land

unit, that is to say, the amount which the fee simple

thereof with vacant possession might have been expected

to realise upon a sale in the open market on the valuation

date upon the assumptions that at that date—

(a) there were not upon or in the unit—

(i) any buildings, erections, or works,

conveyance:

(d) the unit was free from any incumbrance (not

including tithe, tithe rentcharge, or other

payment in lieu of tithe) except any of the

incumbrances mentioned in the First Schedule

to this Act.

(2) Where at any valuation date any land unit

comprises agricultural land, the Commissioners shall,

in addition to ascertaining the land value of the unit,

cause to be ascertained the cultivation value at that

date of the agricultural land comprised therein, that

is to say, what would have been the land value of the

agricultural land as ascertained in accordance with the

provisions of the last foregoing subsection if—

(a) there had been a restriction imposed by law on

the user of the agricultural land permanently

prohibiting its use for any purposes other than

agricultural purposes of the class or classes for

may be owned by the same person if those

parts are vested in him for different estates

or in different capacities:

date in different separate occupations or in

different ownership, none of the divisions shall

he deemed to lie a land unit, but the site of

{he building (with its curtilage) shall be a land

unit, and this Part of this Act shall apply to

every owner of a division as if he were an

owner of that unit:

(c) where in the case of two or more pieces of

land in different separate occupations but

owned by the same owner the Commissioners

sell the pieces of land as one lot, the Commissioners may, if they think fit, treat those

pieces of land as one land unit, and references in this Part of this Act to a land unit

shall have effect accordingly.

(4) The valuation of a land unit under this section shall be made upon the basis that all land not

comprised in the unit (including any minerals or mineral

wayleaves which are excluded from the unit by reason

of their being in separate occupation or ownership) and

everything thereon and therein was in its actual condition

at the valuation date and that all the circumstances

affecting such land and everything thereon and therein

(including circumstances preventing the obstruction of

access of light and air to the unit) were the actual

circumstances at that date:

Provided that the value of a land unit shall not

be deemed to be increased by reason of any other land

unit being subject to any incumbrance from which that

other unit would, under subsection (1) of this section, be

deemed to be free for the purposes of the valuation

thereof.

(5) If the owner of a land unit furnishes to the

Commissioners his estimate of the land value or of the

cultivation value of the unit, the Commissioners shall

shall cause a valuation of the unit in respect of which

tax has become chargeable to be made as at the

date from which the tax became chargeable, and for

the purposes of any such valuation the foregoing

provisions of this section shall have effect as if references

to that date were therein substituted for references to

the valuation date.

being a copy of so much of the entries in the record

kept under the last foregoing subsection as relates to

land wholly or partly comprised in the area of the

council, and the said registers shall be so deposited,

in the case of those relating to the first valuation made

under this Part of this Act, as soon as practicable after

such date as His Majesty may by Order in Council

declare to be the date at which the valuation of all land

in Great Britain has been substantially completed, and

in the case of the registers relating to every subsequent

valuation, on or before the first day of August next after

the valuation date as at which the valuation was made:

Provided that in the event of its being, in the

opinion of the Commissioners, impracticable to include

in a land values register the necessary entries in respect

of any land unit, the register may be deposited with

the omission of those entries.

deposited in accordance with the provisions of the last

foregoing subsection, the Commissioners shall—

(a) except where the entries in respect of a land unit

are the same as those inserted in the register

" upon the owner of every land unit in respect of

which entries are inserted or proposed to be

upon the owner of the unit a copy of the necessary

entries in respect thereof, and cause the entries to be

inserted in the register.

on the first day of January in any year of charge any

piece of land valued under this Part of this Act as a

land unit has become divided into two or more parts in

different ownership (not being horizontal divisions of a

building), the Commissioners shall as soon as practicable

cause to be substituted for the entries in respect of the former unit revised entries showing every such

part as a separate land unit, and showing the land

value, and cultivation value if any, shown by the

entries in respect of the former unit, apportioned

as at that first day of January as between the several

parts thereof according to the respective values of

those parts at that date, and thereupon every such

part shall be deemed to be a land unit notwithstanding

that it was not at the valuation date in separate

occupation or different ownership.

(2) The Commissioners shall serve upon the owner

of any such separate unit, a copy of the revised entries

in respect thereof.

14. —(1) If the owner of a land unit objects to the

revised entries, formed part of a former land unit shall

be entertained under this section except upon the ground

that the value or values of the former unit have been

wrongly apportioned by the Commissioners as between

the several parts thereof.

(2) If the owner of two or more pieces of land in

different separate occupations objects to their having

been treated by the Commissioners as one land unit in

accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act

relating to the ascertainment of values, then, within the

period hereafter in this section limited, he may give to

the Commissioners notice in writing of his objection,

stating the grounds thereof.

(3) No such notice of objection as aforesaid shall be

of any effect unless given by the owner within forty-two

days after service upon him of a copy of the entries in

respect of the unit, or, where no such service is required

by this Part of this Act, within sixty days after the first

day of August on or before which the register is so required to be deposited, or, in either case, within such

further time as the Commissioners may, on application

made within the period aforesaid, allow, but upon any

such objection being made to them within the period

limited by this subsection, the Commissioners shall either

any part of the period of sixty days next after any such

first day of August as aforesaid is vested in the Probate

15 & 16 Judge under section nine of the Administration of

so adopted as aforesaid, the annual value shall be taken

to be of such amount as may be determined by the

Commissioners to be the amount at which the annual

value of the lands, tenements and hereditaments would

have been assessed for the purposes of the said Schedule

if they had been assessed to income tax thereunder and,

in the case of lands, tenements and hereditaments comprising any minerals, if no minerals had been comprised

therein.

2. — (1) If the Minister is of opinion, with respect to

any piece of land, that the execution thereon of reclamation, drainage, or other work is necessary in order to

enable the piece of land to he satisfactorily and economically used for agricultural purposes, he may purchase

and hold the piece of land and execute thereon such work

as aforesaid for the purposes of letting, selling or otherwise

disposing of, the piece of land when the said work has

Provided that the Minister shall not acquire any

land under this section otherwise than by agreement,

save as hereinafter in this section expressly provided.

(2) If it appears to the Minister that any piece of

the piece of land and report to him thereon.

(3) If after receiving a report under the last foregoing subsection with respect to any piece of land the Minister is satisfied that the piece of land is in a seriously

neglected condition and that the condition thereof has

been caused by the failure of the owner thereof to execute

thereon any necessary works of maintenance, or in the

case of land not in the occupation of the owner, by the

failure of the owner to take reasonable steps to reserve

or enforce any right for securing the execution on the

piece of land of any necessary works of maintenance,

amount of the compensation to be paid to any person

in respect of his interest in any piece of lapd proposed

notice to treat served on that person or on any other

person interested in the piece of land, and in such case

any person on whom such a notice of withdrawal has

section eighteen of the Lands Clauses (Consolidation)

Act, 1845; and all such notices and copies of notices may

be served in like manner as such a notice to treat as

aforesaid, and may require the persons served to give

of land to which the notice or copy relates as might be

demanded by such a notice to treat as aforesaid:

Provided that, without prejudice to the duty of the Minister under this subsection to serve copies of notices

two last foregoing subsections as to whether—

a seriously neglected condition; or

for securing the execution on the piece of land

of any necessary works of maintenance; or

(c) any requirements of the notice would involve

unreasonable expense or are otherwise unreasonable; or

(d) the time limited by the notice for compliance

steps are being taken for complying with the

requirements of the notice other than any

requirements which he holds to have been

unreasonable, and where the arbitrator awards

that the time aforesaid ought to be extended

his award shall specify the period of the

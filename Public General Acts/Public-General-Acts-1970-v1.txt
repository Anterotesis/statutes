(ii) subject to sub-paragraph (i) above, the said deduction shall be treated as reducing their respective incomes rateably, or, where relief is given under paragraph (a) or (b) of the said section 28(1), as reducing rateably those incomes as first reduced in accordance with paragraph ( ) of this subsection, and

{) in so far as any deduction to which paragraph (b) or

(c) of this subsection applies cannot be applied for the benefit of the one for whose benefit it would be applicable under the paragraph in question, it shall be applied for the benefit of the other.

40.—(1) Where—

(a) an assessment to income tax (hereafter in this section

referred to as “ the original assessment ”) is made on a man, or on a man’s trustee, guardian, curator, receiver or committee, or on a man’s executors or administrators, and

(b) the Board are of opinion that, if an application for

separate assessment under section 38(1) or 38(2) of this Act had been in force with respect to the year for which the assessment is made, an assessment in respect of, or of part of, the same income would have fallen to be made on, or on the trustee, guardian, curator, receiver or committee of, or on the executors or administrators of, a woman who is the said man’s wife, or was his wife in that year of assessment, and

amount remaining unpaid thereunder, and

(ii) giving particulars, to the best of their judgment, of the

assessment which would have fallen to be made as aforesaid,

and requiring the person on whom the notice is served to pay the amount which would have been payable under the last-mentioned assessment if it conformed with those particulars, or the amount remaining unpaid under the original assessment, whichever is the less.

the tax, with or without interest, and

(b) priority for the tax in bankruptcy, or in the administration of the estate of a deceased person, and

the stating of cases for the opinion of the High Court, and

(d) the ultimate incidence of the liability imposed,

shall follow on the service of a notice under subsection (1) above on a woman, or on her trustee, guardian, curator, receiver or committee, or on her executors or administrators, as would have followed on the making on her, or on her trustee, guardian, curator, receiver or committee, or on her executors or administrators, as the case may be, of such an assessment as is referred to in paragraph (b) of that subsection, being an assessment which—

(i) was made on the day of the service of the notice, and

(ii) charged the same amount of income tax as is required

to be paid by the notice, and

(iii) fell to be made, and was made, by the authority who made the original assessment, and

Provided that, where an appeal against the original assessment has been heard in whole or in part by the Special Commissioners, any appeal from the notice shall be an appeal to the Special Commissioners, and where an appeal against the original assessment has been heard in whole or in part by the General Commissioners for any division, any appeal from the notice shall be an appeal to the General Commissioners for that division.

(3) Where a notice is given under subsection (1) above, income tax up to the amount required to be paid by the notice shall cease to be recoverable under the original assessment, and, where the tax charged by the original assessment carried interest under section 86 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, such adjustment shall be made of the amount payable under that section in relation to that assessment, and such repayment shall be made of any amounts previously paid under that section in relation thereto, as are necessary to secure that the total sum, if any, paid or payable under that section in relation to that assessment is the same as it would have been if the amount which ceases to be recoverable had never been charged.

(4) Where the amount payable under a notice given under subsection (1) above is reduced as the result of an appeal, or of the stating of a case for the opinion of the High Court—

(a) the Board shall, if in the light of that result they are

satisfied that the original assessment was excessive, cause such relief to be given by way of repayment or otherwise as appears to them to be just, but

(b) subject to any relief so given, a sum equal to the reduc-

tion in the amount payable under the notice shall again become recoverable under the original assessment.

(5) The Board and the inspector shall have the like powers of obtaining information with a view to the giving of, and otherwise in connection with, a notice under subsection (1) above as they would have had with a view to the making of, and otherwise in connection with, such an assessment as is referred to in paragraph (b) of that subsection if the necessary conditions had been fulfilled for the making of such an assessment.

Provided that a notice under this section shall not be deemed to be validly served on the inspector unless it specifies the names and addresses of the woman’s executors or administrators.

(2) Where such a notice has been duly served on a woman’s executors or administrators and on the inspector—

(a) it shall be the duty of the Board to exercise such powers

as they may then or thereafter be entitled to exercise under section 40 above in connection with any assessment made on or before the date when the service of the notice is completed, being an assessment in respect of any of the income to which the notice relates, and

(b) the assessments (if any), whether to income tax other

than surtax or to surtax, which may be made after that date shall in all respects, and in particular as respects the persons assessable and the tax payable, be the assessments which would have fallen to be made if—

(i) an application for separate assessment under section 38(1) or 38(2) above, as the case may be, had been in force in respect of the year of assessment in question, and

(ii) all assessments previously made had been made accordingly.

Provided (hat, where this subsection applies and the net aggregate amount of income tax (including surtax) falling to be borne by the husband and the wife for the year is greater than it would have been but for the provisions of this subsection, the Board shall cause such relief to be given (by the reduction of such assessments on the husband or the wife or the repayment of such tax paid (by deduction or otherwise) by the husband or the wife as the Board may direct) as will reduce the said net aggregate amount by the amount of the excess.

Deductions and allowances

71. —(1) In computing for the purposes of Schedule A the profits or gains arising to a person in any chargeable period, such deductions shall be made from any rents or receipts to which he becomes entitled in the period as are provided for by sections 72 to 77 below, subject however to the provisions of Schedule 2 to this Act.

(2) In those sections and that Schedule—

references to a lease extend only to a lease conferring a right, as against the person whose interest is subject to the lease, to the possession of premises,

“ rent ” includes a payment made by the tenant to defray the cost of work of maintenance of, or repairs to, the demised premises, not being work required by the lease to be carried out by the tenant, and

“ tenant’s repairing lease ” means a lease where the lessee is under an obligation to maintain and repair the whole, or substantially the whole, of the premises comprised in the lease;

and for the purposes of the said sections and Schedule, a lease shall be taken to be at a full rent if the rent reserved under the lease (including an appropriate sum in respect of any premium under the lease) is sufficient, taking one year with another, to defray the cost to the lessor of fulfilling his obligations under the lease and of meeting any expenses of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the premises subject to the lease which fall to be borne by him. 72

72. —(1) The deductions which, by virtue of section 71(1) above, may be made from rent to which a person (hereinafter referred to as “ the person chargeable ”) becomes entitled under a lease shall be such deductions as are provided by subsections (2) to (6) below of the amounts of payments made by him—

(a) in respect of maintenance, repairs, insurance or

management,

(b) in respect of any services provided by him otherwise

(2) From rent to which the person chargeable becomes entitled in a chargeable period, there may be deducted the amount of any such payment as aforesaid which became due in that period, or at an earlier time falling within the currency of the lease, in so far as the payment—

(a) was made in respect of the premises comprised in the

lease, and

(b) in the case of a payment for maintenance or repairs,

was incurred by reason of dilapidation attributable to a period falling within the currency of the lease or, in the case of any other payment, was incurred in respect of such a period:

Provided that where the person chargeable became the landlord after the lease began, references in this subsection to the currency of the lease shall not include any time before he became the landlord.

(3) In the case of a lease at a full rent, subsection (2) above shall apply as if references to the currency of the lease included any period (hereinafter referred to as “a previous qualifying period ”)—

in relation to a previous lease of the premises, being a lease at a full rent, or

(b) which was a void period beginning either with the termination of a previous such lease as aforesaid or with the acquisition by the person chargeable of the interest in the premises giving him the right to possession thereof,

so however that a period shall not be a previous qualifying period if it preceded a period ending before the beginning of the lease which was not itself a previous qualifying period.

Where during any period the conditions necessary for the period to be a previous qualifying period were fulfilled as respects part of the premises, but not the whole, the period shall be treated as a previous qualifying period as respects that part of the premises only, and this subsection shall apply accordingly, any necessary apportionment being made of rent, payments or other matters. 4

(4) In the case of a lease at a full rent, not being a tenant’s repairing lease, there may also be deducted the amount of any payment made in respect of other premises by the person chargeable—

(a) in so far as that amount could be deducted under subsections (2) and (3) above from rent to which he became entitled in the chargeable period under a lease

of those other premises, being a lease at a full rent, or could be so deducted if that rent were not insufficient, or

(b) if any part of the chargeable period is, in respect of those other premises, a void period beginning with the termination of a lease at a full rent, in so far as the amount could be deducted as aforesaid if the lease had continued until the end of that period.

(5) Where by reason of any change of circumstances a lease ceases to be, or becomes, a tenant’s repairing lease, or ceases to be, or becomes, a lease at a full rent, subsections (3) and (4) above shall apply in relation to the lease as it subsists after the change of circumstances as if it were a new lease granted when the change occurred.

(6) Where the person chargeable retains possession of a part of any premises and that part is used in common by persons respectively occupying other parts of the premises, subsections

(1) to (5) above shall apply as if a payment made in respect of the part used in common had been made in respect of those other parts.

(7) In subsections (3) and (4) above “void period” means a period during which the person chargeable was not in occupation of the premises or any part thereof, but was entitled to possession thereof.

73.—(1) Where this section applies to an estate for a chargeable period, the owner shall be treated—

of that period is not comprised in a lease under which he is the landlord, as if he were entitled under a lease of that part at a full rent (not being a tenant’s repairing lease) to rent for the said portion, becoming due from day to day, at a rate per annum equal to the annual value of that part ascertained in accordance with section 531 of this Act, and

(b) in relation to a part of the estate which for any

portion of the said period is comprised in a lease under which he is the landlord, not being a lease at a full rent, as if the lease were at a full rent, and as if the rent so far as it relates to that part were at a rate per annum not less than the annual value of that part ascertained as aforesaid, and section 72 above shall apply accordingly:

Provided that—

(i) a payment relating to premises comprised in the estate shall not be deductible from rent in respect of premises not so comprised, and

(ii) paragraph (a) above shall not apply to premises occupied Part 1H by the owner wholly and exclusively for purposes connected with the management of the estate or for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation.

(2) This section shall apply to an estate if, at the end of the year 1962-63, the land then comprised therein was managed as one estate and the owner for the time being of the estate by notice in writing to the inspector so elects, but such an election—

(a) must be made within twelve months after the end of the

first chargeable period for which the person making it became entitled to make it or such further time as the Board may allow,

(b) except in the case of the first election that can be made

under this subsection, shall not have effect unless the like election has had effect as respects the immediately preceding ownership, and

(c) shall apply in relation to the estate throughout the

ownership of the person making it.

(3) Where in any chargeable period the estate comprises premises not included in it at the end of the year 1962-63, subsection (1) above (except the proviso) shall apply in relation to the chargeable period as if the premises were not included in the estate in that period:

(4) In this section “ estate ” means land in one ownership managed as one estate.

74—(1) Where a person becomes entitied in a chargeable Deductions period to a sum other than rent payable under a lease, the from receipts deductions to be made from that sum by virtue of section 71(1) other than above shall be such amounts (if any) as are expressed to be1®111* deductible under subsection (2) below.

and constituted an expense of the transaction under which he became entitled to that sum.

(b) so much of any rent, rentcharge. ground annual, feu

duty or other periodical payment made by that person as was reserved in respect of. or was charged upon or issued out of, premises to which the sum relates and constituted an expense of that transaction,

(c) so much of any other payment made by that person

as constituted an expense of that transaction, not being an expense of a capital nature, and

(d) where, in or before the chargeable period, that person

entered into any like transaction, any amount which, under paragraphs (a) to (c) above, is deductible from a sum to which he is entitled under that like transaction in the period, or was deductible from a sum to which he was so entitled in a previous chargeable period but has not been deducted.

75.—(1) Where the person entitled to possession of any land is in the practice of granting sporting rights over the land for payment, but, in any year of assessment, such rights are for any reason not granted by him, the aggregate of any amounts paid by him which, if such rights had been granted in the year, would have been deductible under section 74 above from payments receivable by him in respect of the grant shall be treated for the purposes of section 72(4) above as a deduction which, by virtue of subsection (2) of the said section 72, might have been made by him from rent to which he was entitled for that year under a lease of the land, being a lease at a full rent:

Provided that if in the year sporting rights over the land are exercised—

the aggregate of the said amounts shall be treated as reduced by an amount equal to the price which might reasonably be expected to have been paid for that exercise of the rights if the person exercising them had had to give full consideration therefor.

(2) For the purposes of the proviso to subsection (1) above, an exercise of sporting rights shall be disregarded if it gives rise to a charge to tax under Schedule E by virtue of section 196 of this Act (benefits to directors etc).

(3) Where the person first-mentioned in subsection (1) above Part in is a company, section 250(1) of this Act shall not have effect

(2) Where the whole of that person’s interest in the premises or any part thereof is transferred (whether by operation of law or otherwise) to some other person—

(a) the amount of the payment which he would be so treated as making for the year of assessment in which the transfer takes place shall be treated as being made partly by the transferor and partly by the transferee, as may be just, and

treated as arising by virtue of this subsection shall be deemed to become due when the sum in question becomes payable by the tenant.

(4) Where, as consideration for the variation or waiver of any of the terms of a lease, a sum becomes payable by the tenant otherwise than by way of rent, the lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to have required the payment of a premium to the landlord (in addition to any other premium) of the amount of that sum; but—

(a) in computing tax chargeable by virtue of this subsection,

the duration of the lease shall be treated as not including any period which precedes the time at which the variation or waiver takes effect, or falls after the time at which it ceases to have effect, and

treated as arising by virtue of this subsection shall be deemed to become due when the contract providing for the variation or waiver is entered into.

(5) Where a payment falling within subsection (1), (3) or (4) above is due to a person other than the landlord, no charge to tax shall arise under that subsection, but any amount which would otherwise fall to be treated as rent shall be treated as profits or gains of that other person chargeable under Case VI of Schedule D:

was granted, and on the assumption that the negotiations for the at undervalue, lease were at arm’s length, could have required the payment of an additional sum (hereinafter referred to as “ the amount foregone”) by way of premium, or additional premium, for the grant of the lease, then, on any assignment of the lease for a consideration—

(a) where the lease has not previously been assigned, exceeding the premium (if any) for which it was granted, or

the consideration for which it was last assigned,

the amount of the excess, in so far as it is not greater than the amount foregone reduced by the amount of any such excess arising on a previous assignment of the lease, shall, in the same proportion as the amount foregone would under section 80(1) above have fallen to be treated as rent if it had been a premium under the lease, be treated as profits or gains of the assignor chargeable to tax under Case VI of Schedule D.

(2) If there is submitted to the inspector, by the grantor or any assignor or assignee of the lease, a statement showing whether or not a charge to tax arises or may arise under this section and, if so, the amount on which the charge arises or may arise, then, if the inspector is satisfied as to the accuracy of the statement, he shall certify the accuracy thereof.

(b) there shall be repaid to the vendor, on a claim made before the expiry of six years after the date on which the reconveyance takes place, any amount by which tax assessed on him by virtue of this section exceeded the amount which would have been so assessed if that date had been treated for the purposes of this section as the date fixed by the terms of the sale.

(3) Where the terms of the sale provide for the grant of a lease directly or indirectly out of the estate or interest to the vendor or a person who is, within the terms of section 533 of this Act, connected with him, this section shall apply as if the grant of the lease were a reconveyance of the estate or interest at a price equal to the sum of the amount of the premium (if any) for the lease and the value at the date of the sale of the right to receive a conveyance of the reversion immediately after the lease begins to run:

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

187

Provided that where a person would, apart from this subsection, be so chargeable in respect of a lease or disposition which extends to a part only of the said premises, the amount on which he is so chargeable shall, where no claim is or can be made by him under the said section 80(6), be the excess (if any) of the later chargeable amount over so much of the appropriate fraction of the amount chargeable on the superior interest as, on a just apportionment, is attributable to that part of the premises.

(2) Where in relation to any premises tax has or would have become chargeable as mentioned in subsection (l)(a) or (b) above in respect of a lease, estate or interest, then, subject to subsection (3) below, the person for the time being entitled to the lease, estate or interest shall be treated for the purpose of deductions under sections 72 and 73 above from rent receivable by him in respect of those or other premises as paying rent for those premises (in addition to any actual rent), becoming due from day to day, during any part of the period in respect of which the amount chargeable on the superior interest arose for which he was entitled to the lease, estate or interest, and in all bearing to that amount the same proportion as that part of the period bears to the whole.

Provided that where the lease so granted, or the said disposition, extends to a part only of the premises, the said subsection (2) and this subsection shall be applied separately in relation to that part and to the remainder of the premises, but as if for any reference to the amount chargeable on the superior interest there were substituted a reference to that amount proportionately adjusted.

extension of the lease beyond a given date by notice given by the tenant, account may be taken of any circumstances making it likely that the lease will be so extended.

(7) Where the amount chargeable arose under section 82 of this Act and the reconveyance or grant in question takes place at a price different from that taken in calculating that amount, or on a date different from that taken in determining the relevant period, the preceding provisions of this section shall be deemed to have had effect (for all relevant chargeable periods) as they would have had effect if the actual price or date had been so taken, and such adjustment of liability to tax shall be made, by means of an assessment or otherwise, as may be necessary, and may be so made at any time at which it could be made if it related only to tax for the chargeable period in which the reconveyance or grant takes place.

135. Where section 154 or 251(1) of this Act applies to treat a trade, profession or vocation as discontinued by reason of any event, then, in computing for tax purposes the profits or gains of the trade, profession or vocation in any period after the event there may be deducted a sum equal to any amount proved during that period to be irrecoverable in respect of any debts credited in computing for tax purposes the profits or gains for any period before the event (being debts the benefit of which was assigned to the persons carrying on the trade, profession or vocation after the event), in so far as the total amount proved to be irrecoverable in respect of those debts exceeds any deduction allowed in respect of them under section 130(i) above in a computation for any period before the event.

(b) if the stock does not fall to be valued under paragraph

(a) above, its value shall be taken to be the amount which it would have realised if it had been sold in the open market at the discontinuance of the trade.

For the purposes of this section “ trading stock ”, in relation to a trade, includes also any services, article or material which would, if the trade were a profession or vocation, be treated as work in progress thereof for the purposes of section 138 below, and references to the sale or transfer of trading stock shall be construed accordingly.

(a) if the work is transferred for money or any other valu-

able consideration to a person who carries on, or intends to carry on, a profession or vocation in the United Kingdom, and the cost of the work may be deducted by that person as an expense in computing for any such purpose the profits or gains of that profession or vocation, the value of the work shall be taken to be the amount paid or other consideration given for the transfer, and

(b) if the work does not fall to be valued under paragraph

(a) above, its value shall be taken to be the amount which would have been paid for a transfer thereof on the date of the discontinuance as between parties at arm’s length.

(3) Where a profession or vocation is discontinued, and the person by whom it was carried on immediately before the discontinuance so elects by notice in writing sent to the inspector at any time within twelve months after the discontinuance, the amount (if any) by which the value of the work in progress at

the discontinuance (as ascertained under subsection (1) above) Part VI exceeds the actual cost of the work shall not be brought into Chapter IV account in computing the profits or gains of the period immediately before the discontinuance, but the amount by which any sums received for the transfer of the work exceed the actual cost of the work shall be included in the sums chargeable to tax by virtue of section 143 below as if it were a sum to which that section applies received after the discontinuance.

(4) Subsections (1) to (3) above shall apply where a profession or vocation is treated under section 154 or 251(1) of this Act as permanently discontinued as they apply in the case of an actual discontinuance, but shall not apply in a case where a profession or vocation carried on by a single individual is discontinued by reason of his death.

in the performance of any such services,

and references in this section to the transfer of work in progress shall include references to the transfer of any benefits and rights which accrue, or might be reasonably expected to accrue, from the carrying out of the work.

(6) If the lessor of tied premises outside the United Kingdom is chargeable to tax for any chargeable period in respect of the profits or gains of the relevant trade, he shall not be liable for that period (or for the part of it during which he carries on the said trade) to tax under Case V of Schedule D in respect of any rent for the premises.

(5) Where, on a person’s acquisition of an asset, the asset or the interest or right in or over it received by him falls to be taken into account for the purposes of tax as a receipt of an income nature (whether as his receipt or another’s), or would fall to be so taken into account if he (or, as the case may be, that other) were chargeable to tax in respect of the whole of his income, his acquisition shall for the purposes of Case VQ be deemed to be for a consideration equal to the amount or value attributed to the asset, or the interest or right in or over it, for that purpose.

163.—(1) In relation to assets held by a person—

(a) as nominee for another person, or

(b) as trustee for another person absolutely entitled as

against the trustee, or for another person who would be so entitled but for being an infant or other person under disability, or for two or more persons who are or would be jointly so entitled,

this Chapter shall apply as if the property were vested in, and the acts of the nominee or trustee in relation to the assets were the acts of, the person or persons for whom he is nominee or trustee (acquisitions from or disposals to him by that person or persons being disregarded accordingly).

Part VI (2) In relation to settled property, the trustees of the settle-Chaptbr vm ment shall for the purposes of Case VII be treated as being a single and continuing body of persons (distinct from the persons who may from time to time be the trustees), and that body shall be treated as being resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom unless the general administration of the trusts is ordinarily carried on outside the United Kingdom and the trustees, or a majority of them for the time being, are not resident or not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom:

Provided that a person carrying on a business which consists of or includes the management of trusts, and acting as trustee of a trust in the course of that business, shall be treated in relation to that trust as not resident in the United Kingdom if the whole of the settled property consists of or derives from property provided by a person not at the time (or, in the case of a trust arising under a testamentary disposition, or on an intestacy or partial intestacy, at his death) domiciled, resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom; and, in relation to disposals of assets after 5th April 1969, if in such a case the trustees or a majority of them are, or are treated in relation to that trust as, not resident in the United Kingdom, the general administration of the trust shall be treated as ordinarily carried on outside the United Kingdom.

For the purposes of this subsection, where part of the property comprised in a settlement is vested in one trustee or set of trustees and part in another (and, in particular, where settled 1925 c. 18. land within the meaning of the Settled Land Act 1925 is vested in the tenant for life, and investments representing capital money are vested in the trustees of the settlement), they shall be treated as together constituting and, in so far as they act separately, as acting on behalf of a single body of trustees.

(3) Subsection (2) above shall apply in relation to property forming part of the estate of a deceased person and to his personal representatives as it applies in relation to settled property and to trustees of a settlement, but personal representatives shall not be chargeable to tax in respect of an acquisition and disposal by reference to the vesting of the property of the deceased in them.

(4) A person acquiring assets as legatee shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal by reference to that acquisition; nor, in the case of settled property, shall a person be chargeable under that Case in respect of any acquisition and disposal of a beneficial interest under the settlement.

(5) Where a person entitled to an asset by way of security, or to the benefit of a charge or incumbrance on an asset, deals with the asset for the purpose of enforcing or giving effect

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

255

to the security, charge or incumbrance, his dealings with it shall Part VI be treated for the purposes of Case VII as if they were done Chapter vm through him as nominee by the person entitled to it subject to the security, charge or incumbrance; and this subsection shall apply to the dealings of any person appointed to enforce or give effect to the security, charge or incumbrance as receiver, receiver and manager or judicial factor as it applies to the dealings of the person entitled as aforesaid.

(6) For the purposes of subsection (1) above, assets held by a person as trustee or assignee in bankruptcy, or under a deed of arrangement, shall be regarded as assets to which the bankrupt or debtor is absolutely entitled as against the trustee or assignee; and, without prejudice to the general provisions of the Income Tax Acts as to the assessment of any such trustee or assignee, tax in respect of any gain accruing on an acquisition and disposal shall be assessable on and recoverable from any such trustee or assignee not only where the acquisition and disposal were effected by him, but also where either the acquisition or the disposal was effected by him and the other was effected by the bankrupt or debtor.

(7) Assets vesting in a trustee in bankruptcy after the death of the bankrupt, or held by a trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or under a deed of arrangement at the death of the bankrupt or debtor, shall for the purposes of Case VII be regarded as held by a personal representative of the deceased, and subsection

(6) above shall not apply after the death.

164.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the gain Computation accruing to a person from his acquisition and disposal of any of gains, asset shall be computed for the purposes of Case VII in the same way as it would fall to be computed for the purposes of Case I of Schedule D if the acquisition and disposal (together with anything done by him to or in relation to the asset in connection with the acquisition and disposal, or with a view to the disposal) had been an adventure in the nature of trade (but so that no dividend or interest in respect of which income tax has been borne by deduction or otherwise shall be brought into the computation as a receipt).

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not be treated as applying for the purposes of Case VII any provision as to the period of computation of profits for the purposes of the said Case I, but the gain accruing on any disposal of an asset shall be computed in one sum as from the relevant acquisition (or first relevant acquisition).

(3) No interest shall be allowable in computing the amount of a gain under Case VII.

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

Part VI (4) Subject to the following subsections, the adventure by Chapter vm reference to which the gain on an acquisition and disposal is to be computed—

(a) shall not be treated as relating to any assets not included

in the disposal, or to any interest not so included in assets which are so included, whether or not the assets or interest not so included were or was included in a relevant acquisition of the assets disposed of,

(b) shall not be treated as relating to assets included in the

disposal which either are not chargeable assets or were not included in a relevant acquisition, and

(c) subject to paragraph (b) above shall be treated as

relating—

(i) to all assets included in the same disposal, whether or not included in the same acquisition, and

(ii) to all relevant acquisitions of those assets, and

(iii) to the whole interest included in the disposal in any assets to which the adventure relates, whether or not the whole interest was included in any relevant acquisition;

and all necessary apportionments shall be made accordingly of the consideration for any acquisition or disposal, or of any receipts or expenditure, including in particular, in the case of land, apportionments between the interest disposed of and an interest retained of receipts and expenditure in connection with the land.

(5) If, in the case of any asset, the interest to which die adventure relates does not derive wholly from one or more relevant acquisitions, then the gain shall be computed as if such part of that interest as derives from any other acquisition had been first appropriated to the adventure immediately before the disposal.

(6) If, in the case of land, there is included in the disposal, besides the land to which the adventure relates, any adjoining or neighbouring land, being chargeable assets and not being land acquired as legatee, so much (if any) of the consideration for the disposal as represents an enhancement due to a relevant acquisition of the first-mentioned land in the value of the adjoining or neighbouring land shall, on the apportionment of the consideration, be apportioned to the first-mentioned land. 7

(7) If, in the case of land, the disposal is subject to an interest created by any such letting of the land as is excepted from Case VII by section 166(2) below, and the letting was made

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

257

by the person disposing of the land, and made by him since Part VI a relevant acquisition, the adventure shall be treated as extending Chapter vm to that letting to the same extent as if the interest thereby created had been included in the disposal.

(8) An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any relevant acquisition of it, and as being disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting at the time of the disposal.

(9) For the purposes of this section—

(a) “ relevant acquisition ” means, in relation to any dis-

posal of an asset, an acquisition which, with that disposal, amounts to an acquisition and disposal within the meaning of this Chapter, except that it does not include an acquisition by reference to which tax is not chargeable, nor an acquisition from which no interest included in the disposal derives, and

(b) an interest included in a disposal shall be treated as

deriving from an acquisition if, without that acquisition, the whole interest could not have been so included, but so that the part of that interest which does, and the part which does not, derive from relevant acquisitions shall be determined as if any interest of temporary duration subsisting at the time of the first relevant acquisition (other than an interest of such a duration as to expire before the time of the disposal) had been of the same duration at the time of the disposal.

165,—(1) There shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Exemption Case VII a gain accruing from the acquisition and disposal of for chattels an asset which is tangible movable property if the amount or I?1™?* lesa value of the consideration for the disposal does not exceed marginal’ £1,000; and the amount of income tax (including surtax) charge- relief, able under that Case in respect of a gain accruing from the acquisition and disposal of any such asset for a consideration exceeding £1,000 shall not exceed half the difference between that consideration and £1,000.

Subject to section 529 of this Act, the amount of the gain on which income tax is so chargeable shall be deemed for the purposes of this subsection to be the highest part of the income of the person charged for the year of assessment in question.

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not affect subsection (4) of section 160 of this Act (Case VII losses), but, for the purposes of the said subsection (4), the consideration for the disposal of any asset which is tangible movable property shall, if less than £1,000 be deemed to be £1,000, and losses allowable under that subsection shall be restricted accordingly.

(a) to the same person, or

(b) to persons who are acting in concert, or are connected

persons within the terms of section 533 of this Act,

those assets shall be treated for the purposes of subsections

(1) and (2) above as a single asset, but with any necessary apportionments of the reductions in tax, and in allowable losses, under those subsections.

(4) In applying subsections (1) and (2) above in a case where the disposal is of a right or interest in or over tangible movable property—

(a) in the first instance, those subsections shall be applied

in relation to the asset as a whole, taking the consideration as including the market value of what remains undisposed of, in addition to the actual consideration,

(b) where the sum of the actual consideration and that

market value exceeds £1,000, the limitation on the amount of income tax (including surtax) in subsection

(1) shall be to half the difference between that sum and £1,000 multiplied by the fraction equal to the actual consideration divided by the said sum, and

(c) where that sum is less than £1,000, any loss shall be

restricted under subsection (2) by deeming the actual consideration to be the actual consideration plus the said fraction of the difference between the said sum and £1,000.

(5) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not apply—

(a) in relation to a disposal of commodities of any de-

scription by a person dealing on a terminal market, or dealing with or through a person ordinarily engaged in dealing on a terminal market, or

(b) in relation to a disposal of currency of any description.

166.—(1) Where an individual disposes by way of gift of an asset the market value of which at the time of the gift does not exceed £100, any gains accruing to the donor on the disposal shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII, but this subsection, taken together with section 27(2) of the Finance Act 1965 (which confers a similar exemption for the purposes of capital gains tax), shall not apply to gifts made by the same individual in the same year of assessment the total market value of which exceeds £100, taking the market value of any gift at the time of the gift.

(2) Except as provided by section 164(7) above, a person dis- Part VI posing of land by letting it for a term of less than twenty-one Chapter vm years shall not be chargeable under Case VII in respect of any acquisition and disposal by reference to that disposal, unless the

letting is accompanied by another letting, or agreement for another letting, such that die combined terms amount to twenty-one years or over, or by an agreement to dispose of the land otherwise than by letting it

(3) If a claim is made under subsection (1) or (2) of section

33 of the Finance Act 1965 (capital gains tax relief in connec- 1965 c. 25. don with replacement of business assets)—

ia) that section shall apply as if references in those subsections to the purposes of Part III of that Act included references to the purposes of this Chapter, and

(b) tax shall not be chargeable under Case VII on a gain accruing to the claimant from the acquisition and disposal of, or of the interest in, the new assets unless the period between the date when the claimant acquired the old assets, or the interest in die old assets, and the date when he disposed of the new assets, or the interest in the new assets, is twelve months or less.

(4) This Chapter has effect subject to the provisions of paragraph 15 of Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1969 (postpone- 1969 c. 32. ment of charge in respect of business assets where business transferred to company as going concern).

(5) A gain shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII if accruing from the acquisition and disposal by any person of a decoration awarded for valour or gallant conduct which he acquired otherwise than for consideration in money or money’s worth.

CHAPTER I

Incomb Tax Trade etc. losses

168.—(1) Where any person sustains a loss in any trade, profession, employment or vocation carried on by him either solely or in partnership, he may, by notice in writing given within two years after the year of assessment, make a claim for relief from income tax on an amount of his income equal to the amount of the loss.

(2) Relief may be given under subsection (1) above in respect of a person’s loss sustained in the last preceding year of assessment in any trade, profession, employment or vocation still carried on by him in the year for which the claim is made, in so far as relief in respect of that loss has not already been given under that subsection or otherwise; and where relief is claimed by virtue of this subsection, it shall be given in priority to any relief under the said subsection (1) in respect of a loss sustained in the year for which the relief is claimed.

(3) A claim for relief under this section may contain either or both of the following requirements—

(a) that the relief be given only by reference to the income of the person sustaining the loss, without extending to the income of that person’s wife or husband;

(h) that the relief be given without any reference to income treated by virtue of Chapter V of Part I of this Act (aggregation of child’s income with that of parent) as income of the person sustaining the loss or of that person’s wife or husband.

(4) Subject to any requirement under subsection (3) above, relief under this section shall be given in respect of a loss sustained by any person by treating the loss as reducing first his income of the corresponding class, then his other income, then the income of the corresponding class of that person’s wife or husband, then the wife or husband’s other income, and then income treated by virtue of the said Chapter V as income of that person or that person’s wife or husband.

For the purposes of this subsection, “income of the corresponding class” means earned or unearned income according as income arising during the same period as the loss to the person sustaining it from profits or gains of the same trade.

(5) Where relief under this section has been given to a person for any year of assessment, he shall not be entitled, in computing the amount of the assessment for any subsequent year, to a deduction of any portion of the amount in respect of which such relief has been obtained.

(6) Where there is in any year of assessment a change on which a trade, profession or vocation is treated under section 154(1) of this Act as permanently discontinued, and a person engaged in carrying on the trade, profession or vocation immediately before the change continues to be so engaged immediately after it, the trade, profession or vocation carried on by him immediately before and immediately after the change shall, notwithstanding the discontinuance, be treated as the same trade, profession or vocation for the purposes of subsection (2) above, except as respects the computation of profits or gains and losses.

(7) For the purposes of this section, the amount of a loss sustained in a trade shall be computed in like manner as the profits or gains arising or accruing from the trade are computed under the provisions of the Income Tax Acts applicable to Case I of Schedule D.

(8) This section applies in relation to losses sustained in the occupation of woodlands in respect of which a person has elected under section 111 of this Act to be charged to income tax under Schedule D as it applies in relation to losses sustained in a trade.

169.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, any claim Extension of made under section 168 above for relief in respect of a loss right of set-off sustained by the claimant in any trade in any year of assessmentt0 capital (hereafter referred to as “ the year of loss ”) may require the ailowances. amount of that loss to be determined as if an amount equal to the capital allowances for the year of assessment for which the year of loss is the basis year were to be deducted in computing the profits or gains or losses of the trade in the year of loss; and a claim may be so made notwithstanding that, apart from those allowances, the claimant has not sustained a loss in the trade in the year of loss.

(2) Capital allowances for any year of assessment shall be taken into account by virtue of this section only if and so far as they are not required to offset balancing charges for the year; and, for the purposes of this subsection, the capital allowances for a year of assessment shall be treated as required to offset balancing charges for the year up to the amount on


264

1968 c. 3.

which the balancing charges fall to be made after deducting from .that amount the amount (if any) of capital allowances for earlier years which is carried forward to that year and would, without the balancing charges, be non-effective in that year.

(3) Where the capital allowances taken into account by virtue of this section are those for the year of assessment for which the claim is made or for the preceding year (the year of loss being the basis year for that year itself, or the claim being made by way of carry-forward of the loss by virtue of section 168(2) above), relief shall not be given by reference to those allowances in respect of an amount greater than the amount non-effective in the year for which the claim is made, or, in the case of allowances for the preceding year, the amount non-effective in both years.

(4) For the purposes of this section—

(a) where the end of the basis period for a year of assess-

ment (as defined in section 72 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968) falls in, or coincides with the end of, any year of assessment, that year is the basis year for the first-mentioned year of assessment, but so that, if a year of assessment would under the foregoing provision be the basis year both for that year itself and for another year of assessment, it shall be the basis year for the year itself and not for the other year,

(b) any reference to the capital allowances or balancing

charges for a year of assessment shall be construed as a reference to those falling to be made in taxing the trade for that year (but not including, in the case of allowances, any part of the allowances for an earlier year carried forward under section 70(4) of the said Act of 1968),

(c) any reference to an amount of capital allowances non-

effective in a year shall be construed as referring to the amount to which, by reason of an insufficiency of profits or gains, effect cannot be given in taxing the trade for the year, and

(d) effect shall be deemed to be given in taxing the trade to

allowances carried forward from an earlier year before it is given to allowances arising in a later year.

(5) Where, on a claim made by virtue of this section, relief is not given under section 168 above for the full amount of the loss determined as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, the relief shall be referred as far as may be to the loss sustained by the claimant in the trade rather than to the capital allowances in respect of the trade.

(6) Subject to subsection (7) below, where for any year of assessment relief is given under section 168 above by reference to any capital allowances, then, for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, effect shall be deemed to have been given to those allowances up to the amount in respect of which relief is so given, as if (in accordance with section 70(2) of the Capital Allowances Act 1968) a deduction in respect thereof had been allowed in taxing the trade for that year, or, in the case of allowances for the following year, in taxing the trade for that following year; and any relief previously given for a subsequent year on the basis that effect had not been given to the allowances as aforesaid shall be adjusted where necessary by an assessment

(7) Where, in any year of assessment, a trade is permanently discontinued, or is treated for the purposes of section 154 above as permanently discontinued, and, immediately before the discontinuance, the trade was being carried on in partnership, then, notwithstanding subsection (6) above, for the purposes of any claim for relief made by virtue of section 171(4)(c) or 174 below and relating to that discontinuance, effect shall not be deemed to have been given either—

(a) to any part of the capital allowances falling to be made

in taxing the trade for that year by reason of relief given under section 168 above by reference to those allowances, or

(b) to any part of the capital allowances falling to be made

in taxing the trade for the preceding year by reason of relief so given by reference to them, in so far as that relief must be referred to the part of the allowances apportionable to the part of the year within twelve months of the discontinuance on an apportionment made by reference to the comparative lengths of the two parts of the year,

but where the same partner claims relief both under section 168 above and under one or other of sections 171(4) and 174 below in respect of the same allowances, the total amount for which relief is to be given to him by reference thereto shall not exceed the greater of the amounts for which, apart from any deficiency of income, relief might have been given under either section separately, and the total amount for which relief is to be given to all the partners under those sections in respect of any allowances shall not in any event exceed the amount of the allowances to which effect has not been given apart from those sections. 8

(8) Where a person claiming relief under section 168 above has, since the end of the year for which the claim is made, carried on the trade in question in partnership, effect shall not be given to this section in relation to that claim except with the

written consent of, or of the personal representatives of, every other person who has been engaged in carrying on the trade between the end of that year and the making of the claim:

Provided that, where the claim is for a loss sustained before an event treated as the permanent discontinuance of the trade, this subsection shall not require the consent of any person as having been so engaged since that discontinuance, or as the personal representative of such a person.

(9) Relief from tax may be given by virtue of this section by reference to capital allowances for a year of assessment before the passing of any Act granting income tax for that year, as if income tax had been granted for the year without alteration; but if relief given to a person by virtue of this section for any year of assessment is affected by a subsequent alteration of the law, or by any discontinuance of the trade or other event occurring after the end of the year, any necessary adjustment may be made, and so much of any repayment of tax as exceeded the amount repayable in the events that happened may, if not otherwise made good, be assessed under Case VI of Schedule D and recovered from that person accordingly.

(10) This section applies (with any necessary adaptations) in relation to a profession, employment or vocation, and in relation to the occupation of woodlands the profits or gains of which are assessable under Schedule D by virtue of an election under section 111 of this Act, as it applies in relation to a trade.

170.—(1) A loss (including any amount in respect of capital allowances which, by virtue of section 169 above, is to be treated as a loss) shall not be available for relief under section 168 above unless it is shown that, for the year of assessment in which the loss is claimed to have been sustained, the trade was being carried on on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits in the trade or, where the carrying on of the trade formed part of a larger undertaking, in the undertaking as a whole:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply—

(a) to a loss made, or an allowance in respect of expenditure

incurred, by any person in the exercise of functions conferred by or under any enactment (including an enactment contained in a local or private Act), or

(b) to an allowance in respect of expenditure incurred before 6th April 1960.

(2) Where during a year of assessment there is a change in the manner in which a trade is being carried on, it shall be treated for the purposes of this section as having been carried

Part vn In the application of this section to a loss sustained by a

Chapter I partner in a partnership, “ the amount of profits or gains on

which he is assessed ” shall, in respect of any year, be taken to mean such portion of the amount on which the partnership is assessed to income tax under Schedule D in respect of the trade, profession or vocation as he would be required to include in a return of his total income for that year.

(2) Any relief under this section shall be given as far as possible from the first subsequent assessment, and, so far as it cannot be so given, then from the next assessment, and so on.

(3) Where in any year of assessment relief cannot be given, or cannot be wholly given, in respect of a loss carried forward under this section because the amount of the profits or gains of the trade assessed under Case I of Schedule D for that year is insufficient, any interest or dividends on investments arising in that year, being interest or dividends which would fall to be taken into account as trading receipts in computing the profits or gains of the trade for the purpose of assessment under that Case but for the fact that they have been subjected to tax under other provisions of the Income Tax Acts, shall be treated for the purposes of the application of this section as if they were profits or gains on winch the person carrying on the trade was assessed under the said Case I in respect of that trade for that year of assessment, and relief shall be given accordingly by repayment or otherwise.

(4) Where there is in any year of assessment a change on which a trade, profession or vocation is treated under section 154 above as permanently discontinued, and a person engaged

. in carrying on the trade, profession or vocation immediately before the change continues to be so engaged immediately after it, then—

(a) the trade, profession or vocation carried on by him

immediately before and immediately after the change shall, notwithstanding the discontinuance, be treated as the same trade, profession or vocation for the purposes of this section, except as respects the computation of profits or gains and losses, and

(b) in respect of a loss sustained by him in the trade,

profession or vocation in the part of the said year before the change, relief shall be given under this section from the assessment relating to the part of the year after the change as if it were an assessment for a subsequent year, and

of any capital allowances falling to be made in taxing the trade, profession or vocation for that part of that year.

For the purposes of paragraph (c) above, the persons engaged in carrying on the trade, profession or vocation immediately before the change shall be treated as entitled to capital allowances in the shares in which they are then entitled to the profits of the trade, profession or vocation, and “ the non-effective amount ” means, in relation to any such allowances, the amount to which, because of an insufficiency of profits or gains, effect cannot be given in taxing the trade, profession or vocation.

(5) Where a loss is sustained by a person in the occupation of woodlands, and that person, if he had made a profit, would by reason of his election under section 111 of this Act have been chargeable for the following year to income tax under Schedule D computed on the amount of that profit, this section shall apply so as to give relief in respect of that loss in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if it were a loss sustained in a trade.

(6) In so far as relief in respect of any loss has been given to any person under this section, that person shall not be entitled to claim relief in respect of that loss under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts.

(7) So far as a claim under this section concerns the amount of the loss for any year of assessment after the year 1964-65, it must be made within six years after the year of assessment in question; but the question whether any and, if so, how much relief on that amount should be given under this section against tax for any year of assessment may be the subject of a separate claim made not later than six years after that year of assessment.

172.—(1) Whereto) a business carried on by any individual, or any individuals in partnership, has been transferred to a company in consideration solely or mainly of the allotment of shares of the company to that individual or those individuals, and

(2) Where, under the said section 171 as applied by subsection

(1) above, a loss falls to be deducted from or set off against any income for any year of assessment, the deduction or set-off shall be made in the first place against that part, if any, of the income in respect of which the individual has been, or is liable to be, assessed to tax for that year.

(3) This section, in its application to the year of assessment in which a business is transferred, shall have effect as if, for the reference in subsection (l)(b) to the year of assessment throughout which the individual is the beneficial owner of the shares and the business is carried on by the company, there were substituted a reference to the period from the date of transfer to the following 5th April.

(2) Relief shall not be allowed by virtue of this section in respect of any payment, or part of a payment, which is not ultimately borne by the person assessed, or which is charged to capital.

(3) This section shall not apply—

Provided that relief shall not be given in respect of the same matter both under this section and under some other provision of the Income Tax Acts.

(2) Any relief under this section shall be given as far as possible from the assessment for a later rather than an earlier year.

(3) Where a claim under this section is made in respect of a terminal loss sustained in a trade, and relief cannot be given, or cannot be wholly given, against the profits or gains of the trade charged to income tax under Schedule D for any year because the amount of those profits or gains is insufficient, any interest or dividends on investments arising in that year, being interest or dividends which would fall to be taken into account as trading receipts in computing the profits or gains of the trade for the purpose of assessment under Case I of that Schedule but for the fact that they have been subjected to tax under other provisions of the Income Tax Acts, shall be treated for the purposes of the application of this section as if they were profits or gains on which the person carrying on the trade was assessed under the said Case I in respect of that trade for that year of assessment, and relief shall be given accordingly by repayment or otherwise.

(5) The question whether a person has sustained any and, if so, what terminal loss in a trade, profession or vocation shall be determined for the purposes of this section by taking the amounts (if any) of the following, in so far as they have not otherwise been taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to tax—

(a) the loss sustained by him in the trade, profession or

vocation in the year of assessment in which it is permanently discontinued,

(a) in subsection (1) above, “ the amount of profits or gains on which he has been charged to income tax ” shall be taken to mean, in respect of any year or part of a year for which the partnership was assessed in respect of the trade, profession or vocation, such portion of the amount of the profits or gains on which the partnership has been, or is treated by virtue of subsection (4) above as having been, charged to income tax in respect of it for that year or part of a year as would be required to be included in a return of his total income for that year,

(b) any reduction in the amount of his terminal loss which

falls to be made under the said subsection (4) by reason of profits or gains having been applied by the partnership in any such year or part of a year in making any payment shall be limited to the same proportion of the profits or gains brought into charge which were so applied, and

(c) if he was carrying on the trade, profession or vocation

immediately before the discontinuance, the amounts to be included in his terminal loss by virtue of subsection (5 )(b)or id) above shall be such part only of the amounts therein mentioned (in so far as they have not otherwise been taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to tax) as would fall to his share on a division made according to the shares in which the partners were then entitled to the profits of the trade, profession or vocation. 10

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

277

in any succeeding accounting period shall then be treated as reduced by the amount of the loss, or by so much of that amount as cannot, on that claim or on a claim (if made) under subsection (2) below, be relieved against income or profits of an earlier accounting period.

(2) Where in any accounting period a company carrying on a trade incurs a loss in the trade, then (subject to subsection (4) below) the company may make a claim requiring that the loss be set off for the purposes of corporation tax against profits (of whatever description) of that accounting period and, if the company was then carrying on the trade and the claim so requires, of preceding accounting periods ending within the time specified in subsection (3) below; and, subject to that subsection and to any relief for an earlier loss, the profits of any of those periods shall then be treated as reduced by the amount of the loss, or by so much of that amount as cannot be relieved under this subsection against profits of a later accounting period.

(3) The time referred to in subsection (2) above is a time equal in length to the accounting period in which the loss is incurred; but the amount of the reduction which may be made under that subsection in the profits of an accounting period falling partly before that time shall not exceed a part of those profits proportionate to the part of the period falling within that time.

(4) Subsection (2) above shall not apply to trades falling within Case V of Schedule D; and, except in so far as it represents an excess in respect of expenditure incurred before the year 1960-61 of capital allowances over balancing charges, a loss incurred in a trade in any accounting period shall not be relieved under that subsection unless the trade is one carried on in the exercise of functions conferred by or under any enactment (including an enactment contained in a local or private Act), or it is shown that for that accounting period the trade was being carried on on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of gain in the trade or in any larger undertaking of which the trade formed part.

This subsection has effect without prejudice to section 180 below (special restrictions for farming and market gardening).

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4) above, the fact that a trade was being carried on at any time so as to afford a reasonable expectation of gain shall be conclusive evidence that it was then being carried on with a view to the realisation of gain; and where in an accounting period there is a change in the manner in which a trade is being carried on, it shall for those purposes be treated as having throughout the accounting period been carried on in the way in which it was being carried on by the end of that period.

(8) Where in an accounting period the charges on income paid by a company—

(a) exceed the amount of the profits against which they are

deductible, and

(b) include payments made wholly and exclusively for the

purposes of a trade carried on by the company,

then, up to the amount of that excess or of those payments, whichever is the less, the charges on income so paid shall in computing a loss for the purposes of subsection (1) above be deductible as if they were trading expenses of the trade.

(9) In this section references to a company carrying on a trade refer to the company carrying it on so as to be within the charge to corporation tax in respect of it.

in accounting periods falling wholly or partly within the three years preceding those twelve months (or within any less period throughout which the company has carried on the trade); and, subject to subsections (2) to (5) below and to any relief for earlier losses, the trading income of any of those periods shall be then treated as reduced by the amount of the loss, or by so much of that amount as cannot be relieved under this subsection against income of a later accounting period:

Provided that relief shall not be given under this subsection in respect of any loss in so far as the loss has been or can be otherwise taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to tax.

(2) Where a loss is incurred in an accounting period falling partly outside the twelve months mentioned in subsection (1) above, relief shall be given under that subsection in respect of a part only of that loss proportionate to the part of the period falling within those twelve months; and the amount of the reduction which may be made under that subsection in the trading income of an accounting period falling partly outside the three years there mentioned shall not exceed a part of that income proportionate to the part of the period falling within those three years.

(3) A claim for relief under this section may require that capital allowances in respect of the trade, being allowances which fall to be made to the company by way of discharge or repayment of tax, and to be so made for an accounting period falling wholly or partly within the twelve months ending when the company ceases to carry on the trade, shall (so far as they cannot be otherwise taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to corporation tax) be added to the loss incurred by the company in that accounting period or, if the company has not incurred a loss in the period, shall be treated as a loss so incurred:

Provided that the allowances for any period shall not be treated as including amounts carried forward from an earlier period.

(4) Subsections (6) to (9) of section 177 above shall apply for the purposes of this section as they apply for the purposes of subsection (1) of that section; and relief shall not be given under this section in respect of a loss incurred in a trade so as to interfere with any relief under section 248 of this Act (charges on income) in respect of payments made wholly and exclusively for the purposes of that trade.

had undertaken those activities at the beginning of the prior Part VII period of loss, he could not reasonably have expected the acdvi- Chapter HI ties to become profitable until after the end of the year next following the prior period of loss.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not restrict relief where the carrying on of the trade forms part of, and is ancillary to, a larger trading undertaking.

(5) In this section—

“basis year”, in relation to any capital allowance, shall be construed in accordance with section 169(4)(<x) above,

“ chargeable period ”, in relation to a company, means any accounting period, or any basis period ending before its first accounting period, “ basis period ” having the meaning given in section 72 of the Capital Allowances 1968 c. 3.

Act 1968,

“ prior five years ”—

(a) in relation to a loss incurred in a year of assessment, means the last five years of assessment before that year, and

(b) in relation to a loss incurred in a company’s accounting period, means the last five years before the beginning of the accounting period,

“ prior period of loss ” means the prior five years, except that, if losses were incurred in the trade in successive years of assessment or chargeable periods amounting in all to a period longer than five years (and ending when the prior five years end), it means that longer period, and in applying this definition to a chargeable period of a company “ losses ” means losses computed without regard to capital allowances, and

“farming” and “market gardening” shall be construed in accordance with the definitions of those terms under section 526(5) of this Act, but as if those definitions were not restricted to activities in the United Kingdom.

(6) For the purposes of this section, a capital allowance is related to a loss incurred in a trade if it falls to be made in taxing that trade and its basis year is the year of assessment in which the loss was incurred.

(7) In ascertaining for the purposes of this section whether a loss was incurred in any part of the prior five years, or earlier, the rules applicable to Case I of Schedule D shall be applied; and in this section “loss computed without regard to capital allowances” means, in relation to a chargeable period of a company, a loss so ascertained, but so that, notwithstanding

(8) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not restrict relief for any loss or capital allowance if the trade was set up and commenced within the prior five years, and, for the purposes of this subsection, a trade shall be treated as discontinued, and a new trade set up, in any event which under any of the provisions of the Tax Acts is to be treated as equivalent to the permanent discontinuance or setting up of a trade:

Provided that a trade shall not be treated as discontinued if, under section 252(2) of this Act or section 17 of the Finance Act 1954 (company reconstructions) it is not to be treated as discontinued for the purpose of capital allowances and charges.

(9) Where at any time there has been a change in the persons engaged in carrying on a trade, this section shall, notwithstanding subsection (8) above, apply to any person who was engaged in carrying on the trade immediately before and immediately after the change as if the trade were the same before and after without any discontinuance, and as if—

(a) a husband and his wife were the same person, and

(b) a husband or his wife were the same person as any

company of which either the husband or the wife has control, or of which the two of them have control,

and accordingly relief from income tax or from corporation tax may be restricted under this section by reference to losses some of which are incurred in years of assessment and some, computed without regard to capital allowances, are incurred in a company’s chargeable periods.

In this subsection ’'control” has the same meaning as in Chapter III of Part XI of this Act (close companies).

(9) For the purposes of this section a right to acquire shares is obtained by a person as a director or employee of a body corporate—

(a) if it is granted to him by reason of his office or employ-

ment as a director or employee of the body corporate who is chargeable to tax in respect of that office or employment under Case I of Schedule E, or

(b) if the right is assigned to him and was granted by

reason of any such office or employment of his to some other person,

Assessment, Collection, Recovery and Appeals

204.—(1) On the making of any payment of, or on account of, any income assessable to income tax under Schedule E, income tax shall, subject to and in accordance with regulations made by the Board under this section, be deducted or repaid by the person making the payment, notwithstanding that when the payment is made no assessment has been made in respect of the income and notwithstanding that the income is in whole or in part income for some year of assessment other than the year during which the payment is made.

(2) The Board shall make regulations with respect to the assessment, charge, collection and recovery of income tax in respect of all income assessable thereto under Schedule E, and those regulations may, in particular, include provision—

(a) for requiring any person making any payment of, or on account of, any such income, when he makes the payment, to make a deduction or repayment of income tax calculated by reference to tax tables prepared by the Board, and for rendering persons who are required to make any such deduction or repayment accountable to, or, as the case may be, entitled to repayment from, the Board,

(b) for the production to and inspection by persons authorised by the Board of wages sheets and other documents and records for the purpose of satisfying themselves that income tax has been and is being deducted, repaid and accounted for in accordance with the regulations,

(c) for the collection and recovery, whether by deduction

from any such income paid in any later year or otherwise, of income tax in respect of any such income which has not been deducted or otherwise recovered during the year,

(d) for the assessment and charge of income tax

by the inspector in respect of income to which this section applies, and

(e) for appeals with respect to matters arising under the

regulations which would not otherwise be the subject of an appeal,

and any such regulations shall have effect notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts:

Provided that —

(i) the deductions of income tax required to be made under paragraph (a) above may be required to be made at the

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

standard rate in such cases or classes of cases as Part VIII may be provided for by the regulations, and Chapter ill

(ii) the regulations shall not affect any right of appeal to the General or Special Commissioners which a person would have apart from the regulations.

(3) The said tax tables shall be constructed with a view to securing that, so far as possible—

(a) the total income tax payable in respect of any income

assessable under Schedule E for any year of assessment is deducted from such income paid during that year, and

(b) the income tax deductible or repayable on the occasion

of any payment of, or on account of, any such income , is such that the total net income tax deducted since the

beginning of the year of assessment bears to the total income tax payable for the year the same proportion that the part of the year which ends with the date of the payment bears to the whole year.

In this subsection references to the total income tax payable for the year shall be construed as references to the total income tax, other than surtax, estimated to be payable for the year in respect of the income in question, subject to a provisional deduction for allowances and reliefs, and subject also, if necessary, to an adjustment for amounts overpaid or remaining unpaid on account of income tax in respect of income assessable under Schedule E for any previous year.

For the purpose of estimating the total income tax payable as aforesaid, it may be assumed in relation to any payment of, or on account of, income assessable under Schedule E that the income paid in the part of the year of assessment which ends with the making of the payment will bear to the income for the whole of that year the same proportion as that part of the year bears to the whole year.

(4) The powers conferred by this section to make regulations shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, and all regulations under this section shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons.

205.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, no assess- Formal ment under Schedule E need be made on a person in respect of assessments income of his assessable to income tax under that Schedule fort0 * any year of assessment if the total net tax deducted in the year in question from that income is the same as it would have cases, been if all the relevant circumstances had been known to all parties throughout the year, and deductions and repayments had throughout the year been made accordingly, and had been so made by reference to cumulative tax tables.

In this subsection—

(a) “cumulative tax tables” means tax tables prepared

under section 204 above which are so framed as to require the tax which is to be deducted or repaid on the occasion of each payment made in the year to be ascertained by reference to a total of emoluments paid in the year up to the time of making that payment, and

(b) references to the total net tax deducted shall be construed as references to the total income tax deducted during the year by virtue of regulations made under the said section 204, less any income tax repaid by virtue of any such regulations.

(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an assessment being made on a person in respect of his income assessable under Schedule E. and, without prejudice to the generality of the preceding provisions of this subsection, an assessment shall be made in respect of the income of a person so assessable for any year of assessment if the person assessable requires an assessment to be made by notice in writing given to the inspector within five years from the end of the year of assessment.

206. Where an assessment to income tax under Schedule E is made as respects income which—

(a) has been taken into account in the making of deductions

or repayments of tax under section 204 above, and

(b) was received not less than twelve months before the

beginning of the year of assessment in which the assessment is made, then, if the assessment is made after the expiration of the period of twelve months immediately following the year of assessment for which it is made, it shall be made in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the expiration of that period.

207. Where a dispute arises under paragraph 1 of Schedule E whether a person is or has been ordinarily resident or domiciled in the United Kingdom or under section 188 above as to the domicile of any person, the question shall be referred to and determined by the Board; but any person who is aggrieved by their decision on the question may, by notice in writing to that effect given to them within three months from the date on which notice of the decision is given to him, make an application to have the question heard and determined by the Special Commissioners, and where an application is so made, the Special Commissioners shall hear and determine the question in like manner as an appeal.

c. 10

319

not the accrual of the benefits is dependent on any contingency)—

specified age or on earlier retirement through incapacity or on death,

the same in relation to all the persons to whom the scheme relates,

(b) references to such a scheme include references to a deed,

agreement, series of agreements, or other arrangements providing for retirement or other benefits for persons consisting of or including a director or employee, or directors or employees, of a body corporate (or, in a case falling within paragraph (a) above, to so much thereof as relates to a person or persons of any one class), notwithstanding that it or they relates or relate only to a small number of directors or employees, or to a single director or employee.

(b) approve such a scheme notwithstanding that, having regard to another such scheme subsisting in connection with the body corporate, the scheme in question is to be treated by virtue of subsection (2) above as not falling within subsection (2) of the said section 221 or as not satisfying the conditions aforesaid,

and where, under this subsection, the Board approve a part of a scheme, neither subsection (1) nor subsection (2) of section 220 above shall apply so as to cause any sum to be deemed to be income of a director or employee by reference to the provision for him of benefits afforded by that part of the scheme or of any part of such benefits.

Retirement Annuities

Approval of retirement annuity contracts and trust schemes.

226.—(1) Where, in any year of assessment, an individual—

(a) is (or would but for an insufficiency of profits or gains

be) chargeable to income tax in respect of relevant earnings from any trade, profession, vocation, office or employment carried on or held by him, and

(b) pays a premium or other consideration under an annuity

contract for the time being approved by the Board as having for its main object the provision for the individual of a life annuity in old age (hereafter in this Chapter referred to as “a qualifying premium”),

then relief from income tax may be given in respect of the qualifying premium under section 227 below, and any annuity payable to the same or another individual shall be treated as earned income of the annuitant to the extent to which it is payable in return for any amount on which relief is so given.

(2) Subject to subsection (3) below, the Board shall not approve a contract unless it appears to them to satisfy the conditions that it is made by the individual with a person lawfully carrying on in the United Kingdom the business of granting annuities on human life, and that it does not—

(6) provide for the annuity payable to the individual to commence before he attains the age of sixty or after he attains the age of seventy, or

(c) provide for the payment by that person of any other

or widower of the individual to be of a greater annual amount than that paid or payable to the individual, or

(e) provide for the payment of any annuity otherwise than

for the life of the annuitant,

and that it does include provision securing that no annuity payable under it shall be capable in whole or in part of surrender, commutation or assignment.

(3) The Board may, if they think fit, and subject to any conditions they think proper to impose, approve a contract otherwise satisfying the preceding conditions, notwithstanding that the contract provides for one or more of the following matters—

(a) for the payment after the individual’s death of an

annuity to a dependant not the widow or widower of the individual,

(b) for the payment to the individual of an annuity com-

mencing before he attains the age of sixty, if the annuity is payable on his becoming incapable through infirmity of body or mind of carrying on his own occupation or any occupation of a similar nature for which he is trained or fitted,

(c) if the individual’s occupation is one in which persons

customarily retire before attaining the age of sixty, far the annuity to commence before he attains that age (but not before he attains the age of fifty),

(d) for the annuity payable to any person to continue for a term certain (not exceeding ten years), notwithstanding his death within that term, or for the annuity payable to any person to terminate, or be suspended, on marriage (or re-marriage) or in other circumstances,

(e) in the case of an annuity which is to continue for a term certain, for the annuity to be assignable by will, and in die event of any person dying entitled to it,

for it to be assignable by his personal representatives in the distribution of the estate so as to give effect to a testamentary disposition, or to the rights of those entitled on intestacy, or to an appropriation of it to a legacy or to a share or interest in the estate.

(4) So much of subsection (1) above as provides that an annuity shall be treated, in whole or in part, as earned income of the annuitant shall apply only in relation to the annuitant to whom the annuity is made payable by the terms of the contract.

(5) The preceding provisions of this section shall apply in relation to a contribution under a trust scheme approved by the Board as they apply in relation to a premium under an annuity contract so approved, with the modification that, for the condition as to die person with whom the contract is made, there shall be substituted a condition that the scheme—

(a) is established under the law of any part of, and admini-

stered in, the United Kingdom, and

(b) is established for the benefit of individuals engaged in

or connected with a particular occupation (or one or other of a group of occupations), and for the purpose of providing retirement annuities for them, with or without subsidiary benefits for their families or dependants, and

(c) is so established under irrevocable trusts by a body of

persons comprising or representing a substantial proportion of the individuals so engaged in the United Kingdom, or of those so engaged in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland,

and with the necessary adaptations of other references to the contract or the person with whom it is made.

(6) Exemption from income tax shall be allowed in respect of income derived from investments or deposits of any fund maintained for the purpose mentioned in subsection (5)(b) above under a scheme for the time being approved under that subsection; and a gain accruing to a person from his acquisition and disposal of assets held by him as part of any such fund shall be exempt from tax chargeable under Case VII of Schedule D, and shall not be a chargeable gain for the purposes of capital gains tax.

(7) The Board may at any time, by notice in writing given to the persons by and to whom premiums are payable under any contract for the time being approved under this section, or to the trustees or other persons having the management of any scheme so approved, withdraw that approval on such grounds and from such date as may be specified in the notice.

(8) Far the purposes of this Chapter, a married woman’s relevant earnings shall not be treated as her husband’s relevant earnings, notwithstanding that her income chargeable to tax is treated as his income.

(9) Subject to subsection (8) above, “ relevant earnings ”, in relation to any individual, means for the purposes of this Chapter any income of his chargeable to tax for the year of assessment in question, being either—

(a) income arising in respect of remuneration from an office

or employment held by him other than a pensionable office or employment, or

(b) income from any property which is attached to or forms

part of the emoluments of any such office or employment held by him, or

(c) income which is chargeable under Schedule A,

Schedule B or Schedule D and is immediately derived by him from the carrying on or exercise by ham of his trade, profession or vocation either as an individual or, in the case of a partnership, as a partner personally acting therein, or

(d) income treated as earned income by virtue of section

383 of this Act (patent rights),

but does not include any remuneration as director of a company whose income consists wholly or mainly of investment income (construed in accordance with section 292(1) of this Act), being a company of which he is a controlling director (as defined in section 224(1) above).

(10) For the purposes of this Chapter, an office or employment is a pensionable office or employment if, and only if, service in it is service to which a sponsored superannuation scheme relates (not being a scheme under which the benefits provided in respect of that service are limited to a lump sum payable on the termination of the service through death or disability before the age of seventy or some lower age); but references to a pensionable office or employment apply whether or not the duties are performed wholly or partly in the United Kingdom or the holder is chargeable to tax in respect of it

Service in an office or employment shall not for the purposes of this definition be treated as service to which a sponsored superannuation scheme relates by reason only of the fact that the holder of the office or employment might (though he does not) participate in the scheme by exercising or refraining from exercising an option open to him by virtue of that service.

c. 10

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

Part IX (11) In subsection (10) above “a sponsored superannuation Chapter III scheme ” means a scheme or arrangement relating to service in particular offices or employments and having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving therein against future retirement or partial retirement, against future termination of service through death or disability, or against similar matters, being a scheme or arrangement under which any part of the cost of the provision so made is or has been borne otherwise than by those persons by reason of their service (whether it is the cost or part of the cost of the benefits provided, or of paying premiums or other sums in order to provide those benefits, or of administering or instituting the scheme or arrangement); but for this purpose a person shall be treated as bearing by reason of his service the cost of any payment made or agreed to be made in respect of his service, if that payment or the agreement to make it is treated under the Income Tax Acts as increasing his income, or would be so treated if he were chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule E in respect of his emoluments from that service.

1867 c. 144. (12) Nothing in sections 4 and 6 of the Policies of Assurance

Act 1867 (which put on assurance companies certain obligations in relation to notices of assignment of policies of life assurance) shall be taken to apply to any contract approved under this section.

(13) For the purposes of any provision applying this subsection “ approved annuities ” means annuities under contracts approved by the Board under this section, being annuities payable wholly in return for premiums or other consideration paid by a person who (when the premiums or other consideration are or is payable) is, or would but for an insufficiency of profits or gains be, chargeable to tax in respect of relevant earnings from a trade, profession, vocation, office or employment carried on or held by him.

Nature and amount of relief for qualifying premiums.

227.—(1) Relief shall be given under this section in respect of a qualifying premium paid by an individual only on a claim made for the purpose, and where relief is to be so given, the amount of that premium shall be deducted from or set off against his relevant earnings for the year of assessment in which the premium is paid:

Provided that the amount which may be deducted or set off in any year of assessment (whether in respect of one or more qualifying premiums) shall not be more than the sum of £750, nor more than one-tenth of his net relevant earnings for that year, and, where the condition in section 226(1)(a) above is satisfied as respects part only of that year, then for the said sum of £750 there shall be substituted the sum which bears to

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

331

it the same proportion as that part bears to the whole year, but so that in the case of individuals holding a pensionable office or employment, and of individuals bom in or before the year 1915, this proviso shall have effect subject to the provisions of section 228 below.

(2) If in any year of assessment a reduction or a greater reduction would be made under this section in the relevant earnings of an individual but for an insufficiency of net relevant earnings, the amount of the reduction which would be made but for that insufficiency, less the amount of any reduction which is made in that year, shall be carried forward to the next following year, and shall be treated for the purposes of relief under this section as the amount of a qualifying premium paid in that following year, and so on for succeeding years (if necessary).

(3) Where, on the making of an assessment for any year on an individual's relevant earnings or on the profits or gains of a partnership from which he derives relevant earnings, notice of assessment is given after or within six months before the end of the year of assessment, and the individual pays a qualifying premium after the end of that year but within the period beginning with the end of that year and ending six months after the date on which the assessment becomes final and conclusive, he may within that period elect that for the purposes of relief under this section the premium shall be treated as paid in that year and not in the year in which it is paid, and where he does so elect, any relief given in consequence of the election for the earlier year shall be given by repayment of tax:

Provided that where either—

(a) the amount of that premium, together with any qualify-

ing premiums paid by him in the year to which the assessment relates (or treated as so paid by virtue of any previous election under this subsection), exceeds the maximum amount of the reduction which may be made under this section in his relevant earnings for that year, or

(b) the amount of that premium itself exceeds the increase in

that maximum amount which is due to taking into account the income on which the assessment is made,

then the election shall have no effect as respects the excess.

(4) For the purposes of relief under this section, an individual’s relevant earnings are those earnings before giving effect to any capital allowances, other than deductions allowable in computing profits or gains, but after taking into account the amounts on which charges fall to be made under the Capital Allowances Act 1968 (including the enactments which under this Act are

Part IX to be treated as contained in Part I of that Act); and references Charter III to income in the following provisions of this section (other than references to total income) shall be construed similarly.

(5) Subject to the following provisions of this section, “ net relevant earnings* means, in relation to an individual, the amount of his relevant earnings for the year of assessment in question, less the amount of any deductions falling to be made from the relevant earnings in computing for the purposes of income tax at the standard rate his total income for that year, being either—

(a) deductions in respect of payments made by him, or

(b) deductions in respect of losses or of capital allowances,

being losses or allowances arising from activities profits or gains of which would be included in computing relevant earnings of the individual or of the individual's wife or husband for the year 1956-57 or a later year of assessment.

(6) Where, in any year of assessment for which an individual claims and is allowed relief under this section, there falls to be made in computing the total income of the individual or that of the individual's wife or husband a deduction in respect of any such loss or allowance of the individual as is mentioned in subsection (5 )(b)above, and the deduction or part of it falls to be so made made from income other than relevant earnings, the amount of the deduction made from that other income shall be treated as reducing the individual’s net relevant earnings for subsequent years of assessment (being deducted as far as may be from those of the immediately following year, whether or not he claims or is entitled to claim relief under this section for that year, and so far as it cannot be so deducted, then from those of the next year, and so on).

(7) Where an individual's income for any year of assessment consists partly of relevant earnings and partly of other income, then as far as may be any deductions which fall to be made in computing his total income, and which may be treated in whole or in part either as made from relevant earnings or as made from other income, shall be treated for the purposes of this section as being made from those relevant earnings in so far as they are deductions in respect of any such loss or allowance as is mentioned in subsection (5 above, and otherwise as being made from that other income.

(8) An individual's net relevant earnings for any year of assessment are to be computed without regard to any relief which falls to be given for that year under tins section either to the individual or to the individual’s wife or husband.

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

333

(9) An individual's relevant earnings, in the case of partner- Part IX ship profits, shall be taken to be his share of the partnership Chatter III income, estimated in accordance with the Income Tax Acts, but

the amount to be included in respect of those earnings in arriving at his net relevant earnings shall be his share of that income after making therefrom all such deductions (if any) in respect of payments made by the partnership, or in respect of capital allowances falling to be made to the partnership for chargeable periods after the year 1955-56, as would be made in computing the tax payable in respect of that income.

(10) Where relief under this section for any year of assessment is claimed and allowed (whether or not relief then falls to be given for that year), and afterwards there is made any assessment, alteration of an assessment, or other adjustment of the claimant’s liability to tax, there shall be made also such adjustments, if any, as are consequential thereon in the relief allowed or given under this section for that or any subsequent year of assessment.

(11) Where relief under this section is claimed and allowed for any year of assessment in respect of any payment, relief shall not be given in respect of it under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts for the same or a later year of assessment nor (in the case of a payment under an annuity contract) in respect of any other premium or consideration for an annuity under the same contract; and references in the Income Tax Acts to relief in respect of life assurance premiums shall not be taken to include relief under this section.

(12) The allowances mentioned in subsections (5)(£>) and (9) above shall not be treated as including amounts carried forward from a year of assessment earlier than the year 1956-57.

(13) If any person, for the purpose of obtaining for himself or any other person any relief from or repayment of tax under this section, knowingly makes any false statement or false representation, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £500.

228.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in the case Application of of an individual who is the holder of a pensionable office or to

payment bears to the total amount of that payment shall be constant for all payments on account of the annuity, and

(c) where neither the term of the annuity nor the amount

of any annuity payment depends on any contingency other than the duration of a human life or lives, that proportion shall be the same proportion which the total amount or value of the consideration for the grant of the annuity bears to the actuarial value of the annuity payments as determined in accordance with the next following subsection, and

(c) the actuarial value of any annuity payments shall be

taken to be their value as at the date when the first of those payments begins to accrue, that value being determined by reference to the prescribed tables of mortality and without discounting any payment for the

time to elapse between that date and the date it is to be made.

(4) Where a person making a payment on account of any life annuity has been notified in the prescribed manner of any decision as to its being or not being a purchased life annuity to which this section applies or as to the amount of the capital element (if any), and has not been notified of any alteration of that decision, the notice shall be conclusive as to those matters for the purpose of determining the amount of income tax which he is entitled or required to deduct from the payment, or for which he is chargeable in respect of it.

(5) Where a person making a payment on account of a purchased life annuity to which this section applies has not been notified in the prescribed manner of the amount of the capital element, the amount of income tax which he is entitled or required to deduct from the payment, or for which he is chargeable in respect of it. shall be the same as if the annuity were not a purchased life annuity to which this section applies.

(6) For the purposes of this section, “life annuity” means an annuity payable for a term ending with (or at a time ascertainable only by reference to) the end of a human life, whether or not there is provision for the annuity to end during the life on the expiration of a fixed term or on the happening of any event or otherwise, or to continue after the end of the life in particular circumstances, and “ purchased life annuity ” means a life annuity granted for consideration in money or money’s worth in the ordinary course of a business of granting annuities on human life.

sideration for the grant of the annuity consisted of sums satisfying the conditions for relief from income tax under section 19 or 20 of this Act (relief for life insurance premiums and certain other payments) or under section 227 above (retirement annuities), or

(c) to any annuity purchased in pursuance of any direction

in a will, or to provide for an annuity payable by virtue of a will or settlement out of income of property disposed of by the will or settlement (whether with or without resort to capital), or

Schedule F and Company Distributions

232.—(1) The Schedule referred to as Schedule F is as Schedule F. follows:—

Schedule F

1. Income tax under this Schedule shall be chargeable for any year of assessment in respect of all dividends and other distributions in that year of a company resident in the United Kingdom which are not charged under any other Schedule and are not specially exempted from income tax, and for purposes of income tax all such distributions shall be regarded as income, however they fall to be dealt with in the hands of the recipient.

2. Income tax under this Schedule for any year of assessment shall be charged in respect of any distribution made in the year on such sum as, after deduction of income tax thereon at the standard rate, equals the amount or value of the distribution after any deduction of income tax actually made; and, subject to any enactment to the contrary, the distribution shall be deemed for purposes of income tax to represent income, of an amount equal to that sum, on which income tax has been borne by deduction:

Provided that in the case of preference dividends the tax chargeable and the amount of income represented by the dividends shall be determined by reference to the fixed gross rate of dividend.

(2) Where, in any year of assessment, a company resident in the United Kingdom makes any distribution, not being a payment of interest other than yearly interest nor a payment in respect of which deductions or repayments of income tax may fall to be made under section 204 of this Act (pay as you earn), the company shall under this subsection, and in accordance with Schedule 9 to this Act, account for and pay income tax in respect of the distribution at the standard rate for that year.

(3) Where a company is liable under subsection (2) above to account for income tax in respect of any payment made by it, and the company is not otherwise entitled to deduct income tax from the payment, the company on making the payment shall be entitled under this subsection to deduct out of it an amount equal to the income tax for which it is liable to account in respect of the payment; and as against any person entitled to the payment the company shall be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction, as if that sum had been actually paid.

(c) any redeemable share capital or any security issued by

the company in respect of shares in the company otherwise than wholly for new consideration, or such part of any redeemable share capital or any security so issued as is not properly referable to new consideration;

(i) securities issued as mentioned in paragraph (c) above, but excluding securities issued before 6th April 1965; or

(ii) securities convertible directly or indirectly into shares in the company and not securities quoted on a recognised stock exchange nor issued on terms which are reasonably comparable with the terms of issue of securities so quoted; or

(e) any such amount as is required to be treated as a distribution by subsection (3) below, or by section 234 below.

(3) Where on a transfer of assets or liabilities by a company to its members or to a company by its members, the amount or value of the benefit received by a member (taken according to its market value) exceeds the amount or value (so taken) of any new consideration given by him, the company shall be treated as making a distribution to him of an amount equal to the difference:

Provided that, where the company and the member receiving the benefit are both resident in the United Kingdom and either the former is a subsidiary of the latter or both are subsidiaries of a third company also so resident, the said amount shall not be treated as a distribution.

(4) The question whether one body corporate is a subsidiary of another for the purpose of subsection (3) above shall be determined as a question whether it is a 51 per cent subsidiary of that other, except that that other shall be treated as not being the owner—

(a) of any share capital which it owns directly in a body corporate if a profit on a sale of the shares would be treated as a trading receipt of its trade; or

(a) repays any share capital, or has done so at any time

after 6th April 1965; and

(b) at or after the time of that repayment issues as paid

up otherwise than by the receipt of new consideration any share capital, not being redeemable share capital;

the amount so paid up shall be treated as a distribution made in respect of the shares on which it is paid up, except in so far as that amount exceeds the amount or aggregate amount of share capital so repaid less any amounts previously so paid up and treated by virtue of this subsection as distributions.

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not apply where the repaid share capital consists of fully paid preference shares—

(a) if those shares existed as issued and fully paid preference

shares on 6th April 1965 and throughout the period from that date until the repayment those shares continued to be fully paid preference shares, or

(b) if those shares were issued after 6th April 1965 as fully

(a) a company issues any share capital as paid up otherwise than by the receipt of new consideration, or has done so after 6th April 1965; and

(b) any amount so paid up does not fall to be treated as a distribution;

then for the purposes of sections 233 and 234 above distributions afterwards made by the company in respect of shares representing that share capital shall not be treated as repayments of share capital, except to the extent to which those distributions, together with any relevant distributions previously so made, exceed the amounts so paid up (then or previously) on such shares after that date and not foiling to be treated as distributions.

(2) In subsection (1) above “ relevant distribution ” means so much of any distribution made in respect of shares representing the relevant share capital as apart from that subsection would be treated as a repayment of share capital, but by virtue of that subsection cannot be so treated.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1) above all shares of the same class shall be treated as representing the same share capital, and where shares are issued in respect of other shares, or are directly or indirectly converted into or exchanged for other shares, all such shares shall be treated as representing the same share capital.

(4) Where share capital is issued at a premium representing new consideration, the amount of the premium is to be treated as forming part of that share capital for the purpose of determining under this Part of this Act whether any distribution made in respect of shares representing the share capital is to be treated as a repayment of share capital:

Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in relation to any part of the premium after that part has been applied in paying up share capital.

(5) Subject to subsection (4) above, premiums paid on redemption of share capital are not to be treated as repayments of capital.

(2) For the purposes of sections 234(1) and 235(1) above share capital issued as mentioned in subsection (1) above shall not be treated as issued “ as paid up otherwise than by the receipt of new consideration ”.

(3) For the purposes of this section an option to receive either a dividend in cash or additional share capital is conferred on a person not only where he is required to choose one or the other, but also where he is offered the one subject to a right, however expressed, to choose the other instead, and a person’s abandonment of, or failure to exercise, such a right is to be treated for those purposes as an exercise of the option.

Provided that where share capital has been issued at a premium representing new consideration, any part of that premium afterwards applied in paying up share capital shall be treated as new consideration also for that share capital, except in so far as the premium has been taken into account under section 235(4) above so as to enable a distribution to be treated as a repayment of share capital.

(2) A distribution shall be treated under this Part of this Act as made, or consideration as provided, out of assets of a company if the cost falls on the company.

(3) In this Part of this Act “ share ” includes stock, and any other interest of a member in a company.

(4) References in this Part of this Act to issuing share capital as paid up apply also to the paying up of any issued share capital.

as if paid or given in respect of a security issued for the advance part X by the company.

(6) Where securities are issued at a price less than the amount repayable on them, and are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange, the principal secured shall not be taken for the purposes of this Part of this Act to exceed the issue price, unless the securities are issued on terms reasonably comparable with the terms of issue of securities so quoted.

(7) For the purposes of this Part of this Act a thing is to be regarded as done in respect of a share if it is done to a person as being the holder of the share, or as having at a particular time been the holder, or is done in pursuance of a right granted or offer made in respect of a share; and anything done in respect of shares by reference to share holdings at a particular time is to be regarded as done to the then holders of the shares or the personal representatives of any share holder then dead.

This subsection shall apply in relation to securities as it applies in relation to shares.

(b) “trade” includes “vocation”, and includes also an office or employment or the occupation of woodlands in any context in which the expression is applied to that in the Income Tax Acts.

239. Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation Tax Acts, corporation tax shall not be chargeable on dividends and other distributions of a company resident in the United Kingdom, nor shall any such dividends or distributions be taken into account in computing income for corporation tax.

246.—(1) Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation Tax Acts, a company resident in the United Kingdom shall not, in respect of distributions received in any year of assessment from another such company (in the Corporation Tax Acts referred to as the recipient’s “ franked investment income ”), be entitled to repayment of income tax on any surplus in amount or value of that franked investment income over the aggregate amount or value of the distributions made by it in that year.

(2) Where in any year of assessment a company has such a surplus of franked investment income, the surplus shall be carried forward to the following year and treated for purposes of this section (including any further application of this subsection) as an amount of franked investment income received in that year; but where by virtue of this subsection income tax in respect of franked investment income received in any year of assessment becomes repayable in a later year, it shall be repaid at the rate for the year in which the income was received, and tax for an earlier year of assessment shall be repaid before tax for a later year.

charge tax for so much of the period as falls within that year according to the rate of tax last fixed, but any such charge shall be subject to later adjustment, if need be, by discharge or repayment of tax or by a further assessment if for that year corporation tax is not charged by an Act passed not later than 5th August next after the end of the year or is charged otherwise than as it has been assessed.

(6) Where the House of Commons passes a Resolution for fixing the rate of corporation tax for any financial year, or for altering the tax for any financial year, then any assessment to tax afterwards made by virtue of subsection (5) above may be made in accordance with the Resolution; but no assessment made by virtue of that subsection later than 5th May next after the end of any financial year shall charge tax for that year, unless a Resolution for charging corporation tax for that year has been so passed, nor shall any assessment be made by virtue of any such Resolution later than the prescribed period from the date on which the Resolution is passed.

(3) If the affairs of the company are completely wound up before an Act is passed fixing the rate of corporation tax for its penultimate year, corporation tax shall be charged on the company's profits arising in the winding-up in its final year, and if the winding-up commenced before the final year, on the company’s profits arising at any time in its penultimate year, at the rate of corporation tax fixed by the budget resolution for the penultimate year (and without regard to the rate fixed by any subsequent Act); and any assessment made by virtue of section 243(5) above shall be subject to any such adjustment, by discharge or repayment of tax or by a further assessment, as may be required to give effect to this subsection.

(5) In making an assessment after the commencement of the winding-up of the company but before the date when its affairs are completely wound up, the inspector may, with the concurrence of the liquidator, act on an assumption as to when that date will fall, so far as it governs section 247(7) below.

(6) The assumption of the wrong date shall not alter the company's final and penultimate year, and if the right date is later an accounting period shall end on the date assumed, and a new accounting period shall begin and the said section 247(7) shall thereafter apply as if that new accounting period began with the commencement of the winding-up.

accounts of any of them to different dates, and does not make up general accounts for the whole of the company's activities, subsection (3 )(b)above shall apply with reference to the accounting

date of such one of the trades as the Board may determine.

(6) If a chargeable gain or allowable loss accrues to a company at a time not otherwise within an accounting period of the company, an accounting period of the company shall then begin for the purposes of corporation tax, and the gain or loss shall accrue in that accounting period.

(4) If claims for group relief are made by a claimant company as respects more than one surrendering company for group relief to be set off against its total profits for any one accounting period, and—

(a) all the claims so made are admissible only by virtue of

subsections (2) and (3) of section 262 above, and

(b) there is a part of the claimant company’s accounting

period during which none of the surrendering companies by reference to which the claims are made is a member of the same group as the claimant company,

the claimant company shall not obtain in all more relief to be set off against its profits for the accounting period than it could obtain on a claim as respects a single surrendering company (with unlimited losses and other amounts eligible for relief) which was not a member of the same group as die claimant company during that part of the claimant company’s accounting period (but was a member during the remainder of that accounting period). 5

(5) The provisions of this subsection have effect as respects a claim for group relief made by a company as a member of a consortium, in this subsection referred to as a “consortium claim ”—

(b) in subsections (3) and (4) above consortium claims shall be disregarded,

and paragraph (a) above shall take effect according to the order in which claims are made.

(6) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 87(3) of the Capital Allowances Act 1968, any reference in Part I of that Act to an allowance made includes a reference to an allowance which would be made but for the granting of group relief, or but for that and but for an insufficiency of profits or other income against which to make it.

264.—(1) A claim for group relief—

(a) need not be for the full amount available,

(3) If the inspector discovers that any group relief which has been given is or has become excessive he may make an assessment to corporation tax under Case VI of Schedule D in the amount which ought in his opinion to be charged.

(4) Subsection (3) above is without prejudice to the making of an assessment under section 29(3)(c) of the Taxes Management Act 1970, and to the making of all such other adjustments by way of discharge or repayment of tax or otherwise as may be required where a claimant company has obtained too much relief, or a surrendering company has foigone relief in respect of a corresponding amount.

Chapter n

General provisions

265.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the amount Computation to be included in respect of chargeable gains in a company’s ^i^argeab e total profits for any accounting period shall be the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the company in the accounting period after deducting any allowable losses accruing to the company in the period and, so far as they have not been allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous accounting period, any allowable losses previously (but not earlier than the year 1965-66) accruing to the company while it has been within the charge to corporation tax.

(2) Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation Tax Acts, the total amount of the chargeable gains to be so included shall for purposes of corporation tax be computed in accordance with the principles applying for capital gains tax, all questions as to the amounts winch are or are not to be taken into account as chargeable gains or as allowable losses, or in computing gains or losses, or charged to tax as a person’s gain, or as to the time when any such amount is to be treated as accruing, being determined in accordance with the provisions relating to capital gains tax as if accounting periods were years of assessment.

(3) Subject to subsection (4) below, where the enactments relating to capital gains tax contain any reference to income tax or to the Income Tax Acts the reference shall, in relation to a company, be construed as a reference to corporation tax or to the Corporation Tax Acts; but—

(a) this subsection shall not affect the references to income

tax in paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 6 to the Finance 1965 c. 25. Act 1965 (exclusion of expenditure by reference to hypothetical income tax),

(b) nothing in this section shall be taken as applying for

corporation tax section 21 of the said Act (alternative charge to tax on capital gains accruing to an individual), and

(c) in so far as the said provisions operate by reference to

matters of any specified description, account shall for corporation tax be taken of matters of that description which are confined to companies, but not of any which are confined to individuals. 4

(4) Part III of the Finance Act 1965 as extended by this section shall not be affected in its operation by the fact that capital gains tax and corporation tax are distinct taxes but.

so far as is consistent with the Corporation Tax Acts, shall apply in relation to capital gains tax and corporation tax on chargeable gains as if they were one tax, so that, in particular, a matter which in a case involving two individuals is relevant for both of them in relation to capital gains tax shall in a like case involving an individual and a company be relevant for him in relation to that tax and for it in relation to corporation tax.

(5) Where assets of a company are vested in a liquidator under section 244 of the Companies Act 1948, or section 226 of the Companies Act (Northern Ireland) 1960, or otherwise, this section and the enactments applied by this section shall apply as if the assets were vested in, and the acts of the liquidator in relation to the assets were the acts of, the company (acquisitions from or disposals to him by the company being disregarded accordingly).

266.—(1) This section applies where a person who is connected with a company resident in the United Kingdom receives or becomes entitled to receive in respect of shares in the company any capital distribution from the company, other than a capital distribution representing a reduction of capital, and—

(a) the capital so distributed derives from the disposal of assets in respect of which a chargeable gain accrues to the company; or

(b) the distribution constitutes such a disposal of assets.

(2) If the corporation tax assessed on the company for the accounting period in which the chargeable gain accrues included any amount in respect of chargeable gains, and any of the tax assessed on the company for that period is not paid within six months from the date when it becomes payable by the company, the said person may by an assessment made within two years from that date be assessed and charged (in the name of the company) to an amount of that corporation tax—

(a) not exceeding the amount or value of the capital distribu-

tion which that person has received or become entitled to receive; and

(b) not exceeding a proportion equal to that person's share

of the capital distribution made by the company of corporation tax on the amount of that gain at the rate in force when the gain accrued.

(3) A person paying any amount of tax under this section shall be entitled to recover a sum equal to that amount from the company. 4

(4) The provisions of this section are without prejudice to any liability of the person receiving or becoming entitled to receive the capital distribution in respect of a chargeable gain

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

379

accruing to him by reference to the capital distribution as constituting a disposal of an interest in shares in the company.

(5) In this section “ capital distribution ” has the same meaning as in paragraph 3 of Schedule 7 to the Finance Act 1965 and “ connected with ” shall be construed in accordance with section 533 of this Act

267.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where—

(a) any scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation involves

the transfer of the whole or part of a company’s business to another company, and

(b) the transfer takes effect after 5th April 1970, and

(c) at the time of the transfer both the companies are resi-

dent in the United Kingdom, and

(d) the first-mentioned company receives no part of the consideration for the transfer (otherwise than by the other company taking over the whole or part of the liabilities of the business),

then so far as relates to corporation tax on chargeable gains the two companies shall be treated as if any assets included in the transfer were acquired by the one company from the other company for a consideration of such amount as would secure that on the disposal by way of transfer neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to the company making the disposal, and for the purposes of Part II of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 (assets held on 6th April 1965) the acquiring company shall be treated as if the respective acquisitions of the assets by the other company had been the acquiring company’s acquisition of them.

(2) This section does not apply in relation to an asset which, until the transfer, formed part of trading stock of a trade carried on by the company making the disposal, or in relation to an asset which is acquired as trading stock for the purposes of a trade carried on by the company acquiring the asset. 3 4

(3) This section does not apply in the case of a transfer of the whole or part of a company’s business to a unit trust scheme to which subsection (1) or subsection (2) of section 38 of the Finance Act 1965 (unit trusts for exempt unit holders) applies.

(4) In this section—

“scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation” means a scheme for the reconstruction of any company or companies or the amalgamation of any two or more companies,

(2) For the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965, the transferor company shall be treated as if a fraction of any chargeable gain accruing to it on its disposal of any asset so transferred to the transferee company did not accrue to the transferor company until—

that asset, or ceases to use it, or is wound up or dissolved, or

(b) the transferor company disposes of all or any of the

shares or loan stock issued in exchange by the transferee company, or

whichever event comes first.

(3) A disposal of shares or loan stock by the transferor company which, by virtue of section 273 below, is treated as giving rise to neither a gain nor a loss shall be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (2Mb) above, but on the first occasion after such a disposal that there is a disposal which is not so treated of all or any of those shares or that loan stock, that subsection shall apply as if the disposal were a disposal by the transferor company.

B is the market value at the time of the transfer of the whole of the consideration so received by the transferor company.

(5) For the purposes of this section the ordinary share capital of a company means all the issued share capital (by whatever name called) of the company, other than capital die holders of which have a right to a dividend at a fixed rate but have no other right to share in the profits of the company; and if all or part of the ordinary share capital of the transferee company consists of shares of no par value, the proportion of one quarter shall be determined according to the market value of the ordinary share capital at the time of the transfer.

(6) All such adjustments shall be made by discharge or repayment of tax as are required to give effect to the provisions of this section.

(7) This section applies only in relation to a transfer of a trade and assets after 10th April 1968.

_ Losses attributable to depreciatory transactions

Transactions

in a group. 280.—(1) This section has effect as respects a disposal of

shares in, or securities of, a company (in this section referred to as an “ ultimate disposal ”) if the value of the shares or securities has been materially reduced by a depreciatory transaction effected on or after 6th April 1965; and for this purpose “depreciatory transaction” means—

one member of a group of companies to another, or

(b) unless the ultimate disposal occurred before 30th April

Provided that a transaction shall not be treated as a depreciatory transaction to the extent that it consists of a payment which is required to be or has been brought into account, for the purposes of corporation tax on chargeable gains, in computing a chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing to the person making the ultimate disposal.

(2) The conditions referred to in subsection (l)(h) above are—

(a) that the company, the shares in which, or securities

of which, are the subject of the ultimate disposal, or any 75 per cent, subsidiary of that company, was a party to the transaction, and

Provided that if the person making the ultimate disposal is not a member of the said group when he disposes of the shares or securities, no reduction of the loss shall be made by reference to a depreciatory transaction which took place when that person was not a member of the said group.

(5) The inspector or the Commissioners shall make the decision under subsection (4) above on the footing that the allowable loss ought not to reflect any diminution in the value of the company’s assets which was attributable to a depreciatory transaction if and so far as the effect of the transaction was to increase the value of the assets of any other member of the group, but allowance may be made for any other transaction on or after 6th April 1965 which has enhanced the value of the company’s assets and depreciated the value of the assets of any other member of the group.

(6) If, under subsection (4) above, a reduction is made in an allowable loss, any chargeable gain accruing on a disposal of the shares or securities of any other company which was a party to the depreciatory transaction by reference to which the reduction was made, being a disposal not later than six years after the depreciatory transaction, shall be reduced to such extent as appears to the inspector, or on appeal to the Commissioners concerned, to be just and reasonable having regard to the effect of the depreciatory transaction on the value of those shares or securities at the time of their disposal:

Provided that the total amount of any one or more reductions in chargeable gains made by reference to a depreciatory transaction shall not exceed the amount of the reductions in allowable losses made by reference to that depreciatory transaction.

Provided that—

(i) any such dividends or interest shall be taken into account for the purposes of assessment to surtax; and

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

463

(ii) the amount actually paid or credited in respect of any

such dividends or interest shall be deemed for surtax purposes to be a net amount corresponding to a gross amount from which tax at the standard rate for that year has been duly deducted, and the amount on which surtax is to be charged in the case of any person shall be calculated accordingly; and

(iii) the provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to interest on any bank loan; and

(iv) the provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to any interest which is payable in respect of a loan to the society under a contract made before the beginning of the first year of assessment as respects which the society enters into arrangements under subsection (1) of this section, if and to the extent that, both at the time of the making of the contract and at the time when the interest becomes payable, it is contemplated by the parties that tax shall be deducted on payment of the interest.

(4) Where any arrangements under this section are in force in the case of any society as respects any year of assessment then, notwithstanding anything in Part II of this Act, income tax shall not be deducted upon payment to the society of any interest on advances, being interest payable in that year.

ing period shall be paid within one month from the making of the assessment, except that if the society's basis period for the year 1965-66 did not extend into the year 1966, the tax shall not be payable before the like time after the last day of the accounting period as 1st January 1966 is after the last day of that basis period; but

(b) if corporation tax has not become payable by the

society for an accounting period by the like time from the beginning of that period as there is between the beginning of the said basis period and 1st January 1966, the society shall at that time from the beginning of the accounting period make a provisional payment of tax computed on the amount on which the society is chargeable to corporation tax for the accounting period last ended with such adjustments, if any, as may be required for periods of different length or as may be agreed between the society and the inspector.

References in this subsection to a society's basis period for the year 1965-66 are references to the period by reference to which the society was assessed to income tax for that year under the arrangements referred to in subsection (1) above.

Act (Northern Ireland) 1964) or as security for a debt jgso c. 26. owed by an individual, the amount of the gain shall 1964 c* 23 be deemed for the purposes of surtax (but not for any (N.I.). other income tax purpose except the furnishing of information) to form part of that individual’s total income for the year in which the event happened;

Part XIV Chapter III Relief where gain charged directly to surtax.

400.—(1) The following provisions of this section shall have effect for the purpose of giving relief, on a claim in that behalf being made by him to the Board, in respect of any increase in an individual's liability to tax which is attributable to one or more amounts being included in his total income for a year of assessment by virtue of section 399(l)(n) above.

(2) Where one amount only is so included, there shall be computed—

(a) the surtax which would be chargeable in respect of the

amount if relief under this section were not available and it constituted the highest part of the claimant’s total income for the year, and

(b) the surtax (if any) which would be chargeable in respect

of the amount if calculated, in accordance with subsection (3) below, by reference to its appropriate fraction,

and the relief shall consist of a reduction or repayment of tax equal to the difference between the two amounts of surtax so computed, or, if surtax would not be chargeable on a calculation by reference to the appropriate fraction, of a reduction or repayment of the tax equal to the surtax computed under paragraph

(a) above.

(3) In subsection (2) above “ appropriate fraction ” means, in relation to any amount, such a sum as bears thereto the same proportion as that borne by one to the number of complete years for which the policy or contract has run before the happening of the chargeable event; and the computation required by paragraph (b) of that subsection shall be made by applying to the amount in question the rate or rates of surtax (if more than one, in corresponding proportions) which would apply if it were reduced to that fraction, treating it, as so reduced, as still constituting the highest part of the claimant's total income for the year, and treating so much of it (if any) as would then not be chargeable to surtax as if it were chargeable thereto at a nil rate.

For the purposes of this subsection, the number of years for which a policy of life insurance has run before the happening of a chargeable event shall be calculated, where appropriate, from the issue of the earliest related policy, meaning, any policy in relation to which the policy is a new policy within the meaning of paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to this Act, any policy in relation to which that policy is such a policy, and so on.

(4) Where by virtue of the said section 399(1 )(u) two or more amounts are included in an individual's total income for any year of assessment, subsections (2) and (3) above shall apply as

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

517

if they together constituted a single amount, but with the appropriate fraction of the whole determined by adding together the appropriate fractions of the individual amounts.

(5) A provision of this section requiring surtax to be calculated as if an amount constituted the highest part of a claimant’s total income shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Income Tax Acts directing any other amount to be treated as the highest part thereof, but, for the purposes of this section, a claimant's total income shall be deemed not to include any amount in respect of which he is chargeable to tax under sections 80, 81 or 82 of this Act (premiums, etc. treated as rent) or section 187 of this Act (payments on retirement or removal from office or employment).

401.—(1) Where an amount is included in an individual's income by virtue of section 399(1 )(a) above, and the rights or share in question were held immediately before the happening of the chargeable event on trust, the individual shall be entitled to recover from the trustees, to the extent of any sums, or to the value of any benefits, received by them by reason of the event, an amount equal to that (if any) by which the tax with which he is chargeable for the year of assessment in question, reduced by the amount of any relief available under section 400 above in respect of the amount so included, exceeds the tax with which he would have been chargeable for the year if the said amount had not been so included.

(2) Where, for the purposes of relief under the said section 400, two or more amounts are to be treated as one, the reduction required by subsection (1) above on account of the relief available in respect of any of them shall consist of a proportionate part of the relief available in respect of their aggregate.

(3) An individual may require the Board to certify any amount recoverable by him by virtue of this section, and the certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the amount.

402.—(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, where a chargeable •event within the meaning of this Chapter has happened in relation to any policy or contract, the body by or with whom the policy •or contract was issued, entered into or effected shall, within three months of the event or, if it is a death or an assignment, within three months of their receiving written notification thereof, deliver to the inspector a certificate specifying—

(a) the name and address of the policy holder,

(b) the nature of the event, and the date on which it

happened.

CHAPTER IV

Insurance : Borrowing to pay Premiums and Borrowing against Life Policies

403.—(1) Subject to the exceptions contained in section 404 below, in computing for the purposes of surtax the total income for any year of assessment of an individual who has entered into a contraot of assurance, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any interest on any borrowed money which has been applied directly or indirectly to or towards the payment of any premium under that contract, or of any sum paid in lieu of any such premium.

in him by virtue of an assignment and any payment was made by him in consideration of the assignment, as if that payment were the payment of a premium under the contract, and

(c) in a case where, either as being the person in whom

the said benefit is vested, or by reason of any agreement under or in pursuance of which the said benefit became vested in him, he pays any interest on any borrowed money, as if that money had been applied to the payment of a premium under the contract.

(3) The provisions of section 22 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 with regard to the delivery of particulars as to deductions claimed to be allowed shall be extended so as to enable the Board to require such particulars with respect to deductions and otherwise as they may consider necessary for the purpose of carrying this section and section 404 below into effect.

(4) In this section and the said section 404—

borrowed money,

(c) any reference to borrowed money applied to or towards

any payment shall be deemed to include a reference to borrowed money applied directly or indirectly to or towards the replacement of any money so applied, and id) any reference to a capital sum payable on death under a contract of assurance shall be construed as a reference to the actual capital sum assured on death, exclusive of any addition which has arisen or may arise from any bonus, share of profits, return of premiums or otherwise, and, in the case of a contract under which different capital sums are payable on death in different events, as a reference to the least of those sums.

404.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, section 403 above shall not, where the interest is payable at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent, per annum, apply to—

(a) interest on money borrowed mainly on the security of property other than a contract of assurance, if the premium in question either—

(i) neither the amount of the first premium under the contract, nor the amount subsequently payable by way of premiums thereunder in respect of any period of twelve months, exceeds one-eighth of the capital sum payable on death, and

(ii) it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board that it is exceptional for the individual in question to apply borrowed money to or towards the payment of premiums to which this paragraph applies, and that no such money has been so applied by him in any of the three years of assessment immediately preceding that in which he so applies the money on which the interest in question is payable, or

(c) interest on borrowed money applied to or towards the

payment of premiums which—

(2) The amount of the moneys payable under a policy of life assurance shall not be deemed for the purposes of this section to be made to increase by reference to the length of a period ending on the happening of an event or contingency dependent on human life by reason only that those moneys are to increase from time to time if profits are made by the persons liable under the policy.

Payments under certified schemes which are not repayments of contributions.

408.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where under any scheme which is for the time being certified or has at any time been certified by the Board of Trade under section 406 above, any payment (not being a payment made by way of repayment of contributions) is made to a person carrying on a trade to which the scheme relates, that payment shall be treated for the purposes of the Tax Acts as a trading receipt of the trade, and shall accordingly be taken into account in computing the profits or gains of the trade for those purposes.

(2) Where on a claim it is shown in accordance with the provisions of Part II of Schedule 11 to this Act that the payments which have been made under such a scheme in respect of a trade (not being payments made by way of repayment of contributions) have been made wholly or partly in respect of damage in respect of which no relief may be given under the Tax Acts, then, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of that Schedule, relief shall be given in respect of those payments by reducing the amounts which are to be treated as trading receipts of the trade under subsection (1) of this section, but, where such relief is given, the said section 406 shall, in relation to contributions subsequently paid under the scheme in respect of the trade, have effect subject to the modifications specified in Part III of that Schedule.

Modification of pre-war provisions for tax free annuities, etc.

Pre-war provisions for tax free annuities, salaries, pensions, etc.

422.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, any provision, however worded, for the payment, whether periodically or otherwise, of a stated amount free of income tax, or free of income tax other than surtax, being a provision which—

(a) is contained in any deed or other instrument, in any

will or codicil, in any order of any court, in any local or personal Act, or in any contract, whether oral or in writing, and

(b) was made before 3rd September 1939, and

(c) has not been varied on or after that date.

shall, as respects payments falling to be made during any year of assessment the standard rate of income tax for which exceeds 27*5 per cent., have effect as if for the stated amount there were substituted an amount equal to the appropriate fraction thereof.

(2) Where any such provision as is mentioned in subsection

(1) of this section is a provision for a payment free of income tax (and not merely a provision for a payment free of income tax other than surtax) the sum, if any, to be paid under that provision to make good the requirement that the payment shall be free of surtax shall, in the case of surtax for the year preceding any such year of assessment as is mentioned in the said subsection (1), be reduced to the appropriate fraction of the sum which would have been sufficient for that purpose if the rates of surtax in force for the year 1937-38 had applied to the year for which the surtax is payable.

(3) If, in the case of a payment to which subsection (1) of this section applies, the relations of the payee and the payor are such that the payee is accountable to the payor for so much of any relief from income tax which he receives as is ascribable to the payment—

(a) the liability of the payee to account to the payor shall

be limited to the appropriate fraction of the sum for which he would have been accountable if the 1938-39 rates of income tax, other than surtax, had applied to the year of assessment in which the payment falls to be made, and the preceding provisions of this section had not been passed; and

(b) the relief to be given shall be calculated as if—

(i) the gross sum represented by the payment were what it would have been if the 1938-39 rates of income tax, other than surtax, had applied to the year of assessment in which the payment falls to be

made, and the preceding provisions of this section Part XIV had not been passed; and Chapter VI

(ii) that gross sum had borne income tax at the standard rate of tax for the year of assessment in which the payment falls to be made.

(4) This section shall not—

(a) affect any provision falling within section 391(4) of this Act or section 106(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (which render invalid agreements not to deduct income tax), or

(b) affect any provision if, by virtue of any provision in the

same or any other deed, instrument, will, codicil, order, local or personal Act or contract which contemplates rises in the rates of income tax, the payments thereunder have ceased or, in the event of further rises in the rates of income tax, may cease, to be wholly free of income tax, or, as the case may be, wholly free of income tax other than surtax; or

(c) apply to any emoluments of any office, employment,

annuity, pension or stipend taxed under Schedule E; or

(d) apply to any dividends or shares of profits:

Provided that the reference in this subsection to any annuity taxed under Schedule E shall not include a reference to any annuity so taxed by virtue of section 208(3) of this Act (approved superannuation funds).

(5) In this section “ the appropriate fraction ” in relation to any year of assessment is where A is the standard rate of income tax for the year expressed as a percentage.

423.—(1) This section applies to offices, employments. Modification annuities, pensions and stipends taxed under Schedule E, where of pre-war by virtue of— provisions

(a) some provision which is contained in a contract (whether salaries, oral or in writing) made before the 3rd September pensions, 1939, and which has not been varied on or after thatetc-date; or

(b) some provision which is contained in an enactment passed before 3rd September 1939 and which has not been amended on or after that date.

the emoluments include a payment to or for the benefit of the recipient of the emoluments in respect of his income tax:

Provided that the reference in this subsection to annuities taxed under Schedule E shall not include a reference to any

Part XIV annuities so taxed by virtue of section 208(3) of this Act Chapter VI (approved superannuation funds).

(2) The amount, if any, payable, in a case to which this section applies, to or for the benefit of the recipient of the emoluments in respect of his income tax for any year of assessment, other than surtax, shall not exceed the amount which would have been payable if the 1938-39 rates of income tax, other than surtax, had applied to the year of assessment in question.

(3) The amount, if any, payable, in a case to which this section applies, to or for the benefit of the recipient of the emoluments in respect of his surtax for any year of assessment shall not exceed the amount which would have been payable if the rates of surtax in force for the year 1937-38 had applied to the year of assessment in question.

Interpretation of last two preceding sections.

424. For the purposes of sections 422 and 423 above—

(a) a provision, however worded, for the payment of such

sum as will after deduction of income tax be equal to a stated amount, shall be treated as a provision for the payment of the said stated amount free of income tax, other than surtax; and

(b) the expression “a stated amount” includes a stated

fraction of the gross amount of any specified income (that is to say, of the amount of that income before income tax has been charged thereon, whether by deduction or otherwise), but does not include a stated fraction of the net amount of any specified income (that is to say, of the amount of that income after it has been charged to income tax, whether by deduction or otherwise); and

(c) the expression “if the 1938-39 rates of income tax, other than surtax, had applied ” means, in relation to a year of assessment, if the standard rate of tax for the year had been 27*5 per cent, and the enactments relating to relief from income tax had not been amended in any respect by any Act passed since 3rd September 1939.

Arrangements for payment of interest less tax or of fixed net amount

Application to 425.—(1) It is hereby declared that any provision made before

interest payable or after the passing of this Act, whether orally or in writing,

without for the payment of interest “ less tax ”, or using words to that

deduction

of tax.

effect, is to be construed, in relation to interest payable without Part XIV deduction of tax, as if the words “ less tax ”, or the equivalent chapter VI words, were not included.

(2) In relation to interest on which the recipient is chargeable to tax under Case III of Schedule D, and which is payable without deduction of tax, any provision, made before or after the passing of this Act, whether orally or in writing, and however worded, for the payment of interest at such a rate (referred to below in this subsection as the “ gross rate ”) as shall, after the deduction of the standard rate of income tax for the time being in force, be equal to a stated rate, shall be construed as if it were a provision requiring the payment of interest at the gross rate.

PART XV

Estates of Deceased Persons in Course of Administration

426.—(1) The following provisions of this section shall have Limited effect in relation to a person who, during the period commencing interests on the death of a deceased person and ending on the completion m residue' of the administration of his estate (in this Part of this Act referred to as “ the administration period ”) or during a part of that period, has a limited interest in the residue of the estate or in a part thereof.

(2) When any sum has been paid during the administration period in respect of that limited interest, the amount thereof shall, subject to subsection (3) below, be deemed for all tax purposes to have been paid to that person as income for the year of assessment in which that sum was paid or, in the case of a sum paid in respect of an interest that has ceased, for the last year of assessment in which it was subsisting.

(3) On the completion of the administration of the estate—

(a) the aggregate amount of all sums paid before, or pay-

able on, the completion of the administration in respect of that limited interest shall be deemed to have accrued due to that person from day to day during the administration period or the part thereof during which he had that interest, as the case may be, and to have been paid to him as it accrued due, and

(b) the amount deemed to have been paid to that person

by virtue of paragraph (a) above in any year of assessment shall be deemed for all tax purposes to have been paid to him as income for that year, and

Absolute interests in residue.

(c) where the amount which is deemed to have been paid to that person as income for any year by virtue of this subsection is less or greater than the amount deemed to have been paid to him as income for that year by virtue of subsection (2) above, such adjustments shall be made as are provided in section 431 below.

(4) Any amount which is deemed to have been paid to that person as income for any year by virtue of this section shall—

(a) in the case of a United Kingdom estate, be deemed to be

income of such an amount as would after deduction of standard tax for that year be equal to the amount deemed to have been so paid, and to be income that has borne standard tax, and

(b) in the case of a foreign estate, be deemed to be income

of the amount deemed to have been so paid, and shall be chargeable to standard tax under Case IV of Schedule D as if it were income arising from securities in a place out of the United Kingdom.

(5) Where a person has been charged to standard tax for any year by virtue of this section in respect of an amount deemed to have been paid to him as income in respect of an interest in a foreign estate and any part of the aggregate income of that estate for that year has borne United Kingdom income tax by deduction or otherwise, the tax so charged on him shall, on proof of the facts on a claim, be reduced by an amount bearing the same proportion thereto as the amount of the said income which has borne United Kingdom income tax, less the tax so borne, bears to the amount of the said aggregate income, less the tax so borne :

Provided that, where relief has been so given, such part of the amount in respect of which he has been charged to standard tax as corresponds to the said proportion shall, for the purposes of surtax, be deemed to represent income of such an amount as would after deduction of standard tax be equal to that part of the amount charged.

427.—(1) The following provisions of this section shall have effect in relation to a person who, during the administration period or during a part of that period, has an absolute interest in the residue of the estate of a deceased person or in a part thereof.

547

(b) that person had that interest, and the amount so ascertained in respect of any year or part of a year, or, in the case of a person having an absolute interest iu a part of a residue, a proportionate part of that amount, is in this Part of this Act referred to as the “ residuary income ” of that person for that year of assessment:

Provided that, when legacy duty charged on the residue, or on the part thereof in which that person has an absolute interest, as the case may be, has been paid in respect of income for any such year or part of a year as aforesaid, his residuary income for that year shall thereafter be treated for the purposes of surtax as reduced by the amount of that duty so far as paid in respect of such income.

(3) When any sum or sums has or have been paid during the administration period in respect of that absolute interest, the amount of that sum or the aggregate amount of those sums shall, subject to subsection (4) below, be deemed for all tax purposes to have been paid to that person as income to the extent to which, and for the year or years of assessment for which, he would have been treated for those purposes as having received income if he had had a right to receive in each year of assessment—

(a) in the case of a United Kingdom estate, his residuary income for that year less standard tax for that year, and

(b) in the case of a foreign estate his residuary income for that year,

and that sum or the aggregate of those sums had been available for application primarily in or towards satisfaction of those rights as they accrued and had been so applied.

In the case of a United Kingdom estate, any amount which is deemed to have been paid to that person as income for any year by virtue of this subsection shall be deemed to be income of such an amount as would, after deduction of standard tax for that year, be equal to the amount deemed to have been so paid, and to be income that has borne standard tax.

have been paid to him as income for that year by virtue of subsection (3) above, such adjustments shall be made as are provided in section 431 below.

(5) In the case of a foreign estate, any amount which is deemed to have been paid to that person as income for any year by virtue of this section shall be deemed to be income of that amount, and shall be chargeable to standard tax under Case IV of Schedule D as if it were income arising from securities in a place out of the United Kingdom.

(6) Where a person has been charged to standard tax for any year by virtue of this section in respect of an amount deemed to have been paid to him as income in respect of an interest in a foreign estate, and any part of the aggregate income of that estate for that year has borne United Kingdom income tax by deduction or otherwise, the tax so charged on him shall, on proof of the facts on a claim, be reduced by an amount bearing the same proportion thereto as the amount of the said income which has borne United Kingdom income tax bears to the amount of the said aggregate income.

(7) For the purposes of any charge to corporation tax under this section, the residuary income of a company shall be computed in the first instance by reference to years of assessment, and the residuary income for any such year shall be apportioned between the accounting periods (if more than one) comprising that year.

(a) the amount of any annual interest, annuity or other

annual payment for that year which is a charge on residue and the amount of any payment made in that year in respect of any such expenses incurred by the personal representatives as such in the management of the assets of the estate as, in the absence of any express provision in a will, would be properly chargeable to income, but excluding any such interest, annuity or payment allowed or allowable in computing the aggregate income of the estate, and

(b) the amount of any of the aggregate income of the

estate for that year to which a person has on or after assent become entitled by virtue of a specific disposition either for a vested interest during the administration period or for a vested or contingent interest on the completion of the administration.

c. 10

549

(2) In the event of its appearing, on the completion of the administration of an estate in the residue of which, or in a part of the residue of which, a person had an absolute interest at the completion of the administration, that the aggregate of the benefits received in respect of that interest does not amount to as much as the aggregate for all years of the residuary income of the person having that interest, his residuary income for each year shall be reduced for the purpose of section 427 above by an amount bearing the same proportion thereto as the deficiency bears to the aggregate for all years of his residuary income.

In this subsection “benefits received” in respect of an absolute interest means the following amounts in respect of all sums paid before, or payable on, the completion of the administration in respect of that interest, that is to say—

(a) as regards a sum paid before the completion of the administration, in die case of a United Kingdom estate such an amount as would, after deduction of standard tax for the year of assessment in which that sum was paid, be equal to that sum, or in the case of a foreign estate the amount of that sum, and

(b) as regards a sum payable on the completion of the administration, in the case of a United Kingdom estate such an amount as would, after deduction of standard tax for the year of assessment in which the administration is completed, be equal to that sum, or in the case of a foreign estate the amount of that sum.

(3) In the application of subsection (2) above to a residue or a part of a residue in which a person other than the person having an absolute interest at the completion of the administration had an absolute interest at any time during the administration period, the aggregates therein mentioned shall be computed in relation to those interests taken together, and the residuary income of that other person also shall be subject to reduction thereunder.

429.—(1) Where the personal representatives of a deceased person have as such a right in relation to the estate of another deceased person such that, if that right were vested in them for their own benefit, they would have an absolute or limited interest in the residue of that estate or in a part thereof, they shall be deemed to have that interest notwithstanding that that right is not vested in them for their own benefit, and any amount deemed to be paid to them as income by virtue of this Part of this Act shall be treated as part of the aggregate income of the estate of the person whose personal representatives they are.

(2) Where different persons have successively during the administration period absolute interests in the residue of the estate of a deceased person or in a part thereof, sums paid during that period in respect of the residue or of that part thereof, as the case may be, shall be treated for the purpose of this Part of this Act as having been paid in respect of the interest of the person who first had an absolute interest therein up to the amount of—

(< a) in the case of a United Kingdom estate, the aggregate for all years of that person’s residuary income less standard tax, or

(b) in the case of a foreign estate, the aggregate for all years of that person’s residuary income, and. as to any balance up to a corresponding amount, in respect of the interest of the person who next had an absolute interest therein, and so on.

(3) Where, upon the exercise of a discretion, any of the income of the residue of the estate of a deceased person for any period (being the administration period or a part thereof) would, if the residue had been ascertained at the commencement of that period, be properly payable to any person, or to another in his right, for his benefit, whether directly by the personal representatives or indirectly through a trustee or other person, the amount of any sum paid pursuant to an exercise of the discretion in favour of that person shall be deemed for all tax purposes to have been paid to that person as income for the year of assessment in which it was paid, and the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) of section 426 above shall have effect in relation to an amount which is deemed to have been paid as income by virtue of this subsection.

430.—(1) Where any income, having accrued before the death of any person, is taken into account both—

(a) in estimating the principal value of an estate for the

purposes of any estate duty payable on his death, and

(b) in ascertaining for the purposes of this Part of this Act

the residuary income of his estate for any year of assessment,

then, in ascertaining the liability to surtax of any person having an absolute interest in the residue of that or any other estate or part thereof, that residuary income shall be treated as reduced by an amount calculated in accordance with the following provisions of this section.

(2) The amount of the reduction shall be an amount which, after deduction of standard tax for the said year of assessment, would equal the amount of estate duty payable in respect of

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

551

so much of the income taken into account as mentioned in Part XV subsection (1) above as exceeds any liabilities so taken into account.

(3) The amount of estate duty payable in respect of any income taken into account in estimating the principal value of an estate shall be taken to be—

(a) subject to paragraph (b)below, the amount which would

be produced by levying estate duty on the amount of that income at the estate rate applicable to the estate in question under the law in force in Great Britain or, as the case may be, in Northern Ireland or, if estate duty is payable both in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, whichever is the higher of the respective amounts which would be so produced;

(b) where section 16(3)(ft) of the Finance Act 1894 or any 1894 c. 30. other provision for corresponding purposes of the law

in force in Northern Ireland applies for the purpose of determining the amount of the estate duty payable in Great Britain or, as the case may be, in Northern Ireland in respect of property consisting of or including that income, the amount which would be produced as aforesaid shall be taken to be an amount equal to so much of that amount of estate duty as may reasonably be regarded as attributable to that income.

(4) The amount of any income accruing before the death of any person and taken into account in estimating the principal value of an estate shall (whether or not the income was valued separately or its amount known at the date of the death) be taken to be the actual amount so accruing less standard tax for the year of assessment in which the death occurred.

(5) The amounts agreed between the persons accountable for estate duty and the Board (or, as respects estate duty payable under the law of Northern Ireland, the Ministry of Finance for Northern Ireland), or determined in proceedings between them, as being respectively the principal value of an estate and the amount of any estate duty payable shall be conclusive for the purposes of this section; and evidence of those amounts and of any facts relevant to their computation may be given by the production of a document purporting to be a certificate from the Board or, as the case may be, that Ministry.

(6) In this section references to liabilities taken into account in ascertaining the amount of the residuary income of an estate include references to liabilities allowed or allowable in computing its aggregate income.

(7) This section shall come into force so as to apply only where the death occurred after 3rd June 1969 (and so that

431.—(1) Where on the completion of the administration of an estate any amount is deemed by virtue of this Part of this Act to have been paid to any person as income for any year of assessment and—

(a) that amount is greater than the amount that has pre-

viously been deemed to have been paid to him as income for that year by virtue of this Part of this Act, or

(b) no amount has previously been so deemed to have been paid to him as income for that year,

an assessment may be made upon him for that year and tax charged accordingly or, on a claim being made for the purpose, any relief or additional relief to which he may be entitled shall be allowed accordingly.

(2) Where on the completion of the administration of an estate any amount is deemed by virtue of this Part of this Act to have been paid to any person as income for any year of assessment, and that amount is less than the amount that has previously been so deemed to have been paid to him, then—

(a) if an assessment has already been made upon him for

that year, such adjustments shall be made in that assessment as may be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Part of this Act which take effect on the completion of the administration, and any tax overpaid shall be repaid, and

(b) if—

(i) any relief has been allowed to him by reference to the amount which has been previously deemed as aforesaid to have been paid to him as income for that year, and

(2) Subject to section 468(3) below, for the purposes of this Chapter a tax advantage obtained or obtainable by a person shall be deemed to be obtained or obtainable by him in consequence of a transaction in securities or of the combined effect of two or more such transactions, if it is obtained or obtainable in consequence of the combined effect of the transaction or transactions and of the liquidation of a company.

(3) Where this section applies to a person in respect of any transaction or transactions, the tax advantage obtained or obtainable by him in consequence thereof shall be counteracted by such of the following adjustments, that is to say an assessment, the nullifying of a right to repayment or the requiring of the return of a repayment already made (the amount to be returned being chargeable under Case VI of Schedule D and recoverable accordingly), or the computation or recomputation of profits or gains, or liability to tax, on such basis as the Board may specify by notice in writing served on him as being requisite for counteracting the tax advantage so obtained or obtainable.

(4) Subject to section 468(3) below, an assessment under subsection (3) above to counteract a tax advantage consisting of the avoidance or reduction of an assessment to income tax which would be payable by a company under section 232(2) of this Act (Schedule F) in respect of a distribution may be made under Case VI of Schedule D on a person other than the company, and may be so made in addition to any assessment to counteract a tax advantage in respect of surtax.

An assessment so made on a person other than the company may be of an amount arrived at without regard to any set-off to which the company would have been entitled under Schedule 9 to this Act.

(5) Subject to section 468(3) below, in the case of a man and his wife living with him (whether or not she is separately assessed to tax), this Chapter shall be treated as applying to him in respect of any transaction or transactions as it would apply if any property, rights or liabilities of the wife were his property, rights or liabilities in relation to which she had acted only as

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

583

nominee for him, and shall be treated as applying to the wife in respect of any transaction or transactions as it would apply if any property, rights or liabilities of the man were her property, rights or liabilities in relation to which he had acted only as nominee for her:

Provided that no adjustment made under subsection (3) above by reference to any transaction or transactions to counteract any tax advantage shall by virtue of this subsection be so made that a person bears more tax than if the transaction or transactions had not had as a consequence that any relief or increased relief from, or repayment or increased repayment of, income tax, or any deduction in computing profits or gains, was obtained or obtainable, or that the way in which receipts accrued was such that the recipient did not pay or bear tax on them.

(6) The Board shall not give a* notice under subsection (3) above until they have notified the person in question that they have reason to believe that this section may apply to him in respect of a transaction or transactions specified in the notification; and if within thirty days of the issue of the notification the said person, being of opinion that this section does not apply to him as aforesaid, makes a statutory declaration to that effect stating the facts and circumstances upon which his opinion is based, and sends it to the Board, then subject to subsection (7) below this section shall not apply to him in respect of the transaction or transactions.

(7) If, when a statutory declaration has been sent to the Board under subsection (6) above, they see reason to take further action in the matter—

(a) the Board shall send to the tribunal a certificate to that

effect, together with the statutory declaration, and may also send therewith a counter-statement with reference to the matter;

(b) the tribunal shall take into consideration the declaration

and the certificate, and the counter-statement, if any, and shall determine whether there is or is not a prima facie case for proceeding in the matter, and if they determine that there is no such case this section shall not apply to the person in question in respect of the transaction or transactions:

Provided that such a determination shall not affect the operation of this section in respect of transactions which include that transaction or some or all of those transactions and also include another transaction or other transactions.

(8) Subject to section 468(3) below, any notice or notification under subsection (3) or subsection (6) above, or under section 465 below, concerning the application of this section to a person

negligible, and before any considerable revival of the trade, there is a change in the ownership of the company,

no relief shall be given under section 177 of this Act (relief for trading losses against future trading profits or total profits) by setting a loss incurred by the company in an accounting period beginning before the change of ownership against any income or other profits of an accounting period ending after the change of ownership.

(2) In applying this section to the accounting period in which the change of ownership occurs, the part ending with the change of ownership, and the part after, shall be treated as two separate accounting periods, and the profits or losses of the accounting period shall be apportioned to the two parts.

The apportionment shall be on a time basis according to the respective lengths of those parts except that if it appears that that method would work unreasonably or unjustly such other method shall be used as appears just and reasonable.

(3) In subsection (1) above “major change in the nature or conduct of a trade ” includes—

(a) a major change in the type of property dealt in, or services or facilities provided, in the trade, or

(5) Where relief in respect of a company’s losses has been restricted under this section then, notwithstanding section 87(3) of the Capital Allowances Act 1968, in applying the provisions of that Act about balancing charges to the company by reference to any event after the change of ownership of the company, any allowance or deduction falling to be made in taxing the company’s trade for any chargeable period before the change of ownership shall be disregarded unless the profits or gains of that chargeable period or of any subsequent chargeable period before the change of ownership were sufficient to give effect to the allowance or deduction.

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

613

c. 10

In applying this subsection it shall be assumed that any profits Part xvn or gains are applied in giving effect to any such allowance or Chapter IV deduction in preference to being set off against any loss which is not attributable to such an allowance or deduction.

(6) Where the operation of this section depends on circumstances or events at a time after the change of ownership (but not more than three years after), an assessment to give effect to the provisions of this section shall not be out of time if made within six years from that time, or the latest of those times.

(7) Any person in whose name any shares, stock or securities of a company are registered shall, if required by notice in writing by an inspector given for the purposes of this section, state whether or not he is the beneficial owner of those shares or securities and, if not the beneficial owner of those shares or securities or any of them, shall furnish the name and address of the person or persons on whose behalf those shares, stock or securities are registered in his name.

(8) This section shall not apply if the change of ownership took place before 15th April 1969, and subsection (l)(a) above shall not apply if the major change in the nature or conduct of the trade was completed before that date.

In other respects this section has effect by reference to circumstances and events before that date, as well as by reference to later circumstances and events.

484.—(1) For the purposes of section 483 above (in this Rules for

section called “ the principal section ”) there is a change in the ascertaining

ownership of a company— change in

r r J ownership of

(a) if a single person acquires more than half the ordinary comPany.

share capital of the company, or

(b) if two or more persons each acquire a holding of 5 per cent, or more of the ordinary share capital of the company, and those holdings together amount to more than half the ordinary share capital of the company, or

(c) if two or more persons each acquire a holding of the ordinary share capital of the company, and the holdings together amount to more than half the ordinary share capital of the company, but disregarding a holding of less than 5 per cent, unless it is an addition to an existing holding and the two holdings together amount to 5 per cent, or more of the ordinary share capital of the company.

(2) In applying subsection (1) above—

(a) the circumstances at any two points of time with not

more than three years between may be compared, and a holder at the later time may be regarded as having acquired whatever he did not hold at the earlier time, irrespective of what he has acquired or disposed of in between,

(b) to allow for any issue of shares or other reorganisation

of capital, the comparison may be made in terms of percentage holdings of the total ordinary share capital at the respective times, so that a person whose percentage holding is greater at the later time may be regarded as having acquired a percentage holding equal to the increase,

(c) to decide for the purposes of subsection (l)(b) or (c)

above if any person has acquired a holding of at least 5 per cent., or a holding which makes at least 5 per cent, when added to an existing holding, acquisitions by, and holdings of, two or more persons who are connected persons within the meaning of section 533 of this Act shall be aggregated as if they were acquisitions by, and holdings of, one and the same person,

(d) any acquisition of shares under the will or on the

intestacy of a deceased person and, if it is shown that the gift is unsolicited and made without regard to the provisions of the principal section, any gift of shares, shall be left out of account.

(3) Where, because persons, whether company members or not, possess extraordinary rights or powers under the articles of association or under any other document regulating the company, ownership of ordinary share capital may not be an appropriate test of whether there has been a major change in the persons for whose benefit the losses may ultimately enure, then in considering whether there has been a change of ownership of the company for the purposes of the principal section, holdings of all kinds of share capital, including preference shares, or of any particular category of share capital, or voting power or any other special kind of power, may be taken into account instead of ordinary share capital.

(4) Where the principal section has operated to restrict relief by reference to a change of ownership taking place at any time, no transaction or circumstances before that time shall be taken into account in determining whether there is any subsequent change of ownership.

(5) A change in the ownership of a company shall be disregarded for the purposes of the principal section if—

(a) immediately before the change the company is the 75 per cent, subsidiary of another company, and

(b) (although there is a change in the direct ownership of the company) that other company continues after the change to own the first-mentioned company as a 75 per cent, subsidiary.

(6) If there is a change in the ownership of a company which has a 75 per cent, subsidiary (whether owned directly or indirectly) then, unless under subsection (5) above that change in ownership is to be disregarded, the principal section shall apply as if there had also been a change in the ownership of that 75 per cent, subsidiary.

(7) For the purposes of this section—

(a) references to ownership shall be construed as references to beneficial ownership, and references to acquisition shall be construed accordingly,

(b) a company shall be deemed to be a 75 per cent, subsidiary of another company if and so long as not less than three quarters of its ordinary share capital is owned by that other company, whether directly or through another company or other companies, or partly directly and partly through another company or other companies,

(c) the amount of ordinary share capital of one company owned by a second company through another company or other companies, or partly directly and partly through another company or other companies, shall be determined in accordance with subsections (5) to (10) of section 532 of this Act,

{) “ share ” includes stock.

(8) If any acquisition of ordinary share capital or other property or rights taken into account in determining that there has been a change of ownership of a company was made in pursuance of a contract of sale or option or other contract, or the acquisition was made by a person holding such a contract, and the contract was made on or after 15th April 1969, the time when the change in the ownership of the company took place shall be determined as if the acquisition had been made when the contract was made with the holder or when the benefit of it was assigned to him so that, in the case of a person exercising an option to purchase shares, he shall be regarded as having purchased the shares when he acquired the option.

Double Taxation Relief CHAPTER I The Principal Reliefs

497.—(1) If Her Majesty by Order in Council declares that arrangements specified in the Order have been made with the government of any territory outside the United Kingdom with a view to affording relief from double taxation in relation to income tax or corporation tax and any taxes of a similar character imposed by the laws of that territory, and that it is expedient that those arrangements should have effect, then, subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, the arrangements shall, notwithstanding anything in any enactment, have effect in relation to income tax and corporation tax in so far as they provide—

(a) for relief from income tax, or from corporation tax in

respect of income, or

(b) for charging the income arising from sources in the

United Kingdom to persons not resident in the United

Kingdom, or

(c) for determining the income to be attributed—

(i) to persons not resident in the United Kingdom and their agencies, branches or establishments in the United Kingdom, or

(ii) to persons resident in the United Kingdom who have special relationships with persons not so resident.

(2) The provisions of Chapter II below shall apply where arrangements which have effect by virtue of this section provide that tax payable under the laws of the territory concerned shall be allowed as a credit against tax payable in the United Kingdom.

(3) For the purposes of this section and, subject to section 503(3) below, of the said Chapter II in its application to relief under this section, any amount of tax which would have been payable under the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom but for a relief to which this subsection applies given under the

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

law of that territory shall be treated as having been payable; Part XVHI and references in this section and that Chapter to double taxa- Chapter I tion, to tax payable or chargeable, or to tax not chargeable directly or by deduction shall be construed accordingly.

This subsection applies to any relief given with a view to promoting industrial, commercial, scientific, educational or other development in a territory outside the United Kingdom, being a relief with respect to which provision is made in the arrangements in question for double taxation relief.

(4) Except in the case of a claim for an allowance by way of credit in accordance with Chapter II below, a claim for * relief under subsection (l)(a) above shall be made to the Board.

(5) Where, under any arrangements which have effect by virtue of this section, relief may be given, either in the United Kingdom or in the territory with the government of which the arrangements are made, in respect of any income, and it appears that the assessment to income tax or corporation tax made in respect of the income is not made in respect of the full amount thereof, or is incorrect having regard to the credit, if any, which falls to be given under the arrangements, any such assessments may be made as are necessary to ensure that the total amount of the income is assessed, and the proper credit, if any, is given in respect thereof, and, where the income is entrusted to any person in the United Kingdom for payment, any such assessment may be made on the recipient of the income under Case VI of Schedule D.

(6) Any arrangements to which effect is given under this section may include provision for relief from tax for periods before the passing of this Act, or before the making of the arrangements, and provisions as to income which is not itself subject to double taxation, and the preceding provisions of this section shall have effect accordingly.

(7) Any Order in Council made under this section may be revoked by a subsequent Order in Council, and any such revoking Order may contain such transitional provisions as appear to Her Majesty to be necessary or expedient.

(8) Before any Order proposed to be made under this section is submitted to Her Majesty in Council, a draft thereof shall be laid before the House of Commons, and the Order shall not be so submitted unless an Address is presented to Her Majesty by that House praying that the Order be made.

(9) Notwithstanding section 501(2) below, any arrangements made in relation to the profits tax under section 347 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (which this section re-enacts) or any 1952 c. 10. earlier enactment corresponding to the said section 347 shall,

except in so far as arrangements made after the passing of the

498.—(1) To the extent appearing from the following provisions of this section, relief from income tax and corporation tax in respect of income shall be given in respect of tax payable under the laiw of any territory outside the United Kingdom by allowing the last-mentioned tax as a credit against income tax or corporation tax, notwithstanding that there are not for the time being in force any arrangements under section 497 above providing for such relief:

Provided that the said relief shall not be given in respect of tax payable under the law of the Republic of Ireland.

(2) The said relief (hereafter referred to as “ unilateral relief ”) shall be such relief as would fall to be given under Chapter II below if arrangements with the government of the territory in question containing the provisions specified in subsections

(3) and (4) below were in force by virtue of the said section 497, but subject to any particular provision made with respect to unilateral relief in that Chapter; and any expression in that Chapter which imports a reference to relief under arrangements for the time being having effect by virtue of the said section 497 shall be deemed to import also a reference to unilateral relief.

(3) Credit for tax paid under the law of the territory outside the United Kingdom and computed by reference to income arising in that territory shall be allowed against any United Kingdom income tax or corporation tax computed by reference to that income (profits from, or remuneration for, personal or professional services performed in that territory being deemed for this purpose to be income arising in that territory):

Provided that—

(a) where the territory is the Isle of Man or any of the Channel Islands, the limitation to income arising in the territory shall not apply,

(h) where arrangements with the government of the territory are for the time being in force by virtue of section 497 above, credit for tax paid under the law of the territory shall not be allowed by virtue of this subsection in the case of any income if any credit for that tax is allowable under those arrangements in respect of that income, and

(c) credit shall not be allowed by virtue of this subsection for overseas tax on a dividend paid by a company resident in the territory unless—

(i) the overseas tax is directly charged on the dividend, whether by charge to tax, deduction of tax at source or otherwise, and the whole of it represents tax which neither the company nor the recipient would have borne if the dividend had not been paid, or

(ii) the dividend is paid to a company within subsection (4) below, or

(iii) the dividend is paid to a company to which section 509(1) below applies, and is a dividend of the kind described in that subsection.

(4) Where a dividend paid by a company resident in the territory is paid to a company resident in the United Kingdom which either—

(a) controls directly or indirectly, or

(b) is a subsidiary of a company which controls directly or

indirectly,

not less than 25 per cent, of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, or not less than 10 per cent, of the voting power if the territory is one of the Commonwealth territories, any tax in respect of its profits paid under the law of the territory by the company paying the dividend shall be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be allowed in respect of the dividend.

In this subsection references to the Commonwealth territories, and to one company being a subsidiary of another, are to be construed in accordance with section 500 below.

(5) Where unilateral relief may be given in respect of any income, and it appears that the assessment to income tax or corporation tax made in respect of the income is not made in respect of the full amount thereof, or is incorrect having regard to the credit, if any, which falls to be given by way of unilateral relief, any such assessments may be made as are necessary to ensure that the total amount of the income is assessed, and the proper credit, if any, is given in respect thereof, and, where the income is entrusted to any person in the United Kingdom for payment, any such assessment may be made on the recipient of the income under Case VI of Schedule D.

(6) In this section, and in Chapter II below in its application to unilateral relief, references to tax payable or paid under the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom include only references to taxes which are charged on income and correspond

Provided that no arrangements made under this subsection shall exempt from United Kingdom tax any profits or gains which either—

(i) arise from the sale of goods from a stock in the United

Kingdom, or

(ii) accrue to a person resident in the United Kingdom, or

postponement under this section of the relevant capital allowances operating to reduce that income for the purposes of tax for any chargeable period.

(2) The said conditions are—

(a) that the law under which the overseas tax is chargeable

provides for deductions or allowances to be given corresponding to capital allowances, but on a different basis such that they operate to reduce the income in question (if at all) to a less extent than the capital allowances to which the claim relates, but are calculated to operate to a greater extent than the corresponding capital allowances to reduce income arising subsequently, and

of the income in question is less than it would be if the capital allowances to which the claim relates operated to reduce the income to the same extent only as the deductions or allowances so provided for.

(4) For the purposes of any claim under this section there shall be taken into account such only of the relevant capital allowances, and the deductions or allowances operating to reduce the income in question for purposes of the overseas tax, as are calculated to give relief in respect of the same expenditure or the same assets. 5

(5) In this section “ overseas tax ” means tax chargeable under the laws of any territory outside the United Kingdom, and “ relevant capital allowances ”, in relation to any trade, means capital allowances falling to be made in taxing the trade; and the reference in subsection (1) above to tax for a chargeable period shall be construed, in relation to corporation tax, as referring to the tax for any financial year which is chargeable in respect of that period.

Sections 19, and

Lifb Policies : Qualification for Relief on Premiums

Part I Qualifying Conditions

General rules applicable to whole life and term assurances

1.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule, if a policy secures a capital sum which is payable only on death, or one payable either on death or on earlier disability, it is a qualifying policy if—

(a) it satisfies the conditions appropriate to it under sub-para-graphs (2) to (4) below, and

(b) except to the extent permitted by sub-paragraph (5) below it does not secure any other benefits.

(2) If the capital sum referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above is payable whenever the event in question happens, or if it happens at any time during the life of a specified person—

(a) the premiums under the policy must be payable at yearly

or shorter intervals, and either—

(i) until the happening of the event, or, as the case may require, until the happening of the event or the earlier death of the specified person, or

(ii) until the time referred to in sub-paragraph (i) above or the earlier expiry of a specified period ending not earlier than ten years after the making of the insurance, and

(b) the total premiums payable in any period of twelve months must not exceed—

(i) twice the amount of the total premiums payable in any other such period, or

(ii) one-eighth of the total premiums which would be payable if the policy were to continue in force for a period of ten years from the making of the insurance, or, in a case falling within paragraph (u)(ii) above, until the end of the period therein referred to.

(3) If the capital sum referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above is payable only if the event in question happens before the expiry of a specified term ending more than ten years after the making of the insurance, or only if it happens both before the expiry of such a term and during the life of a specified person—

(a) the premiums under the policy must be payable at yearly or shorter intervals, and either—

(i) until the happening of the event or the earlier expiry of the said term, or, as the case may require, until


678

c. 10

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

Sch. 1

the happening of the event or, if earlier, the expiry of the term or the death of the specified person, or

(ii) as in sub-paragraph (i) above, but with the substitution for references to the term of references to a specified shorter period, being one ending not earlier than ten years after the making of the insurance or, if sooner, the expiry of three-quarters of the said term, and

(b) the total premiums payable in any period of twelve months must not exceed—

(i) twice the amount of the total premiums payable in any other such period, or

(ii) one-eighth of the total premiums which would be payable if the policy were to continue in force for the term referred to in paragraph i) above, or, as the case may require, for the shorter period referred to in paragraph (<0(ii) above.

(4) If the capital sum referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above is payable only if the event in question happens before the expiry of a specified term ending not more than ten years after the making of the insurance, or only if it happens both before the expiry of such a term and during the life of a specified person, the policy must provide that any payment made by reason of its surrender during the period is not to exceed the total premiums previously paid thereunder.

(5) Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (1 Xh) above, if a policy secures a capital sum payable only on death, it may also secure benefits (including benefits of a capital nature) to be provided in the event of a person’s disability; and no policy is to be regarded for the purposes of that provision as securing other benefits by reason only of the fact that it confers a right to participate in profits, that it carries a guaranteed surrender value, that it gives an option to receive payments by way of annuity, or that it makes provision for the waiver of premiums by reason of a person’s disability, or for the effecting of a further insurance or insurances without the production of evidence of insurability.

(6) In applying sub-paragraph (2) or (3) above to any policy—

(a) no account shall be taken of any provision for the waiver of premiums by reason of a person’s disability, and

(b) if the term of the policy runs from a date earlier, but not more than three months earlier, than the making of the insurance, the insurance shall be treated as having been made on that date, and any premium paid in respect of the period before the making of the insurance, or in respect of that period and a subsequent period, as having been payable on that date.

(7) References in this paragraph to a capital sum payable on any event include references to any capital sum, or series of capital sums, payable by reason of that event; and a policy secures a capital sum payable either on death or on disability notwithstanding that the amount payable may vary with the event.

2.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule, a policy which secures a capital sum payable either on survival for a specified term or on earlier death, or earlier death or disability, including a policy securing the sum on death only if occurring after the attainment of a specified age not exceeding sixteen, is a qualifying policy if it satisfies the following conditions—

(a) the term must be one ending not earlier than ten years after the making of the insurance,

(b) premiums must be payable under the policy at yearly or

shorter intervals, and—

(i) until the happening of the event in question, or

(ii) until the happening of that event, or the earlier expiry of a specified period shorter than the term but also ending not earlier than ten years after the making of the insurance, or

(iii) if the policy is to lapse on the death of a specified person, until one of those times or the policy’s earlier lapse.

(c) the total premiums payable under the policy in any period

of twelve months must not exceed—

(i) twice the amount of the total premiums payable in any other such period, or

(ii) one-eighth of the total premiums which would be payable if the policy were to run for the specified term,

(d) the policy—

(i) must guarantee that the capital sum payable on death, or on death occurring after the attainment of a specified age not exceeding sixteen, will, whenever that event may happen, be equal to three-quarters at least of the total premiums which would be payable if the policy were to run for that term, disregarding any amounts included in those premiums by reason of their being payable otherwise than annually, and

(ii) if it is a policy which does not secure a capital sum in the event of death before the attainment of a specified age not exceeding sixteen, must not provide for the payment in that event of an amount exceeding the total premiums previously paid thereunder, and

(e) the policy must not secure the provision (except by sur-

render) at any time before the happening of the event in question of any benefit of a capital nature other than a payment falling within paragraph (dXii) above, or benefits attributable to a right to participate in profits or arising by reason of a person’s disability.

(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1X^0) above, 10 per cent of the premiums payable under any policy issued in the course of an industrial assurance business as defined in section 1(2) of the Industrial Assurance Act 1923 shall be treated as attributable to the 1923 c. 8. fact that they are not paid annually.

3. A policy issued by any friendly society, or branch of a friendly society, in the course of its tax exempt life or endowment business, as defined in section 337(3) of this Act, is a qualifying policy notwithstanding that it does not comply with the conditions specified in paragraph 1 or 2 above.

(ii) Industrial Assurance policies

4. —(1) A policy issued in the course of an industrial assurance 1923 c. 8. business, as defined in section 1(2) of the Industrial Assurance Act

1923, and not constituting a qualifying policy by virtue of paragraph 1 or 2 above, is nevertheless a qualifying policy if—

(a) the sums guaranteed by the policy, together with those guaranteed at the time the assurance is made by all other policies issued in the course of such a business to the same person and not constituting qualifying policies apart from this paragraph, do not exceed £1,000,

(b) it satisfies the conditions with respect to premiums specified in paragraph 1(2) above,

(c) except by reason of death or surrender, no capital sum other

than one falling within paragraph () below can become payable under the policy earlier than ten years after the making of the assurance, and

(i) the first such payment is due not earlier than five years after the making of the assurance, and the others, except the final payment, at intervals of not less than five years, and

(ii) the amount of any payment, other than the final payment, does not exceed four-fifths of the premiums paid in the interval before its payment, and

(iii) if the first such payment is due earlier than ten years after the making of the assurance, or any other such payment except the last is due earlier than ten years after the preceding one, the sums guaranteed by the policy, together with the other sums referred to in paragraph (a) above so far as guaranteed by policies the payments under which also fall within this sub-paragraph, do not exceed £500.

(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, the sums guaranteed by a policy do not include any bonuses, or, in the case of a policy providing for a series of payments during its term, any of those payments except the first, or any sum payable on death during the term by reference to one or more of those payments except so far as that sum is referable to the first such payment.

(iii) Family income policies and mortgage protection policies

5.—(1) The following provisions apply to any policy which is not a qualifying policy apart from those provisions, and the benefits secured by which consist of or include the payment on or after a person’s death of—

(a) one capital sum which does sot vary according to the date

of death, plus a series of capital sums payable if the death occurs during a specified period, or

(b) a capital sum, the amount of which is less if the death occurs in a later part of a specified period than if it occurs in an earlier part of that period.

(2) A policy falling within sub-paragraph (l)(a) above is a qualifying policy if—

(a) it would be one if it did not secure the series of capital

sums there referred to, and the premiums payable under the policy were such as would be chargeable if that were in fact the case, and

(b) it would also be one if it secured only that series of sums,

and the premiums thereunder were the balance of those actually so payable.

(3) A policy falling within sub-paragraph (1)(6) above is a qualifying policy if—

(a) it would be one if the amount of the capital sum there referred to were equal throughout the period to its smallest amount, and the premiums payable under the policy were such as would be chargeable if that were in fact the case, and

(b) it would also be one if it secured only that capital sum so far as it from time to time exceeds its smallest amount, and the premiums payable thereunder were the balance of those actually so payable.

Other special provisions

(i) Exceptional mortality risk

6. For the purpose of determining whether any policy is a qualifying policy, there shall be disregarded—

(a) so much of any premium thereunder as is charged on the

grounds that an exceptional risk of death is involved, and

(b) any provision under which, on those grounds, any sum may become chargeable as a debt against the capital sum guaranteed by the policy on death.

(ii) Connected policies

7. Where the terms of any policy provide that it is to continue in force only so long as another policy does so, neither policy is a qualifying policy unless, if they had constituted together a single policy issued in respect of an insurance made at the time of the insurance in respect of which the first-mentioned policy was issued, that single policy would have been a qualifying policy.

(iii) Premiums paid out of sums due under previous policies

8. —(1) Where, in the case of a policy under which a single premium only is payable, liability for the payment of that premium is discharged in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) below, the policy is a qualifying policy notwithstanding anything in paragraph 1(2) or 1(3) above, or in paragraph (b) or (c) of paragraph 2(1); and where, in the case of any other policy, liability for the payment of the first premium thereunder, or of any part of that premium, is so discharged, the premium or part shall be disregarded for the purposes of paragraph 1(2)(Z>) and 1(3X&) above, and of paragraph (c) of paragraph 2(1).

(2) Liability for the payment of a premium is discharged in accordance with this sub-paragraph if it is discharged by the retention by the company with whom the insurance is made of the whole or a part of any sum which has become payable on the maturity of, or on the surrender more than ten years after its issue of the rights conferred by, a policy—

(a) previously issued by the company to the person making the

insurance, or, if it is made by trustees, to them or any predecessors in office, or

(b) issued by the company when the person making the insurance was an infant, and securing a capital sum payable either on a specified date falling not more than one month after his attaining twenty-five, or on the anniversary of the policy immediately following his attainment of that age,

being, unless it is a policy falling within paragraph (b) above and the premium in question is a first premium only, a policy which was itself a qualifying policy, or which would have been a qualifying policy had it been issued in respect of an insurance made after 19th March 1968.

(iv) Substitutions and variations

9. —(1) Where one policy (hereafter referred to as “the new policy ”) is issued in substitution for, or on the maturity of and in consequence of an option conferred by, another policy (hereafter referred to as “ the old policy ”), the question whether the new policy is a qualifying policy shall, to the extent provided by the rules in sub-paragraph (2) below, be determined by reference to both policies.

(2) The said rules (for the purposes of which, the question whether the old policy was a qualifying policy shall be determined in accordance with this Part of this Schedule, whatever the date of the insurance in respect of which it was issued), are as follows—

(a) if the new policy would apart from this paragraph be a qualifying policy, but the old policy was not, the new policy is not a qualifying policy unless the person making the insurance in respect of which it is issued was an infant when the old policy was issued, and the old policy was one securing a capital sum payable either on a specified date falling not later than one month after his attaining twenty-five or

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

683

on the anniversary of the policy immediately following his Sch. 1 attainment erf that age;

(b) if the new policy would apart from this paragraph be a

qualifying policy, and the old policy was also a qualifying policy, the new policy is a qualifying policy unless—

(i) it takes effect before the expiry of ten years from the making of the insurance in respect of which the old policy was issued, and

(ii) the highest total of premiums payable thereunder for any period of twelve months expiring before that time is less than one half of the highest total paid for any period of twelve months under the old policy, or under any related policy issued less than ten years before the issue of the new policy (“related policy” meaning any policy in relation to which the old policy was a new policy within the meaning of this paragraph, any policy in relation to which that policy was such a policy, and so on);

qualifying policy, and would fail to be so by reason only of paragraph 1(2) or 1(3) above or of paragraph (a), (b) or

(c) of paragraph 2(1), it is nevertheless a qualifying policy if the old policy was a qualifying policy and—

(i) the old policy was issued in respect of an insurance made more than ten years before the taking effect of the new policy, and the premiums payable for any period of twelve months under the new policy do not exceed the smallest total paid for any such period under the old policy, or

substantially equivalent to those which he would have enjoyed if the old policy had continued in force.

Sch. 1 with the rules in paragraph 9 above, with references in those rules to the new policy and the old policy construed for that purpose as references respectively to the policy after the variation and the policy before the variation, and with any other necessary modifications.

(2) In applying any of those rules by virtue of this paragraph, the question whether a policy after a variation would be a qualifying policy apart from the rule shall be determined as if any reference in paragraphs 1 to 7 of this Schedule to the making of an insurance, or to a policy’s term, were a reference to the taking effect of the variation or, as die case may be, to the term of the policy as from the variation.

(3) This paragraph does not apply by reason of—

(a) any variation which, whether or not of a purely formal character, does not affect the terms of a policy in any significant respect, or

(3) Where, in the case of any policy, or any policy after a variation, the total premiums payable in any period of twelve months do not exceed £26, a certificate need be given under sub-paragraph

(1) or (2) above only if requested in writing by the policy holder, and, if so requested, shall be given within three months of receipt of the request; and sub-paragraph (2) above shall not apply by reason of—

(a) any variation which, whether or not of a purely formal character, does not affect the terms of a policy in any significant respect, or

Special Relief for Individuals

2. The relief shall be computed in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6 below, and in those paragraphs—

“ chargeable sum ” means an amount to which, under subsection

(1), (2), (3) or (4) of section 80 of this Act, the claimant is treated as becoming entitled in the year of assessment, or in respect of which he is by virtue of subsection (5) of that section, or section 81 or 82 of this Act, chargeable to income tax for the year under Case VI of Schedule D;

“relevant period*', in relation to any chargeable sum, means the period treated in computing the amount of the sum as being the duration of the lease in respect of which it

arises or, where it arises (by virtue of the said section 82) in connection with the sale of an estate or interest in land, means the period mentioned in subsection (1) of that section;

“ yearly equivalent ”, in relation to any chargeable sum, means the amount which bears to that sum the same proportion as one bears to the number of years and fractions of years in the relevant period.

3. There shall be computed—

(a) the amount of the tax which, in respect of the chargeable

sum or the aggregate of the chargeable sums, as the case may be, would be chargeable if—

(i) the relief were not given, and

(ii) that sum or aggregate were treated as the highest part of the claimant’s total income, and

(iii) amounts deductible in computing the tax were so far as possible deducted from other sums from which they are deductible in the year rather than from that sum or aggregate, and

(b) the amount of the tax which, in respect of that sum or

aggregate, would be chargeable if calculated, in accordance with paragraph 4 below, by reference to the yearly equivalent of that sum, or, as the case may be, of each sum comprised in that aggregate,

and the relief shall consist of a reduction or repayment of tax equal to the difference between those amounts.

4. —(1) Where the relief is to be given in respect of one chargeable sum only, the tax shall be calculated for the purposes of paragraph 3(h) above as follows—

(a) from the yearly equivalent of that sum there shall be deducted such amounts as, following the principle set out in paragraph 3(a)(iii) above, are deductible from that sum,

(b) if any balance of the yearly equivalent remains, the tax in respect of the chargeable sum shall be calculated at the rate which, apart from the relief, would apply if the amount of the sum were reduced to the amount of that balance and were then treated as the highest part of the claimant’s total income or, if two or more rates would then apply, at those rates in corresponding proportions,

(c) if no such balance remains, the tax shall be calculated at

the rate applicable to the highest part of the remainder of the claimant’s total income for the year of assessment,

and, whether or not any such balance remains, the tax shall be arrived at by applying the said rate or rates to so much of the chargeable sum as remains after deducting such amounts as, following the principle set out in the said paragraph 3(aXiii), are deductible from that sum.

(a) the rate of tax on a sum arising in respect of any relevant period shall be calculated before the rate of tax on any sum arising in respect of a shorter relevant period, and

(b) in calculating the rate of tax on a sum arising in respect of any relevant period and the deductions from that sum, an amount deducted in respect of a sum tax for which has already been calculated shall not again be deducted, and, in calculating a rate of tax—

(i) any chargeable sum tax for which has not already been calculated, or in respect of which no balance of the yearly equivalent remains, shall be disregarded, and

(ii) as respects any other chargeable sum, the total income of the claimant shall be taken to include the sum, but on the assumption that the amount of it was only that of the balance remaining of the yearly equivalent

(3) Where two or more chargeable sums arise in respect of relevant periods of equal duration, they shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as a single chargeable sum of an amount equal to the aggregate of those sums and arising in respect of a relevant period of like duration.

5. A provision of paragraph 3 or 4 above requiring tax to be calculated as if an amount were treated as the highest part of the claimant’s total income shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Income Tax Acts directing other income to be treated as the highest part of his total income, but for the purposes of those paragraphs his total income shall be deemed—

(a) not to include any amount in respect of which he is charge-

able to tax under section 187 of this Act (payments on retirement or removal from office or employment), and

(b) to include, in respect of any amount which would otherwise be included therein by virtue of section 399 (1X«) of this Act (gains arising in connection with life policies etc.), no greater amount than the appropriate fraction thereof within the meaning of section 400 of this Act.

6. A provision of paragraph 3 or 4 above shall apply in relation to any part of the claimant’s total income (as computed for the purposes of that provision) as respects which he would be entitled under Chapter II of Part I of this Act (personal and other reliefs) to a deduction equal to tax at the standard rate on that part as if that part were subject to a nil rate of tax, and shall apply in relation to any part thereof as respects which he would be entitled under section 22 of this Act (reduced rate relief to a deduction equal to tax at any other rate on that part as if that part were subject to a rate of tax equal to the difference between the standard rate and that other rate.

2. —(1) An election for the herd basis shall apply to all production herds of a particular class kept by the farmer making the election, including herds which he has ceased to keep before the making of the election, or first begins to keep after the making thereof.

(2) An election for the herd basis must be made in writing to the inspector, and must specify the class of herds to which it relates.

(3) Subject to paragraph 6 below, an election for the herd basis shall be valid only if it is made not later than two years after the end of the first chargeable period for which the farmer making the election is chargeable under Case I of Schedule D to tax in respect of the profits or gains of his farming, or is given relief undo* section 168 or 177(2) of this Act (set off of trading losses against general income) in respect of his farming, being profits or gains or relief the amount of which is computed by reference to the facts of a period during the whole or some part of which the farmer kept a production herd of the class in question.

(4) An election for the herd basis shall be irrevocable and, subject to paragraph 6 below, shall have effect for the said first chargeable period and all subsequent chargeable periods.

3. —(1) Where an election for the herd basis has effect, the consequences for the purpose of computing profits or gains under Case I of Schedule D shall be as provided by this paragraph.

(2) The initial cost of the herd and, subject to the provisions of this paragraph as to replacements, the cost of any animal added to the herd shall not be deducted as an expense, and the value of the herd shall not be brought into account.

(3) Where an animal which has theretofore been treated as part of the farmer’s trading stock is added to the herd otherwise than by way of replacement, there shall be included as a trading receipt—

(a) in the case of an animal bred by the farmer, a sum equal to the cost of breeding it and rearing it to maturity, and

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

697

(.b)in any other case, a sum equal to the initial cost to the farmer of acquiring the animal, together with any cost incurred by him in rearing it to maturity.

(4) Where an animal forming part of the herd dies, or ceases to form part thereof, and is replaced therein by another animal—

(a) any proceeds of sale of the animal which dies or ceases

to form part of the herd shall be included as a trading receipt, and

(b) the cost of the animal which replaces it, except in so far as

that cost consists of such costs as are allowable apart from the provisions of this Schedule as deductions in computing profits or gains of fanning under Case I of Schedule D, shall be deducted as an expense:

Provided that—

(i) where the second-mentioned animal is of better quality than

the animal which it replaces, the amount deducted shall not exceed the amount which it would have been necessary to expend in order to acquire an animal of the same quality as the one replaced, and

(ii) where the animal which is replaced was slaughtered by the order of any Ministry, government department or local or public authority under the law relating to diseases of animals, and the animal which replaces it is of worse quality, the amount included as a trading receipt shall not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction.

(5) Where the herd is sold as a whole, and another production herd of the same class is acquired, sub-paragraphs (1) to (4) above shall apply as though there had been sold from the original herd, and replaced therein, a number of animals equal to the number in the original herd or in the newly acquired herd, whichever is the less.

(6) If (either all at once or over a period not exceeding twelve months) either—

(a) the whole of a herd is sold in circumstances in which sub-paragraph (5) above does not apply, or

(b) a part of a herd is sold on a substantial reduction being made in the number of animals in the herd,

any profit or loss arising from the transaction shall not be taken into account:

Provided that where, within five years of the sale, the seller acquires or begins to acquire another production herd of the class in question or, as the case may be, acquires or begins to acquire animals to replace the part of the herd in question—

(i) sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) above shall apply to the acquisition or replacement, except that, if the sale was one which the seller was compelled to effect by causes wholly beyond his control, the amount included as a trading receipt in respect of any animal sold which is replaced by an animal

Sch. 6

698

c. 10

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

Sch. 6

of worse quality shall not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction in respect of that animal of worse quality, and

(ii) for the purposes of the application of those sub-paragraphs, the proceeds of sale of the animals comprised in the original herd or part of a herd shall be brought into account as if they had been respectively received at the times of the corresponding acquisitions.

(7) If an animal forming part of the herd is sold, and neither sub-paragraph (4) nor (5) nor (6) above applies, any profit or loss arising from the transaction shall be included or deducted, as the case may be; and for the purposes of this sub-paragraph, the said profit or loss shall be computed by comparing with the proceeds of sale—

(a) in the case of an animal bred by the farmer, the cost of breeding it and rearing it to maturity, and

(b) in any other case, a sum equal to the initial cost to the farmer of acquiring the animal (or, in the case of an animal acquired otherwise than for valuable consideration, its market value when the farmer acquired it) together, in both cases, with any cost incurred by him in rearing it to maturity.

(8) Where the herd is sold as a whole, and another production herd of the same class is acquired, and the number of animals in the newly acquired herd is less than the number in the original herd, then, if the difference is not substantial, sub-paragraph (6) above shall not apply, and sub-paragraph (7) above shall apply to a number of animals in the original herd equal to the difference.

(9) The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall apply in relation to the death or destruction of animals as .they apply in relation to their sale, as if any insurance or compensation moneys received by reason of the death or destruction were proceeds of sale, and any reference in this paragraph to the proceeds of sale of an animal includes a reference to any proceeds of sale of its carcase or any part thereof.

Farming :provisions applicable to special cases

4. A farmer who, having kept a production herd of a particular class, ceases altogether to keep herds of that class for a period of at least five years shall, as respects production herds kept by him after the end of that period, be treated as if he had never kept any production herds of that class before the end of that period.

5. —(1) Where a farmer transfers to another person all or any of the animals which form part of a production herd otherwise than by way of sale, or by way of sale but for a price other than that which they would have fetched if sold in the open market, and either—

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

699

whom the transferor has control, or both the transferor and the transferee are bodies of persons and some other person has control over both of them, or

(b) it appears with respect to the transfer, or with respect to transactions of which the transfer is one, that the sole or main benefit, or one of the main benefits, which (apart from the provisions of this paragraph) might have been expected to accrue to the parties or any of them was a benefit resulting from the obtaining of a right to make an election for the herd basis, or from such an election having effect or ceasing to have effect, or from such an election having a greater effect or a less effect,

the like consequences shall ensue, in relation to all persons concerned, for the purpose of computing profits or gains under Case I of Schedule D as would have ensued if the animals had been sold for the price which they would have fetched if sold in the open market.

(2) In this paragraph “ body of persons ” includes a partnership, and “ control ” has the meaning given by section 534 of this Act

6.—(1) Where the whole or a substantial part of a production herd kept by a farmer for the purposes of his farming is slaughtered by the order of any Ministry, government department or local or public authority under the law relating to diseases of animals in such circumstances that compensation is payable in respect of it, an election for the herd basis thereupon made by .the farmer in relation to that herd and any other production herds of the same class so kept by him shall, subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, be valid notwithstanding that it is not made within die time required by paragraph 2(3) of this Schedule.

(2) An election for the herd basis made by virtue of sub-paragraph

(1) above shall only be valid if made not later than two years after the end of the first chargeable period for which the tax chargeable on the farmer in respect of the profits or gains of his farming finally falls to be computed by reference to the facts of a period in which the compensation is relevant:

Provided that, for income tax (but not corporation tax) purposes, if that chargeable period is the second year of assessment within the meaning of section 117 of this Act (basis of assessment for second and third years after commencement), and notice is given under subsection (2) of that section, the election shall be valid if made not later than the giving of that notice.

Sch. 6

c. 10

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

for relief in respect of his farming, if the relief fells to be computed wholly or partly by reference to die facts of a period in which the compensation is relevant

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, compensation shall be deemed to be relevant in any period if, but only if. it fells (or would but for an election under this paragraph fall) to be taken into account as a trading receipt in computing the profits or gains or losses of that or an earlier period.

(b) the immature animals in question are bred in the herd, are maintained therein for the purpose of replacement, and are necessarily maintained for that purpose,

and references in this Schedule to herds shall be construed accordingly, and references therein to an animal being added to a herd include references to an immature animal which is kept in the herd becoming a mature animal:

Provided that not more immature animals shall in any case be treated as forming part of a herd than are required to prevent a fall in the numbers of the herd.

Female animals shall be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as becoming mature when they produce their first young.

(3) In this Schedule “a production herd* means, in relation to a fanner, a herd of animals of the same species (irrespective of breed) kept by him wholly or mainly for the sake of the products which they produce for him to sell, being products obtainable from the living animal.

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

701

(4) For the purposes of this Schedule, production herds kept by a farmer shall be deemed to be of the same class if, and only if, all the animals kept in the herds are of the same species (irrespective of breed) and the products produced for him to sell for the sake of which (either wholly or mainly) the herds are kept by him are of the same kinds in the case of all the herds; and elections for the herd basis shall be framed accordingly.

c. 10

703

(a) the person or persons becoming so entitled shall, on dis-

posing of the property, be chargeable under Case VII by reference to that acquisition of it, if there is an acquisition and disposal by him or them, and

(3) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not apply in relation to a person’s appropriation of an asset for the purposes of a trade if he is chargeable to tax in respect of the profits of the trade under Case I of Schedule D and elects that, instead, the market value of the asset at the time of the appropriation shall, in computing the profits of the trade for the purposes of tax, be treated as reduced by the amount of the gain, or increased by the amount of the loss, referred to in that sub-paragraph; and where that sub-para-graph does not apply by reason of such an election, the profits of the trade shall be computed accordingly:

8.—(1) Subject to paragraph 9 below, where a person disposes of shares, die shares disposed of shall be identified in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph with the shares acquired by him which could be comprised in that disposal, and shall be so identified notwithstanding that they are otherwise identified by the disposal, or by a transfer or delivery giving effect to the disposal (but so that, where a person disposes of shares in one capacity, they shall not be identified with shares which he holds or can dispose of only in some other capacity).

(2) The identification under this paragraph of the shares disposed of on any occasion shall have effect not only for determining the gain or loss accruing by reason of that disposal, but for all the purposes of Case Vll, including its operation in relation to other disposals by the same person and, in a case where that person's acquisition of the shares is or may be relevant to the person acquiring from him, its operation in relation to the last-mentioned person.

(3) Shares disposed of on an earlier date shall be identified before shares disposed of on a later, and the identification of the shares first disposed of shall accordingly determine the shares which could be comprised in the later disposal.

(4) Shares disposed of for transfer or delivery on a particular date, or in a particular period—

(a) shall not be identified with shares acquired for transfer or delivery on a later date, or in a later period, and

(b) shall be identified with shares acquired for transfer or delivery on or before that date, or in or before that period, but on or after the date of the disposal, rather than with shares not so acquired.

(5) The shares disposed of shall be identified with shares not acquired as legatee rather than with shares acquired as legatee.

(6) The shares disposed of shall be identified—

(a) with shares acquired within the twelve months preceding

the disposal rather than with shares not so acquired, and with shares so acquired on an earlier date rather than with shares so acquired on a later, and

(b) subject to paragraph (a) above, with shares acquired on a later date rather than with shares acquired on an earlier, and

(c) with shares acquired at different times on any one day in

as nearly as may be equal proportions.

delivery of shares disposed of, a person by a single bargain acquires shares for transfer or delivery on a particular date, or in a particular period, and disposes of them for transfer or delivery on a later date, or in a later period, then—

(a) the shares disposed of by that bargain shall be identified

with the shares thereby acquired, and

(b) shares previously disposed of which, but for the operation of paragraph (a) above in relation to acquisitions for transfer or delivery on the earlier date or in the earlier period, would have been identified with the shares acquired by that bargain—

(i) shall, subject to sub-paragraph (3) above, be identified with any available shares acquired for such transfer or delivery (that is to say, any shares so acquired other than shares to which paragraph (a) above applies, and other than shares with which shares disposed of for such transfer or delivery would be identified apart from this sub-paragraph), and

(ii) in so far as they cannot be so identified, shall be treated as disposed of for transfer or delivery on the later date, or in the later period, above-mentioned.

(9) This paragraph, and paragraph 9 below, shall apply in relation to a disposal of any assets as they apply in relation to a disposal of shares, where the assets are of a nature to be dealt in without identifying the particular assets disposed of or acquired.

9.—(1) Where, in the case of a man and his wife living with him. one of diem—

(a) disposes of shares to his wife or her husband after 10th April 1968, and

(b) disposes of other shares, of the same kind as those disposed of to the wife or husband, to another person (in this paragraph called “ a third party ”)»

the provisions of this paragraph shall have effect as respects any shares acquired by the person making those disposals which, but for the provisions of paragraph 8 above, could have been comprised in either of those disposals.

(2) If, but for the provisions of this sub-paragraph, shares disposed of to a third party—

(a) would not be taxable shares, and

(b) but for the disposal to the wife or husband would be taxable shares,

the identification shall be reversed so that the shares disposed of to the third party (or, if the quantity disposed of to the third party was greater than the quantity disposed of to the wife or husband, a part of them equal to the quantity disposed of to the wife or husband) shall be taxable shares.

(3) If there is more than one disposal to the wife or husband, or more than one disposal to a third party, the provisions of this paragraph shall be applied to shares disposed of on an earlier date before

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

709

being applied to shares disposed of on a later date, and the reidentification of the shares first disposed of shall accordingly determine the way in which this paragraph applies to the shares comprised in the later disposal.

(4) In this paragraph “taxable shares’* are shares the disposal of which, together with their acquisition, constitutes an acquisition and disposal within the meaning of Case VII.

Re-acquisition of shares etc. after sale at a loss

10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, where a loss accrues to a person from his acquisition and disposal of any shares, and he re-acquires the same shares within one month after the disposal or, in the case of a re-acquisition otherwise than through a stock exchange, within six months after it, that loss shall not be allowable under Case VH otherwise than by deduction from any gain accruing to him from an acquisition and disposal of the shares beginning with the re-acquisition.

For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, shares acquired for transfer or delivery after the date of transfer or delivery of the shares sold shall be deemed to have been acquired after the disposal of the shares sold.

(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, where a person disposes of shares and afterwards acquires the like shares within the period referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, he is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as re-acquiring the shares disposed of (or, if the quantity disposed of was greater than the quantity acquired, a part of them equal to the quantity acquired), but so that—

(a) there cannot be in relation to the same disposal more than

one re-acquisition of the same share, nor be by the same acquisition of a share a re-acquisition in relation to more than one disposal, and

(b) an acquisition of shares shall, where there has been more than one relevant disposal, be treated as a re-acquisition of shares disposed of on an earlier date rather than of shares disposed of on a later, and as a re-acquisition of shares disposed of at different times on the same date in as nearly as may be equal proportions, and

(c) where there is more than one acquisition of shares relevant

to a previous disposal, shares acquired on an earlier date shall be treated in relation to that disposal as the shares re-acquired rather than shares acquired on a later date, and, as between shares acquired on any one date, those subsequently disposed of on an earlier date shall be so treated rather than those subsequently disposed of on a later date, and those subsequently disposed of on any one day shall be so treated in as nearly as may be equal proportions, and

(d) where a person disposes of shares in one capacity, shares which he acquires in some other capacity shall be disregarded.

shares previously disposed of by him are identified with those shares, then—

(a) this paragraph shall not apply in relation to any loss accruing from that acquisition and disposal, and

(b) that acquisition shall not be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as a re-acquisition of any shares.

(4) Where, under paragraph 8(8) above, shares disposed of are identified with shares acquired by the same bargain, sub-paragraph

(3) of this paragraph shall apply as if the disposal had preceded the acquisition.

(5) Where—

(a) under arrangements designed to postpone the acceptance of

(b) under paragraph 8 above—

(i) the shares disposed of by that bargain are identified with shares previously acquired for transfer or delivery on the earlier date, or in the earlier period, and

(ii) shares disposed of afterwards, but within six! months of the date of that bargain, are identified with the shares acquired by that bargain,

then, subject to sub-paragraph (6) below, sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph shall apply as if the disposal by that bargain had preceded the acquisition of the shares so identified with those disposed of.

(6) Where an acquisition of shares is more than once continued by such a bargain as is referred to in paragraph (a) of sub-para-graph (5) above, that sub-paragraph shall apply in relation to each bargain continuing the acquisition, but so that, in relation to each such bargain, paragraph (hXii) of that sub-paragraph shall have effect as if the references to the date of the bargain and the shares thereby acquired were references to the date of the last of the bargains and the shares thereby acquired; and, for the purposes of this sub-paragraph, an acquisition continued by one bargain shall be treated as further continued by a later bargain in so far as the shares disposed of by the later bargain are identified under paragraph 8 above with the shares acquired by the earlier.

(7) This paragraph, and paragraph 11 below, shall apply in relation to acquisitions or disposals of any assets as they apply in relation to acquisitions or disposals of shares, where die assets are of a nature to be dealt in without identifying the particular assets disposed of or acquired.

11.—(1) Where, in the case of a man and his wife living with him, a loss accrues to one of them from his or her acquisition and disposal of any shares, and the other of them is to be treated in

(2) Shares disposed of by the husband or wife shall not for the purposes of this paragraph be treated as the same as shares acquired by the other if, for the purposes of paragraph 10 above—

(a) the person disposing of the shares is to be treated as having re-acquired the same shares, or

(b) the person acquiring the shares is to be treated as thereby re-aoquiring shares disposed of,

or if the person acquiring the shares acquires them from her husband or his wife.

(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) above, where the husband or wife disposes of shares and the other afterwards acquires the like shares within the prescribed period from the disposal, the other is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as acquiring the same shares as those disposed of (or, if the quantity disposed of was greater than the quantity acquired, a part equal to the quantity acquired) and, so far as necessary, the rules in paragraphs (a) to () of paragraph 10(2) above shall apply for the purpose of determining which are the same shares, as if the husband and wife were one person, and disregarding all shares excluded by sub-paragraph (2) above.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, shares acquired by the wife or husband for transfer or delivery after the date of transfer or delivery of the shares sold by the other shall be deemed to have been acquired after the disposal of the shares sold.

(5) Where the husband or wife acquires shares and, under paragraph 8 above, shares previously disposed of by him or her are identified with those shares, then—

(a) this paragraph shall not apply in relation to any loss

accruing from that acquisition and disposal, and

(b) that acquisition shall not be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as an acquisition of the same shares as any shares disposed of by the other,

and sub-paragraphs (4) to (6) of paragraph 10 above shall apply as if references in those sub-paragraphs to sub-paragraph (3) of the said paragraph 10 included references to this sub-paragraph.

(6) In this paragraph “ the prescribed period ” means—

(a) in the case of an acquisition of shares through a stock ex-

change, one month, and

(2) Subject to the following sub-paragraphs, a reorganisation or reduction of a company’s share capital shall not be treated as involving any disposal of the original shares, or any acquisition of the new holding or any part of it, but the original shares and the new holding shall be treated as the same asset acquired as the original shares were acquired.

(3) Where, on a reorganisation or reduction of a company’s share capital, a person gives or becomes liable to give any consideration for his new holding or any part of it, that consideration shall, in relation to any disposal of the new holding or any part of it, be treated as having been given for the original shares, and, if the new holding or part of it is disposed of with a liability attaching to it in respect of that consideration, the consideration given for the disposal shall be adjusted accordingly:

Provided that there shall not be treated as consideration given for the new holding or any part of it any surrender, cancellation or other alteration of the original shares or of the rights attached thereto, or any consideration consisting of any application in paying up the new holding or any part of it of assets of the company or of any dividend or other distribution declared out of those assets but not made.

Notwithstanding the above proviso, in applying this sub-paragraph in relation to the issue of share capital to which subsection (1) of section 236 of this Act (stock dividend options) applies (as involving a reorganisation of the company’s share capital) there shall be allowed, as consideration given for the new holding which includes that share capital, the sum referred to in that subsection less income tax at the standard rate.

of his original shares any capital distribution from the company not forming part of the new holding, he shall be treated as if the new holding resulted from his having, in consideration of that distribution, disposed of an interest in the original shares of a market value equal to that of the distribution (but without prejudice to the original shares and the new holding being treated in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) above as the same asset).

References in this sub-paragraph to any capital distribution from the company include references to any consideration given by any person other than the company in respect of the original shares.

(6) Where, on a reorganisation of a company’s share capital, a person receives, or becomes entitled to receive, in respect of any shares a provisional allotment of shares in or debentures of the company, then, unless he neither accepts the allotment nor disposes of his rights before or after the making of the allotment, those rights shall be treated in relation to him and any person acquiring them directly or indirectly from him as if they were the shares or debentures to which they relate, and as if the consideration to be given for the shares or debentures were a liability attaching to the rights.

(7) References in this paragraph to a reduction of share capital do not include the paying off of redeemable share capital, and where shares in a company are redeemed by a company otherwise than by the issue of shares or debentures (with or without other consideration) and otherwise than in a liquidation, the shareholder shall be treated as disposing of the shares at the time of the redemption.

(a) if it consists of more than one class of shares in or debentures of the company, and one or more of those classes is of shares or debentures which, at any time not later than the end of the period of three months beginning with the date on which the reorganisation or reduction of capital took effect, or of such longer period as the Board may by notice in writing allow, had quoted market values on a recognised stock exchange in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or

(b) taken any steps by advertisement or otherwise to dispose of the land, or to make his willingness to dispose of it known to the authority or others.

(2) In this paragraph M authority exercising or having compulsory powers*' means, in relation to any disposal of land, a person or body of persons acquiring the land compulsorily, or who has or have been or could be authorised to acquire it compulsorily for the purposes for which it is acquired, or for whom another person or tody of persons has or have been or could be authorised so to acquire it.

20.—(1) Where a single bargain comprises two or more transactions whereby assets are disposed of, those transactions shall be treated for the purposes of section 164 of this Act as a single disposal; and where separate considerations are agreed, or purport to be agreed, for any two or more transactions comprised in one bargain (whether transactions whereby assets are disposed of or not), those considerations shall be treated as together constituting an entire consideration for the transactions, and shall be apportionable between them accordingly.

(2) Where an individual and the wife or husband of that individual, or a body of persons and a person having control of it, or two bodies of persons under common control, enter into associated transactions, sub-paragraph (1) above shall apply as if the transactions were comprised in a single bargain (“ tody of persons *' for this purpose including a partnership):

(6) in computing for any purpose of this Schedule the amount which would secure that neither a gain nor a loss accrued to that person on his disposal of the land;

and maintenance expenditure incurred by the person chargeable which falls to be taken into account for other purposes of Case VII shall not be taken into account in computing his profits or gains for the purposes of Schedule A, but, where it has been taken into account in computing those profits or gains, any necessary adjustment of that person’s liability to tax may be made by means of an assessment or otherwise, and, for that purpose, the amount of any tax repaid by reason of its having been taken into account may be charged on him under Case VI of Schedule D and recovered accordingly.

(5) Where, in the case of any asset, the person chargeable receives or is entitled to claim any capital allowances with reference to expenditure relating to the asset, the amount of the allowances shall be treated for the purpose of computing the gain as a trading receipt of the adventure in so far as it exceeds the amount or aggregate amount on which any balancing charges fall to be made on him in respect of the allowances (subject, however, to a just apportionment where the adventure does not relate to the whole of his interest in the asset).

In this sub-paragraph “capital allowance” does not include an allowance under Part II of the Capital Allowance Act 1968, or an investment allowance.

Treatment of one person’s acquisition as another's

21.—(1) Where under this Schedule a person acquiring an asset is to be treated as if another’s acquisition of it had been his acquisition, that person shall be treated as having acquired the asset at the time when the other acquired it and for a consideration of such amount as would secure that, on the other’s disposal to that person, neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to the other (that amount being calculated as it would be for the purpose of a charge under Case VII then falling on the other by reference to that acquisition); and where there have been more than one acquisition by the other of different interests in the asset, this provision shall apply in relation to each such acquisition:

Provided that—

(a) a person shall be treated as if another’s acquisition of an asset had been his acquisition of it only if and in so far as the interest taken by that person would be treated for

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

c. 10

719

the purpose of such a charge as aforesaid as deriving from Sch. 7 that acquisition, and

(b) that person shall be treated as acquiring the asset as legatee, and not for any consideration, in so far as the said interest would be so treated as deriving from an acquisition by the other as legatee.

Supplementary

22. —(1) Where any sum falls to be apportioned for the purposes of Case VII and, at the time of the apportionment, it appears that it is material as respects the liability to tax of two or more persons, any question which arises as to the manner in which the sum is to be apportioned shall be determined for the purposes of the tax on all those persons—

(a) in a case where the same body of General Commissioners

have jurisdiction with respect to all those persons, by those Commissioners, unless all those persons agree that it shall be determined by the Special Commissioners,

(b) in a case where different bodies of Commissioners have jurisdiction with respect to those persons, by such of those bodies as the Board may direct, unless all those persons agree that it shall be determined by the Special Commissioners, and

(c) in any other case, by the Special Commissioners,

and any such Commissioners shall determine the question in like manner as if it were an appeal:

Provided that all the said persons shall be entitled to appear and be heard by the Commissioners who are to make the determination, or to make representations to them in writing.

(2) This paragraph applies in relation to any determination of market value for the purposes of Case VII as it applies in relation to apportionments.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, the relevant period—

(a) in the case of a gift, is the period ending with the year of

assessment following that in which the gift is made or, where an election may be made by the donee alone, the period ending with the year of assessment following that in which he first disposes of the property comprised in the gift or any part of it, and

(b) in the case of an election under paragraph 7 of this Schedule, is the period ending with the year of assessment following that in which is made the appropriation of the asset for the purposes of the trade;

and in this paragraph, references to a gift include any disposal otherwise than by way of bargain at arm’s length, and references to the donor and the donee shall be construed accordingly.

SCHEDULE 8

Schedule E: Relief as Respects Tax on Payments on Retirement or Removal from Office or Employment

Preliminary

1. Relief shall be allowed in accordance with the following provisions of this Schedule in respect of tax chargeable by virtue of section 187 of this Act, where a claim is made under section 188(4) of this Act.

2. A person shall not be entitled to relief under this Schedule in so far as such relief, together with any relief allowed under Chapter II of Part 1 of this Act (personal reliefs), would reduce the amount of income on which he is chargeable at the standard rate below the amount income tax on which he is entitled to charge against any other person, or to deduct, retain or satisfy out of any payment which he is liable to make to any other person.

Relief by reduction of sums chargeable

3. In computing the charge to tax in respect of a payment chargeable to tax under section 187 of this Act, not being a payment of compensation for loss of office, there shall be deducted from the payment a sum equal to the amount (if any) by which the standard capital superannuation benefit for the office or employment in respect of which the payment is made exceeds £5,000.

4. In this Schedule “ the standard capital superannuation benefit ”, in relation to an office or employment, means a sum arrived at as follows, that is to say—

(a) there shall be ascertained the average for one year of the holder’s emoluments from the office or employment for

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970

721

c. 10

the last three years of his service before the relevant date (or for the whole period of his service if less than three years);

(b) one-twentieth of the amount ascertained at (a) shall be multiplied by the whole number of complete years of the service of the holder in the office or employment; and

(c) there shall be deducted from the product at (b) a sum equal

to the amount, or, as the case may be, to the value at the relevant date, of any lump sum (not chargeable to tax) received or receivable by the holder in respect of the office or employment in pursuance of any such scheme or fund as is described in subsections (1) and (2) of section 221 of this Act:

Provided that no account shall be taken for the purposes of this paragraph of the service of any person as an officer or employee of a body corporate at any time while he was a controlling director (as defined in section 224(1) of this Act) of that body.

5. Where tax is chargeable under section 187 of this Act in respect of two or more payments to which paragraph 3 above applies, being payments made to or in respect of the same person in respect of the same office or employment or in respect of different offices or employments held under the same employer or under associated employers, then—

(a) the said paragraph 3 shall apply as if those payments were

a single payment of an amount equal to their aggregate amount and, where they are made in respect of different offices or employments, as if the standard capital superannuation benefit were an amount equal to the sum of the standard capital superannuation benefits for those offices or employments, and

(b) where the payments are treated as income of different charge-

able periods, the relief to be granted under that paragraph in respect of a payment chargeable for any such period shall be the amount by which the relief computed in accordance with the preceding provision in respect of that payment and any payments chargeable for previous chargeable periods exceeds the relief in respect of the last-mentioned payments,

and where the standard capital superannuation benefit for an office or employment in respect of which two or more of the payments are made is not the same in relation to each of those payments, it shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as equal to the higher or highest of those benefits.

6. In computing the charge to tax in respect of a payment chargeable to tax under section 187 of this Act, being a payment made in respect of an office or employment in which the service of the holder includes foreign service and not being a payment of compensation for loss of office, there shall be deducted from the payment (in addition to any deduction allowed under the preceding provisions of this Schedule) a sum which bears to the amount which would be chargeable to tax apart from this paragraph the same proportion as

Relief by reduction of tax

7. In the case of any payment in respect of which tax is chargeable under section 187 of this Act, the following relief shall be allowed by way of deduction from the tax chargeable by virtue of that section, that is to say, there shall be ascertained—

(a) the amount of tax which would be chargeable apart from this paragraph in respect of the income of the holder or past holder of the office or employment for the chargeable period of which the payment is treated as income,

(b) the amount of tax which would be so chargeable if the payment had not been made, and

(c) the difference between the respective amounts of tax which

would be so chargeable on the assumptions—

(i) that the appropriate fraction only of the payment (after deducting any relief applicable thereto under the preceding provisions of this Schedule) had been made, and

(ii) that no part of the payment had been made,

and disregarding, in each case, any other emoluments of the office or employment, and the amount to be deducted shall be the difference between the amount ascertained at (a) and the sum of the amount ascertained at (b) and the appropriate multiple of the difference ascertained at (c).

8. —(1) Where the income of the holder or past holder of the office or employment for the chargeable period of which the payment is treated as income includes income, income tax on which he is entitled to charge against any other person, or to deduct, retain or satisfy out of any payment which he is liable to make to any other person, the amounts referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of paragraph 7 above shall be calculated as if that tax were not chargeable in respect of that income.

(2) Where for any year of assessment an individual claims relief under paragraph 7 above, and also under section 400 of this Act (gains arising in connection with life policies etc.) or Schedule 3 thereto (premiums etc. taxable under sections 80 to 82), or under both that section and that Schedule, then, in computing the relief under paragraph 7 above, his income shall be deemed to include—

(a) in respect of any amount which would otherwise be included

therein by virtue of section 399(1Xu) of this Act, no greater amount than the appropriate fraction thereof within the meaning of the said section 400, and

(b) in respect of any chargeable sum within the meaning of the

said Schedule 3 (including two or more sums treated for the purposes of paragraph 3 of that Schedule as one chargeable sum), no greater amount than the balance (if any) of the yearly equivalent thereof remaining after the making of any deduction required by the said paragraph 3.

(a) where the payment is not a payment of compensation for loss of office, one-sixth and six, and

(b) where the payment is a payment of compensation for loss of office, one divided by the relevant number of years of unexpired service, and that number of years,

and for the purposes of this paragraph "the relevant number of years of unexpired service*' means the number of complete years taken into account in calculating the amount of the payment, being years for which the holder of the office or employment would have been entitled (otherwise than by virtue of arrangements made in contemplation of his retirement or removal or of any relevant change in the functions or emoluments of the office or employment) to retain the office or employment or its full emoluments, and where the period taken into account as aforesaid is less than one complete year or exceeds an exact number of years, it shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as one complete year or as the next higher number of complete years, as the case may be.

10. Where tax is chargeable under section 187 of this Act in respect of two or more payments to or in respect of the same person in respect of the same office or employment and is so chargeable for the same chargeable period, those payments shall be treated for the purposes of paragraph 7 above as a single payment of an amount equal to their aggregate amount:

Provided that, where the appropriate fraction and the appropriate multiple are not the same for each of the payments, the calculations of relief under the said paragraph 7 shall be made separately in relation to each payment or payments having a different appropriate fraction and multiple, and in any such calculation—

(a) any payment for which the appropriate multiple is lower

shall be left out of account for all the purposes of the said paragraph 7, and

(b) in ascertaining the difference at (c) of that paragraph it shall be assumed that the appropriate fraction only of any payment for which the appropriate multiple is higher had been made,

and the relief to be allowed shall be the sum of the reliefs so calculated in respect of the payments respectively.

11. Where tax is chargeable under section 187 of this Act in respect of two or more payments to or in respect of the same person in respect of different offices or employments, and is so chargeable for the same chargeable period, paragraphs 7 to 10 above shall apply as if those payments were made in respect of the same office or employment and as if any emoluments of any of those offices or employments were emoluments of the same office or employment.

RESPECT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM TAX.

The Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic of Ireland,

Considering the Agreement of the 14th April, 1926, between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State, in pursuance of which exemptions from tax are conferred on persons resident in one only of the countries from tax under the law of the other.

Considering that doubts have arisen as to the effect on the said exemptions of the provisions of subsection (2) of Section four of the United Kingdom Finance (No. 2) Act, 1955 (hereinafter called " the Act of 1955”) and subsection (2) of Section fifty-one of the Irish Republican Finance Act, 1958 (hereinafter called “the Act of 1958”) (which relate to purchases of shares by persons exempted from tax).

Desiring to remove these doubts for the year 1959-60 and subsequent years.

Have agreed as follows:—

Article 1

(1) The said exemptions fall within, and are subject to, the said provisions of the Act of 1955 and the Act of 1958.

(2) Subject as aforesaid the said Agreement of 1926 as amended by Agreements made on the 25th April, 1928, and the 21st July, 1947, continues in force.

(3) Paragraph (1) of this Article does not relate to cases where the dividend in respect of which exemption is claimed is one on a holding of shares or stock acquired by the person claiming exemption, or regarded as having been acquired by him, before the eighth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine except in so far as that dividend is one falling within subsection (2) of the said Section four or subsection (2) of the said Section fifty-one by reason (directly or indirectly) that in respect of another dividend, received by a body corporate other than the person claiming exemption from a holding of shares or stock acquired, or regarded as acquired, by the body corporate on or after the said eighth day of April, a deduction is to be made in determining the income of that body corporate arising after a given date; but this paragraph is without prejudice to any question as to the application of the said provisions of the Act of 1955 and the Act of 1958 in circumstances to which paragraph (1) of this Article does not relate.

Article 2

This Agreement shall become effective on the exchange of notes confirming that the necessary steps have been taken to give it the

Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic of Ireland with

RESPECT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM TAX.

The Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic of Ireland.

Considering the Agreement of the 14th April, 1926, between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State in pursuance of which exemptions from tax are conferred on persons resident in one only of the countries from tax under the law of the other.

Considering that legislation may be enacted in either country to maintain the proper incidence of liability to income tax and to prevent the obtaining of undue tax advantages.

Considering that such legislation may be insufficiently effective unless, as well as applying to persons resident in the country where it is enacted, it applies also to persons not so resident but resident in the other of the two countries and accordingly affects exemptions from tax conferred in pursuance of the said Agreement of 1926,

Recognising that the legislation which was the subject of the Agreement of the 4th April, 1959, made between the two Governments affected the said exemptions in particular ways, and desiring to supplement that Agreement by a more general Agreement,

Desiring to declare that save as provided by this Agreement the continuance in force of the said Agreement of 1926 shall not be affected by the enactment of such legislation.

Have agreed as follows:—

Legislation enacted in either country at any time after the date of this Agreement and affecting in any way exemptions from income tax of that country of persons resident in that country shall, except as otherwise provided by the legislation and subject to the next following Article of this Agreement, have the like effect on exemptions from that tax which persons enjoy as not resident in that country but resident in the other of the two countries, and the enactment of such legislation shall not affect the continuance in

Article 3

This Agreement shall become effective on the exchange of notes confirming that the necessary steps have been taken to give it the force of law in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and thereafter shall remain effective only so long as it has the force of law in both countries.

Nature and amount of payments.

(3) The provisions of the First Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to the constitution and procedure of the Commission.

Payments. Nature, amount and provisions for securing the public

interest.

2. — (1) Payments shall be made by the Commission, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act, in respect of war damage to land occurring during the risk period.

(2) For the purposes of the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to such payments, land sustaining war damage as aforesaid shall, subject to the provisions of the next succeeding subsection, be dealt with in such units as the Commission may determine, and land which is to constitute a unit for those purposes is in this Part of this Act referred to as a “ hereditament ”,

(3) Hereditaments shall be of two kinds consisting respectively of—

(a) buildings (excluding buildings the use of which is acces-

sory to the use of other land and which would not be readily marketable apart from that other land) or parts of such buildings, and the sites of such buildings or of parts thereof; and

(б) land other than as aforesaid:

Provided that there shall be included in a hereditament that comprises a building falling within paragraph (a) of this subsection, or a part of such a building, any land (including a building) which, though not falling within that paragraph, might be expected ordinarily to be occupied with the first-mentioned building or part and is so situated that war damage thereto, if not made good, would be likely to affect substantially the value of the first-mentioned building or part.

A hereditament that comprises a building falling within paragraph (a) of this subsection, or a part of such a building, is in this Part of this Act referred to as a “ developed hereditament ".

3. — (1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, a payment to be made thereunder shall be of one or other of two kinds, in this Part of this Act referred to respectively as a “ payment of cost of works ” and a “ value payment”.

(2) The amount of a payment of cost of works shall be computed as follows :—

(a) If the war damage is made .good by reinstating the hereditament in the form in which it existed immediately before the occurrence of the damage, the amount of the payment shall be an amount equal to the proper cost of the works executed for the making good thereof:

1941.

War Damage Act, 1941.

Ch. 12.

19

Provided that if the reinstatement of any part of the hereditament could have been omitted without detracting from its value, or the omission thereof would have increased the value of the hereditament, the amount of the payment shall be reduced to what it would have been if that part had not been reinstated.

In this Part of this Act the expression “ the permissible amount ” means, in relation to a payment of cost of works, the amount that is payable by virtue of this paragraph or that would have been payable if this paragraph had had effect in relation to the payment.

(6) If the war damage is made good by works which include alterations or additions to the hereditament, the amount of the payment shall be an amount equal to so much of the proper cost of the works executed for the making good of the damage as falls within the permissible amount.

(3) In this Part of this Act the expression “ proper cost ” means, in relation to any works, such cost as is reasonable, having reganl to the prices of materials and rates of remuneration for services current when the works are executed and to all other relevant circumstances, and in computing the proper cost of any works the cost of the necessary employment of an architect, engineer, surveyor, land agent, or other person in an advisory or supervisory capacity, in connection with the execution of the works, shall be treated as part of the cost of the works.

(4) The amount of a value payment shall be an amount equal to the amount of the depreciation in the value of the hereditament caused by the war damage, that is to say, the amount by which the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was immediately after the occurrence of the damage is less than its value in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage.

(5) For the purposes of the last preceding subsection, the value of a hereditament in the state in which it was at any time shall be ascertained by reference to prices current at the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, and shall be taken to be the amount which the fee simple in the hereditament in that state might have been expected to realise on a sale thereof made in the open market on the said day with vacant possession, subject to any restrictive covenant, easement, quasieasement, or other right inuring for the benefit of other land, any public right of way, right of common, or other right inuring for the benefit of the public or of any section thereof, and any restriction or liability imposed by or under an enactment, to which the hereditament was subject at that time, but free from any other incumbrance:

Act, 1941.

Provided that provision may be made by regulations made by the Treasury for the valuation by reference to such matters as may be therein specified of hereditaments consisting of or comprising premises of a kind not normally the subject of sales in the open market, or having a value which could not be fully realised on such a sale.

(6) The amount of a payment of cost of works shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value, ascertained in accordance with regulations made by the Treasury, of any articles which formed part of the hereditament and become available as materials in consequence, whether directly or indirectly, of the war damage, and in computing the amount of a value payment the value, ascertained as aforesaid, of any such articles shall be included in the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was immediately after the occurrence of the war damage:

Provided that—

(a) where any such articles are removed in exercise of emergency powers, otherwise than pursuant to a requisition, the amount of the payment shall be computed as if they had been wholly destroyed on the occurrence of the damage; and

(b) where any such articles are requisitioned, the amount of the payment shall be computed as mentioned in the preceding proviso and then'reduced by the amount of the sum payable under the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939, or under any such agreement as is mentioned in section fifteen of that Act, in respect of the requisition, or which would have been so payable if a claim therefor had been duly made under that Act.

4. — (1) Subject as provided by subsection (2) of this section, the question whether a payment under this Part of this Act is to be a payment of cost of works or a value payment shall be determined as follows, that is to say—

(a) in the case of a developed hereditament the payment shall be a payment of cost of works unless the damage involves total loss, that is to say, is such that the making good thereof would be likely to require works costing more than the difference between the value which the hereditament would have after the execution of the works and the value which the hereditament, with the damage not made good, would have as ‘a site;

(b) in the case of a hereditament not being a developed hereditament the payment shall be a payment of cost of works in a case only in which the permissible amount of that payment would be likely to be less than the amount of a value payment in respect of the damage.

1941- War Damage Ch. 12.

Act, 1941.

(2) The preceding subsection shall have effect subject to the provisions of section seven of this Act for securing the public interest in the making of payments under this Part of this Act, and subject also to the following provisions, that is to say—

[a) in a case in which the appropriate payment would, apart

from this provision, be a payment of cost of works, if the Commission are satisfied that it is the wish of the owners of proprietary interests in the hereditament and of any mortgagee of any such interest, or of any of the persons aforesaid whose wish ought in the opinion of the Commission to prevail, that the damage should not be made good, or if they are satisfied that the circumstances are such that the damage will not in fact be made good, they may, if they think fit, make a value payment in respect of the damage, so however that the amount of a payment made by virtue of this paragraph shall be such amount as the Commission think proper, not exceeding either the amount that would have been permissible for the payment of cost of works or the amount that would have been payable if a value payment had been the appropriate payment; and

(b) in a case in which the appropriate payment would, apart

from this provision, be a value payment, the Commission may make a payment of cost of works in respect of the damage if it appears to them to be expedient so to do having regard to the effect that the making good of the damage would have in relation to the value of another hereditament.

5. Where a payment of cost of works or a value payment is Additional made in respect of war damage to a hereditament, there shall be payments made, in addition to that payment, a payment (in this Part of jjj this Act referred to as a “ temporary works payment ”) of an porary” amount equal to the proper cost of any works reasonably executed works, for temporarily meeting the circumstances created by the damage, being—

(a) where a payment of cost of works is made, works, other than those taken into account in computing the amount of that payment, executed between the occurrence of the damage and the time when it is made good;

(b) where a value payment is made, works executed between the occurrence of the damage and the time when the Commission’s determination to make that payment, and not a payment of cost of works, has been notified to all persons having an interest in the hereditament who have made a request in writing to the Commission to be notified thereof, or, if no such request has been made, the time of their determination.

12. — (1) If war damage to a hereditament is increased by failure on the part of the owner of, or any person interested in, a proprietary interest in the hereditament or any part thereof (including a mortgagee of such an interest) to take any steps for preserving the hereditament or that part thereof which he might reasonably have been expected to take after the happening of the event from which the damage results, the following provisions of this section shall have effect.

(2) Where a value payment is to be made in respect of the war damage, both the actual depreciation in the value of the hereditament caused thereby and the depreciation that would have been caused if the damage had not been increased as aforesaid shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of sections three and six of this Act and the difference shall be deducted from the payment, or, if it is payable in two or more shares, from the share apportioned to the relevant proprietary interest:

Additional provisions as to payments in certain cases.

14. — (1) If, when the discharge of value payments generally or in substantial volume has become permissible, it appears to the Commission that, having regard to any circumstances arising since the passing of this Act, the amounts of any such payments computed as provided by section three of this Act are inadequate, the Commission shall make a report to the Treasury stating that they are of that opinion, the circumstances to which they have had regard in forming it, and the deductions which they draw therefrom.

(2) On receipt from the Commission of any such report the Treasury shall consider the report, and shall have power by order to direct that the amounts of value payments which would otherwise be computed as provided by section three of this Act shall, either in all cases or in such classes of cases as may be specified in the order, be increased by a sum equal to such proportion of the amount computed as aforesaid as may be specified in the order.

(3) An order under this section as to any value payments shall have effect in relation to any such payment whether made before or after the coming into force of the order.

(4) The Treasury shall publish in such manner as they think fit any report made to them under subsection (1) of this section as soon as may be after they have made an order in pursuance thereof or have determined to make no order thereon.

15. — (1) Where a developed hereditament sustains war damage in respect of which the appropriate payment would be a value payment, but, owing to the value as a vacant site of land comprised in the hereditament, the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was immediately after the occurrence of the damage is no less than its value in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage, if a tenancy being a proprietary interest was then subsisting in the hereditament and the Commission are satisfied that the time which it then had to run was sufficiently short to render it probable that the hereditament would have remained in its existing form during that time apart from war damage, they may, if they think fit, make in respect of the tenancy a payment of such kind and amount as appears to them to be reasonable in view of the value thereof.

(2) Paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of section seven of this Act, section eight thereof, and subsection (4) of section nine thereof, shall have effect in relation to a payment to be made under this section as they have effect in relation to a value payment, and a payment to be so made shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of section nine of this Act, be made to the person who. was, immediately before the occurrence of the damage, the owner of the tenancy.

(a) a payment of cost of works in respect of any works for making

good the damage executed before the date of the notice to treat or other the date on which the acquisition became obligatory, in so far as the proper cost thereof falls within the said permissible amount; and

(b) a value payment of an amount equal to the residue of the

said permissible amount, or, if no such works were so executed, to the whole thereof.

(2) In a case in which the preceding subsection has effect, section five of this Act shall have effect in relation to works reasonably executed for temporarily meeting the circumstances created by the damage to the land acquired, being works, other than those taken

Provided that a property shall not be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as a contributory property—

Any such apportionment shall be made by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, but any person who is aggrieved by any such apportionment may appeal to the Special Commissioners.

(5) In this section, the expression " net assessment” means the full annual -value as ascertained for the purposes of an assessment under Schedule A, less any sums on which relief was allowed under Rules 1, 4 and 7 of No. V of Schedule A or subsection (6) of section thirteen of the Tithe Act, 1936, and less any sums on which relief would have been allowable in respect of an annuity under section four of the Tithe Act, 1918, or of payments in respect of the redemption or reduction of an annuity under the Tithe Act, 1936, if relief in respect of so much of such an annuity or such payments as represents interest were in all cases given by way of reduction of an assessment under Schedule A in lieu of being given by a right of deduction of tax.

(a) an assessment under Schedule A shall be treated as having been in force during the period as respects which it has effect; and

Section 17. THIRD SCHEDULE.

Payments under Part I in cases of Repeated Damage.

1. Subject to the subsequent provisions of this Schedule, the references in sections three and four of this Act to war damage shall be construed as references to war damage occurring on a single occasion, and accordingly the nature and amount of the payment to be made in respect of war damage occurring on each of two or more occasions shall, subject as aforesaid, be determined separately.

2. Where a developed hereditament, being or including a developed hereditament which has already sustained (whether on a single occasion or on two or more occasions) war damage not being such that a value payment is to be made in respect thereof, sustains on a subsequent occasion war damage such that the making good thereof, and of the damage sustained earlier so far as not already made good, would be likely, in the opinion of the Commission, to require works costing more than the difference between the value which the hereditament would have after the execution of the works and the value which the hereditament, with the damage not made good, would have as a site, the Commission may determine that a single value payment shall be made in respect of all the war damage as if it had occurred on the earliest occasion, to the exclusion of any other payment in respect of any of it:

Provided that—

(a) section five of this Act shall have effect both in relation to such

temporary works as are therein mentioned, and also in relation to any works appearing to the Commission to have been reasonably executed for making good any of the damage occurring on an occasion earlier than the latest notwithstanding that they may not have been of a temporary character;

(б) any payment of cost of works, or any part of any such payment,

made in respect of any of the damage shall not be recoverable, but shall be taken into account in determining the amount, if any, to be paid under the preceding proviso;

1941* War Damage Ch. 12.

Act, 1941.

(c) if the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was

immediately after the damage occurring on the subsequent occasion is less by any amount than it would otherwise have been by reason of any physical change therein not directly attributable to war damage (other than ordinary wear and tear) occurring between the earliest occasion and the subsequent occasion, the amount of the single value payment shall be reduced by that amount;

(d) if the title to the hereditament has altered as respects the proprietary interests subsisting therein, or as respects the ownership or the subsistence of a mortgage of any of those interests, between the earliest occasion and the subsequent occasion, the provisions of Part I of this Act the operation of which depends upon those matters, shall have effect as if the damage had occurred on the subsequent occasion; and

ie) the interest on the single value payment shall run from the subsequent occasion.

3. Where a value payment is to be made in respect of war damage sustained (whether on a single occasion or on two or more occasions) by a developed hereditament, any war damage sustained by the hereditament on a subsequent occasion shall be taken into account in determining the amount of that payment as if that damage had occurred on the earliest occasion, and no separate payment shall be made in respect thereof.

4. The Commission may determine that war damage sustained by a hereditament other than a developed hereditament on any two or more occasions shall be taken into account together for the purposes of Part I of this Act as if it had all occurred on the earlifest occasion, and shall be the subject of a single value payment or payment of cost of works accordingly:

Provided that, where the single payment in respect of that damage is a value payment, the proviso to paragraph 2 of this Schedule shall have effect in relation thereto as it has effect in relation to a single value payment to be made under that paragraph, with the substitution, for each reference to the subsequent occasion mentioned in that proviso, of a reference to such one of the occasions of damage taken into account under this paragraph as the Commission may determine.

5. In determining the amounts of separate payments of cost of works to be made in respect of war damage occurring on two or more occasions, the cost of any works which contribute to the making good both of damage occurring on one of those occasions and of damage occurring on another of them shall not be taken into account more than once.

6. The amount of a payment of cost of works shall be reduced by any amount by which the proper cost of the works executed for making good the war damage is increased by reason of any such physical change in the hereditament as is mentioned in proviso (c) to paragraph 2 of this Schedule occurring between the time of the occurrence of the war damage and the time when it is made good.

L-—(1) Where, on consideration of a report from the Agricultural Schemes for Executive Committee for any area in Scotland, the Secretary drainage of State is satisfied that— works.

(a) any agricultural land in that area is capable of improvement by drainage works or that any such land is being or is in danger of being injured by flooding and that such injury can be remedied or prevented by the execution of drainage works either on such land or on any other land, and

(b) the estimated cost of the operations involved (exclusive of the compensation, if any, which may be expected to become payable in pursuance of this Act) would not be unreasonable having regard to the benefits to agriculture which would accrue, and would not in any case exceed an amount equal to ten pounds for each acre of agricultural land benefited by the operations,

he may, in accordance with the provisions of a scheme made under this section, enter on the lands and execute such drainage works, and may maintain such works. In the execution and maintenance of such works it shall be lawful for the Secretary of State without payment to appropriate and dispose of any shingle, sand, clay, stones or other matter removed in the course of such work, or to deposit such materials on the banks of any water course or to use it as he may think fit.

(a) the works proposed to be executed;

(б) the area to be affected thereby;

(c) the estimated cost of carrying out the scheme, exclusive

of any compensation as aforesaid, the amount to be recoverable by the Secretary of State in respect of such cost, and the manner in which that amount is to be apportioned among the lands comprised in the area; and

(d) the estimated cost of maintaining the works proposed

to be executed and the manner in which such estimated cost is to be apportioned among the lands comprised in the area;

and shall give notice by advertisement in at least one newspaper circulating in the area affected by the scheme of the making of the draft scheme, of the place where it can be inspected and of the time within which objections to the scheme may be presented to the Secretary of State, and shall serve the like notice on the owners and occupiers of the lands comprised in the area and on any navigation authority or other body or person appearing to the Secretary of State or claiming to be affected by the scheme.

(3) In fixing the amount of the cost recoverable by the Secretary of State, and in apportioning that amount or in apportioning the estimated cost of maintenance among the lands comprised in the area affected by the scheme, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the benefit expected to accrue to such lands by reason of the execution of the scheme, and the costs so apportioned in any case shall not exceed the estimated value of the benefit so expected to accrue to such lands; and in estimating the value of such benefit the Secretary of State shall take into account any probable increase in the value of the lands, any depreciation in the value of the lands which might be expected to occur if no such drainage works as are proposed in the scheme were undertaken, and any other benefit whether by way of relief from expenditure on drainage operations or in respect of damage by flooding or otherwise, which may accrue to the owner of the lands by reason of the execution of the works, and shall also have regard to any expenditure incurred by such owner in respect of drainage works which are being carried out by such owner for the improvement of such lands or in respect of any contract or obligation entered into by such owner for the carrying out of such works.

Provided that, if any objection by an owner or occupier of any of the said lands relates to the amount to be apportioned to such lands in respect of the estimated cost of carrying out the scheme or of ipaintaining the works, the question, failing agreement, shall be referred to the Scottish Land Court for determination, without prejudice, however, to the power of the Secretary of State to proceed with the execution of the works.

(5) If within one month after the date of the notice of the making of the draft scheme, an owner or occupier of lands comprised in the area affected by the scheme or any other person intimates to the Secretary of State a claim for compensation in respect of injury or damage which will be suffered by him in consequence of the execution or maintenance of the drainage works in accordance with the scheme and the Secretary of State does not admit such claim or agree upon the amount of compensation therefor with such owner, occupier or person, the question shall be referred to the Scottish Land Court for determination. In detennining any such question the Court shall have regard to the considerations specified in subsection (3) of this section, but no account shall be taken of any diminution or depreciation ascribable only to loss of pleasure or amenity.

The owner of any lands from whom any sum is recoverable in pursuance of this subsection shall be entitled to recover from the occupier in occupation of those lands at the date of the completion of the works an annual payment of such amount and for such period as the Secretary of State, having regard to the benefit to be derived from the works, the contract of tenancy and all other circumstances of the case, and after giving to the parties an opportunity of being heard, may determine.

(8) The cost incurred by the Secretary of State in maintaining drainage works executed in pursuance of a scheme under this section shall, in so far as such cost does not exceed the estimated cost of maintenance specified in the scheme, be recoverable by the Secretary of State from the owners of the lands comprised in the area affected by the scheme according to the apportionment therein contained, and any sum due by any such owner in respect of such cost, shall, if the Secretary of State so decides, be levied on and recovered from such owner by the rating authority in like manner in all respects as if it were a rate leviable by that authority and shall be paid over by the rating authority to the Secretary of State.

(10) Where the Secretary of State decides not to proceed with a scheme, he shall pay to any person such expense as he may reasonably have incurred in connection with the making of the scheme or with any claim by him to compensation, and the amount of such expense shall in default of agreement be determined in like manner as a claim to compensation under this section.

2. — (1) There may be issued by the National Debt Commissioners for the purpose of local loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of five million pounds.

(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation, and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local loans specified in the tables contained in Part I and Part II of the Schedule to this Act should, to the extent specified in the last column of those tables, not be reckoned as assets of the Local Loans Fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887:

Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the extent aforesaid shall be written off from the assets of the Local Loans Fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees, as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year.

—

and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees so pledged as aforesaid was during the years ending the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and thirty-nine and the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and forty respectively insufficient to discharge in full the instalments of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in those years and the principal sum of four hundred pounds with interest amounting to forty-nine pounds four shillings now remains unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable:

Now, therefore, the said principal sum of four hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to forty-nine pounds four shillings shall be remitted.

5. — (1) Where a local authority or a harbour authority, with Power to the approval of the Treasury, exercises an option to redeem facilitate any securities and offers to issue new securities in exchange for conversion the securities to be redeemed, the Treasury may advance to the government authority, on such terms as they think fit, any moneys required securities, for the redemption of securities in respect of which the said offer is not accepted.

(2) Any moneys advanced under the foregoing subsection shall be deemed to be a local loan within the meaning of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887, and that Act shall apply accordingly.

(2) Where any scheme of arrangement is effected through the services of a liabilities adjustment officer, being a scheme to which the debtor and all the creditors who have provable debts and to whom notice has been given in accordance with rules made under this Part of this Act assent, the officer shall approve ' the scheme, and, if he is unable to effect a scheme to which the debtor and all the said creditors assent, he may approve any scheme appearing to .him to be equitable and reasonable and to which the debtor and a majority in number and in value of such

of the said creditors whose debts have been proved assent, and any scheme so approved shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, be binding on all the said creditors, so far as their provable debts are concerned:

Provided that—

(a) where any of the said creditors has a debt which would

be entitled to be paid in priority under subsection (1) of section thirty-three of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, if 4 the debtor were bankrupt, a scheme of arrangement c* shall not be approved under this section unless that creditor assents thereto or the scheme secures the payment of the debt with the like degree of priority;

(4) The court shall not reduce the rate of interest under the last foregoing subsection, unless the annual amount payable by way of interest at the existing rate exceeds the net annual value of the mortgaged property at the date of the order and any such reduction of the rate of interest shall be limited to the extent of that excess.

Provided that, if the liabilities adjustment order provides for the postponement of the realisation or distribution of a substantial part of the debtor’s property, and the court considers that, in the case of any debt or debts falling within paragraph (b) of the last foregoing subsection, delay in payment would cause exceptional hardship, the order may provide for the payment of that debt or those debts in priority to other debts falling within the said paragraph (b).

(3) Where it appears to the court that a debtor is in a position not only to pay the proved debts in full, but also interest thereon from the date of the protection order, the liabilities adjustment order may provide for the payment of such interest at such rate, not exceeding three per cent, per annum, as may be specified in the order.

(2) Nothing in the preceding subsection shall be taken to prejudice or affect the power conferred on the Board of Trade by section sixty-seven of the War Damage Act, 1941, to refuse an application for the issue of a policy, or any power vested in a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust or by law to effect an insurance against war damage otherwise than under the said schemes or against a risk other than war damage. 3

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by subsection (1) of this section, the powers conferred thereby extend—

(a) to the charging with excess profits tax of persons who, but for the adjustments, would not be chargeable with any tax, or would not be chargeable to the same extent;

An Act to confer on the Treasury powers for giving effect to a loan agreement made between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and to provide for payments in respect of the disposal of securities, income and other payments for the purposes of the agreement; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[29th July 1941]

Powers for giving effect to Agreement.

WHEREAS by an agreement (in this Act referred to as “ the Agreement ”) dated the twenty-first day of July, nineteen hundred and forty-one, and made in the United States of America between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, provision was made for a loan to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom from that Corporation repayable, subject to the provisions for extension and prepayment therein contained, on the first day of July, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, for securing the loan by pledge of securities of corporations incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or of one or more of the States thereof, and for the application to the service of the loan of income and other payments arising from the pledged securities and of income from branches in the United States of America of British insurance companies:

And whereas having regard to the duration of the loan the Agreement cannot be carried out under powers conferred under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, 1939 and 1940, and it is expedient that the provisions of this Act should have effect for the purpose of enabling the Agreement to be carried out:

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :—

1. — (1) The Treasury may exercise such powers as appear to them necessary or expedient for the purpose of enabling the Agreement to be carried out, and in particular (but without

1941- Financial Powers Ch. 36. 275

(US.A. Securities) Act, 1941.

prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions of this subsection)—

(a) may require securities and income and other payments arising therefrom, and income from such branches as aforesaid, to be placed at the disposal of the Treasury;

(b) may require, prohibit or restrict the doing of any acts and the execution of any documents.

(2) Any requirements, prohibitions or restrictions which it appears to the Treasury to be necessary or expedient to impose for the purpose aforesaid shall be prescribed by regulations made by them or by orders or directions made or given thereunder by them or on their behalf, and regulations made under this section may contain such incidental and supplementary provisions (including provisions as to the obtaining of information and as to the apprehension, trial and punishment of persons offending against the regulations) as appear to the Treasury necessary or expedient for the purpose aforesaid.

2. — (1) Where any security has been placed at the disposal of the Release of. Treasury by virtue of this Act, it shall be released by the Treasury payment as soon as may be after they have satisfied themselves, at any jjjjj i^omef8 time while it is under their control, that it is no longer necessary or expedient for the purposes of the Agreement that they should retain control thereof:

Provided that—

(a) the Treasury may, if at any time it appears to them necessary or expedient so to do for the purposes of the Agreement, by order made as respects any class of securities or by direction given as respects any particular securities, declare that the right to release conferred by this subsection shall be extinguished in the case of the securities to which the order or direction relates;

(b) if any security is so dealt with in pursuance of the

Agreement as to prevent the Treasury regaining control thereof under the Agreement, the right to the release of that security shall be extinguished.

(2) If at any time the right to the release of any security is extinguished, the Treasury shall as soon as may be thereafter pay in respect of the security such sum in sterling as they may determine, being a sum which in their opinion is not less than the market value thereof at that time:

Provided that, if the Treasury certify that the security was of such a kind as not to be capable of being valued on the basis of market value, the sum to be paid shall be such sum in sterling as may be agreed or, in default of agreement, as may be determined by arbitration to have been the fair value thereof at that time as between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

Treasury by virtue of this Act, and any income or other payment arising therefrom before the release of the security, or the extinguishment of the right to the release thereof, is applied in pursuance of the Agreement; or

(б) any income arising from any such branch of an insurance

company as aforesaid is so applied,

the Treasury shall, as soon as may be after the income or payment is so applied, pay in respect thereof such sum as appears to them to have been the sterling equivalent of the income or payment at the time when it arose.

(4) On the placing at the disposal of the Treasury of any security, any right conferred by this section to release or payment in respect of the security, or to payment in respect of any income or other payment arising therefrom, shall vest in the person who, immediately before the placing thereof at the disposal of the Treasury, was entitled (whether as bailee or otherwise) to possession of the documents of title to the security, and, on the placing at the disposal of the Treasury of any income from such a branch as aforesaid, any right to payment in respect of the income shall vest in the person who, immediately before the placing thereof at the disposal of the Treasury, was entitled to receive income arising from that branch.

(5) Where any person is registered, in accordance with arrangements made by the Treasury, as the person in whom any right conferred by this section to a release or payment is for the time being vested, whether by virtue of the original vesting thereof in him under the last foregoing subsection or by virtue of any assignment or devolution thereof to him, his receipt for the release or payment shall be a good discharge to the Treasury.

(8) Any right conferred by this section to the release of a security of any description may be satisfied by the release of any security of that description, and any such right to the release of a security may be satisfied by the release of any security substituted therefor by the exercise of any right of exchange or conversion or any similar right attaching to the security.

(9) The payments to be made under this section shall be made out of funds in the Exchange Equalisation Account, and the making thereof shall be treated as an investment of such funds.

3. — (1) Any regulations made under this Act shall be laid before Provisions as the Commons House of Parliament as soon as may be after to regulations, they are made; but notwithstanding anything in subsection (4) of section one of the Rules Publication Act, 1893, such regulations 56 & 57 Vict. shall be deemed not to be, or to contain, statutory rules to which c* 66-that section applies.

(2) If the said House, within the period of forty days beginning with the day on which any such regulations as aforesaid are laid before it, resolves that the regulations be annulled, they shall thereupon become void, without prejudice, however, to anything previously done thereunder or to the making of new regulations:

not apply to the regulations made on the first occasion on which regulations under this Act are made, but the regulations made on that occasion shall not have effect until approved by a resolution of the said House.

(3) In reckoning any such period of forty days as aforesaid, no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued, or during which the said House is adjourned for more than four days.

(4) In the event of any inconsistency between any provisions of regulations made under this Act, or of any order made or direction given under such regulations, and any provisions (whether coming into effect before or after the first-mentioned provisions) of Regulations made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, 1939 and 1940, or of any instrument having effect by virtue of Regulations so made, the first mentioned provisions shall prevail, but nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the power to make -Defence Regulations conferred by the said Acts.

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

In addition to the sums hereby granted out of the Consolidated Fund, there may be applied out of any money directed under section two of the Public Accounts and Charges Act, 1891, to be applied as appropriations in aid of the grants for the services and purposes specified in Schedule (B) annexed hereto the sums respectively set forth in the last column of the said schedule.

4. — (1) So long as the aggregate expenditure on navy, army and air services respectively is not made to exceed the aggregate sums appropriated by this Act for those services respectively, any surplus arising on any vote for those services, either by an excess of the sum realised on account of appropriations in aid of the vote over the sum which may be applied under this Act as appropriations in aid of that vote, or by saving of expenditure on that vote, may, with the sanction of the Treasury, be temporarily applied either in making up any deficiency in the sums realised on account of appropriations in aid of any other vote in the same department, or in defraying expenditure in the same department which is not provided for in the sums appropriated to the service of the department by this Act, and which it may be detrimental to the public service to postpone until provision can be made for it by Parliament in the usual course.

5. Whereas under the powers given for the purpose by the Appropriation Act, 1939, surpluses arising on certain votes for navy, army and air services have been applied towards making good deficits on those services respectively as shown in the statements set out in Schedule (C) to this Act.

It is enacted that the application of those surpluses as shown in the said statements is hereby sanctioned.

Provided that the Treasury may dispense with the production of a declaration under this section in respect of any payment if either—

(a) such a declaration has been subscribed within a period of twelve calendar months preceding the date of the payment, or such longer period as the Treasury may in any particular case allow; or

(б) the payment is made through a banker who has entered

into an undertaking in such form as may be approved by the Treasury with respect to the notification of circumstances coming to the knowledge of the banker which might affect the right to such payments of the person to whom the payment is made.

(2) Any person who makes a declaration for the purpose of this section knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. 7

1

1. — (1) Section four of the principal Act (which empowers tenants to disclaim leases or to retain them on altered terms) shall not apply to any short tenancy as hereinafter defined, and the references in Part II of the said Act to a lease, underlease, sub-lease, interest in the term created by a lease, tenant, subtenant, or person having an interest in or derived out of the term created by a lease (except the references in section seven to an underlease or to a person having an interest in the land comprised in a lease) shall be construed as not including references to a short tenancy or, as the case may be, to a tenant holding under a short tenancy.

(2) Where for any period any land let on a short tenancy is unfit by reason of war damage and is not occupied either in whole or in part by the tenant, no rent shall be payable under the tenancy in respect of that period.

(3) Where any such land as aforesaid, or any part thereof, is occupied by the tenant while the land is unfit by reason of war damage, there shall be payable by the tenant in respect of the period of such occupation such rent as may be agreed between him and the landlord or, in default of agreement, as may be fixed by the court.

(4) For the purposes of this section, a dwelling-house let on a short tenancy which has been rendered unfit by war damage shall be deemed at any time to be fit if it has been repaired to such extent as is reasonably practicable at that time, having regard to the circumstances prevailing in the locality, and as is sufficient to render the dwelling-house reasonably capable of being used for housing purposes, and continues to be in that state of repair:

Provided that, if a dwelling-house is deemed to be fit by virtue of this subsection, but the extent of the accommodation therein has been substantially diminished as the Tesult of the damage, the rent payable by the tenant in respect of the period during which the accommodation is so diminished shall be reduced to such extent as may be agreed between him and the landlord or, in default of agreement, as may be fixed by the court.

(5) If the local authority in whose area any such dwelling-house is situated issue a certificate that the dwelling-house has been repaired to the extent mentioned in the last foregoing subsection, the production of the certificate shall, as respects any period during which the certificate is in force, be sufficient evidence that the house was fit for the purposes of this section during that period, unless the contrary is proved:

Provided that the local authority shall, on the application of the tenant made not less than three months after the issue of the certificate or after his last application, inspect the dwelling-house, and if they are satisfied that—

(a) further repairs have become reasonably practicable since the issue of the certificate and have not been carried out; or

(b) the works of repair carried out before the issue of the

certificate have not been maintained in a reasonably efficient state;

they shall revoke the certificate and serve a notice of the revocation on the tenant and on the landlord, and, as from the date of the service of the notice, the certificate shall cease to have effect except as respects any period before the said date; and, as respects any period after the said date and before the date of the issue of a new certificate under this subsection, the production of the notice shall be sufficient evidence that the dwelling-house was unfit by reason of war damage during that period. Tinless the contrary is proved.

The functions of a local authority under this subsection may be exercised on their behalf by such officers as may be authorised in writing by the authority, and, for the purposes of this subsection, an instrument purporting to be such a certificate as aforesaid and to be signed by an officer of a local authority shall, without further proof, be deemed to be a certificate duly issued, unless the contrary is proved.

cate with the tenant and has failed to do so;

(War Damage) (Amendment) Act, 1941.

(b) where, in the case of any such land as is mentioned in subsection (4) of section thirty-nine of the War Damage Act, 1941, the Commission determine to make a payment (other than a payment of cost of works) under paragraph (a) or paragraph (6) of that subsection, or determine to make no payment under either of those paragraphs, the determination shall have effect as if it were a determination to make a value payment *

Provided that, if the cost of reinstatement exceeds the amount of the payment of cost of works, such part of the excess as is attributable to any such alteration or addition shall be defrayed by the applicant.

(4) Where the War Damage Commission determine that the payment under Part I of the War Damage Act, 1941, in respect of any war damage to land comprised in a lease is to be a payment of cost of works, and neither the landlord nor the tenant is under an obligation under the principal Act to render the land fit, the foregoing provisions of this section shall, notwithstanding section one of the principal Act, apply to any obligation to repair under the lease (whether of the landlord or the tenant) which would but for the said section one require him to make good the war damage or the greater part thereof, in like manner as if it were such an obligation to render the land fit; and any question arising under this subsection in relation to any lease shall, on the application either of the landlord or the tenant, be determined by the court.

(b) if the Commission determine that the said payment is

to be a payment of cost of works, the said provisions shall again apply to the lease as from the date on which their determination became final, and have effect as if the reference to the occurrence of the damage were construed as a reference to the earliest occasion on which war damage occurred to the land, and the reference to the amount of the payment of cost of works were construed as a reference to the aggregate amount of payments of cost of works made in respect of war damage to the land.

(б) the proposals are accepted by the persons having the said

interests or, if not so accepted, are in the opinion of the Commission, given on an application made by the tenant, such as ought reasonably to have been accepted by those persons; and

(c) the proposals are carried out (subject to such modifications as may be agreed by the tenant and the persons having the said interests or as may be submitted to the Commission by the tenant or any of those persons and approved by the Commission) within such period as is reasonable in all the circumstances;

7. Where any lease or any instrument relating to the land comprised in a lease is affected by any change in the land resulting from anything done under the last two foregoing sections of this Act, and in particular any covenant to repair contained in any such lease or instrument is so affected, the lease or instrument shall have effect subject to such adaptation or modification as may be agreed by the parties concerned, or, in default of such agreement, as may be determined by the court.

(b) in a case where a notice to elect has been served and has not

been complied with, may extend to such date as it may fix the period allowed under this Act within which the notice to elect must be complied with.

ment of the rent and otherwise as it thinks just, including directions as respects any sub-lease comprising a disclaimable tenement and a tenement which is not disclaimable; and

(3) In determining the amount of compensation to be given for any land acquired compulsorily under this section, the value of that land shall be taken to be the price which a willing seller would, at the date of the notice to treat, have been likely to obtain in the open market for the land if it had remained in the condition in which it was at the time when possession was taken by the Minister or the Committee, as the case may be, and such reduction, if any, shall be made in the compensation as is necessary in order to off-set any appreciation in the value of the land which is directly or indirectly ascribable to the war.

(4) For the purposes of section sixteen of the War Damage Act, 1941 (which relates to the payment to be made in a case where land which has sustained war damage, is, before the damage has been fully made good, acquired compulsorily by virtue of an enactment passed before the passing of that Act), this Act shall be deemed to have been passed before that Act, and, where land is acquired under this section, no value payment shall be made under that Act in respect of any damage to the land occurring after possession of the land had been taken by the Minister or the Committee, as the case may be.

(5) On the acquisition by the Minister under this section of any land which is the subject of an occupation contract, that contract shall, as from the date of the acquisition, have effect for all purposes (including the purposes of the next succeeding section) as if it had created a tenancy granted by the Minister;

Provided that the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, shall not, by virtue of this subsection, apply in relation to any such tenancy except in so far as it was incorporated in the occupation contract.

(6) Nothing in this section shall authorise the acquisition of any land which is, or forms part of, a metropolitan common within the meaning of the Metropolitan Commons Act, 1866, or which is subject, or might be made subject, to regulation under an order or scheme made in pursuance of the Inclosure Acts, 1845 to 1882, or under any local Act or otherwise, or which

17) The expenses of the Minister in acquiring land under this section shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament.

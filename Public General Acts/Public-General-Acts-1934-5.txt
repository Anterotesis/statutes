would, in the opinion of the officer, or on an appeal the appeal tribunal, by whom the application is determined, have been payable to him by way of transitional 1 payments under subsection (1) of section fifty-nine of the principal Act but for the operation of subsection (2)

of that section, and there shall be paid to him a sum

(in this Act referred to as “ a supplementary allowance ”)

equal to the amount, if any, by which the amount so ascertained exceeds the allowance payable to him under the said Part II, or if by reason only of his inability to prove that he is in need of such an allowance no such allowance is payable in his case, equal to the amount so ascertained; and any such supplementary allowance shall be in addition to any other sum payable to him by way of allowance under the said Part II:

Provided that, where a determination made under paragraph (3) of Article one of the Unemployment

(2) This section applies to any applicant who would at any time since the sixth day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, be, or have been, entitled to transitional payments but for the operation of subsection (2) of section fifty-nine of the principal Act.

(3) For the purposes of all the provisions of the principal Act, except those as to the amount of allowances payable under Part II thereof, a supplementary allowance payable under this section shall be deemed to be, or to form part of, as the case may be, an allowance payable under that Part of that Act, and those provisions

(including provisions as to determinations and appeals)

shall have effect accordingly so, however, that in relation

to supplementary allowances leave to appeal shall not be withheld under the provisions of subsection (5) of section thirty-nine of the principal Act.

Minister of Labour and of the Treasury for the purpose of enabling allowances under Part II of the principal

Act to be supplemented so that the sums payable shall be of amounts as nearly as may be equal to those payable by reason of the provision for supplementary allowances made by this Act, payments have been made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in respect of the period between the sixth day of January and the twenty-

eighth day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, those payments shall, if made in accordance with such arrangements, be deemed to have been duly made in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act and this Act.

(5) This section shall be deemed to have been in operation since the sixth day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, and any determination made under the principal Act before the passing of this Act shall be revised accordingly; and this Act shall continue in operation until such date as may be determined by an order made by the Minister of Labour:

Provided that no such order shall have effect until it has been confirmed by a resolution passed by each

House of Parliament.

(6) Any sums required to defray any supplementary allowances or other payments payable under this Act shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament and any such sum payable in the first instance out of the Unemployment Fund shall be repaid to that fund out of such moneys.

(6) Benefit shall be payable in respect of each week after the first week of a continuous period of unemployment.

(7) No person shall receive benefit in respect of any period of less than one day.

32.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, the expression

(a) that the first statutory condition is fulfilled in his case; and

(b) in the case only of an insured contributor who has exhausted his benefit rights in his last preceding benefit year, also that contributions have been paid in respect of him for ten weeks since the Sunday last before the last day in that benefit year in respect of which he received benefit;

and every subsequent period of twelve months commencing on the date on which that contributor on a

claim for benefit proves the matters aforesaid for the first time after the termination of his last preceding benefit year:

Provided that—

(i) where before the commencement of this Act and after the twenty-fifth day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, an insured contributor proved the matters aforesaid, the expression “benefit year” in relation to him means the period of twelve months beginning on the date on which he proved those matters for the first time after the said twenty-fifth day of July and every

(ii) this subsection shall have effect subject to the provisions of section one hundred and eleven of this Act.

(2) If, in the case of any insured contributor, it is found that he has been treated in error as having begun his benefit year on any date by reason of his having been wrongly treated as having proved any of the matters aforesaid on that date, his benefit year shall nevertheless be deemed to have begun on that date, but he shall not be entitled to benefit during the remainder of that year until he proves those matters.

(3) For the purposes of determining whether an insured contributor has exhausted his benefit rights in his last preceding benefit year, if it is proved by an officer of the Ministry of Labour—

(a) that he has not made a claim for benefit in respect of any days in that year in respect of which he would have been entitled thereto if he had made a claim therefor; and

(b)that there is reasonable cause to believe that his omission to make the claim was with intent to avoid the necessity of proving the matters set out in paragraph (6) of subsection (1) of this section;

the insured contributor shall be deemed to have received benefit in respect of those days unless he proves that the omission was not -with the intent aforesaid.

33, The Minister may by regulations make provision as to the circumstances in which and the extent to which contributions paid in error and sums paid to a person by way of benefit while he was not entitled thereto are to be taken into account for the purposes of the last two foregoing sections of this Act.

35.—(1) Any three days of unemployment, whether consecutive or not, within a period of six consecutive days shall be treated as a continuous period of unemployment, and any two such continuous periods separated by a

(2) The Minister may by regulations prescribe that

a period of consecutive days shall, for the purposes of the last foregoing subsection, begin or end on such day as may be prescribed and that such a period may be inclusive or exclusive of Sundays.

(3) Any time during which an insured contributor fails to fulfil the second, third or fourth statutory condition or is, under the provisions of this Act, disqualified for receiving benefit or to be deemed not to be unemployed, shall be excluded in the computation of continuous periods of unemployment, unless he proves that the failure to fulfil the condition, or the disqualification, was due to incapacity for work arising from some specific disease or bodily or mental disablement.

(4) Save as otherwise provided by regulations made in accordance with the provisions of this subsection,

a continuous period of unemployment shall be deemed to begin on the date on which the insured contributor makes application for benefit in the prescribed manner, but regulations may be made by the Minister for authorising some earlier date to be substituted for the date of the application:

Provided that, except in cases where good cause is shown for delay in making the application, such regulations shall not authorise the substitution of an earlier date for any purpose other than that of computing the first week of a continuous period of unemployment in a

case in which the applicant, upon an application for benefit which begins his benefit year, proves in the prescribed manner that a continuous period of unemployment was in fact current at the date of that application.

Treasury and subject to such conditions and otherwise as the Minister may prescribe, pay to any association with which a special arrangement is in force, by way of contribution towards the administrative expenses of the association in connection with the arrangement, such sum (not exceeding the amount hereafter specified) as he thinks fit:

(4) The Minister may make regulations for giving effect to the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to special arrangements and for referring to insurance officers, courts of referees or the umpire appointed under this Act any question which may arise under those provisions.

(5) Where, in consequence of a decision of an insurance officer, court of referees or umpire, an association has paid to one of its members any sum by way of provision for unemployment and the decision is subsequently revised, then—

(a) so much of that sum as represented the amount of benefit which, but for the arrangement, would have been payable to that person may, unless that person shows that the sum was received by him in good faith and without knowledge that he was not entitled thereto, be recovered, without prejudice to any other remedy, by means of deductions from any benefit or from any payment from the association to which that person thereafter becomes entitled; and

(6) where the decision is revised on new facts being brought to the knowledge of the insurance officer, court of referees or umpire, repayment of that sum shall, notwithstanding the revision, be made to the association out of the Unemployment Fund, if it is shown that no-one concerned with the case on behalf of the association could reasonably have been expected to ascertain the facts on which the decision was revised, and that recovery of the sum has not been practicable.

Provided that—

(i) where it is necessary for a local authority, being the town council of a large burgh, to provide such accommodation as aforesaid on an extensive scale in one or more re-development areas, and the Department are satisfied that, by reason of the costliness of the provision so made, the total annual expenditure likely to be incurred by the local authority in providing such housing accommodation as is referred to in the foregoing subsection is substantially greater than the equivalent of ten pounds per house per annum for forty years, the Department may, with the sanction of the Treasury, undertake to make, and make, in lieu of the contribution aforesaid,

a contribution of such larger amount, not exceeding ten pounds fifteen shillings, in respect of such of the houses provided in the

local authority other than the town council of a

large burgh in providing such accommodation as is referred to in the foregoing subsection is substantially greater than the equivalent aforesaid, in consequence of the remoteness of the sites of any houses in which such accommodation is provided from centres of supply of building labour and material, and the impracticability of obtaining for such houses higher rents than are ordinarily payable by persons employed in agriculture or fishing or by persons of a like economic condition, the

Department may, with the sanction of the

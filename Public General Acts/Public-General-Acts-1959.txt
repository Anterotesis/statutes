(3) of section two of the National Insurance Act, 1954, the three hundred and twenty-five million pounds authorised to be paid under that subsection in respect of those five years.

2.—(1) In relation to graduated contributions references in Further this Act to remuneration shall be taken to include, and include provisions as only, any emoluments assessable to income tax under Schedule E (other than pensions), being emoluments from which tax under

National Insurance Act, 1959 7 & 8 Euz. 2

—com. such remuneration, whether or not tax in fact falls to be deducted

from that payment.

(2) Except in so far as regulations otherwise provide, the graduated contributions payable in any income tax week in respect of a person’s remuneration shall be determined—

remuneration in one employment, all payments made in that week on account of remuneration in the same employment, or in any two or more employments under the same employer, except any employment such that graduated contributions are not payable in respect

> of it;

(b) by apportioning between the employments any single

payment of remuneration in two or more employments under different employers, and (subject to the foregoing paragraph) treating as separate payments the parts apportioned to each employment.

(5) Provision shall be made by regulations for determining the graduated contributions payable where the whole or part of a person’s remuneration in any employment is not paid weekly (and accordingly for determining the equivalent amounts mentioned in subsection (1) of section one of this Act), and may include provision for modifying subsection (2) of this section ; and regulations may also, for the purpose of graduated contributions, make provision as to the intervals at which a person’s remuneration or any part of it is to be treated as paid where it is not all paid at the same intervals of a week or longer and in the amounts due for those or for corresponding intervals.

made in an income tax week, in so far as it depends on any condition as to a person’s age or retirement, shall be determined as at the beginning of the week or as at the end of it; and

(c) for securing that liability is not avoided or reduced by

an employer following in the payment of persons employed any practice which is abnormal for their employments.

(7) Subject to the provisions of this Act, all the provisions of the principal Act or any other enactment relating to contributions as an employed person and to employer’s contributions (other than provisions of the principal Act regulating the number and amount of any contributions, or the periods for which they are payable, or relating to the conditions for or rate of benefit) shall apply to the graduated contributions payable by insured persons and employers by virtue of this Act; and in relation to graduated contributions, references to the payment of remuneration in respect of which a contribution is payable shall be substituted for references to the week for which it is payable in subsection (1) of section six and subsection (3) of section fifty-eight of the principal Act (which relate to an employer’s duty to pay the insured person’s contribution on his behalf, and to the disposal of employer’s contributions paid in respect of mariners not liable for contributions as insured persons).

(8) In this Act “ income tax year ” means the twelve months beginning with the sixth day of April in any year, and “ income tax week ” means one of the successive periods in an income tax year beginning with the first day of that year and every seventh day thereafter (the last day of an income tax year or, in the case of an income tax year ending in a leap year, the last two days being accordingly treated as a separate income tax week).

(5) With a view to securing that contribution years begin in the case of all or any insured persons with the first Monday in April, regulations may, notwithstanding anything in the principal Act, provide for contribution years not so beginning to be on any occasion shorter than fifty-two or longer than fifty-three weeks so as to end immediately before that Monday, and may modify the contribution conditions for any benefit and any other provisions of the principal Act in such manner as appears to the Minister to be expedient to take account of the shorter or longer contribution year.

(7) A person who has attained pensionable age and retired from regular employment, but is not entitled to a retirement pension, shall be treated for the purpose of the foregoing subsections as receiving a retirement pension at a nominal weekly rate:

Provided that—

(a) this subsection shall not confer any right to graduated retirement benefit on a person who would be entitled to a retirement pension but for some provision of the principal Act or of regulations disqualifying him for receipt of it; and

(b) regulations may provide that any right by virtue of this subsection to benefit at less than a specified weekly rate shall be satisfied either altogether or for a specified period by the making of a single payment of the prescribed amount.

(8) Notwithstanding that the provisions of the principal Act reducing the weekly rate of benefit in respect of the beneficiary’s earnings are applied by this Act to graduated retirement benefit, the power of the Minister under section -two of the National Insurance Act, 1956, to make regulations amending those provisions shall include power to provide that they shall not reduce the amounts payable as graduated retirement benefit, but that those amounts shall be payable as if it were a separate benefit not subject to the said provisions.

5.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a man, having paid graduated contributions as an insured person, dies leaving a widow, and she either has attained pensionable age at the time of his death, or remains his widow when she attains that age, then the last foregoing section shall apply as if the increase in the weekly rate of her retirement pension provided for by subsection (2) were the amount there specified by reference to her graduated contributions plus sixpence for every shilling or part of a shilling of the weekly rate of his graduated retirement benefit.

(2) For the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, the weekly rate of the husband’s graduated retirement benefit shall (whether or not he was receiving or entitled to receive any such benefit) be taken to have been the weekly rate appropriate to the amount of graduated contributions paid by him together with any addition under subsection (5) of the last foregoing section; and where

at his death he had attained pensionable age but had not retired Pact 1 from regular employment, that addition shall be computed as —com. if he had retired from regular employment immediately before his death.

(3) A woman’s right to graduated retirement benefit by virtue of this section shall b& brought into account under subsection (5) of the last foregoing section in determining the graduated retirement benefit payable to her under that section:

Provided that, if the husband died after she attained pensionable age, she shall for the purpose of this subsection be treated as not having attained pensionable age until the date of his death.

(4) A woman’s right to graduated retirement benefit by virtue of this section in respect of a husband she marries after she attains pensionable age shall be subject to such additional conditions as may be prescribed; and except as may be provided by regulations a woman more than once married shall not be entitled for the same period to any graduated retirement benefit by virtue of this section in respect of more than one of the husbands.

(5) Regulations may provide that where a woman is entitled to graduated retirement benefit and to a widowed mother’s allowance the graduated retirement benefit shall be an increase in the weekly rate of that allowance; and where that benefit is such an increase, subsections (6) and (7) of the last foregoing section shall not apply, but the provisions of this Act shall, as respects the amount of the increase in the allowance, have effect subject to the provisions of the principal Act reducing the rate of a widowed mother’s allowance in respect of the beneficiary’s earnings.

6.—(1) The amount of the increase under subsection (4) of Amendment as section twenty of the principal Act in the weekly rate of a retire-to .increases in ment pension for contributions paid by the beneficiary in respect of the period after his attaining pensionable age shall be one contributions shilling for twelve contributions (instead of one shilling and paid after sixpence for twenty-five); and the increase under that subsection pensionable as applied by subsection (3) of section twenty-one of that Actage* in the rate of a retirement pension payable to a woman by virtue of her husband’s insurance shall, subject to any regulations under the said subsection (3), be the same, except that as respects any period during which the husband is alive the increase shall be sixpence for twelve contributions (instead of one shilling for twenty-five).

(2) Accordingly in the said subsections there shall be made the following amendments, in place of those made by section four of the National Insurance Act, 1951, that is to say,—

(3) The foregoing subsections shall not affect the operation of any of the enactments there referred to as respects contributions paid for contribution weeks commencing before such day as the Minister may by order appoint; but regulations may make transitional provision for cases where the relevant contributions so paid do not make up twenty-five or a multiple of twenty-five contributions (including provision for making up the contributions so paid to a multiple of twenty-five with the aid of contributions paid for later weeks, or making up the contributions paid for later weeks to a multiple of twelve with the aid of the said contributions).

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an employed contributor’s employment shall, in relation to any person employed in it who is over the age of eighteen and under pensionable age, be a non-participating employment for any period during which—

(a) his service in it is service qualifying him under a recognised superannuation scheme for retirement benefits by way of pension which are on the whole as favourable as the right to benefit to be derived from graduated

1959

Ch. 47

643

contributions (in this Act referred to as “equivalent pension benefits ”); and

(b) there is in force a certificate issued under this section to the employer that the employment is to be treated as a non-participating employment;

and an employment which is a non-participating employment in relation to a person employed in it immediately before he attains pensionable age shall, if the conditions of this Part of this Act other than paragraph (a) of this subsection are satisfied, continue to be a non-participating employment in relation to him so long as he continues to be employed in it and has not retired from regular employment.

(3) Where an insured person’s period of service in a nonparticipating employment comes to an end otherwise than by his death, and at the end of it he is not assured of equivalent pension benefits in respect of it, then subject to the provisions of this Act there shall be due to the National Insurance Fund from his employer in that employment a payment in lieu of contributions equal to the difference between—

(a) the aggregate amount of the contributions which would

have been payable by or in respect of the insured person during that period if on the fust day of each contribution week beginning in the period contributions (including graduated contributions) had been payable by and in respect of him at the rates provided for by section one of this Act and the graduated contribution in each week had been payable in respect of a weekly payment of remuneration of fifteen pounds made on that day; and

(b) the aggregate amount of the contributions which would

have been payable by or in respect of him for that period if for each such contribution week contributions had been payable at the rates applying to non-participating employments;

and on the making of any payment required by this subsection the insured person shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as having paid such graduated contributions payable by him as are referred to in paragraph (a) above (or, if the payment is of less than the full amount required, a proportionate part of such contributions).

(4) Where a person is in the same contribution week employed both in a non-participating employment and in another employed contributor’s employment, then unless provision to the contrary is made by regulations, any contribution payable by or in respect of him for that week shall be payable at the rate appropriate to a non-participating employment.

(5) Where a person is in any income tax year employed both in a non-participating employment and in another employed contributor’s employment, then any question as to the amount (if any) by which the graduated contributions paid by him in respect of remuneration paid in that year exceed the amount prescribed under subsection (3) of section two of this Act shall be determined as if (in addition to those contributions) on the first day of any contribution week in which he was employed in a non-participating employment he had paid a graduated contribution in respect of a weekly payment of remuneration of fifteen pounds made on that day:

Provided that if he is treated under subsection (3) of this section as having on any such day paid a graduated contribution or part of one, this subsection shall treat him as paying on that day only such contribution (if any) as is necessary in order to make up the amount he is treated as having paid to that of such a graduated contribution as aforesaid.

(6) For the purpose of determining liability to graduated contributions, an employment shall be deemed to be a nonparticipating employment in relation to a person previously (but no longer) employed in it, if—

(a) it was a non-participating employment in relation to him when he was last employed in it; or

(b) he ceased to be employed in it on or before attaining the age of eighteen, and on attaining that age was employed in a non-participating employment under the same employer in place of it.

(7) Regulations shall provide for the issue to employers of certificates specifying the employments which are to be treated either generally or in relation to any description of persons specified in the certificate as non-participating employments, and for the cancellation, variation or surrender of any certificate or issue of an amended certificate on any change of circumstances affecting the treatment of an employment as a non-participating employment, and (subject to the exclusion by subsection (2) of this section of persons under the age of eighteen or over pensionable age) any such certificate for the time being in force shall be conclusive that the employments included in it are nonparticipating employments:

Provided that—

(a) no such certificate or cancellation, surrender or variation

of such a certificate shall have effect from a date earlier than the beginning of the contribution week following that in which it is issued or made; and

(b) subject to the provisions of this Act, an employment

otherwise satisfying the conditions for inclusion in such

1959

a certificate shall be so included if and so long as the Part n employer so elects, and not otherwise. —com.

(8) Provision may for the purposes of this Part of this Act be made by regulations—

(a) for treating a person’s employment, where it begins or

ends in the course of a contribution week or of an income tax week, as doing so at the beginning or end of the week;

(b) for disregarding changes in a person’s employment due

to the death of an employer or other causes, and for treating employment under the new employer as a continuation of that under the former employer, and treating any certificate issued to or election made by the former employer as issued to or made by the new employer;

(c) for disregarding temporary interruptions in a person’s

employment, and for treating the employment as continuing during the interruption; id) generally as to the circumstances in which a person’s employment is or is not to be treated as having come to an end.

8.—(1) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, equivalent Further pension benefits, in relation to any period of service in an Pr<^2?L?of employment, comprise, and comprise only, retirement benefits by way of pension as respects which the following conditions are ^ non. satisfied, that is to say,— participating

(a) the benefits consist of or include a pension which (subject

to any condition as to retirement) commences not later than insured pensionable age, and there is no condition postponing beyond insured pensionable age the age at which retirement on pension is allowed; and

(b) there is no provision for the surrender, commutation or

assignment of the pension or, if there is, some part of the pension is excluded from the operation of it; and

(c) the pension or the said part of it is payable for life,

and is not capable of being terminated or suspended except for such causes, if any, as may be prescribed; and

() apart from any period before insured pensionable age, the pension or the said part of it is of an amount not less, when expressed as a weekly rate, than the graduated retirement benefit which would be payable to the person employed in return for an amount of graduated contributions equal to one such contribution paid in each week of the period of service in respect of a weekly payment of remuneration of fifteen pounds.

Part n (2) Where service in an employment contingently qualifies a —cont. person employed in it for retirement benefits by way of pension, then, in determining whether the employment can be treated a a non-participating employment in relation to the persons from time to time so employed or any of them, a person’s service shall be treated as qualifying him for such pension benefits as, in the existing circumstances, can reasonably be expected to accrue to him from a period of service of appropriate length, on the assumption that he remains in an employment qualifying him for those benefits until insured pensionable age (or as near to that age as the terms of the employment allow) but no longer.

(3) In determining whether an employment can be treated as a non-participating employment in a case where a limit on the maximum amount of the benefits payable or any description of them operates to prevent service beyond a given length from qualifying a person for further benefits, the qualification arising from any period of service shall be determined on the assumption that the total service does not exceed that length.

(4) Any scheme or arrangement having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving in particular employments for providing them with retirement benefits by way of pension shall be a recognised superannuation scheme for the purposes of this Part of this Act—

(a) if it is established by Act of Parliament or of the Par-

liament of Northern Ireland, or other instrument having the force of law; or

(b) if the benefits for which service in those employments

qualifies a person, or such part of them as has to be taken into account to constitute them equivalent pension benefits, are secured by irrevocable trust, contract of assurance or annuity contract satisfying such conditions as may be prescribed, or in such other manner as may be prescribed, and the provision made to enable benefits to be paid (taking into account any additional resources which could and would be provided by the employer, or any person connected with the employer, to meet any deficiency) is adequate to ensure payment in full of the benefits or part aforesaid.

(5) In this section “ insured pensionable age ” means pensionable age for the purposes of the principal Act:

Provided that where the date for a person’s retirement on pension under a superannuation scheme is fixed by reference •to his attaining that age and so as to fall not later than six months after he does so, but does not depend solely on age, this section shall apply in relation to his benefits under that scheme as if he did not attain that age before that date.

(a) he is absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to them, and the

manner in which they are secured and the provision made for their payment are such as may be prescribed; or

(b) such other conditions as may be prescribed are satisfied;

and regulations may provide for treating as having effect from the end of a person’s service in a non-participating employment any option exercised or other thing done within the prescribed period thereafter in relation to his retirement benefits in respect of it.

(a) a payment in lieu of contributions would, but for this subsection, fall to be made in respect of a person on the coming to an end of his service in a nonparticipating employment; and

{b) on the coming to an end of that service, or within the prescribed period thereafter, he enters another nonparticipating employment; and

(c) his service in the previous employment is service qualify-

ing him for equivalent pension benefits under the recognised superannuation scheme relating to his new employment (on the like assumptions as are to be made under subsections (2) and (3) of section eight of this Act in relation to his service in the new employment); and

(d) if the scheme is a recognised superannuation scheme

by virtue of paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section

648

Ch. 47

National Insurance Act, 1959 7 & 8 Buz. 2

Part n eight of this Act, the conditions of that paragraph are

—cont. satisfied in relation to the said benefits;

then for the purpose of any liability to make a payment in lieu of contributions in respect of him the two employments shall be treated as a single continuous employment (any interval being disregarded):

Provided that—

(i) this subsection shall not apply unless either both employ-

ments are under the same employer or such other conditions as may be prescribed are satisfied; and

(ii) regulations may direct that paragraph (c) of this subsection shall not apply in any prescribed cases in which provision is made by the recognised superannuation scheme relating to the new employment for taking into account in any manner the service in the previous employment.

(6) Where an insured person’s period of service in a nonparticipating employment comes to an end otherwise than by Ids death, and at the end of it he is over pensionable age, then for the purpose of any liability to make a payment in lieu of contributions in respect of that service he shall be deemed to be assured at the end of it (in lieu of any pension benefits he then has) of the same pension benefits, save as provided by regulations under subsection (3) of this section, as those of which he would have been assured on the coming to an end of the service on his attaining pensionable age by his then retiring from the employment; and any question whether those benefits are equivalent pension benefits, and any question as to the amount of or as to the graduated contributions attributable to any payment in lieu of contributions, shall be determined as if the service had come to an end by his so retiring:

Provided that where the date for his retirement on pension under the recognised superannuation scheme relating to the employment is fixed by reference to his attaining that age and so as to fall not later than six months after he does so, but does not depend solely on age, this subsection shall apply as if he did not attain that age before that date.

Provided that the amount recoverable shall not exceed the amount of the refund, or so much of it as has not been made.

(2) Where the period taken into account in fixing the amount of a payment does not coincide with that in respect of which the refund is to be made, then (subject to subsection (3) of this section) the amount recoverable under this section shall be determined by reference to so much of the payment and of the refund as are referable to the same period.

(3) The amount which may be recovered under this section in respect of any payment in lieu of contributions shall be increased by such amount as may be prescribed where—

(a) under subsection (4) of the last foregoing section the insured person’s service in any previous employment is treated in fixing the payment in lieu of contributions

CHAPTER 48

An Act to enable schemes made with a view to eliminating excess capacity in the cotton industry to provide for paying compensation for any such elimination and for raising the sums required for that and other purposes by levies on the industry; to enable the Board of Trade to make contributions towards any such compensation and to make grants for the re-equipment of the industry; and for purposes connected therewith.

[9th July, 1959]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Schemes in 1.—(1) The Cotton Board, with a view to promoting the

efficiency of the industry by the elimination of excess capacity, tionofexcess My> i*1 consultation with such bodies as appear to them to capacity. represent (so far as practicable) the interests of those carrying on business and of those employed in any section of the industry, prepare for that section a scheme providing for the payment by the Cotton Board, for the elimination of excess capacity, of compensation which, except in so far as the circumstances of the section make it desirable in the opinion of the Cotton Board to relate the compensation to other factors, shall be related to the number of machines of any specified description eliminated.

(2) Any scheme prepared by the Cotton Board under this section (in this Act referred to as a “ reorganisation scheme ”) shall be submitted by them to the Board of Trade; and if the Board of Trade are satisfied—

(a) that the reorganisation scheme makes adequate provision (in point of time as well as in point of quantity) to the end of eliminating excess capacity in that section of the industry; and

(b) that arrangements have been made within the section for the payment of compensation in respect of loss of employment due to the elimination of the excess capacity; and

(c) that bodies representing the interests of a majority of the persons employed in the section have agreed to those arrangements so far as they relate to persons whose interests are represented by those bodies;

1959

Cotton Industry , 1959

Ch. 48

661

then subject to subsection (9) of this section the Board of Trade may by order confirm the scheme and thereupon the scheme shall have effect.

(3) The Board of Trade may pay to the Cotton Board two-thirds of the amounts required by the Cotton Board for making the compensation payments provided for by a reorganisation scheme under subsection (1) of this section, but excluding payments of any description if the scheme provides for them to be wholly defrayed out of sums raised under the scheme.

(4) The amounts required by the Cotton Board to defray—

(a) any compensation payments provided for by a reorganisa-

tion scheme relating to any section of the industry, so far as not defrayed out of the sums paid by the Board of Trade under subsection (3) of this section; and

(b) any other expenses incurred by them under this Act in

relation to any section of the industry for which a reorganisation scheme is brought into force;

shall be raised by means of charges to be imposed under the reorganisation scheme relating to that section on persons registered with the Cotton Board as carrying on business in the section, and that scheme may include provision for the disposal (including disposal for the purpose of advancing research in the cotton industry) of any sums raised under this subsection and not required for the purpose for which they were raised.

(5) Provision may also be made by the reorganisation scheme relating to any section of the industry—

(a) for raising by means of charges to be imposed as aforesaid

the amounts required for compensating persons employed in the section under any arrangements made within the section with reference to the elimination of excess capacity or to the re-equipment of businesses in the section, being arrangements made in contemplation of or in connection with the passing or operation of this Act; and

(б) for the payment by the Cotton Board of the sums so raised to the persons responsible under the arrangements for the distribution of those sums.

(6) An order of the Board of Trade confirming a reorganisation scheme may provide for the recovery by the Cotton Board of any charges imposed under the scheme, and may for the purposes of the scheme include any such supplementary provisions as, by

virtue of subsection (4) of section four of the Industrial Organisa- 10 & 11 Geo. 6. tion and Development Act, 1947, may for the purposes of ac*40*

662

Ch. 48

Cotton Industry , 1959

7 & 8 E2

development council order be included in that order; and sections five and six of that Act (which relate to the disclosure of information obtained under, and to the enforcement of, the powers of that Act) shall apply as if any order under this section containing any such supplementary provisions were a development council order, and as if those provisions were included by virtue of the said subsection (4).

(7) Any reorganisation scheme may be varied or revoked by a subsequent reorganisation scheme, and any provisions contained in an order of the Board of Trade by virtue of subsection (6) of this section may be varied or revoked by a subsequent order of the Board of Trade.

(8) The Board of Trade may (subject to subsection (9) of this section) by order revoke a reorganisation scheme if it appears to them, after consultation with such bodies as appear to them to represent (so far as practicable) the interests of those carrying on business and of those employed in the section of the industry and with the Cotton Board, that the scheme is not serving the purposes for which it was made, or that the continued operation of the scheme would be contrary to the public interest; but the revocation may be made subject to any savings or other transitional or consequential provisions, and shall be without prejudice to anything previously done under the scheme or the making, submission or confirmation of a new scheme.

(9) Any power of the Board of Trade to make orders under this section shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, but the Board shall not make any such order unless a draft of it has been laid before Parliament and approved by resolution of each House.

(10) A reorganisation scheme may contain provisions relating to excess capacity eliminated before as well as after the coming into force of the scheme (but not before the twenty-fourth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine); and any question as to excess capacity, if the question arises in the preparation of a reorganisation scheme at a time more than a year after the commencement of this Act, shall be determined as at the end of that year.

(11) In this Act, the “ Cotton Board ” means the development council of that name established under the Industrial Organisation and Development Act, 1947, and “ the industry ” means the activities included in that term in the development council orders relating to the Cotton Board, as those orders have effect at the commencement of this Act; and any part of the industry may be treated as a section of it for any purpose of this Act, whether or not it constitutes a section for the purposes of any such order, and where a part not constituting a section for the purpose of

1959

Cotton Industry ; 1959

Ch. 48

663

registration with the Cotton Board is treated as a section under this Act, any reference in this Act to a person registered as carrying on business in the section shall apply to persons registered with the Cotton Board in respect of any business comprising activities within that part of the industry.

2.—(1) Where a reorganisation scheme has been brought into force for any section of the industry and it appears expedient to the Board of Trade to make for that section such grants as are hereby authorised, then subject to the provisions of this section the Board of Trade may make to any person in respect of any qualifying expenditure incurred or to be incurred in re-equipping a business carried on by him in that section of the industry a re-equipment grant not exceeding one quarter of that expenditure.

(2) The expenditure qualifying for a re-equipment grant shall be expenditure incurred in the purchase and installation of machinery or equipment, or in the modernisation of machinery or equipment, and satisfying such conditions as the Board of Trade may from time to time require.

(3) A re-equipment grant may be made in respect of expenditure incurred before the coming into force of the reorganisation scheme for the relevant section of the industry, but not in respect of expenditure incurred before the twenty-fourth day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, or of expenditure incurred for the replacement or modernisation of machinery or equipment which was not in use in the business before that day.

(4) No payment shall be made by way of re-equipment grant in respect of any machinery or equipment unless the following conditions are complied with:—

(a) an applicant for a grant or for a payment under a grant must supply the Board of Trade with the information which they think necessary for the purpose of determining whether the grant or payment should be made, and (if so required by them) must verify or permit them to verify to their satisfaction any information supplied to them for that purpose; and

(b) an application for a grant must be made, and the information required in connection with that application must be supplied, not later than three years from the commencement of this Act; and

(c) the purchase and installation, or the modernisation, of the machinery or equipment must be completed not later than five years from the commencement of this Act or within such further period as the Board of Trade may for special reasons allow.

An Act to confirm and give effect to a vesting deed and trust instrument relating to the Chevening Estate and other property, and for purposes connected therewith.

[9th July, 1959]

WHEREAS by a vesting deed (in this Act referred to as “ the vesting deed ”) dated the twelfth day of May nineteen hundred and fifty-nine and made between The Right Honourable James Richard Earl Stanhope (in this Act referred to as “ the Settlor ”) of the one part and Coutts and Company of the other part the freehold property therein described (consisting of Chevening House in the County of Kent and certain lands held therewith) was declared to be vested in the Settlor in fee simple upon the trusts declared in a trust instrument of even date therewith:

And whereas by the trust instrument set out in the Schedule to this Act (in this Act referred to as “ the trust instrument ”), being the trust instrument referred to in the vesting deed, the said freehold property and the chattels, investments, moneys and other property therein mentioned were declared to be settled upon the trusts and subject to the powers and provisions set out in that instrument:

And whereas it is expedient that the vesting deed and the trust instrument (in so far as they would otherwise not have had effect) should have effect by the authority of Parliament:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) The vesting deed and the trust instrument are hereby Confirmation confirmed, and shall have effect, and be deemed to have had effect t

equity which apart from this subsection would have affected their validity:

Provided that this subsection shall not affect any right or interest in respect of any of the properly comprised in the vesting deed or the trust instrument, being a right or interest to which a person other than the Settlor was entitled immediately before the execution of the vesting deed.

Part I

Establishment of Wages Councils

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, the Establishment Minister may by order establish a wages council to perform, in relation to the workers described in the order and their employers, the functions specified in the subsequent provisions of this Act

(2) An order establishing a wages council may be made by the Minister either—

(a) if he is of opinion that no adequate machinery exists for

the effective regulation of the remuneration of the workers described in the order and that having regard to the remuneration existing among those workers, or any of them, it is expedient that such a council should be established; or

(b) if he thinks fit, to give effect to a recommendation of

a commission of inquiry made on the reference to them, in accordance with the following section, of an application made in accordance therewith for the establishment of a wages council; or

(c) if he thinks fit, to give effect to the recommendation of a commission of inquiry made in a case where the Minister, being of opinion that no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of the remuneration of any workers or the existing machinery is likely to cease to exist or be adequate for that purpose and a reasonable standard of remuneration among those workers will not be maintained, refers to the commission the question whether a wages council should be established with respect to any of those workers and their employers.

1140 Ch. 69 Wages Councils Act, 1959 7 & 8 2

Part I (3) The provisions in that behalf of the First Schedule to this —cont. Act shall nave effect with respect to the making of orders establishing wages councils.

(4) The provisions in that behalf of the Second Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to the constitution, officers and proceedings of wages councils.

Applications 2.—(1) An application for the establishment of a wages

for wages council with respect to any workers and their employers may council orders. ^ *0 the Minister either—

(u) by a joint industrial council, conciliation board or other similar body constituted by organisations representative respectively of those workers and their employers; or

(b) jointly by any organisation of workers and any organisation of employers which claim to be organisations that habitually take part in the settlement of remuneration and conditions of employment for those workers,

on the ground, in either case, that the existing machinery for the settlement of remuneration and conditions of employment for those workers is likely to cease to exist or be adequate for that purpose.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this and the following subsection, where such an application as aforesaid is made to him the Minister—

(a) if he is satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to

justify the reference of the application to a commission of inquiry, and, in the case of an application under paragraph (b) of the foregoing subsection, that the claim of the organisations habitually to take part in the settlement of remuneration and conditions of employment for those workers is well-founded, shall refer the application to a commission of inquiry to inquire into and report on the application;

(b) if he is not so satisfied shall notify the applicants to that

effect, in which case no further steps shall be taken on the application unless and until he is so satisfied by fresh facts brought to his notice:

Provided that before taking either of the said courses, the Minister may require the applicants to furnish such information, if any, in relation to the application as he considers necessary.

(3) If, on considering an application under subsection (1) of this section, it appears to the Minister either—

1959

Wages Councils , 1959

Ch.69

1141

(a) that there is a joint industrial council, conciliation board or other similar body constituted by organisations of workers and organisations of employers, being a council, board or body which would or might be affected by the establishment of a wages council in pursuance of the application; or

(b) that there are organisations of workers and organisations of employers representative respectively of workers other than workers to whom the application relates and their employers, who would or might be affected by the establishment of a wages council as aforesaid,

being a council, board or body, or, as the case may be, organisations, which are parties to joint voluntary machinery for the settlement of remuneration and conditions of employment but are not parties to the application for a wages council, the Minister shall, before deciding to refer the application to a commission of inquiry, give notice of the application to that council, board or body or, as the case may be, to those organisations, shall consider any observations in writing which may be submitted to him by them within such period as he may direct, not being less than one month from the date of the notice, and, if he decides to refer the application to a commission of inquiry, shall transmit a copy of the observations to the commission.

(4) If, before an application is referred to a commission of inquiry, it is withdrawn by the applicants, no further proceedings shall be had thereon.

3.—(1) Where the Minister makes to a commission of inquiry any such reference as is mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (2) of section one of this Act, it shall be the duty of the commission to consider not only the subject matter of the reference but also any other question or matter which, in the opinion of the commission, is relevant thereto, and in particular to consider whether there are any other workers (being workers who, in the opinion of the commission, are engaged in work which is complementary, subsidiary or closely allied to the work performed by the workers specified in the reference or any of them) whose position .should be dealt with together with that of the workers, or some of the workers, specified as aforesaid; and in relation to any such reference to a commission of inquiry, any reference in this Part of this Act to the workers with whom the commission is concerned shall be construed as a reference to the workers specified as aforesaid and any such other workers as aforesaid.

(2) If the commission is of opinion with respect to the workers with whom it is concerned or any of those workers whose

1142

Ch.69

Wages Councils , 1959

Part 1 position should, in the opinion of the commission, be separately —cont. dealt with—

(a) that there exists machinery set up by agreement between

organisations representing workers and employers respectively which is, or can be made by improvements which it is practicable to secure, adequate for regulating the remuneration and conditions of employment of those workers; and

(b) that there is no reason to believe that that machinery is likely to cease to exist or be adequate for that purpose,

the commission shall report to the Minister accordingly and may include in its report any suggestions which it may think fit to make as to the improvement of that machinery.

(3) Where any such suggestions are so included, the Minister shall take such steps as appear to him to be expedient and practicable to secure the improvements in question.

(4) If the commission is of opinion with respect to the workers with whom it is concerned or any of those workers whose position should, in the opinion of the commission, be separately dealt with—

(a) that machinery for regulating the remuneration and

conditions of employment of those workers is not, and cannot be made by any improvements which it is practicable to secure, adequate for that purpose, or does not exist; or

(b) that the existing machinery is likely to cease to exist

or be adequate for that purpose,

and that as a result a reasonable standard of remuneration among those workers is not being or will not be maintained, the commission may make a report to the Minister embodying a recommendation for the establishment of a wages council in respect of those workers and their employers.

(5) In considering for the purposes of section one of this Act whether any machinery is, or is likely to remain, adequate for regulating the remuneration and conditions of employment ot any workers, the commission shall consider not only what matters are capable of being dealt with by that machinery, but also to what extent those matters are covered by the agreements or awards arrived at or given thereunder, and to what extent the practice is, or is likely to be, in accordance with those agreements or awards.

(a) to give effect to an application in that behalf made to ^ktion of

provisions of section six of this Act.

(2) The Minister may at any time by order vary the field of operation of a wages council.

(3) An order under this section abolishing or varying the field of operation of one or more wages councils may include provision for the establishment of one or more wages councils operating in relation to all or any of the workers in relation to whom the first mentioned council or councils would have operated but for the order, and such other workers, if any, as may be specified in the order.

(4) Where an order of the Minister under this section directs that any workers shall be excluded from the field of operation of one wages council and brought within the field of operation of another, the order may provide that anything done by, or to give effect to proposals made by, the first-mentioned council shall have effect in relation to those workers as if it had been done by, or to give effect to proposals made by, the second-mentioned council and may make such further provision as appears to the Minister to be expedient in connection with the transition.

(5) Where an order of the Minister under this section directs that a wages council shall be abolished or shall cease to operate in relation to any workers, then, save as is otherwise provided by the order, anything done by, or to give effect to proposals made by, the wages council shall, except as respects things previously done or omitted to be done, cease to have effect or, as the case may be, cease to have effect in relation to the workers in relation to whom the council ceases to operate.

(6) The provisions in that behalf of the First Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to the making of orders under this section.

5.—(1) An application such as is mentioned in paragraph (a) Applications of subsection (1) of the foregoing section may be made to the for abolition of Minister either— wages councils.

(a) by a joint industrial council, conciliation board or other similar body constituted by organisations of workers and organisations of employers which represent respectively substantial proportions of the workers and

employers with respect to whom that wages council operates; or

(b) jointly by organisations of workers and organisations of employers which represent respectively substantial proportions of the workers and employers aforesaid.

(2) The grounds on which any such application may be made are that the council, board or body provides, or, as the case may be, that the organisations jointly provide, machinery which is, and is likely to remain, adequate for the effective regulation of remuneration and conditions of employment for those workers.

6.—(1) The Minister—

(a) shall in any case where an application for the abolition

of a wages council has been made to him under the foregoing section and he does not thereupon proceed to the making of an order giving effect to the application,

(b) may in any other case where he is considering whether

to exercise his power under section four of this Act to abolish or vary the field of operation of a wages council,

refer to a commission of inquiry the question whether the council should be abolished or, as the case may be, its field of operation varied.

(2) On a reference under this section of a question as to the abolition of a wages council a commission of inquiry, if of opinion that it is expedient to do so having regard—

(a) to the extent to which there is, and is likely to remain,

adequate machinery set up by agreement between organisations representing workers and employers respectively for the effective regulation of remuneration and conditions of employment of workers within the field of operation of the wages council to which the reference relates, or

(b) to the extent (if any) to which it is practicable and

desirable to bring within the field of operation of another wages council all or any of the workers within the field of operation of the council to which- the reference relates,

or to both those considerations, may make a report to the Minister recommending—

(i) the abolition of the wages council to which the reference

relates, or

(ii) the narrowing of the field of operation of the council,

and (in either case), if the commission is of opinion that it is expedient as aforesaid, also recommending the transfer of

1959 Wages Councils Act, W59 Ch. 69

workers to the held of operation of another wages council, whether already existing or to be established.

(3) On a reference under this section as to the variation of the field of operation of a wages council the commission may make a report to the Minister recommending any such variation (including the transfer of workers to the field of operation of any other wages council, whether already existing or to be established) which appears to the commission desirable in all the circumstances.

(4) In considering for the purposes of section four of this Act whether any machinery is, or is likely to remain, adequate for regulating the remuneration and conditions of employment of any workers, a commission of inquiry shall consider not only what matters are capable of being dealt with by that machinery, but also to what extent those matters are covered by the agreements or awards arrived at or given thereunder, and to what extent the practice is, or is likely to be, in accordance with those agreements or awards.

(3) Where a commission of inquiry makes a recommendation for the abolition of a wages council, it may include in its report a recommendation for the variation of the field of operation of an existing central co-ordinating committee so that it no longer operates in relation to the council to be abolished, or a recommendation for the abolition of any central co-ordinating committee theretofore operating in relation to the wages council to be abolished.

1959 Wages Councils Act, 4959 Ch. 69

and while the permit is in force the remuneration authorised to be paid to him by the permit shall, if those conditions are complied with, be deemed to be the statutory minimum remuneration.

(2) Where an employer employs any worker in reliance on any document purporting to be a permit granted under the foregoing subsection authorising the employment of that worker at less than the statutory minimum remuneration, then, if the employer has notified the wages council in question that, relying on that document, he is employing or proposing to employ that worker at a specified remuneration, the document shall, notwithstanding that it is not or is no longer a valid permit relating to that worker, be deemed, subject to the terms thereof and as respects only any period after the notification, to be such a permit until notice to the contrary is received by the employer from the council.

in that behalf as is mentioned in section one, two or three of the Truck Act, 1896, and in accordance with the provisions of that section.

(2) Notwithstanding anything in subseotion (1) of this section, wages regulation proposals and wages regulation orders may contain provisions authorising specified benefits or advantages, being benefits or advantages provided, in pursuance of the terms and conditions of the employment of workers, by the employer or by some other person under arrangements with the employer and not being benefits or advantages the provision of which is illegal by virtue of the Truck Acts, 1831 to 1940, or of any other enactment, to be reckoned as payment of wages by the

2. Before making an order, the Minister shall publish, in the prescribed manner, notice of his intention to make the order, specifying a place where copies of a draft thereof may be obtained and the time (which shall not be less than forty days from the date of the publication) within which any objection made with respect to the draft order must be sent to him.

3. Every objection so made must be in writing, and must state—

(a) the specific grounds of objection, and

(b) the omissions, additions or modifications asked for,

and the Minister shall consider any such objection made by or on behalf of any person appearing to him to be affected, being an objection sent to him within the time specified in the notice, but shall not be bound to consider any other objection.

4. If there are no objections which the Minister is required by the foregoing paragraph to consider or if, after considering all such objections, he is of opinion that all those objections either—

(a) in the case of an order to be made in pursuance of the

recommendation of a commission of inquiry, were made to the commission and were expressly dealt with in the report embodying the recommendation; or

(b) in any case, will be met by modifications which he proposes to make under this paragraph or are frivolous,

he may make the order either in the terms of the draft or subject to such modifications, if any, as he thinks fit, being modifications which, in his opinion, do not effect important alterations in the character of the draft order as published.

5. Where the Minister does not proceed under the foregoing paragraph, he may, if he thinks fit, either—

(a) amend the draft order, in which case all the provisions of

this Schedule shall have effect in relation to the amended draft order as they have effect in relation to an original draft order; or

(b) refer the draft order to a commission of inquiry for inquiry and report, in which case he shall consider the report of the commission and may then, if he thinks fit, make an order either in the terms of the draft or with such modifications as he thinks fit.

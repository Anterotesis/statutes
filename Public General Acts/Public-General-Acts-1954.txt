(3) Where a claim is made under this section in respect of a terminal loss sustained in a trade, and relief cannot be given, or cannot be wholly given, against the profits or gains of the trade charged to tax under Schedule D for any year because the amount of those profits or gains is insufficient, then any interest or dividends on investments arising in that year, being interest or dividends which would fall to be taken into account as trading receipts in computing the profits or gains of the trade for the purpose of assessment under Case I of Schedule D but for the fact that they have been subjected to tax under other provisions of the Income Tax Acts, shall be treated for the purposes of the application of this section as if they were profits or gains on which the person carrying on the trade was assessed under the said Case I in respect of that trade for that year of assessment, and relief shall be given accordingly by repayment or otherwise.

(4) The profits or gains on which a person or partnership has been charged to tax for any year of assessment shall be treated, for the purposes of any relief under this section from the assessment for that year, as reduced by the amount of those

(5) The question whether a person has sustained any, and if so what, terminal loss in a trade, profession or vocation shall for the purposes of this section be determined by taking the amounts, if any, of the following (in so far as they have not been otherwise taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to tax), that is to say—

(a) the loss sustained by him in the trade, profession or

vocation in the year of assessment in which it is permanently discontinued;

(b) the relevant capital allowances for that year of assessment;

(c) the loss sustained by him in the trade, profession or

vocation in the part of the preceding year of assessment beginning twelve months before the date of the discontinuance;

1954

Finance A, 1954

Ch. 44

193

was assessed in respect of the trade, profession or vocation, such portion of the amount of the profits or gains on which the partnership has been, or is treated by virtue of subsection (4) of this section as having been, charged to tax in respect of it for that year or part of a year as would be required by the Income Tax Acts to be included in a return of his total income for that year; and

(b) any reduction in the amount of his terminal loss which fails to be made under the said subsection (4) by reason of profits or gains having been applied by the partnership in any such year or part of a year in making any payment shall be limited to the same proportion of the profits or gains brought into charge which were so applied; and

(c) if he was carrying on the trade, profession or vocation

in partnership immediately before the discontinuance, the amounts to be included in his terminal loss by virtue of paragraph (b) or () of subsection (5) of this section shall be such part only of the amounts therein mentioned (in so far as they have not been otherwise taken into account so as to reduce or relieve any charge to tax) as would fall to his share on a division made according to the shares in which the partners were then entitled to the profits of the trade, profession or vocation.

(8) For all the purposes of this section a trade, profession or vocation shall be treated as permanently discontinued, and a new trade, profession or vocation as set up and commenced, when it is so treated for the purposes of section nineteen of the Finance Act, 1953; but—

(b) on any discontinuance, a person not continuing to be so engaged may be given relief in respect of a terminal loss against profits or gains on which he was charged in respect of the same trade, profession or vocation for a period before a previous discontinuance, if he has been continuously engaged in carrying it on between the two discontinuances, and, in his case, if the previous discontinuance occurred within twelve months before the other,—

(i) it shall be disregarded for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (c) of subsection (5) of this section, except that those paragraphs shall be taken to include any amount on which relief could have been allowed to him as for a loss sustained before the previous discontinuance by virtue of paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of the said section nineteen, so far as it is referable to a period within those twelve months; and

(a) there shall be taken into account such fraction only of the

allowances for the said preceding year of assessment as the part of that year beginning twelve months before the discontinuance giving rise to the claim is of a year; and

(b) the allowances for any year shall not be treated as including any amounts carried forward from an earlier year.

Provided that relief in respect of an amount so carried forward shall be given for the first year of assessment next following, in so far as relief can be so given in accordance with the provisions of this section in respect of that amount as well as in respect of other sums disbursed or treated as disbursed for that year, and so far as it cannot be so given, then for the next year of assessment, and so on.”

Provided that in the case of a claim made by virtue of subsection (3) of section fifteen of the Finance Act, 1953 (which enables a loss to be carried forward for one year for the purposes of the said section three hundred and forty-one), the deduction shall be of an amount equal to the said capital allowances in so far as, by reason of an insufficiency of profits or gains, effect cannot be given to them in charging the profits or gains of the trade for the relevant year of assessment or for the following year.

(2) Where on any claim made by virtue of this section relief is not given under the said section three hundred and forty-one for the full amount of the loss determined as aforesaid, the relief shall be referred as far as may be to the loss sustained by the claimant in the trade rather than to the capital allowances in respect of the trade.

(3) For the purposes of this section, the capital allowances falling to be made in charging the profits or gains of the trade for the relevant year of assessment shall be treated as not including any part of the allowances for an earlier year, notwithstanding that it is carried forward to the relevant year under subsection (2) of section three hundred and twenty-three of the Income Tax Act, 1952; but effect shall be deemed to be given in charging the profits or gains of the trade to allowances carried forward from an earlier year before it is given to allowances arising in a later year.

Provided that it does not include expenditure incurred on buildings or structures which have been destroyed before the beginning of the first period to which subsection (1) of this section applies in the case of the trade, and only includes that fraction of other expenditure incurred before that time which is equal to the number of grave-spaces which at that time were or could have been made available in the cemetery for sale divided by that number plus the number already sold.

(3) For the purposes of this section—

(a) the residue of any expenditure at the end of a period is the amount incurred before that time which remains after deducting—

(i) any amount allowed in respect of that expenditure under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section in computing the profits and gains or losses of the trade for any previous period, and

(ii) if after the beginning of the first period to which subsection (1) of this section applies in the case of the trade and before the end of the period mentioned at the beginning of this subsection any asset representing that expenditure is sold or destroyed, the net proceeds of sale, or, as the case may be, any insurance money or other compensation of any description received by the person carrying on the trade in respect

of the destruction and any money received by him for the remains of the asset; and

(b) the appropriate fraction of the residue of any expenditure at the end of any period is that represented by the number of grave-spaces in the cemetery sold in the period divided by that number added to the number of grave-spaces which at the end of the period are or could be made available in the cemetery for sale.

(4) Where in the year 1954-55 or any subsequent year of assessment there is a change in the persons engaged in carrying on a trade which consists of or includes the carrying on of a cemetery, any allowance to be made under this section to the persons carrying on the trade after the change shall, whether or not it is to be assumed for other purposes that the trade was discontinued and a new trade set up and commenced, be computed as if they had at all times been engaged in carrying on the trade, and as if everything done to or by any of their predecessors in carrying on the trade had been done to or by them, and without regard to the price paid on any sale on the occasion of any such change.

(5) No expenditure shall be taken into account both under paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section, whether for the same or different periods.

(6) This section shall apply in relation to a trade which consists of or includes the carrying on of a crematorium and in connection therewith the maintenance of memorial garden plots, as it applies in relation to a trade which consists of or includes the carrying on of a cemetery, but subject to the modifications that—

(b) references to grave-spaces shall be taken as references to

memorial garden plots; and

(c) references to the sale or use of land for interments shall be taken as references to its sale or use for manorial garden plots.

(7) In this section references to the sale of land include references to the sale of a right of interment in land and to the appropriation of part of a memorial garden in return for a dedication fee or similar payment, and references to capital expenditure incurred in providing land shall be taken as references to the cost of purchase and to any capital expenditure incurred in levelling or draining it or otherwise rendering it suitable for the purposes of a cemetery or memorial garden.

(8) Section three hundred and thirty-two of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which relates to expenditure which is reimbursed to a person carrying on a trade), shall apply for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of Part X of that Act.

nor to assets used in any such business, or shares in or debentures of any such company.

Amendments restricting Finance Act, 1940, s. 55, where deceased did not have voting control of company.

29.—(1) In section fifty-five of the Finance Act, 1940 (under which shares in or debentures of a company are in certain cases to be valued for estate duty by reference to the value of the company’s assets), the following provisions shall be omitted, that is to say—

(a) in subsection (1), paragraphs and (c), with the word

“ or ” at the end of paragraph (a); and

(b) in subsection (3), paragraph (b), with the word “or” at the end of paragraph (a) and the words “or capacity ”;

but in the cases dealt with by subsections (2) to (4) of this section, the said section fifty-five shall apply as if the deceased had, within five years of his death, had control of the company otherwise than in a fiduciary capacity, but shall apply only to the valuation of shares in or debentures of the company as respects which the conditions of subsection (5) of this section are satisfied.

(2) The said section fifty-five shall apply as aforesaid if, during a continuous period of two years falling wholly within the five years ending with his death, the deceased had powers equivalent to control of the company.

(3) The said section fifty-five shall apply as aforesaid, if during any such period as aforesaid the dividends declared by the company and the interest accruing due on debentures of the company are, as to amounts forming in the aggregate more than one-half of the total amount of the dividends and interest, to be treated by virtue of any of the provisions of sections forty-seven and forty-eight of the Finance Act, 1940, as benefits accruing to the deceased from the company, or would have fallen to be so treated if the deceased had made a transfer of property to the company.

For this purpose the expression “ debenture ” shall have the same meaning as in subsection (4) of this section.

1954

Finance A, 1954

Ch. 44

(4) The said section fifty-five shall apply as aforesaid, if at Part iv any time during the five years ending with the death of the deceased

(not being a time when some other person had control or powers equivalent to control of the company) the deceased had a beneficial interest in possession in shares in or debentures of the company, or in both, of an aggregate nominal amount representing one-half or more of the aggregate nominal amount of the shares in and debentures of the company then outstanding; but for this purpose—

(a) at any time when both the deceased and another person

had such an interest in the same share or debenture, the deceased’s interest in it shall be treated as extending only to the same fraction of it as that interest would have been deemed for purposes of estate duty to extend to if the share or debenture had passed on his death at that time; and

(b) the expression “ debenture ” shall not include an obliga-

tion of the company in respect of a debt incurred by it for money borrowed by way of temporary loan, if the loan was not one of a series of temporary loans by the same person and either was repaid within two years of being made or was made less than two years before the deceased’s death.

(5) The said section fifty-five shall apply by virtue of the foregoing subsections only to the valuation of shares in or debentures of the company as respects which one or other of the following conditions is satisfied:—

(a) that immediately after the deceased’s death a person

having control or powers equivalent to control of the company, either alone or in conjunction with his relatives, has a beneficial interest in possession in the shares or debentures;

(b) that immediately before and after the death the shares

or debentures are held by the trustees of some trust who then have control of the company by virtue of shares in or debentures of the company held by them as such trustees:

Provided that, in the case of shares or debentures falling to be valued on the death by virtue of a gift inter vivos made by the deceased, or by virtue of a disposition or determination (in relation to which section forty-three of the Finance Act, 1940, has effect) of an interest limited to cease on the death, the above conditions shall not apply, and the condition shall be that immediately after the death or at any previous time since the gift or since the disposition or determination, as the case may be, the donee or person becoming entitled by virtue of or upon

Other

amendments of, or affecting Finance Act, 1940, s. 55.

30.—(1) Where any shares or debentures falling to be valued in accordance with section fifty-five of the Finance Act, 1940, are sold within three years after the death by the persons accountable for the duty payable on the death or by the persons to whom they pass on the death, and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are satisfied—

(a) that no person concerned either as vendor or as having

an interest in the proceeds of sale was a relative of any person concerned either as purchaser or as having an interest in the purchase; and

(b) that the sale was made at arm’s length for a price freely

negotiated at the time of sale; and

(c) that the price obtained for the shares or debentures on

the sale, with any adjustment needed to take account of any difference in circumstances at the date of the sale and at the date of the death, was less than the value as ascertained under the said section fifty-five of the shares or debentures sold;

then for the purposes of estate duty on the death that price, as so adjusted, shall be substituted for the value so ascertained as the value of the shares or debentures sold.

(2) The said section fifty-five shall not apply to the valuation on a person’s death of any shares or debentures comprised in a gift inter vivos made by the deceased, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue—

(a) that the shares or debentures were given absolutely to a

person who was or had been in the employment of the company, or to the widow or orphan of such a person, and the donee was not a relative of the deceased; and

(b) that bona fide possession of the shares or debentures was

assumed by the donee immediately upon the gift and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the deceased and of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise; and

1954

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1) of section fifty of the Finance Act, 1940 (by virtue of which an allowance for a company’s liabilities is to be made in valuing its assets for the purposes of section forty-six or section fifty-five of that Act), any liability of the company arising, or which may arise, after the death for taxation on income or profits shall be taken into account as if it were an actual but contingent liability at the date of the death, in so far as the liability or its amount is referable to income or profits accruing before the death, whether then realised or not; and in their estimation of any such liability for taxation charged on income or profits arising after the death the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall take into account the extent (if any) to which the last-mentioned income or profits are likely to be insufficient to meet the liability.

(4) Where any shares or debentures which fall to be valued in accordance with the said section fifty-five have also fallen to be so valued on a previous death within five years, then for the purposes of section fifteen of the Finance Act, 1914 (which provides relief from estate duty on lands and businesses in respect of quick succession), those shares and debentures shall, in relation to those deaths, be treated in the same way as an interest in land or in a business not carried on by a company, if on both deaths their value is wholly or partly attributable to the value of land of the company or any subsidiary of it or to the value of assets used by the company or any subsidiary of it in a business not consisting mainly in the holding of or dealing in investments other than land:

Provided that the amount on which the reduction under the said section fifteen is to be calculated shall be limited (where necessary) to the duty on the part so attributable of the value, on which duty is payable, of the shares or debentures, and references to that part of the value shall, in the proviso to the said section fifteen, be substituted for the references to the whole value (whether in relation to the first or the second death).

(5) Where a company alters its share capital by sub-dividing any shares into shares of smaller amount, or by consolidating and dividing any shares into shares of larger amount, subsections

(1) and (4) of this section shall apply to shares derived by those means from shares of the same class which have fallen to be valued in accordance with the said section fifty-five on a death occurring before the alteration of share capital, as if those shares and the equivalent amount of the shares from which they were so derived were the same shares; and if a company has issued to

31.—(1) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, except in so far as the context otherwise requires,—

(a) “ company ” includes any body corporate, wheresoever incorporated;

(b) “ debenture ” has the meaning assigned to it by section

fifty-nine of the Finance Act, 1940;

(c) “ subsidiary ” has the meaning assigned to it by section

one hundred and fifty-four of the Companies Act, 1948;

() “ relative ” means husband, wife, ancestor, lineal descendant, brother or sister;

control of a company if he either has the capacity, or could by an exercise of a power exercisable by him or with his consent obtain the capacity, to exercise or to control the exercise of any of the following powers* that is to say, the powers of a board of directors or of a governing director of the company, power to nominate a majority of directors or a governing director thereof, power to veto the appointment of a director thereof, or powers of a like nature.

(2) The two last foregoing sections, and this section so far as it relates thereto, shall be construed as one with section fifty-five of the Finance Act, 1940, except that subsection (5) of that section (which provides for disregarding control had by any person in a fiduciary capacity) shall not affect paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of section twenty-nine of this Act.

(3) In determining, for the purposes of subsection (5) of the said section twenty-nine, or of subsection (2) of section thirty of this Act, whether a person at any time has or had control of a company, either alone or in conjunction with his relatives, or a beneficial interest in possession in any shares in or debentures of a company,—

(a) where that person or a relative of his is or was at any time entitled under a trust, either alone or in conjunction with that person’s relatives, to not less nine-tenths of the income arising from any such shares or debentures, that person or the relative in question, as the case may be, shall be treated as being or having been able at that time to control the exercise by the

Revenue so direct, be disregarded—

(i) any limited interest subsisting at the relevant time in any shares in or debentures of the company; and

(5) In determining for the purposes of section twenty-eight or subsection (4) of section thirty of this Act what part of the value of any shares in or debentures of a company is attri-

| butable to the value of particular assets,—

(a) the value of the shares or debentures shall be apportioned in proportion to the net value of the company's assets I after allowing for liabilities other than liabilities in

respect of shares in or debentures of the company; and

! (b) the value apportioned under this subsection to the value

| of any shares in or debentures of another company

(3) Anything authorised or required to be done under the following provisions of this Part of this Act in relation to tenancies to which the foregoing section applies shall, if done before the term date in relation to a long tenancy at a low rent, not be treated as invalid by reason only that at the time at which it was done the qualifying condition was not fulfilled as respects the tenancy.

the property comprised in the tenancy, the tenancy shall continue at the same rent and in other respects on the same terms as before the term date;

(b) if the premises qualifying for protection are only part

of the property comprised in the tenancy, the tenancy while continuing after the term date shall have effect as a tenancy of those premises to the exclusion of the remainder of the property, and at a rent to be ascertained by apportioning the rent payable before the term date as between those premises and the remainder of the property, and in other respects on the same terms (subject to any necessary modifications) as before the term date.

(3) In this Part of this Act the expression “ the premises qualifying for protection ” means the aggregate of the premises of which, if the tenancy in question were not one at a low rent, the tenant would be entitled to retain possession by virtue of the Rent Acts after the coming to an end of the tenancy at the term date.

(4) Any question arising under paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section as to the premises comprised in a tenancy continuing as mentioned in that paragraph, as to the rent payable in respect of a tenancy so continuing, or as to any of the terms of such a tenancy, shall be determined by agreement between the landlord and die tenant or, on the application of either of them, by the court.

Act, 1954

the dangers inherent in the use at mines or mines of that class, as the case may be, of that material or device or such materials and devices of that class, as the case may be, are in his opinion such as to render it necessary or expedient for provision for prohibiting or restricting or, as the case may be, further restricting the use at mines or mines of that class, as the case may be, of that material or device or such materials and devices of that class, as the case may be, to be made by such regulations and for temporary provision in that behalf to be made forthwith by the order pending the coming into operation of provision in that behalf made by such regulations.

(3) No blasting material or device shall be taken or used below ground in a mine other than material or a device provided by the owner of the mine.

(4) In this section the expression “blasting materials and devices’9 means explosives and any articles designed for the purpose of breaking up or loosening minerals by means of explosion, the expansion of gas, the change of a substance from one physical state to another or a chemical reaction not constituting combustion.

Fire Precautions and Provisions as to Rescue

70.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, it shall notFire be lawful for more than one hundred persons to be employed below ground in a mine of coal in circumstances in which, if workings there were a fire in any length of intake airway through which served by the air supply to all of those persons passes, none of them would single intake be ahle to withdraw from the mine without either passing airway* through the fire or following a way out to the surface in which, or in any part of which, the air would or might become so contaminated by the products of combustion generated by the fire as to prejudice seriously the possibility of the withdrawal of persons through it in safety, unless—

(a) that length of intake airway and everything with which it

is equipped are so constructed or treated, and so maintained and used, that that length of airway is, so far as can be reasonably foreseen, free from the risk that any fire that might break out therein would so develop as to prevent or endanger the withdrawal from the mine of those persons; or

(b) means are provided for securing that, in the event of

a fire in that length of intake airway, those persons will be able to withdraw in safety.

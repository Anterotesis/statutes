BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the principal roads in Great Britain constituting the national system of routes for through traffic which by virtue of this Act become trunk roads shall be known by that name and as from the date upon which any road becomes a trunk road the Minister of Transport (hereinafter referred to as “ the Minister ”) shall be the highway authority for the road.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the roads specified in the First Schedule to this Act shall by virtue of this Act become trunk roads as from the first day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-seven.

(3) If the Minister is satisfied that it is expedient to construct a new road or improve any road with a view to superseding any part of a trunk road by the creation of a new route for through traffic, he may after serving upon the council of every county within whose area the part of the trunk road to be superseded, or the route which is to supersede it, is situated, notice of his intention to do so, and, after considering any representation made by any such council within three months after service of the said notice, and after holding a local inquiry, if he thinks fit to do so or if a request therefor is made by any such council within the said

three months and not withdrawn, make an order providing that—

(a) upon such date as may be specified in the order,

the route which is to supersede the part of the trunk road shall, by virtue of this Act, become a trunk road; and

(б) upon the first day of April next following the

date on which the Minister serves upon the councils aforesaid notice that the said route is ready to be used for the purposes of through traffic, the part of the trunk road to be so superseded as aforesaid shall become a county road.

(4) Where an order has been made under the last foregoing subsection, section thirty-two of the Local 19 & 20 Government Act, 1929 (which entitles the councils of Geo. 5. c. 17. certain boroughs and urban districts to claim the functions of maintenance and repair of county roads),

shall have effect as if the part of the trunk road to be superseded as aforesaid had become a county road on the date of the making of the order, so, however, that any functions of maintenance and repair claimed under the said section in respect of the said part shall not be exercisable until the date on which it becomes a county road.

(5) Where at the date of the passing of this Act a road was being constructed or improved by a highway authority, or was being improved by an authority in the exercise of functions under section thirty-two of the Local Government Act, 1929, or plans for the construction or improvement of a road by such an authority had been approved by the Minister, then, if the Minister is satisfied that by reason of the construction or improvement any part of a road specified in the said First Schedule has been or will be superseded by the creation of a new route for through traffic, he may at any time before the first day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and after serving upon the authority notice of his intention to do so, by order make such modifications in the provisions of the said Schedule as may be necessary for the purpose of substituting for references therein to the part superseded, references to the route which has superseded or will supersede it.

2.—(1) If the Minister of Health is satisfied that Adjustment the grants payable to councils under the said section of grants, one of the Unemployment Assistance (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1935 would, in the case of some councils, be insufficient to meet the expenditure incurred by the council in connection with the provision of relief to which this section applies, and in the case of other councils, be more than sufficient to meet the expenditure so incurred by the council, the Minister may make such adjustments in the instalments of the grants payable in respect of the period beginning with the first day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-six and ending with the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, as he thinks fit for the purpose of increasing the grants in cases where they would be insufficient, by reducing the excess in cases where they would be more than sufficient, to meet the expenditure aforesaid :

Provided that—

(a) the Minister shall not make any increases or

reductions under this section except after consultation with such associations as appear to him to represent the councils concerned and with any local authority with whom consultation appears to him to be desirable; and

1.—{1) There may be issued by the National Debt Grants for Commissioners for the purposes of local loans by the Pul)hc Public Works Loan Commissioners any sum or sums not wor 8‘ exceeding in the whole the sum of twenty million pounds.

money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation, and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local loans specified in the tables contained in Part I and Part II of the Schedule to this Act should to the extent specified in the last column of those tables, not be reckoned as assets of the Local Loans Fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887:

Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the extent aforesaid shall be written off from the assets of the Local Loans Fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland :

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees as defined in clause three of the said memorandum was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be applicable

to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees so pledged as aforesaid, was during the year ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of two hundred pounds with interest amounting to forty-seven pounds seven shillings now remains unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable:

Now, therefore, the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to forty-seven pounds seven shillings shall be remitted.

purpose before the said twenty-third day of December ; or

(б) in a case where he is charged with using the

design upon goods, that the design had been applied to the goods before he acquired them by some other person who had manufactured or dealt with the goods in the course of trade, and that that other person lawfully used the design upon similar goods before the said twenty-third day of December.

(4) Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.

WHEREAS His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have, by an agreement (hereafter referred to as “ the observation agreement ”) embodied in a resolution adopted on the eighth day of March nineteen hundred and thirty-seven by the International Committee for the application of the agreement regarding non-intervention in Spain, agreed with the Governments of certain other countries to establish in the manner provided in the observation agreement, unless otherwise amended or determined, a system of observation of the Spanish frontiers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the agreement regarding non-intervention in Spain is being effectively observed :

Provision as to observing officers.

1 Edw. 8. &, 1 Geo. 6. c.l.

And whereas the said system, under the terms of the observation agreement, is to be carried into effect by a body referred to therein as “ the International Board for Non-intervention in Spain ” and by certain officers, who are referred to in the observation agreement and in this Act as “ the chief administrator ”, “administrators”, “deputy administrators” and “observing officers ”;

And whereas, in order to enable effect to be given to the said agreement, it is expedient to make such amendments of the law relating to merchant shipping as are hereafter contained in this Act:

Now, therefore, be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :—

1.—(1) No ship to which the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Munitions to Spain) Act, 1936 (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the Act of 1936 ”) applies and which is bound to a port or place in Spanish territory shall enter any waters adjacent to Spanish territory unless she has first proceeded to the prescribed place and there embarked such observing officers as may be deputed in that behalf by the administrator at that place:

Provided that—

(a) a ship shall not be deemed to have contravened

the foregoing provisions of this subsection by reason only that she has been compelled to enter waters adjacent to Spanish territory, either in order to reach the prescribed place, or by stress of weather or any other circumstance which neither the master nor the owner of the ship could have prevented or forestalled; and

(b) there may, by agreement between the master

or owner of any ship and the chief administrator or the administrator at the prescribed place, be substituted for the prescribed place, in relation to that ship while on the voyage on which she is then engaged, such other place as may be so agreed; and

(c) the administrator at the prescribed place may, if it appears to him that he has for the time being an insufficient number of observing officers available for embarkation on any ship, exempt that ship from the provisions of this subsection while on the voyage on which she is then engaged.

(2) Any observing officers so embarked on any such ship shall be entitled to remain on board the ship until disembarked in the manner provided in the next following subsection.

(3) When any ship to which the Act of 1936 applies, having observing officers on board in pursuance of this Act, leaves a port or place in Spanish territory bound to any port or place not in Spanish territory, she shall proceed to the prescribed place, taking the shortest available route thereto unless otherwise agreed between the master or owner of the ship and the administrator who deputed the observing officers on board the ship, and shall there disembark the said officers :

Provided that the said administrator may substitute another place for the prescribed place, so, however, that, without the consent of the master or owner of the ship, no such substitution shall be made which would increase the length of the ship’s intended voyage by more than fifty sea miles.

(4) If any ship to which the Act of 1936 applies contravenes or fails to comply with the foregoing provisions of this section, the master of the ship shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and the owner of the ship shall also be guilty of a misdemeanour if he is privy to the contravention or failure.

(5) The Board of Trade may on the application of the owner and with the consent of the authority, by licence exempt any ship, being a ship which is shown to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade to be regularly engaged in carrying goods or passengers to or from Spanish territory, from the foregoing provisions of this section on the following conditions, namely :—

(a) that the ship does not, except with the consent of the chief administrator, proceed to sea from

Ch. 19. Merchant Shipping 1 Edw. 8.

(Spanish Frontiers Observation) 1 Geo. 6.

Act, 1937.

any port or place without having on board such observing officers as may be deputed from time to time in that behalf by the chief administrator; and

(b) that the owner of the ship pays to the authority on demand such additional expenses as may from time to time be certified by the Board of Trade to have been incurred by the authority by reason of the ship complying with the condition aforesaid, instead of complying with the said provisions of this section.

paid, or deemed to have been paid, by a special voluntary contributor has fallen short of fifty, any pension payable in respect of his insurance shall be payable only at the reduced rate shown in the Third Schedule to this Act as appropriate to the circumstances of his case.

The said period shall be the period comprising the contribution year in which the contributor entered into insurance and each subsequent contribution year down to, and including, the contribution year immediately preceding the date on which he dies or attains the age of sixty-five, as the case may be :

to this Act in their application to his case, as the Government Actuary may certify to be appropriate, having regard to his rights in respect of his previous insurance.

(5) Where a person enters into insurance as a special voluntary contributor in the course of the second contribution half-year in a contribution year, then, for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, contributions shaft be deemed to have been paid by him in respect of each contribution week in that half-year before his entry into insurance.

(6) Where a person enters into insurance as a special voluntary contributor in the course of a contribution year, then, for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section and of the Third Schedule to this Act, contributions shall be deemed to have been paid by him in respect of each contribution week in that year before his entry into insurance.

in the principal Act, there shall be carried thereto all contributions under the principal Act paid by special voluntary contributors, and there shall be paid thereout all pensions payable under the principal Act in respect of the insurance of special voluntary contributors :

Provided that an old age pension under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936, which is payable by virtue of section eleven of the principal Act, shall not for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a pension payable under the principal Act, but shall be payable out of moneys provided by Parliament in manner provided by the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936.

(2) Any sums standing to the credit of the Special Pensions Account which are not required to meet expenditure shall from time to time be paid over to the Treasury and by them credited to an Account to be called the Treasury Special Pensions Account.

(3) There shall also be paid into the Treasury Special Pensions Account out of moneys provided by Parliament the following sums, that is to say:—

(a) in the year ending on the thirty-first day of

March, nineteen hundred and forty, and in each of the two succeeding years, a sum greater by one-third than the sum which, on an estimate made in accordance with directions to be given by the Treasury, may be expected to be received in a contribution year in respect of the contributions of initial entrants on the basis that every initial entrant is insured throughout the year;

(b) in each of the next succeeding seven years, a sum

so calculated that, if annual payments of that amount were made during a period of twenty-seven years, those payments together with the sums paid under paragraph (a) of this subsection would be equal in value to the capital amount (as estimated by the Government Actuary in the year nineteen hundred and forty-one) of the loss to the Treasury Special Pensions Account arising through the admission to insurance of the persons admitted thereto as initial entrants; and

(c) in subsequent years, such sums as Parliament may determine with a view to meeting the loss to the Treasury Special Pensions Account arising through the admission to insurance, whether as initial entrants or otherwise, of persons admitted thereto as special voluntary contributors.

(4) If at any time it is shown to the Treasury that the sums in the Special Pensions Account are insufficient to meet the liabilities to be met thereout, the Treasury may out of the Treasury Special Pensions Account issue to the Special Pensions Account any sums required for the purpose of discharging those liabilities.

(5) There shall be paid from the Special Pensions Account such sums as the Treasury may direct towards defraying expenses of the administration of the principal Act in relation to special voluntary contributors, and the sums so paid shall, in accordance with regulations made by the Treasury, be applied as an appropriation in aid of the moneys provided by Parliament for the expenses incurred in the administration of the principal Act.

(6) The provisions of subsections (4) and (6) of section fourteen of the principal Act (which relate to the investment of funds and the audit of accounts) shall apply to the Special Pensions Account and to the Treasury Special Pensions Account in like manner as they apply to the Pensions Account and to the Treasury Pensions Account.

7.—(1) The Government Actuary shall in the year nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and in every succeeding tenth year, make a report to the Treasury on the general financial operation of the foregoing provisions of this Act, the amount of contributions from the Exchequer which will be required to preserve the solvency of the Treasury Special Pensions Account, and the value of the benefits conferred by the foregoing provisions of this Act:

Provided that nothing in this provision shall be construed as preventing the Treasury from requiring additional reports to be so made at such times during the currency of any decennial period as they think fit.

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any byelaws under this Act which are for the time being in force, and notwithstanding any restriction imposed by paragraph (a) of the proviso to subsection (1) of section thirty-four of the Public Health Act, 1936 (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the principal Act ”), the occupier of any trade premises within the district of a local

authority may, with the consent of the local authority or, so far as is permitted by any such byelaws as aforesaid, without such consent, discharge into the public sewers of the local authority any trade effluent proceeding from those premises.

(2) Nothing in paragraphs (a) and (6) of subsection

(1) of section twenty-seven of the principal Act (which prohibits the passing of certain matters into public sewers) shall apply in relation to any trade effluent which, by virtue of this Act, may lawfully be discharged into a public sewer; and subsections (2) to (5) of section thirty-four of the principal Act (which regulate the making of connections with public sewers for the purpose of drainage into such sewers) shall apply in relation to the lawful discharge of any trade effluent into public sewers as those subsections apply in relation to any discharge of matters into such sewers which is authorised by subsection (1) of that section.

(3) Section twenty-six of the principal Act is hereby repealed.

Special restrictions on discharge of trade effluents.

2.—(1) No trade effluent shall be discharged from any trade premises into a public sewer of a local authority otherwise than in accordance with a written notice (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ a trade effluent notice ”) served on the local authority by the owner or occupier of the premises, stating—

(a) the nature or composition of the trade effluent,

(б) the maximum quantity of the trade effluent

which it is proposed to discharge on any one day, and

(c) the highest rate at which it is proposed to discharge the trade effluent;

and no trade effluent shall be discharged in accordance with such a notice until the expiration of the period of two months, or such less time as may be agreed to by the local authority, from the day on which the notice is served on the local authority (hereafter in this Act referred to as “ the initial period ”).

(2) In so far as the discharge of any trade effluent in accordance with a trade effluent notice would not be lawful without the consent of the local authority, the notice shall be deemed to be an application for that consent.

1937. Public Health (Drainage Ch. 40.

of Trade Premises) Act, 1937.

(3) Where a trade effluent notice in respect of any premises is served on a local authority, the local authority may, at any time within the initial period, give to the owner or occupier, as the case may be, of those premises a direction that no trade effluent shall be discharged in pursuance of the notice until a specified date after the end of the initial period; and, in so far as the discharge of any trade effluent in accordance with the trade effluent notice requires the consent of the local authority in order to be lawful, the local authority may give that consent either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the local authority think fit to impose with respect to—

(a) the sewer or sewers into which any trade effluent may be discharged in pursuance of the trade effluent notice,

(b) the nature or composition of the trade effluent

which may be so discharged,

(c) the maximum quantity of any trade effluent

which may be so discharged on any one day, either generally or into a particular sewer,

(d) the highest rate at which any trade effluent may

be discharged in pursuance of the trade effluent notice, either generally or into a particular sewer, and

(e) any other matter with respect to which byelaws

may be made under this Act;

but any such condition as aforesaid shall be of no effect if and so far as it is inconsistent with any byelaws so made which are for the time being in force.

(4) A local authority, on receiving a trade effluent notice duly served on them, shall forthwith send a copy of the notice to any interested body, and the local authority shall not have power to take any further action under the preceding provisions of this section in relation to the notice, without the approval of the body or bodies (if any) to whom the local authority are required by this subsection to send a copy of the notice.

(5) If, in the case of any trade premises—

(a) any trade effluent is discharged in contravention of this section, or without such consent

(if any) as is necessary for the purposes of this Act, or

(b) any direction or condition given or imposed under this section is contravened,

the occupier of the premises shall be guilty of an offence.

3.—(1) Any person aggrieved by a direction of a local authority given under the last preceding section in relation to a trade effluent notice, or by the refusal of a local authority to give a consent for which application has. been duly made to them by means of such a notice, or by the failure of a local authority to give such a consent within the initial period, or by any condition attached by a local authority to such a consent, may appeal to the Minister, and upon any such appeal the Minister—

(a) where the appeal is in respect of such a direction

as aforesaid, may either annul the direction or modify it by substituting an earlier date for the date specified in the direction as the date before which no trade effluent is to be discharged in pursuance of the notice,

(б) where the appeal is in respect of such a refusal or

failure as aforesaid, may give the necessary consent, either unconditionally or subject to any such condition as the Minister thinks fit to impose for determining any of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (3) of the last preceding section,

(c) where the appeal is in respect of such a condition

as aforesaid in relation to any matter, may either annul the condition or substitute therefor any less stringent condition in relation to the same matter, or

(d) in any case, may dismiss the appeal;

and the decision of the Minister on any stich appeal shall be final:

Provided that at any stage of the proceedings on such an appeal the Minister may, and, if so directed by the High Court, shall, state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the High Court any question of law arising in those proceedings.

(2) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that a person aggrieved by the failure of a local authority

1937. Public Health (Drainage Ch. 40.

of Trade Premises) , 1937.

to give such a consent as aforesaid within the initial period has a right of appeal under this section, notwithstanding that the failure may be occasioned only by the fact that an interested body have not approved the giving of the consent.

(3) Where, by virtue of this section, the Minister modifies a direction or gives a consent or imposes a condition, then for the purposes of the preceding sections of this Act, the direction, as so modified, or the consent or condition, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been duly given or imposed by the local authority under the last preceding section.

4.—(1) For the purposes of this Act the consent of a local authority to the discharge of any trade effluent from any trade premises into a sewer of the local authority shall not be necessary, if any trade effluent of the same nature or composition as that of the trade effluent in question was lawfully discharged as aforesaid from those premises into that sewer at some time within the period of one year ending on the third day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and if and so long as—

(a) the quantity of the trade effluent discharged from the premises into the sewer on any one day does not exceed the maximum quantity thereof so discharged on any one day during the said period, and

(b) the rate at which the trade effluent is discharged

from the premises into the sewer is not higher than the highest rate at which it was so discharged during the said period, and

(c) (where the trade effluent was at any time within

the said period discharged into the sewer under an agreement between the local authority and the owner or occupier of the trade premises, being an agreement which was in force at the end of the said period but has thereafter ceased to be in force) the owner or occupier of those premises makes to the local authority, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, such payments (if any) in respect of the reception of the trade effluent into the sewer as he would have been obliged to make under that agreement if it were still in force.

(a) if, at some time during the period of one year immediately before the date on which the old drain or sewer was so closed, any trade effluent of the same nature or composition as that of the trade effluent in question was lawfully discharged through the old drain or sewer into the public sewer or the cesspool, as the case may be, with which it communicated; and

(b) if and so long as—

(i) the quantity of the trade effluent which, on any one day, is discharged through the new drain or sewer into the public sewer with which it communicates does not exceed the maximum quantity of the trade effluent which, on any one day during the said period, was discharged through the old drain or sewer into the public sewer or the cesspool, as the case may be, with which it communicated, or (where, immediately before it was so closed, the old drain or sewer communicated with a cesspool) does not exceed such greater quantity, if any, as may be substituted for the said maximum quantity by agreement between the local authority and the owner or occupier of the trade premises or, in default of such agreement, by order of the Minister, and

(ii) the rate at which the trade effluent is discharged through the new drain or sewer into the public sewer with which it communicates is not higher than the highest rate at

(4) The consent of a local authority to the discharge, from any premises into a sewer of the local authority, of any liquid produced solely in the course of laundering articles on those premises shall not be necessary for the purposes of this Act.

(5) Any dispute arising under this Act as to the nature or composition of any trade effluent discharged from any trade premises into a sewer of a local authority during such a period as is mentioned in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section, or as to the quantity of trade effluent so discharged on any one day during such a period, or as to the rate at which trade effluent was so discharged during such a period, shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, be referred to the Minister for determination; and upon any such reference the Minister may make such order in the matter as he thinks just, and the order shall be final:

Provided that at any stage of the proceedings on such a reference the Minister may, and, if so directed by the High Court, shall, state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the High Court any question of law arising in those proceedings.

of all condensing water;

(c) for requiring that, before the trade effluent enters

(i) injure or obstruct those sewers, or make specially difficult or expensive the treatment or disposal of the sewage from those sewers, or

(ii) (where the trade effluent is to be, or is, discharged into a sewer having an outfall into any harbour or tidal water or into a sewer which connects directly or indirectly with a sewer or sewage disposal works having such an outfall) cause or tend to cause injury or obstruction to the navigation on, or the use of, the said harbour or tidal water;

(2) Nothing in any trade effluents byelaws, in so far as they provide for matters other than those specified in paragraphs (e), (g) and (h) of the preceding subsection, shall apply in relation to any discharge of trade effluents to which, by virtue of the last preceding section, the consent of the local authority is not necessary, and nothing in any trade effluents byelaws shall enable a local authority to make any charge for the reception into a sewer of any quantity of any trade effluent discharged from any particular trade premises, being a quantity which, by virtue of the last preceding section, could lawfully be discharged from those premises into the sewer without the consent of the local authority.

(2) If the Minister is satisfied that the establishment or carrying on of any trade or industry at any premises within the district of a local authority is, or is likely to be, unreasonably impeded in consequence of any trade effluents byelaws made by that local authority, he may, for the purpose of removing the impediment, require the local authority to revoke those byelaws and to make such new byelaws as he considers necessary, and if the local authority do not within six months after such requisition comply therewith, the Minister may himself for that purpose revoke the byelaws and make such new byelaws as he considers necessary.

(3) Any byelaws made by the Minister under this section shall have effect as if they had been duly made by the local authority and confirmed by the Minister.

7. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any trade effluents byelaws for the time being in force, a

local authority may enter into and carry into effect an agreement with the owner or occupier of any trade premises within their district for the reception and disposal by the local authority of any trade effluent produced on those premises, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the preceding provision, the agreement may provide for the construction by the local authority of such works as may be required for the said reception or disposal, and for the repayment by the owner or occupier, as the case may be, of the whole or part of the expenses incurred by the local authority in carrying out their obligations under the agreement:

Provided that any agreement entered into under this subsection by a local authority shall not take effect unless and until the agreement has been approved by any interested body or the Minister has dispensed with the necessity for such approval.

(3) A copy of every agreement entered into by a local authority in pursuance of this section, certified by the clerk of the local authority, shall be kept by the local authority at their offices so as to be available at all reasonable times for inspection and copying by any person, upon payment of a fee of sixpence for each inspection.

(4) Nothing in this Act or in any trade effluents byelaws shall affect any agreement with respect to any trade effluent duly made between a local authority and the owner or occupier of any trade premises before the commencement of this Act or the coming into operation of the byelaws, as the case may be.

In determining whether a trade mark is adapted to distinguish as aforesaid, the tribunal may have regard to the extent to which—

Provided that, if it is proved either—

(a) that there is a well-known and established use

of the word or words as the name or description of the article or substance by a person or persons carrying on a trade therein, not being use in relation to goods connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark or (in the case of a certification trade mark) goods certified by the proprietor; or

the provisions of the next succeeding subsection shall have effect.

(2) Where the facts mentioned in paragraph (a) or

(b) of the foregoing subsection are proved with respect to any word or words, then—

(a) if the trade mark consists solely of that word or those words, the registration of the trade mark, so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question or of any goods of the same description, shall be deemed for the purposes of section thirty-five of the principal Act to be an entry wrongly remaining on the register;

(b)if the trade mark contains that word or those words and other matter, the Court or the Registrar, in deciding whether the trade mark shall remain on the register, so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question and of any goods of the same description, may, in case of a decision in favour of its remaining on the register, require as a condition thereof that the proprietor shall disclaim any right to the exclusive use in relation to that article or substance and any goods of the same description of that word or those words, so however, that no disclaimer upon the register shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made; and

(3) No word which is the commonly used and accepted name of any single chemical element or single chemical compound, as distinguished from a mixture, shall be registered as a trade mark in respect of a chemical substance or preparation, and any such registration in force at the commencement of this Act or thereafter shall, notwithstanding anything in section forty-one of the principal Act, be deemed for the purposes of section thirty-five of the principal Act to be an entry made in the register without sufficient cause, or an entry wrongly remaining on the register, as the circumstances may require:

Provided that the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not have effect in relation to a word which is used to denote only a brand or make of the element or compound as made by the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark, as distinguished from the element or compound as made by others, and in association with a suitable name or description open to the public use.

(4) The foregoing provisions of this section shall have effect in substitution for the provisions of section six of the Trade Marks Act, 1919, and accordingly that section shall be repealed.

(3) If on an application for the registration of a trade mark as to which the Registrar has given advice as aforesaid in the affirmative, made within three months after the advice is given, the Registrar, after further investigation or consideration, gives notice to the applicant of objection on the ground that the trade mark is not adapted to distinguish, or capable of distinguishing, as the case may be, the applicant shall be entitled, on giving notice of withdrawal of the application within the prescribed period, to have repaid to him any fee paid on the filing of the application.

6. It shall not be lawful to register as a trade mark or part of a trade mark any matter the use of which would, by reason of its being likely to deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a court of justice, or would be contrary to law or morality, or any scandalous design.

The foregoing provisions of this section shall have effect in substitution for the provisions of section eleven of the principal Act, and accordingly that section shall be repealed.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing subsections, a trade mark shall not be, or be deemed to have been, assignable or transmissible in a case in which, as a result of an assignment or transmission, there would in the circumstances subsist, or have subsisted, whether under the common law or by registration, exclusive rights in more than one of the persons concerned to the use, in relation to the same goods or description of goods, of trade marks nearly resembling each other or of identical trade marks, if, having regard to the similarity of the goods and of the trade marks, the use of the trade marks in exercise of those rights would be, or have been, likely to deceive or cause confusion:

Provided that, where a trade mark is, or has been, assigned or transmitted in such a case as aforesaid, the assignment or transmission shall not be deemed to be, or to have been, invalid under this subsection if the exclusive rights subsisting as a result thereof in the persons concerned respectively are, or were, having regard to limitations imposed thereon, such as not to be exercisable by two or more of those persons in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, within the United Kingdom (otherwise than for export therefrom), or in relation to goods to be exported to the same market outside the United Kingdom.

(5) The proprietor of a registered trade mark who proposes to assign it in respect of any goods in respect of which it is registered may submit to the Registrar in the prescribed manner a statement of case setting out the circumstances, and the Registrar may issue to him a certificate stating whether, having regard to the similarity of the goods and of the trade marks referred to in the case, the proposed assignment of the first-mentioned trade mark would or would not be invalid under the last foregoing subsection, and a certificate so issued shall, subject to the provisions of this section as to appeal and unless it is shown that the certificate was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, be conclusive as to the validity or invalidity under

the last foregoing subsection of the assignment in so far as such validity or invalidity depends upon the facts set out in the case, but, as regards a certificate in favour of validity, only if application for the registration under section thirty-three of the principal Act of the title of the person becoming entitled is made within six months from the date on which the certificate is issued.

(6) In a case in which as a result of an assignment or transmission of a trade mark there would in the circumstances subsist, or have subsisted, whether under the common law or by registration, an exclusive right in one of the persons concerned to the use of the trade mark limited to use in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in a place or places in the United Kingdom, and an exclusive right in another of those persons to the use of a trade mark nearly resembling the first-mentioned trade mark or of an identical trade mark in relation to the same goods or description of goods limited to use in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in another place or other places in the United Kingdom, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:—

(a) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) to (3) of this section, a trade mark shall not, after the commencement of this Act, be assignable or transmissible in any such case:

Provided that, on application in the prescribed manner by the proprietor of a trade mark who proposes to assign it, or of a person who claims that a trade mark has been transmitted to him or to a predecessor in title of his since the commencement of this Act, in any such case, the Registrar, if he is satisfied that in all the circumstances the use of the trade marks in exercise of the said rights would not be contrary to the public interest, may approve the assignment or transmission, and an assignment or transmission so approved shall not be deemed to be, or to have been, invalid under this paragraph or under subsection (4) of this section, so, however, that in the case of a registered trade mark this provision shall not have effect unless application for the registration under

(6) The validity of an assignment or transmission

effected or claimed to have been effected before the commencement of this Act in any such case shall be determined as if the foregoing provisions of this section had not been enacted :

Provided that, on application made in the prescribed manner within two years from the commencement of this Act by a person who claims that an assignment or transmission of a registered trade mark to him or to a predecessor in title of his has been so effected, the Registrar shall have the like jurisdiction as under the proviso to the foregoing paragraph, and an assignment or transmission approved by him shall not be deemed to have been invalid on the ground of the subsistence of such rights as aforesaid, or on the ground that the assignment or transmission was effected otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of a business or was effected in respect of some (but not all) of the goods in respect of which the trade mark was registered, if application for registration of title as aforesaid is made within six months from the date on which the approval is given or was made before that date.

(7) Where an assignment in respect of any goods of a trade mark that is at the time of the assignment used in a business in those goods is made after the commencement of this Act otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of that business, the assignment shall not take effect until the following requirements have been satisfied, that is to say, the assignee must, not later than the expiration of six months from the date on which the assignment is made or within such extended period, if any, as the Registrar may allow, apply to him for directions with respect to the advertisement of the assignment, and must advertise it in such form and manner and within such period as the Registrar may direct.

(2) The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be use by the proprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be use by a person other than the proprietor, for the purposes of section twelve of this Act and for any other purpose for which such use is material under the Trade Marks Acts or at common law.

(3) Subject to any agreement subsisting between the parties, a registered user of a trade mark shall be entitled to call upon the proprietor thereof to take proceedings to prevent infringement thereof, and, if the proprietor refuses or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the registered user may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as if he were the proprietor, making the proprietor a defendant.

that the grant thereof would tend to facilitate trafficking in a trade mark.

(б) may be cancelled by the Registrar on the applica-

tion in writing in the prescribed manner of the registered proprietor or of the registered user or of any other registered user of the trade mark; or

(c) may be cancelled by the Registrar on the application in writing in the prescribed manner of any person on any of the following grounds, that is to say,—

(ii) that the proprietor or the registered user misrepresented, or failed to disclose, some fact material to the application for the registration, or that the circumstances have materially changed since the date of the registration;

(iii) that the registration ought not to have been effected having regard to rights vested in the applicant by virtue of a contract in the performance of which he is interested.

(13) Nothing in this section shall confer on a registered user of a trade mark any assignable or transmissible right to the use thereof.

(2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered—

on application by that person to the Court or, at the option of the applicant and subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of section twenty-six of this Act, to the Registrar, the tribunal may impose on the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks proper for securing that that registration shall cease to extend to such use as last aforesaid.

(3) An applicant shall not be entitled to rely for the purposes of paragraph (6) of subsection (1), or for the purposes of subsection (2), of this section on any nonuse of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention not to use or to abandon the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates.

Provided that a mark shall not be so registrable in the name of a person who carries on a trade in goods of the kind certified.

In determining whether a mark is adapted to distinguish as aforesaid, the tribunal may have regard to the extent to which—

(a) the mark is inherently adapted to distinguish

as aforesaid in relation to the goods in question; and

(b) by reason of the use of the mark or of any other

circumstances, the mark is in fact adapted to distinguish as aforesaid in relation to the goods in question.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsections (3) to (5) of this section, and of sections forty-one and forty-four of the principal Act, the registration of a person as proprietor of a certification trade mark in respect of any goods, shall, if valid, give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods, and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trade mark or a person authorised by him under the regulations in that behalf using it in accordance therewith, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in

(a) as being use as a trade mark; or

(b) in a case in which the use is use upon the goods

or in physical relation thereto or in an advertising circular, or other advertisement, issued to the public, as importing a reference to some person having the right either as proprietor or by his authorisation under the relevant regulations to use the trade mark or to goods certified by the proprietor.

(3) The right to the use of a certification trade mark given by registration as aforesaid shall be subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register, and shall not be deemed to be infringed by the use of any such mark as aforesaid in any mode, in relation to goods to be sold or otherwise traded in in any place, in relation to goods to be exported to any market, or in any other circumstances, to which, having regard to any such limitations, the registration does not extend.

(4) The right to the use of a certification trade mark given by registration as aforesaid shall not be deemed to be infringed by the use of any such mark as aforesaid by any person—

(a) in relation to goods certified by the proprietor

of the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk of which they form part, the proprietor or another in accordance with his authorisation under the relevant regulations has applied the trade mark and has not subsequently removed or obliterated it, or the proprietor has at any time expressly or impliedly consented to the use of the trade mark; or

(б) in relation to goods adapted to form part of,

or to be accessory to, other goods in relation to which the trade mark has been used without infringement of the right given as aforesaid or might for the time being be so used, if the use of the mark is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods are so adapted and neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the mark is to indicate otherwise than in accordance with the fact that the goods are certified by the proprietor:

(5) Where a certification trade mark is one of two or more registered trade marks which are identical or nearly resemble each other, the use of any of those trade marks in exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration shall not be deemed to be an infringement of the right so given to the use of any other of those trade marks.

(6) There shall be deposited at the Patent Office in respect of every trade mark registered under this section regulations approved by the Board of Trade for governing the use thereof, which shall include provisions as to the cases in which the proprietor is to certify goods and to authorise the use of the trade mark, and may contain any other provisions which the Board of Trade may require or permit to be inserted therein (including provisions conferring a right of appeal to the Registrar against any refusal of the proprietor to certify goods or to authorise the use of the trade mark in accordance with the regulations).

Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in relation to goods as to which the Registrar is satisfied that compliance with this subsection in relation thereto would involve undue complexity and that the addition or antedating, as the case may be, would not affect any substantial quantity of goods and would not substantially prejudice the rights of any person.

to be paid as a condition of the grant as aforesaid of such a lease or licence, or as a condition of the renewal or continuance, after the beginning of the said day, of such a lease or licence, whether granted before or after the beginning of the said day;

and any such order may be varied or revoked by a subsequent order made in like manner, and subject to the like approval, as the original order:

Provided that an order under this section shall not be made in relation to any premises unless the Commission are satisfied that the making of the order is desirable to prevent persons who may have any interest in the premises taking undue advantage of the position which they enjoy by virtue of this Part of this Act; and before making such an order, the Commission shall give to any person appearing to them to have an interest in the premises concerned a reasonable opportunity of making representations to the Commission, and shall take any such representations into consideration.

(8) A committee may, if they think it expedient, cancel or vary any minimum rate fixed under this Act.

(9) Before fixing, cancelling or varying any minimum rate, the committee shall give such notice as may be prescribed of the rate which they propose to fix or of their proposal to cancel the rate or of the proposed variation of the rate, as the case may be, and of the manner in which and the time within which objections to the proposal may be lodged, not being less than fourteen days from the date of the notice, and shall consider any objections to the proposal which may be lodged within the time mentioned in the notice.

4. Any worker employed in agriculture in any district on piece work for which no minimum piece rate has been fixed or any person authorised by such a worker may complain to the committee for the district that the piece rate of wages paid to the worker for that work is such a rate as would yield in the circumstances of the case to an ordinary worker a less amount of wages than the minimum rate for time work applicable in the case of that worker and the committee may, on any such complaint after giving the employer an opportunity of making such representations as he thinks desirable, direct that the employer shall pay to the worker such additional sum by way of wages for any piece work done by him at that piece rate at any time within fourteen days before the date of complaint or at any time after the date of complaint and before the decision of the committee thereon as in their opinion represents the difference between the amount which would have been paid if the work had been done by an ordinary worker at the minimum rate for time work and the amount actually received by the worker by whom, or on whose behalf, the complaint is made, and any sum so directed to be paid may be recovered by or on behalf of the worker from the employer as a civil debt.

rate of wages in substitution for any such rate as aforesaid which, by cancellation or otherwise, has ceased to operate; or

6. The Department may direct a committee to reconsider any minimum rate which has been fixed by them, and thereupon the committee shall reconsider the same and notify to the Department the result of their reconsideration.

7. —(1) Where any minimum rate of wages has been made effective by an order of the Board under this Act, any person who employs a worker in agriculture shall, in cases to which the minimum rate is applicable, pay wages to the worker at a rate not less than the minimum rate, and, if he fails to do so, shall be liable on summary conviction in respect of each offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds and to a fine not exceeding one pound for each day on which the offence is continued after conviction.

(2) In any proceedings against a person under this section it shall lie with that person to prove that he has paid wages at not less than the minimum rate.

(3) In any proceedings against an employer under this section the court shall, whether or not there is a conviction or a fine is imposed, order the employer to pay to the worker such sum as may be found by the court to represent the difference between the amount which ought at the minimum rate applicable to have been paid by the employer to the worker during the period of six, months immediately preceding the date on which the complaint was served and the amount actually paid by the employer to the worker during that period.

(4) Where an employer has been convicted under this section for failing to pay wages to any worker at not less than the minimum rate applicable, then, if notice of intention so to do has been served with the complaint, evidence may be given of any failure on the part of the employer to pay wages to that worker at not less than the minimum rate applicable to him at anytime during the eighteen months immediately preceding the period of six months mentioned in the last preceding subsection, and on proof of the failure the court may order the employer to pay to the worker such sum as is found by the court to represent the difference between the amount which ought to have been paid to the worker by way of wages at the minimum rate applicable during those eighteen months and the amount actually so paid.

(5) Where an offence for which an employer is under this section liable to a fine has in fact been committed by some agent of the employer or other person, that agent or other person shall be liable to be proceeded against for the offence in the same manner as if he were the employer, and either together with the employer, or before or after the employer is proceeded against, and shall be liable on conviction to the same punishment as that to which the employer is liable.

(6) It shall be a defence for an employer who is charged with an offence under this section to prove that he has used due diligence to secure compliance with the provisions of this Act, and that the offence was in fact committed by his agent or some other person without his knowledge, consent or connivance.

(7) Where it appears to the Department that a sum is due from an employer to a worker on account of the payment of wages to him at less than the minimum rate applicable, or by reason of any direction given by a committee for the payment of an additional sum by way of wages for piece work, the Department may institute, on behalf of or in the name of the worker, civil proceedings before any court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of the said sum :

Provided that in any such civil proceedings instituted ' by the Department the court shall have the same power to make an order for the payment of expenses by the Department as if they were a party to the proceedings.

(9) The powers given by this section for the recovery of sums due from an employer to a worker shall not be in derogation of any right of the worker to recover such sums by any other proceedings.

(10) Any agreement for the payment of wages in contravention of this Act, or for abstaining from exercising any right of enforcing the payment of wages in accordance with this Act, shall be void.

(11) Subject to any determination under this Act of the benefits or advantages which may be reckoned as payment of wages in lieu of cash and the value at which they are to be reckoned, and to any limitation or prohibition under this Act of the reckoning of benefits or advantages as payment of wages in lieu of cash, the court shall, in any proceedings under this Act, reckon as a payment of wages such amount as represents the value of any benefits or advantages (not being benefits or advantages prohibited by law) received by a worker under the terms of his employment.

8.—(1) The Department shall, in addition to any special power to make regulations given to them under this Act, have power to make regulations for the following purposes:—

(3) that any Agreement for the setting up of such a Conference, to which they may become a party, will not provide for any reduction in imports of Canadian fat cattle and beef into the United Kingdom below recent levels;

(4) that any such Agreement will recognize that special provision may become necessary for increased shipments of fat cattle and beef from Canada and will provide for specified reductions, if necessary, in shipments of chilled beef from foreign countries;

(5) that there will be no regulation of imports of cattle or

beef from Canada unless, after consultation with the Government of Canada, it appears to the Government of the United Kingdom that the effective working of a general scheme for the orderly marketing in the United Kingdom of meat cannot otherwise be secured.

Article 6.

The Government of Canada undertake that the goods the growth, produoe or manufacture of the United Kingdom enumerated in Schedule IV appended hereto, when conveyed without transhipment from any part of the British Empire enjoying the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff into a sea, lake or river port of Canada, shall not be subjected to duties of customs higher than those specified in that Schedule.

The Government of Canada undertake as regards goods the growth, produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom other than those enumerated in Schedule IV that, under the British Preferential Tariff, no new protective duty shall be imposed and

no existing protective duty increased except after an inquiry at which United Kingdom producers shall enjoy full rights of audience.

Article 7.

The Government of Canada undertake that goods the growth, produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom enumerated in Schedule IV, when not of a class or kind made in Canada and when subject to duties of customs on importation into Canada, shall, when conveyed without transhipment from any part of the British Empire enjoying the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff into a sea, lake or river port of Canada, enjoy the benefit of preferential tariff margins which, in the case of any such goods, shall not be less than the difference between the rate of duty provided for in this agreement and the rate of duty now levied upon like goods the growth, produce or manufacture of any foreign country, provided however that, if the duty on foreign goods becomes less than such preferential tariff margin, no duty shall be levied on the like goods of United Kingdom origin.

Article 8.

The Government of Canada undertake in respect of the goods the growth, produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom enumerated in Schedule V appended hereto that the difference between the rates of duties of customs on such goods on importation into Canada, when conveyed without transhipment from any part of the British Empire enjoying the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff into a sea, lake or river port of Canada, and the rates upon similar goods the growth, produce or manufacture of any foreign country shall not be less than the margins set out in that Schedule.

Article 9.

The two Governments undertake that, except as provided for in legislation already in force, goods the growth, produce or manufacture of either country covered by the provisions of Articles 1 and 2, or of the first paragraph of Article 6, as the case may be, shall not be subjected on importation into the other country to any imposts or charges other than the customs duties leviable in accordance with the provisions of the said Articles unless equal imposts or charges are imposed on similar goods the growth, produce or manufacture of the importing country.

Article 10.

Each Government reserve the right to suspend or modify the preferential margin specified in respect of any item in Schedule HI or Schedule V, as the case may be, if, after inquiry, it appears to that Government that a predominating share of the trade in such

item is controlled by any organisation or combine of exporters and that by virtue of the guaranteed margin that organisation or combine is exercising this control to the prejudice of consumers or users of the goods in question.

Article 11.

Neither Government will, without the consent of the other Government, amend their regulations regarding qualification for preferential tariff treatment so as to increase above fifty per centum the prescribed proportion of the value of any class of manufactured articles which must be derived from expenditure in the British Empire in order to entitle the articles to preference.

Article 12.

The Government of Canada, recognizing that the entry of Canadian goods into the United Kingdom market free of duty, as assured in Article 1 of this Agreement and, in particular, their exemption from liability to any special or dumping duty, even if sold in that market at less than their comparable selling price in Canada, warrant more nearly reciprocal treatment of United Kingdom goods offered for sale in similar circumstances in Canada, agree to exempt particular classes of United Kingdom goods from special or dumping duty under the conditions set out in the following paragraphs.

If it appears to the Government of the United Kingdom that any goods enjoying entry free of duty into the United Kingdom under the provisions of Article 1 of this Agreement are exported from Canada to the United Kingdom at export or selling prices lower than the fair market value for home consumption, as determined on the bases laid down in Section 6 of the Customs Tariff of Canada, and that in consequence thereof the sale of similar United Kingdom goods is being prejudicially or injuriously affected, they may notify the Government of Canada of the facts of the case and request that United Kingdom goods of each or any class or kind normally manufactured by the Canadian industry manufacturing the goods in question shall be exempt from special or dumping duty on importation into Canada.

On receipt of such notification and request the Government of Canada will take suitable steps to correct the situation complained of and, if other measures are ineffectual, will exempt United Kingdom goods, as specified in the notification, from special or dumping duty for such period as may prove necessary. Recognizing that in certain circumstances it may be found necessary to exempt from special or dumping duty other United Kingdom goods of a class or kind normally manufactured by the Canadian industry manufacturing the goods in question, the Government of Canada

1937.

Finance A, 1937.

Ch. 54.

agree that they will accord sympathetic consideration to any 1st Sen. request that the United Kingdom Government may make under cont-this Article for such exemption and will, in consultation with the United Kingdom Government, determine what measures shall be taken to restore fair trading conditions.

The Government of the United Kingdom will invite the Governments of the non-self-goveming Colonies and Protectorates to continue to accord to Canada any preference which may for the time being be accorded to any other part of the British Empire:

Provided that the operation of this paragraph shall not extend to any preferences accorded by Northern Rhodesia to the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories in South Africa.

The Government of Canada undertake to accord to those non-Belf-governing Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, to which the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff are at present accorded, and also to Malta, the benefit of any preferences for the time being accorded to any part of the British Empire:

Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall interfere with existing obligations or special arrangements already in force between Canada and other parts of the British Empire; and,

Provided further that the Government of Canada shall not be bound to continue to accord any preferences to any Colony or Protectorate which, not being precluded by international obligations from according preferences, either (i) accords to Canada no preferences, or (ii) accords to some other part of the British Empire (in the case of Northern Rhodesia, excepting the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories in South Africa) preferences not accorded to Canada.

The Government of Canada undertake to accord to goods the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the non-self-goveming Colonies, Protectorates or Mandated Territories of Togoland under British Mandate, the Cameroons under British Mandate, the Tanganyika Territory or Palestine, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to similar goods the growth, produce or manufacture of any foreign country.

Article 15.

The Government of the United Kingdom will invite the Governments of the Colonies and Protectorates shown in Schedule VI appended hereto to continue in operation the preferences accorded to Canada on the commodities and at the rates shown in that Schedule, and the Government of Canada will continue in operation the preferences accorded to the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories by Canada as set out in Schedule VII appended hereto:

Provided that the Government of Canada shall not be bound to continue to accord any preferences to any Colony or Protectorate which, not being precluded by international obligations from according preferences, either (i) accords to Canada no preferences, or (ii) accords to some other part of the British Empire (in the case of Northern Rhodesia, excepting the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories in South Africa) preferences not accorded to Canada; and,

Provided further that, in the event of the denunciation and termination of the Canada-West Indies Trade Agreement dated the 6th July, 1925, either Government shall be at liberty, on giving at least six months’ notice, to terminate the provisions of this Article not earlier than the termination of that Agreement.

Article 16.

In the event of circumstances arising which in the judgment of the Government of the United Kingdom or of the Government of Canada, as the case may be, necessitate a variation in the terms of this Agreement, the proposal to vary those terms shall be the subject of consultation between the two Governments.

Article 17.

The Agreement will come into force on a date to be mutually agreed between the two Governments. On the coming into force of the present Agreement, the Agreement concluded between the two Governments at Ottawa on the 20th August, 1932, shall cease to have effect. Pending the coming into force of the present Agreement, the two Governments will apply its provisions as far as may be possible and will consult together with regard to the dates on which particular provisions of the 1932 Agreement shall be deemed to have been replaced by provisions of the present Agreement. The Agreement will remain in force until the 20th August, 1940. Unless six months before the 20th August, 1940, notice of termination shall have been given by either Government

Sir,

With reference to Article 16 of the Trade Agreement signed this day, I have the honour to inform you that the Canadian Government, having taken note of the statements of the United Kingdom Government in the course of the recent discussions (1) that it is essential to the national security that the production of the zinc smelting industry in the United Kingdom should be maintained at a satisfactory level; (2) that at any enquiry into the question of the effects of imports of zinc from oversea Empire countries on the maintenance of the production of zinc in the United Kingdom at a satisfactory level having regard to the needs of national security, the Canadian zinc producers would have the opportunity of submitting evidence, and (3) that the Government of the United Kingdom would consult the Canadian Government before taking any decision to impose a customs duty on imports of Canadian zinc into the United Kingdom; agree that it will be open to the United Kingdom Government, after such enquiry and after consultation with the Canadian Government, and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1 of the Trade Agreement, to impose a customs duty on imports of zinc produced or manufactured in Canada, without prejudice however, to the provisions of Article 3 of the Agreement.

It is understood that no customs duty will be imposed on Canadian zinc which is not equally applicable to zinc from other oversea Empire sources.

I have, etc.,

Letter No. 2.

Letter from Canadian Signatory on the Subject of Home Consumption Drawbacks.

Ottawa,

February 20, 1937.

Sir,

During the negotiations in London last summer, representations were made by the United Kingdom authorities to the effect that in certain cases tariff preferences accorded the United Kingdom by Canada had been rendered less effective than had been expected by reason of the drawbacks of duty for home consumption authorized by Schedule B to the Customs Tariff. At that time the Minister of Finance promised, on behalf of the Canadian Government, that fuller consideration would be given to the proposal of the United Kingdom that the preferential principle of tariff treatment be applied to the Drawback Schedule.

Since the return of the Canadian delegation, the competent Departments of the Canadian Government have been studying United Kingdom proposals, and such examination as has been made to date of the operation of Schedule B justifies the position taken in London by the Minister of Finance : that to apply suddenly a preferential scheme to the entire existing Schedule might, in many instances, work hardship upon Canadian consumers without necessarily ensuring any added advantage to United Kingdom interests.

Close examination of the existing Schedule reveals that frequently the home consumption drawback applies to raw materials imported for use in the manufacture of non-protected finished products, and in such instances the effect of abolishing or even restricting the full privilege of drawback might easily be disastrous to the industry concerned. There is the further fact that several of the items in the Schedule appear to have become inoperative (in so far as may be judged by the absence of claims thereunder), and such items are now the subject of review by the Canadian Government with a view to their possible cancellation. There is also to be borne in mind the fact that, under the last two or three Budgets, an effort has been made not merely to afford margins of preference by way of drawbacks, but actually to confine the operation of certain new drawback items to importations under the British Preferential Tariff.

The provision for home consumption drawbacks in the Canadian tariff is not one which this Government desires to see extended; on the contrary, were it feasible to do so immediately

1937.

Finance A, 1937.

Ch. 54.

645

and at one stroke, the Government would prefer to dispense with the granting of such drawbacks, the administration of which is always costly and frequently difficult. To that end, as indicated, the Canadian Government already contemplates reducing the Schedule; and in this connection—and toward the same objective— it will undertake to give prompt and sympathetic consideration to any requests that may from time to time be put forward by the Government of the United Kingdom regarding the continuance or the operation of any particular item in the Schedule.

I have, etc.,

W. L. MACKENZIE KING.

FOURTH SCHEDULE.

Adaptations of Income Tax Provisions as to Computation of Profits for Purpose of National Defence Contribution.

1. The profits shall be taken to be the actual profits arising in the chargeable accounting period; and the principles of computing profits by reference to any other period and, save as provided in the next following paragraph, of allowing losses sustained in any other period to be carried forward, shall not be followed.

2. —(1) Where a person carrying on a trade or business either solely or in partnership has, before the beginning of the first of the relevant accounting periods, sustained a loss (as computed for income tax purposes) in the trade or business, he may olaim that so much of that loss shall be carried forward and deducted from or set off against the profits arising from the trade or business in any of the relevant accounting periods as could, under section thirty-three of the Finance Act, 1926, as amended by section nineteen of the Finance Act, 1932, be carried forward and deducted from or set off against the assessable income tax profits of the trade or business for the year of assessment corresponding to that accounting period:

Provided that, in ascertaining the amount (if any) that could be so carried forward and deducted from or set off against assessable income tax profits for a year of assessment corresponding to an accounting period—

(a) the amount of the assessable income tax profits for that year shall be taken to be equal to the amount of the profits arising in that accounting period (computed in like manner as profits arising in a chargeable accounting period are computed for the purpose of the national defence contribution but before making any deduction for wear and tear under the next following paragraph);

(b) the amount of the assessable income tax profits for any

previous year of assessment corresponding to a previous relevant accounting period shall be taken to be equal to the amount of the profits (computed as aforesaid) arising in that previous accounting period; and

(c) the amount of the deduction (if any) to be made from the

assessable income tax profits under Rule 6 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule D for any year of assessment corresponding to a relevant accounting period shall be taken to be equal to the amount which, under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of the next following paragraph, falls to be deducted in computing the amount of the profits arising in that accounting period.

(2) Where a person carrying on a trade or business either solely or in partnership has, in any relevant accounting period, sustained a loss in the trade or business (to be computed in like manner as profits arising in a chargeable accounting period are computed for the purpose of the national defence contribution) he may claim that that loss shall be carried forward and, as far as may be, deducted from or set off against the profits arising from the trade or business in the next relevant accounting period and, if and so far as it exceeds the profits so arising in that period, against the profits so arising in the next such period, and so on.

In the application of this sub-paragraph to a loss sustained by a partner in a partnership, references to losses or profits shall be construed as references to that partner’s share in those losses or profits.

(3) For the purpose of this paragraph—

3.—(1) There may be deducted in respect of any accounting period a sum (ascertained on the like basis as the amount of a deduction for wear and tear is ascertained under Rule 6 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule D) which represents the diminution in value by reason of wear and tear during that period of any plant or machinery in respect of which a deduction

1937.

Finance A, 1937.

could be made under the said Rule 6, plus ten per cent, of that sum.

(2) Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, there may, in the case of the first chargeable accounting period, be deducted any sum which, under paragraph (3) of the said Rule 6, falls to be added to the amount of the deduction for wear and tear to be made under that Rule in charging the profits or gains of the trade or business to income tax for the year 1937-1938:

Provided that, if the amount of the deduction falling to be made under this, sub-paragraph exceeds the amount of profits arising from the trade or business in the first chargeable accounting period, the excess shall, in lieu of being deducted in that chargeable accounting period, be deducted in the second chargeable accounting period if and in so far as there are profits arising in that period, and so on.

4. The principles of the Income Tax Acts under which deductions are not allowed for interest, annuities or other annual payments payable out of the profits, or for royalties, or (in certain cases) for rent, and under which the annual value of lands, tenements, hereditaments or heritages occupied for the purpose of a trade or business is excluded, and under which a deduction may be allowed in respect of such annual value, shall not be followed :

Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall authorise any deduction in respect of—

(a) any payment of dividend or distribution of profits; or

(б) any interest, annuity or other annual payment paid to

any person carrying on the trade or business, or any royalty or rent so paid;

and, for the purpose of paragraph (b) of this proviso, where the trade or business is carried on by a company the directors whereof have a controlling interest therein, the directors shall be deemed to be carrying on the trade or business.

5. The provisions of subsection (4) of section twenty-seven of the Finance Act, 1920 (which disallows deductions on account of the payment of dominion income tax) shall not apply.

6. Where, in respect of any profits arising from a trade or business, relief from income tax chargeable in the United Kingdom is granted by virtue of arrangements with the Government of any other country, being arrangements which for the time being have effect either—

(a) under section eighteen of the Finance Act, 1923 (which as amended by section thirty-one of the Finance Act,

(6) under section seventeen of the Finance Act, 1930 (which provides for the relief of certain agencies from double taxation);

those profits shall not be included in the profits arising from that trade or business, if and so long as the profits of trades or businesses which, by virtue of those arrangements, are relieved from income tax chargeable in that other country, are relieved from all taxes chargeable in that other country on the profits of trades or businesses.

7. Income received from investments or other property shall be included in the profits in the cases and to the extent provided in this paragraph, and not otherwise—

(a) in the case of the business of a building society, or a

banking business, assurance business or business consisting wholly or mainly in the dealing in or holding of investments or other property, the profits shall include all income received from investments or other property except—

(i) income received directly or indirectly by way of dividend or distribution of profits from a body corporate carrying on a trade or business to which the section of this Act charging the national defence contribution applies; and

(ii) income to which the persons carrying on the trade or business are not beneficially entitled;

(b) in the case of any other trade or business, being a trade

or business carried on by a body corporate, the profits shall include all income received by way of dividend or distribution of profits from any other body corporate in which the first-mentioned body corporate has a controlling interest and which is not liable to be assessed to the national defence contribution:

Provided that the profits of a body corporate which, either alone or in conjunction with any statutory undertakers, has a controlling interest in any other body corporate, being statutory undertakers, shall not in any case include any income received from that other body corporate.

8. Subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph, the profits shall include all such income arising from the trade or business as is chargeable to income tax under Case I of Schedule D, or would be so chargeable if the profits of the trade or business were chargeable under that Case, except

1937.

Finance A, 1937.

Ch. 54.

651

income which is, or would be, exempted from income tax by virtue of section thirty-nine of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or section thirty of the Finance Act, 1921.

9. No deduction shall be made on account of liability to pay or the payment of United Kingdom income tax or the national defence contribution.

10. No deduction shall be made in respect of any transaction or operation of any nature if and so far as it appears that the transaction or operation has artificially reduced the profits or created or increased a loss or would artificially reduce the profits or create or increase a loss.

11. In the case of a trade or business carried on in any chargeable accounting period by a company the directors whereof have a controlling interest therein, the deduction to be allowed in respect of the remuneration of the directors other than wholetime service directors shall not exceed fifteen per cent, of the profits arising from the trade or business in that period (computed before making any deduction in respect of the remuneration of the directors other than whole-time service directors), or fifteen hundred pounds, whichever is the greater, so, however, that the deduction shall in no case exceed fifteen thousand pounds:

Provided that in relation to a chargeable accounting period of less than twelve months any reference in this paragraph to fifteen hundred pounds or fifteen thousand pounds shall be construed as a reference to a sum which bears the same proportion to fifteen hundred pounds or fifteen thousand pounds, as the case may be, as the length of the period bears to twelve months.

12. —(1) In the case of a trade or business carried on in any chargeable accounting period by an individual or individuals in partnership, he or they may claim that there shall be allowed as a deduction in respect of that period the greatest amount which could have been allowed as a deduction under the last foregoing paragraph in respect of the remuneration of the directors other than whole-time service directors, if the trade or business had been carried on in that period by a company the directors whereof had a controlling interest therein :

Provided that, where a deduction is made under this paragraph as respects any period, the profits arising from the trade or business in that period shall be chargeable to the national defence contribution at the rate applicable in the case of a trade or business carried on by a body corporate.

(2) Any claim under this paragraph shall be made by notice in writing given to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue within one month from the end of the chargeable accounting period in question.

CHAPTER 56.

An Act to make provision for the ascertainment and registration of particulars as to proprietary interests in unworked coal and mines of coal and in certain associated minerals, property and rights in land, and for purposes connected therewith. [30th July 1937.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Registration of particulars of ownership.

1.—(1) For the purpose of recording such particulars as are hereinafter mentioned as to proprietary interests that subsist in coal and mines of coal in Great Britain and in certain property and rights held in association therewith, the Board of Trade shall establish a register, to be called “ the coal holdings register.”

(2) The Board shall receive applications duly made to them for the registration of particulars in the register, and, after such applications have been examined in accordance with the provisions of this Act, shall register particulars of the facts ascertained upon the examination thereof.

(3) Registrations under this Act shall be effected in respect of such proprietary interests or groups of proprietary interests as are, under the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act, to be treated as constituting units of separate ownership, and applications for registration must be made accordingly.

Any such interest or group of interests is in this Act referred to as a “ holding.”

(4) The matters whereof particulars may be registered in respect of any holding shall be—

(a) the coal and mines of coal in which the holding

subsists;

(б) the property and rights which are held in

association with such coal and mines or any of them and in which the holding subsists;

1937.

Coal (Registration

717

(c) the servitudes, restrictive covenants and other matters subject to which the coal hereditaments in which the holding subsists or any of them are or is held;

(d) such matters of title as are requisite for the identification of the holding as a unit of separate ownership; and

2. Every objection must be in writing and state—

(a) the specific grounds of objection; and

(б) the omissions, additions, or modifications asked for.

3. The Secretary of State shall consider any objection made by or on behalf of any persons appearing to him to be affected which is sent to him within the required time, and he may, if he thinks fit, amend the draft regulations, and, after doing so, he shall, unless an inquiry has been held under this Schedule, cause the amended draft to be dealt with in like manner as an original draft.

4. If after the publication of the notice with respect to any draft regulations (whether an original or amended draft) any general objection as hereinafter defined is made within the required time with respect to the draft and not withdrawn, then, unless a previous inquiry under this Schedule has been held with respect to the draft or some previous draft of the regulations or the Secretary of State withdraws the draft regulations, he shall before making the regulations direct an inquiry to be held in the manner hereinafter provided. The Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, also direct such an inquiry to be held in regard to any objection, notwithstanding that no such general objection has been made or that such a previous inquiry has been held as aforesaid.

5. Where any such inquiry is to be held as to any draft regulations, the following provisions shall have effect with respect to the inquiry—

(a) the Secretary of State shall appoint a competent person or competent persons to hold the inquiry, and to report to him thereon;

(c) the witnesses may, if the person holding or presiding

over the inquiry thinks fit, be examined on oath;

(d) subject as aforesaid, the inquiry and all proceedings

preliminary and incidental thereto shall be conducted in accordance with rules made by the Secretary of State and the rules may make provision as to the costs of the inquiry and other proceedings, including the remuneration of the person or persons holding the inquiry.

6. For the purposes of this Schedule the expression " general objection ” means, as respects any draft regulations, an objection made—

(a) by or on behalf of the majority of the occupiers of the

factories affected by the draft regulations or by or on behalf of the occupier or occupiers employing a majority of the persons employed in those factories; or by any person who satisfies the Secretary of State that he or an association on behalf of which he acts, represents a majority of the persons employed in those factories; or

(б) by or on behalf of the majority of the occupiers of any

class or description of factories affected as respects which it appears to the Secretary of State that, by reason of special conditions existing in connection therewith, there is reason to believe that any of the requirements of the draft regulations may be unnecessary or inappropriate in the case of that class or description, or by or on behalf of the occupier or occupiers employing a majority of the persons employed in any such class or description of factories as aforesaid; or by any person who satisfies the Secretary of State that he or an association on behalf of which he acts represents a majority of the persons employed in any such class or description of factories as aforesaid.

(whichever rate is the less) for each acre of that land which at the beginning of the said day was under oats or under barley, as the case may be :

Provided that the appropriate Minister shall not be authorised to make any subsidy payment in relation to any farm by reason of any land which at any particular time was comprised in that farm having been then under oats or under barley, if the total area of the land then comprised in that farm which was then under oats or under barley, as the case may be, was less than one acre, and where the said total area was not an exact number of acres, the odd fraction of an acre shall be disregarded.

SCHEDULES.

THE FIRST SCHEDULE (referred to in section 2).

THE CATHEDRAL AND COLLEGIATE CHURCH OF SAINT SAVIOUR AND SAINT MARY OVERIE. SOUTHWARK.

Preamble.

The Church of Saint Saviour, Southwark, originally the Collegiate Church of the Priory of Saint Mary Overie, thereafter served as the church of a parish established, by a Statute of Henry VIH in the year 1541, out of two previously existing parishes. The property of the Wardens of those two parishes was vested in a body of six Wardens, who were to be elected by the parishioners of the new parish.

The rectory, church, burying-ground and certain other property in the parish were granted by James I in 1611 to certain persons, and by those persons conveyed in 1614 to a body of Trustees on trust for the employment of two preaching Chaplains and other purposes. The Saint Saviour’s, Southwark, Chaplaincy Act, 1868, reduced the number of these Chaplains to one, who was required to maintain a curate.

The St. Saviour’s, Southwark (Church Rate Abolition) Act, 1883, vested the right of perpetual presentation to the office of Chaplain in the Bishop of the diocese in which the parish church was or might be situated and enacted that the holder of the said office should be styled Rector. It confirmed the Wardens in their capacity as a body corporate and in their rights, but regulated the method of electing the Wardens, including the Warden of the Great Account, and made provision for the election of a further Warden, to be called the Rector s Warden, and his inclusion in the body corporate. It added the Rector to the then existing Trustees, and made new provisions for election of the elected Trustees; and it vested in the Trustees

(commonly called “ the Rectory Trustees ”), in addition to the property of which at that time they stood possessed, the sum of seven thousand pounds paid by the Bishop of Rochester for the right of presentation to the office of Chaplain (thenceforward styled Rector) and certain other property detailed in the First Schedule to the Act; but it provided that, with one exception, the income derived from these sources and from any other property which from time to time might be vested in the said Trustees should be paid over to the Wardens and by them expended upon the stipends of the Rector, the Schoolmaster and the Usher of the Grammar School of Saint Saviour in Southwark, and towards defraying the expenses of the repair and maintenance of the Church and other expenses in connection therewith as the Wardens should think proper.

These arrangements were, in part, materially changed by the Borough of Southwark (St. Saviour) Scheme, 1901, made in pursuance of the London Government Act, 1899. This Scheme provided (inter alia) for two Churchwardens, one of whom was to be the Rector’s Warden, to whom was transferred any power, duty, property or liability of the Court of Wardens connected with the affairs of the Church; and it made the Rectory Trustees not merely trustees but also the administrators (but subject to the conditions contained in the Act of 1883 in respect of the objects to which it was applicable) of the income of the property vested in them. In other respects the rights of the Court of Wardens were fully maintained. The election of the five members of the Court of Wardens (other than the Rector’s Warden) was thenceforward to be entrusted to the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark, and that of the Rectory Trustees to the inhabitants of the ecclesiastical district for the time being attached to the Church of Saint Saviour.

Meanwhile changes had taken place within the Church itself. In 1896 the Vestry resolved that the Lady Chapel (being now that portion of the Cathedral Church which is mentioned in Statute I as being available for parochial purposes) sufficiently provided for the needs of the parish and approved a proposal to apply for a faculty for fitting up that Chapel as a parish church and to use the remainder of the Church as a collegiate church, subject to the Warden of the Great Account and the Rector’s Warden being members of the Chapter. In pursuance of this resolution, the Bishop of Rochester, in 1897, entered into an agreement under seal with the Rector whereby the Lady Chapel was thenceforth to be deemed the parish church and the Rector renounced all his rights to the use of the remainder of the Church, save in respect of solemnisations of baptism and marriage, the receipt of fees therefor, the joint use of the vestry and the bells, and access to the Parish Church. In the same year a faculty was given for effecting the necessary alterations, and the Bishop promulgated Statutes for the Collegiate Church. The Saint Thomas Southwark

Measure, 1937.

1 Edw. 8.

1 Geo. 6.

and Saint Saviour Southwark Act, 1898, which united the two parishes, designates the Church of Saint Saviour as a Collegiate Church.

The bishopric of Southwark was founded by an Order in Council made on the 20th day of March, 1905, in pursuance of the Bishoprics of Southwark and Birmingham Act, 1904, the Second Schedule to which declared the Church of Saint Saviour, Southwark, to be the Cathedral Church of the diocese of Southwark.

By an Order in Council made on the 29th day of April, 1915, the benefices of Saint Saviour and of Saint Peter, in Southwark, were united. The Rectory of Saint Peter’s has since that time been the residence of the Incumbents; and save for baptisms, marriages and occasional special Services, Saint Peter’s Church has been used as though it were the Parish Church of the united benefices; and it is with that Church that the Parochial Church Council has chiefly concerned itself.

In 1922 the Bishop of Southwark promulgated new Statutes in amendment of those of 1897. These bodies of Statutes, though not binding in law, have generally been followed. In accordance with these Statutes, the Bishop was Dean and a Bishop Suffragan Sub-Dean, and the number of Canons was limited to six, with Dignities (apart from that of Sub-Dean) of Precentor, Chancellor and Missioner. The Chapter was constituted so as to include the Dean, the Sub-Dean, the Canons, the Warden of the Great Account, the Rector’s Warden, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer. While the clerical members of this Chapter controlled all matters relating to the ministering of the Word and Sacraments and the conduct of Divine Worship, the Chapter as a whole had, among other powers, that of appointing, dismissing, and regulating the duties of, all persons (save the Canons and others appointed by the Bishop) employed in the Cathedral Church and of fixing and altering their remuneration.

The following Constitution and Statutes have been framed by the Cathedral Commissioners for England with the object of bringing the governance of the Cathedral Church of Saint Saviour, Southwark, into accord, so far as is attainable, with the provisions of the Cathedral Measures, 1931 and 1934, while at the same time preserving so much of the ordinances under which, since its establishment as a Cathedral Church, it has been ruled as is compatible with that end. Accordingly, the Constitution provides for residentiary canonries, which have heretofore existed in the Cathedral Church and may, unless and until sufficient endowments are available, be held by persons holding some other preferment.

patients) shall have effect as if any reference therein to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman included a reference to committing buggery or an act of gross indecency with another man.

(5) Subsection (1) of this section shall not prevent an act from being an offence (other than a civil offence) under any provision of the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 or the Naval Discipline Act 1957.

(6) It is hereby declared that where in any proceedings it is charged that a homosexual act is an offence the prosecutor shall have the burden of proving that the act was done otherwise than in private or otherwise than with the consent of the parties or that any of the parties had not attained the age of twenty-one years.

(7) For the purposes of this section a man shall be treated as doing a homosexual act if, and only if, he commits buggery with another man or commits an act of gross indecency with another man or is a party to the commission by a man of such an act.

2.—(1) It shall continue to be—

(a) an offence under section 12 of the Act of 1956 and at

(b) by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to

have committed it or to have become unlawfully at large, as the case may be; or

(c) because the accusation against him is not made in good

faith in die interests of justice,

it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust or oppressive to return him.

Provided that a magistrates* court shall not commit the offender to that other court of assize or quarter sessions in any case where it appears to the magistrates* court that he would thereby suffer hardship.

(4) For the purposes of this and the next following sections a suspended sentence passed on an offender on appeal shall be treated as having been passed by the court by which he was originally sentenced.

(d) if it was passed by a court of quarter sessions, a justice acting for the area for which that court was held;

(e) if it was passed by a magistrates' court, a justice acting for the area for which that court acted.

(3) Where an offender is convicted by a court in Scotland of an offence punishable with imprisonment and the court is informed that the offence was committed during the operational period of a suspended sentence passed in England or Wales, the court shall give written notice of the conviction to the clerk of the court by which the suspended sentence was passed.

(4) Unless he is acting in consequence of a notice under subsection (2) of the last foregoing section or under the last foregoing subsection, a justice of the peace shall not issue a summons under this section except on information and shall not issue a warrant under this section except on information in writing and on oath.

(5) A summons or warrant issued under this section shall direct the offender to appear or to be brought before the court by which the suspended sentence was passed; but if a warrant is so issued requiring him to be brought before a court of assize or quarter sessions and he cannot forthwith be brought before that court because that court is not being held, the warrant shall have effect as if it directed him to be brought before a magistrates' court for the place where he is arrested and the latter court shall commit him in custody or on bail to that court of assize or quarter sessions or if, having regard to the time when and the place where he is likely to be dealt with in respect of the suspended sentence by that court, it would be more convenient that he should be dealt with by another court of assize or quarter sessions, to that other court:

Provided that a magistrates’ court shall not commit the offender to that other court in any case where it appears to the magistrates' court that he would thereby suffer hardship.

(4) For purposes of subsection (2) or (3) above a house and premises shall be taken as not including any premises which are to be or may be included under section 2(4) above in giving effect to the tenant's claim, and as including any part which is to be or may be excluded under section 2(5) or (6).

(6) Any entire rent payable at any time in respect of both a house and premises or part thereof and of property not included in the house and premises shall for purposes of this section be apportioned as may be just according to the circumstances existing at the date of the severance giving rise to the apportionment, and references in this section to the rent of a house and premises or of part thereof shall be construed accordingly.

(c) and (6) above.

(3) For purposes of subsection (2) above the house and premises shall be treated as discharged from a rent to the extent to which—

(a) the rent is charged on or apportioned to other land

so as to confer on the tenant in respect of the house and premises the remedies against the other land provided for by section 190(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925; or

(b) the landlord is otherwise entitled to be exonerated from

or indemnified against liability for the rent in respect of the house and premises and the tenant will (in so far as the landlord’s right is not a right against the tenant himself or his land) become entitled on the conveyance to the like exoneration or indemnity.

(4) Where for the purpose of complying with subsection (2) above the house and premises are to be discharged from a rent by redemption of it (with or without prior apportionment), and for any reason mentioned in section 191(4) of the Law of Property Act 1925 difficulty arises in paying the redemption price, the tenant may, and if so required by the landlord shall, before execution of the conveyance pay into court on account of the price for the house and premises an amount not exceeding the appropriate amount to secure redemption of the rent; and 2 the amount so paid by the tenant is less than that appropriate amount, the landlord shall pay into court the balance.

(5) Where payment is made into court in accordance with subsection (4) above, the house and premises shall on execution of the conveyance be discharged from the rent, and any claim to the redemption money shall lie against the fund in court and not otherwise.

(6) For purposes of subsection (4) above “the appropriate amount to secure redemption ” of a rent is (subject to subsection

(7) below) the amount of redemption money agreed to be paid or in default of agreement, the amount certified under section 191 of the Law of Property Act 1925.

(<z) “the appropriate amount to secure redemption” of the rent for purposes of subsection (4) above shall, if no amount has been agreed or certified as mentioned in subsection (6), be such sum as, on an application under section 191(7) of the Law of Property Act 1925 for the apportionment of the rent, may, pending the apportionment, be approved by the apportioning authority as suitable provision (with a reasonable margin) for the redemption money of the part likely to be apportioned to the house and premises; and

(6) the apportionment, when made, shall be deemed to have had effect from the date of the payment into court, and if in respect of any property affected by the rent there has been any overpayment or underpayment, the amount shall be made good by abatement of or addition to the next payment after the apportionment and (if necessary) later payments.

(8) Subsection (2) above applies to rentcharges and other rents falling within section 191 of the Law of Property Act 1925 which during the continuance of the tenancy are, or but for the termination of the tenancy before their commencement would have been, recoverable from the landlord without his having a right to be indemnified by the tenant.

(2) Where in accordance with subsection (1) above the conveyance to a tenant will be effective to discharge the house and premises from a charge to secure the payment of money, then except as otherwise provided by this section it shall be the duty of the tenant to apply the price payable for the house and

(3) For the purpose of determining the amount payable in respect of any charge under subsection (2) above a person entitled to the benefit of a charge to which that subsection applies shall not be permitted to exercise any right to consolidate that charge with a separate charge on other property; and if the landlord or the tenant is himself entitled to the benefit of a charge to which that subsection applies, it shall rank for payment as it would if another person were entitled to it, and the tenant shall be entitled to retain the appropriate amount in respect of any such charge of his.

(4) For the purpose of discharging the house and premises from a charge to which subsection (2) above applies, a person may be required to accept three months or any longer notice of the intention to pay the whole or part of the principal secured by the charge, together with interest to the date of payment, notwithstanding that the terms of the security make other provision or no provision as to the time and manner of payment; but he shall be entitled, if he so requires, to receive such additional payment as is reasonable in the circumstances in respect of the costs of re-investment or other incidental costs and expenses and in respect of any reduction in the rate of interest obtainable on re-investment.

(5) Subsection (2) above shall not apply to any debenture-holders’ charge, that is to say, any charge, whether a floating charge or not, in favour of the holders of a series of debentures issued by a company or other body of persons, or in favour of trustees for such debenture-holders; and any such charge shall be disregarded in determining priorities for purposes of subsection (2):

Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in relation to a charge in favour of trustees for debenture holders which at the date of the conveyance to the tenant is (as regards the house and premises) a specific and not a floating charge.

(6) Where the house and premises are discharged by this section from a charge (without the obligations secured by the charge being satisfied by the receipt of the whole or part of the price), the discharge of the house and premises shall not prejudice any right or remedy for the enforcement of those obligations against other property comprised in the same or any other

(7) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not be taken to prevent a person from joining in the conveyance for the purpose of discharging the house and premises from any charge without payment or for a less payment than that to which he would otherwise be entitled; and, if he does so, the persons to whom the price ought to be paid shall be determined accordingly.

(8) A charge on the landlord’s estate to secure the payment of money or the performance of any other obligation shall not be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as a tenant’s incumbrance by reason only of the grant of the tenancy being subsequent to the creation of the charge and not authorised as against the persons interested in the charge; and this section shall apply as if the persons so interested at the time of the grant had duly concurred in the grant for the purpose (but only for the purpose) of validating it despite the charge on the grantor’s estate:

Provided that, where the tenancy is granted after the commencement of this Part of this Act (whether or not it is, by virtue of section 3(3) above, to be treated for other purposes as forming a single tenancy with a previous tenancy) and the tenancy has not by the time of the conveyance of the house and premises to die tenant become binding on the persons interested in the charge, the conveyance shall not by virtue of this section discharge the house and premises from the charge except so far as it is satisfied by the application or payment into court of the price payable for the house and premises.

(9) Nothing in this section shall apply in relation to any charge falling within section 11 above, and for purposes of subsection (2) above the price payable for the house and premises shall be treated as reduced by any amount to be paid out of it before execution of the conveyance for the redemption of a rent in accordance with section 11(4).

(a) for any reason difficulty arises in ascertaining how much

is payable in respect of the charge; or

(b) for any reason mentioned in subsection (2) below difficulty arises in making a payment in respect of the charge;

the tenant may pay into court on account of the price for the house and premises die amount, if known, of the payment to be made in respect of the charge or, if that amount is not known, the whole of the price or such less amount as the tenant thinks right in order to provide for that payment.

(2) Payment may be made into court in accordance with subsection (l)(b) above where the difficulty arises for any of the following reasons: —

(a) because a person who is or may be entitled to receive

payment cannot be found or ascertained;

(b) because any such person refuses or fails to make out

a title, or to accept payment and give a proper discharge, or to take any steps reasonably required of him to enable the sum payable to be ascertained and paid; or

(c) because a tender of the sum payable cannot, by reason of complications in the title to it or the want of two or more trustees or for other reasons, be effected, or not without incurring or involving unreasonable cost or delay.

(3) Without prejudice to subsection (l)(a) above, the price payable for a house and premises on a conveyance under section 8 above shall be paid by the tenant into court if before execution of the conveyance written notice is given to him—

(a) that the landlord or a person entitled to the benefit

of a charge on the house and premises so requires for the purpose of protecting the rights of persons so entitled, or for reasons related to any application made or to be made under section 36 below, or to the bankruptcy or winding up of the landlord; or

(b) that steps have been taken to enforce any charge on the landlord’s interest in the house and premises by the bringing of proceedings in any court, or by the appointment of a receiver, or otherwise;

and where payment is to be made into court by reason only of a notice under this subsection, and the notice is given with reference to proceedings in a court specified in the notice other than the county court, payment shall be made into the court so specified.

(4) For the purpose of computing the amount payable into court under this section, the price payable for the house and premises shall be treated as reduced by any amount to be paid out of it before execution of the conveyance for the redemption of a rent in accordance with section 11(4) above.

Extension

14.—(1) Where a tenant of a house has under this Part of this Act a right to an extended lease, and gives to the landlord written notice of his desire to have it, then except as provided by this Part of this Act the landlord shall be bound to grant to the tenant, and the tenant to accept, in substitution for the existing tenancy a new tenancy of the house and premises for a term expiring fifty years after the term date of the existing tenancy.

(2) Where a person gives notice of his desire to have an extended lease of a house and premises under this Part of this Act, then unless the notice lapses under any provision of this Act excluding his liability, there shall be borne by him (so far as they are incurred in pursuance of the notice) the reasonable costs of or incidental to any of the following matters:—

(a) any investigation by the landlord of that person’s right

to an extended lease;

(b) any lease granting the new tenancy;

(c) any valuation of the house and premises obtained by

the landlord before the grant of the new tenancy for the purpose of fixing the rent payable under it in accordance with section 15 below.

(3) A tenant shall not be entitled to require the execution of a lease granting a new tenancy under this section otherwise than on tender of the amount, so far as ascertained,—

(a) of any sums payable by way of rent or recoverable

as rent in respect of the house and premises up to the date of tender; and

(b) of any sums for which at that date the tenant is liable

under subsection (2) above; and

lord under or in respect of the existing tenancy or any agreement collateral thereto;

and, if the amount of any such sums is not or may not be fully ascertained, on offering reasonable security for the payment of such amount as may afterwards be found to be payable in respect of them.

(4) This section shall have effect notwithstanding that the grant of the existing tenancy was subsequent to the creation of a charge on the landlord’s estate and not authorised as against the persons interested in the charge; and a lease executed to give effect to this section shall be deemed to be authorised as against the persons interested in any charge on the landlord’s estate, however created or arising, and shall be binding on them :

Provided that, where the existing tenancy is granted after the Part I commencement of this Part of this Act (whether or not it is, by virtue of section 3(3) above, to be treated for other purposes as forming a single tenancy with a previous tenancy) and, the grant being subsequent to the creation of the charge on the landlord’s estate, the existing tenancy is not binding on the persons interested in the charge, a lease executed to give effect to this section shall not by virtue of this subsection be binding on those persons.

(5) Where a lease is executed to give effect to this section, and any person having a charge on the landlord’s estate is by reason thereof entitled to possession of the documents of title relating to that estate, the landlord shall within one month after execution of the lease deliver to that person a counterpart of it duly executed by the tenant, and the instrument creating or evidencing the charge shall apply in the event of his failing to deliver a counterpart in accordance with this subsection as if the obligation to do so were included in the terms of the charge as set out in that instrument.

(6) Where under a lease executed to give effect to this section the new tenancy takes effect subject to a subsisting charge on the existing tenancy, and at the time of its execution the person having the charge is by reason thereof entitled to possession of the documents of title relating to the existing tenancy, then he shall be similarly entitled to possession of the documents of title relating to the new tenancy and the tenant shall within one month of the execution of the lease deliver it to him, and the instrument creating or evidencing the charge shall apply in the event of the tenant failing to deliver the lease in accordance with this subsection as if the obligation to do so were included in the terms of the charge as set out in that instrument.

(7) A landlord granting a lease under this section shall be bound to take such steps as may be necessary to secure that it is not liable in accordance with the proviso to subsection (4) above to be defeated by persons interested in a charge on his estate; but a landlord is not obliged, in order to grant a lease under this section, to acquire a better title than he has or could require to be vested in him.

15.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, the Terms of new tenancy to be granted under section 14 above shall be a tenancy to tenancy on the same terms as the existing tenancy as those * terms apply at the relevant time, but with such modifications on ex ension' as may be required or appropriate to take account—

(a) of the omission from the new tenancy of property comprised in the existing tenancy; or

Part I

(b) of alterations made to the property demised since the grant of the existing tenancy; or

(c) in a case where the existing tenancy derives (in accord-

ance with section 3(6) above) from more than one separate tenancies, of their combined effect and of the differences (if any) in their terms.

(2) The new tenancy shall provide that as from the original term date the rent payable for the house and premises shall be a rent ascertained or to be ascertained as follows: —

(a) the rent shall be a ground rent in the sense that it shall

represent the letting value of the site (without including anything for the value of buildings on the site) for the uses to which the house and premises have been put since the commencement of the existing tenancy, other than uses which by the terms of the new tenancy are not permitted or are permitted only with the landlord’s consent;

(b) the letting value for this purpose shall be in the first

instance the letting value at the date from which the rent based on it is to commence, but as from the expiration of twenty-five years from the original term date the letting value at the expiration of those twenty-five years shall be substituted, if the landlord so requires, and a revised rent become payable accordingly;

(c) the letting value at either of the times mentioned shall be determined not earlier than twelve months before that time (the reasonable cost of obtaining a valuation for the purpose being borne by the tenant), and there shall be no revision of the rent as provided by paragraph ( b)above unless in the last of the twenty-five years there mentioned the landlord gives the tenant written notice claiming a revision.

(3) Where during the continuance of the new tenancy the landlord will be under any obligation for the provision of services, or for repairs, maintenance or insurance, the rent payable in accordance with subsection (2) above shall be in addition to any sums payable (whether as rent or otherwise) in consideration of those matters or in respect of the cost thereof to the landlord; and if the terms of the existing tenancy include no provision for the making of any such payments by the tenant, or provision only for the payment of a fixed amount, the terms of the new tenancy shall make, as from the time when rent becomes payable in accordance with subsection (2) above, such provision as may be just for the making by the tenant of payments related to the cost from time to time to the landlord.

Leasehold Reform Act 1967

Ch. 88

2063

and for the tenant’s liability to make those payments to be enforceable by distress, re-entry or otherwise in like manner as the liability for the rent.

(4) Subject to subsection (5) below, provision shall be made by the terms of the new tenancy or by an instrument collateral thereto for the continuance with any suitable adaptations of any agreement collateral to the existing tenancy.

(5) For purposes of subsections (1) and (4) above, there shall be excluded any term of the existing tenancy or any agreement collateral thereto in so far as that term provides for or relates to the renewal of the tenancy, or confers any option to purchase or right of pre-emption in relation to the house and premises, or provides for the termination of the tenancy before the term date otherwise than in the event of a breach of its terms; and there shall be made in the terms of the new tenancy or any instrument collateral thereto such modifications as may be required or appropriate to take account of the exclusion of any such term as aforesaid.

(6) Where the new tenancy is granted after the original term date, the first reference in subsection (2) above to that date shall have effect as a reference to the grant of the new tenancy; but on the grant of the new tenancy there shall be payable by the tenant to the landlord as an addition to the rent payable under the existing tenancy any amount by which for the period since the relevant time or the original term date (whichever is the later) the sums payable to the landlord in respect of the house and premises (after making any necessary apportionment) for rent and matters referred to in subsection (3) above fall short in total of the sums that would have been payable for rent and matters so referred to under the new tenancy, and section 14(3)(a) above shall apply accordingly.

(7) Subsections (1) to (6) above shall have effect subject to any agreement between the landlord and tenant as to the terms of the new tenancy or any agreement collateral thereto; and either of them may require that for purposes of the new tenancy there shall be excluded or modified any term of the existing tenancy or an agreement collateral thereto which it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to include unchanged in the new tenancy in view of the date at which the existing tenancy commenced and of changes since that date which affect the suitability at the relevant time of the provisions of that tenancy.

(8) The new tenancy shall make provision in accordance with section 16(4) below, and shall reserve to the landlord the right to resume possession in accordance with section 17.

(9) In granting the new tenancy, the landlord shall not be bound to enter into any covenant for title beyond that implied

(2) Whereto) a tenancy of a house and premises has been extended

under section 14 above; and (b) any part other than the house of the property then comprised in that tenancy is afterwards (while so comprised) held or occupied with another house not so comprised;

subsection (l)to) or ( b)above shall not apply to exclude any right under this Part of this Act of a tenant of the other house to acquire the freehold or an extended lease of that part as being at the relevant time comprised in his house and premises, unless the landlord objects in accordance with subsection (3) below.

(3) If, in a case falling within subsection (2) above, a tenant of the other house gives notice of his desire to have the freehold or an extended lease under this Part of this Act, the landlord, not later than two months afterwards, may give him written

Provided that if the tenant is seeking to acquire the freehold, this subsection shall apply only if his notice is given after the original term date of the tenancy under which the said part is held.

(4) Where a tenancy has been extended under section 14 above, no long tenancy created immediately or derivatively by way of sub-demise under the tenancy shall confer on the subtenant, as against the tenant’s landlord, any right under this Part of this Act to acquire the freehold or an extended lease.

(5) Where a tenancy has been extended under section 14 above, and that tenancy and any subsequent tenancy at a low rent of property comprised in it (with or without intervening tenancies) are to be treated under section 3(3) above as a single tenancy of that property, the single tenancy shall be treated for purposes of this section as one which has been extended under section 14, and the instrument granting any such subsequent tenancy shall make provision in accordance with subsection (4) above.

(6) A person granting a sub-tenancy to which subsection (l)(d) above will apply, or negotiating with a view to the grant of such a sub-tenancy by him or by a person for whom he is acting as agent, shall inform the other party that the sub-tenancy is to be derived out of a tenancy extended under section 14 of this Act (or one treated for purposes of this section as so extended), unless either he knows that the other party is aware of it or he himself is unaware of it.

(7) Where an instrument extending a tenancy at a low rent, or granting a further tenancy at a low rent in substitution for or in continuance of such a tenancy, contains a statement to the effect that the tenancy is being or has been previously extended under this Part of this Act, the statement shall be conclusive for purposes of this section in favour of any person not being a party to the instrument, unless the statement appears from the instrument to be untrue.

(a) includes or causes to be included in an instrument a

statement to the effect mentioned in subsection (7) above, knowing the statement to be untrue; or

(b) on an order under subsection (4) becoming final, the

notice shall cease to have effect, but section 9(4)

Leasehold Reform Act 1967 Ch. 88

or 14(2) above shall not apply to require the tenant to make any payment to the landlord in respect of costs incurred by reason of the notice;

and a notice of the tenant’s desire to have the freehold shall be of no effect if given after the making of the application and before the time referred to in paragraph (a) above or after an order under subsection (4) above has become final.

19.—(1) Where, in the case of any area which is occupied Retention of directly or indirectly under tenancies held from one landlord management (apart from property occupied by him or his licensees or for j£Jnefit the time being unoccupied), the Minister on an application made neighbour-within the two years beginning with the commencement of this hood.

Part of this Act grants a certificate that, in order to maintain adequate standards of appearance and amenity and regulate redevelopment in the area in the event of tenants acquiring the landlord’s interest in their house and premises under this Part of this Act, it is in the Minister’s opinion likely to be in the general interest that the landlord should retain powers of management in respect of the house and premises or have rights against the house and premises in respect of the benefits arising from the exercise elsewhere of his powers of management, then the High Court may, on an application made within one year of the giving of the certificate, approve a scheme giving the landlord such powers and rights as are contemplated by this subsection.

For purposes of this section “ the Minister ” means as regards areas within Wales and Monmouthshire the Secretary of State, and as regards other areas the Minister of Housing and Local Government.

(2) The Minister shall not give a certificate under this section unless he is satisfied that the applicant has, by advertisement or otherwise as may be required by the Minister, given adequate notice to persons interested, informing them of the application for a certificate and its purpose and inviting them to make representations to the Minister for or against the application within a time which appears to the Minister to be reasonable; and before giving a certificate the Minister shall consider any representations so made within that time, and if from those representations it appears to him that there is among the persons making them substantial opposition to the application, he shall afford to those opposing the application, and on the same occasion to the applicant and such (if any) as the Minister thinks fit of those in favour of the application, an opportunity to appear and be heard by a person appointed by the Minister for the purpose, and shall consider the report of that person.

(3) The Minister in considering whether to grant a certificate authorising a scheme for any area, and the High Court in

2069

PartJ

2070

Ch. 88

Leasehold Reform Act 1967

Part I considering whether to approve a scheme shall have regard primarily to the benefit likely to result from the scheme to the area as a whole (including houses likely to be acquired from the landlord under this Part of this Act), and the extent to which it is reasonable to impose, for the benefit of the area, obligations on tenants so acquiring their freeholds; but regard may also be had to the past development and present character of the area and to architectural or historical considerations, to neighbouring areas and to the circumstances generally.

(4) If, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection

(3) above, to the provision which it is practicable to make by a scheme, and to any change of circumstances since the giving of the certificate under subsection (1), the High Court think it proper so to do, then the High Court may by order—

(a) exclude from the scheme any part of the area certified

under that subsection; or

(b) declare that no scheme can be approved for the area;

and before submitting for approval a scheme for an area so certified a person may, if he sees fit, apply to the High Court for general directions as to the matters proper to be included in the scheme and for a decision whether an order should be made under paragraph (a) or (b) above.

(5) Subject to subsections (3) and (4) above, on the submission of a scheme to the High Court, the High Court shall approve the scheme either as originally submitted or with any modifications proposed or agreed to by the applicant for the scheme, if the scheme (with those modifications, if any) appears to the court to be fair and practicable and not to give the landlord a degree of control out of proportion to that previously exercised by him or to that required for the purposes of the scheme; and the High Court shall not dismiss an application for the approval of a scheme, unless either—

(a) the Court makes an order under subsection (4)

above; or

(b) in the opinion of the Court the applicant is unwilling

to agree to a suitable scheme or is not proceeding in

the matter with due despatch.

(6) A scheme under this section may make different provision for different parts of the area, and shall include provision for terminating or varying all or any of the provisions of the scheme, or excluding part of the area, if a change of circumstances makes it appropriate, or for enabling it to be done by or with the approval of the High Court.

(7) Except as provided by the scheme, the operation of a scheme under this section shall not be affected by any disposition

or devolution of the landlord’s interest in the property within Part I the area or parts of that property; but the scheme—

to) shall include provision for identifying the person who is for the purposes of the scheme to be treated as the landlord for the time being; and

(b) may include provision for transferring, or allowing the landlord for the time being to transfer, all or any of the powers and rights conferred by the scheme on the landlord for the time being to a local authority or other body, including a body constituted for the purpose.

In the following provisions of this section references to the landlord for the time being shall have effect, in relation to powers and rights transferred to a local authority or other body as contemplated by paragraph (b) above, as references to that authority or body.

(8) Without prejudice to any other provision of this section, a scheme under it may provide for all or any of the following matters: —

to) for regulating the redevelopment, use or appearance of property of which tenants have acquired the landlord’s interest under this Part of this Act; and

(b) for empowering the landlord for the time being to carry

out work for the maintenance or repair of any such property or carry out work to remedy a failure in respect of any such property to comply with the scheme, or for making the operation of any provisions of the scheme conditional on his doing so or on the provision or maintenance by him of services, facilities or amenities of any description; and

(c) for imposing on persons from time to time occupying

or interested in any such property obligations in respect of maintenance or repair of the property or of property used or enjoyed by them in common with others, or in respect of cost incurred by the landlord for the time being on any matter referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph ib) above;

(d) for the inspection from time to time of any such property on behalf of the landlord for the time being, and for the recovery by him of sums due to him under the scheme in respect of any such property by means of a charge on the property;

and the landlord for the time being shall have, for the enforcement of any charge imposed under the scheme, the same powers and remedies under the Law of Property Act 1925 and other- 1925 c. 20. wise as if he were a mortgagee by deed having powers of sale and leasing and of appointing a receiver.

Parti (9) A scheme under this section may extend to property in which the landlord’s interest is disposed of otherwise than under this Part of this Act (whether residential property or not), so as to make that property, or allow it to be made, subject to any such provision as is or might be made by the scheme for property in which tenants acquire the landlord’s interest under this Part of this Act.

(10) A certificate given or scheme approved under this section 1925 c. 22. shall be registered under the Land Charges Act 1925 as a local

land charge; and where a scheme is so registered—

(b) in relation to a house and premises in the area section

10 above shall have effect subject to the provisions of the scheme, and the price payable under section 9 shall be adjusted accordingly.

(b) that the applicants are willing to be bound by any

scheme to co-operate in the management of their property in those areas and in the administration of the scheme;

the Minister may give a certificate under this section for those areas as a whole; and where a certificate is given by virtue of this subsection, this section shall apply accordingly, but so that any scheme made by virtue of the certificate shall be made subject to conditions (enforceable in such manner as may be provided by the scheme) for securing that the landlords and their successors co-operate as aforesaid.

(13) Where it appears to the Minister—

(a) that a certificate could be given under this section for any area or areas on the application of the landlord or landlords; and

(14) Where a certificate under this section has been given for an area, or an application for one is pending, then subject to subsection (15) below if (before or after the making of the application or the giving of the certificate) a tenant of a house in the area gives notice of his desire to have the freehold under this Part of this Act,—

(a) no further proceedings need be taken in relation to the

notice beyond those which appear to the landlord to be reasonable in the circumstances; but

(1) above, then those having the appropriate interests in separate parts thereof shall instead grant the tenancy; and where it is necessary in accordance with this sub-paragraph for more than one landlord to join in granting the new tenancy, the lease shall have effect in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) above, but as if they had been jointly entitled to their interests and had become separately entitled by assignments taking effect immediately after the lease.

(4) The lease shall give effect to section 15(2) of this Act on the basis that the references there to the landlord include the landlord granting the new tenancy, the immediate landlord of whom the new tenancy will be held and any intermediate landlord, and shall give effect to section 15(3) on the basis that account is to be taken of obligations imposed on any of those landlords by virtue of the new tenancy or any superior tenancy; and section 16(4) of this Act shall apply on the basis that the reference there to the tenant's landlord includes the immediate landlord of whom the new tenancy will be held and all superior landlords, including any superior to the landlord granting the new tenancy.

11.—(1) Where a tenancy in the house and premises superior to the tenancy in possession is vested in the claimant or a trustee for him, the lease under section 14 of this Act shall include an actual surrender of that superior tenancy without a re-grant, and it shall accordingly be disregarded for purposes of paragraph 10 above.

(2) Where, apart from this provision, the effect of the lease under section 14 of this Act would be, as regards any tenancy superior to the new tenancy,—

(a) that the rent payable under-that superior tenancy would be

equal to or more than the rent payable under the tenancy on which it would be in immediate reversion (regard being had to the operation of this sub-paragraph in relation to any other tenancy); or

(b) that the difference between those rents would not be more than four pounds a year;

then the person entitled to that superior tenancy may by written notice given to his immediate landlord and, if neither of them is the reversioner, to the reversioner require that the lease shall include an actual surrender by him of his tenancy without a re-grant.

(3) Any person entitled to a tenancy superior to the new tenancy may by the like notice require that the lease shall confer on him the right to surrender his tenancy if by reason of any revision of the rent payable under the claimant's new tenancy (together with any consequent surrender under this provision of tenancies intermediate between the superior tenancy and that new tenancy) the rent payable under the superior tenancy will not thereafter be less by more than four pounds a year than the rent payable under the tenancy on which it will be in immediate reversion.

(4) Where a landlord required apart from this sub-paragraph (or by virtue of this sub-paragraph as it operates in relation to another landlord) to grant the new tenancy would do so by virtue of a tenancy in respect of which he claims, by the like notice, to have the benefit of sub-paragraph (2) or (3) above, he shall for purposes of paragraph 10 above be replaced, subject to any further operation of this sub-paragraph, by the next superior landlord.

(5) References in this paragraph to the rent payable under a tenancy mean, in relation to a tenancy comprising property other than the house and premises, so much of that rent as is apportionable to the house and premises, and any surrender or provision for the surrender of such a tenancy in accordance with this paragraph shall be limited to the house and premises.

12.—(1) No provision of any tenancy prohibiting, restricting or otherwise relating to a sub-demise by the tenant shall have effect with reference to any lease executed to give effect to section 14 of this Act.

(2) Where by reason of section 14(4) proviso of this Act it is necessary to make any payment to discharge the house and premises from a charge affecting the interest of any landlord, the reversioner, if he is not the landlord liable or primarily liable in respect of the charge, shall not be required to make that payment otherwise than out of money made available for the purpose by that landlord, and it shall be the duty of that landlord to provide for the charge being discharged.

13. —(1) For purposes of this Schedule the expectation of possession carried by a tenancy is the expectation which it carries at the relevant time of possession after the tenancy in possession, on the basis that—

(a) subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, the tenancy in possession terminates at the relevant time if its term date fell before then, or else terminates at its term date or (in the case of a tenancy which has been extended) its original term date; and

(b) a tenancy other than the tenancy in possession terminates at its term date.

(2) In a case where before the relevant time the claimant's immediate landlord had given notice to quit terminating the tenancy in possession at a date earlier than the term date, the date specified in the notice to quit shall be substituted for the date in sub-paragraph (lXfl) above.

14. —(1) This Schedule shall apply notwithstanding that the tenancy in possession is a tenancy from the Crown within the meaning of section 33 of this Act; and, where under section 33(1 Xft) the appropriate authority gives notice that as regards a Crown interest the authority will grant or concur in granting the freehold or an extended lease, then in relation to the Crown interest and the person to whom it belongs this Schedule shall have effect as it has effect in relation

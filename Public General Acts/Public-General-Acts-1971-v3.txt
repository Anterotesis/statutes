70.—(1) An industrial development certificate in respect of any development may be issued subject to such restrictions on the making of an application for planning permission for that development (whether as to the period within which, or the persons by whom, such an application may be made, or otherwise) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate having regard to the proper distribution of industry; and where an industrial development certificate in respect of any development is issued subject to any such restrictions, and an application for planning permission for that development is made which does not comply with those restrictions, file provisions of section 67 of this Act shall apply in relation to that application as if no such certificate had been issued.

(2) Without prejudice to subsection (1) of this section, an industrial development certificate may be issued either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate having regard to the proper distribution of industry; and any reference in this section to conditions attached to an industrial development certificate is a reference to conditions subject to which such a certificate is issued.

(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) of this section, conditions may be attached to an industrial development certificate—

in section 85 of this Act) to be contained in any building to which the certificate relates, or precluding it from containing any office floor space (as so defined);

(6) Planning permission to which subsection (5) of this section applies shall not be invalid by reason only that the requirements of that subsection are not complied with; but where any such planning permission is granted without complying with the requirements of that subsection the planning permission shall be deemed to have been granted subject to the conditions attached to the industrial development certificate, or (if any other conditions were imposed by the authority granting the permission) to have been granted subject to the conditions attached to the certificate in addition to the other conditions.

71.—(1) This section applies to any condition subject to which Provisions as planning permission is granted in accordance with the provisions to conditions of section 70 of this Act, or subject to which planning permission ^§£^70 is by virtue of that section deemed to have been granted, whether it is a condition which could have been imposed apart from that section or not.

Provision for cases where certificate withheld.

72.—(1) Where such an application as is mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) of section 67 of this Act is, by virtue of those subsections, of no effect by reason that the requirements of those subsections are not fulfilled, the local planning authority shall consider whether, if those requirements had been fulfilled, they would nevertheless have refused the permission sought by the application, either in respect of the whole or in respect of part of the land to which the application relates; and if they are of the opinion that they would so have refused that permission, they shall serve on the applicant a notice in writing to that effect.

(2) Where a notice is served under subsection (1) of this section in respect of the whole or part of any land, it shall operate, for the purposes of sections 38 and 39 of this Act, as if the application for planning permission had been an effective application and the notice had been a planning decision of the local planning authority refusing that permission in respect of that land or that part thereof, as the case may be; and the provisions of those sections (if in those circumstances they would have been applicable) shall have effect accordingly.

of this section (in addition to any other conditions imposed by Part IV the authority granting the permission).

(3) The said condition is that the use of the building, whether as originally erected or as subsequently extended or altered, shall be restricted so that (whether in consequence of a change of use or otherwise) it does not at any time contain office premises having an aggregate office floor space which exceeds the prescribed exemption limit.

(2) If the case is the following, that is to say—

to which these provisions (or Part I of the Act of 1965) applied, or it was such development but no office development permit was required for it; and

(b) either the proposed alteration or extension is not

development to which these provisions apply or it is such development but no office development permit is required for it; and

(c) there will result from the proposed alteration or exten-

the planning permission for the alteration or extension shall be granted subject to the condition specified in subsection (3) of this section (in addition to any other conditions imposed by the authority granting the permission). 3

(3) The said condition is that the use of the building as altered or extended, or as subsequently further altered or extended, shall be restricted so that (whether in consequence of

boogie

1794

c. 78

Town and Country Planning Act

Part IV a change of use or otherwise) it does not at any time contain office premises having an aggregate office floor space which exceeds the prescribed exemption limit.

(4) In the following two cases this section shall not apply—

{a) where the planning permission is in respect of a building which, after its alteration or extension, will be wholly residential; and

(b) where the planning permission is subject to conditions by virtue of section 70(5) or (6) of this Act and those conditions either restrict the office floor space which the building as extended or altered may contain or preclude it from containing any office floor space.

Planning 80.—(1) The provisions of this section shall have effect with

permission respect to any planning permission for development involving f?the erection of two or more buildings on land which is within morebSdings a contr°Ued area when the planning permission is granted and where no office was also within such an area when the application for planning development permission was made, except in a case where all the buildings

, are exempt from this section, required.

(2) Any one of the said buildings shall be exempt from this section if—

(a) it is wholly residential; or

(b) the planning permission is subject to conditions by

virtue of section 70(5) or (6) of this Act and those conditions either restrict the office floor space which the building may contain or preclude it from containing any office floor space.

(3) If the aggregate floor space of the buildings proposed to be erected (leaving out of account any which are exempt from this section) is twice, or more than twice, the prescribed exemption limit, and either the erection of the buildings is not development to which these provisions apply or it is such development but no office development permit is required for it, the planning permission shall be granted subject to the condition specified in subsection (4) of this section (in addition to any other conditions imposed by the authority granting the permission). 4

(4) The said condition is that the use of each one of the buildings (excluding any which are exempt from this section) shall be restricted so that (whether in consequence of a change of use or otherwise) it does not at any time contain office premises having an aggregate floor space which exceeds the limit for that building specified in the condition, which limit shall (subject to subsection (5) of this section) be a floor space

Town and Country Planning Act 1971

c. 78

1795

bearing such proportion to the building’s total floor space as Part IV the prescribed exemption limit bears to the aggregate floor space of all the buildings (excluding any which are exempt from this section) for whose erection the planning permission is granted.

(5) The authority granting the planning permission may in doing so specify in the said condition, as it applies to any building, a limit differing from the one provided by subsection (4) of this section, but not so that the total of the limits for all the buildings to which the condition applies exceeds the prescribed exemption limit.

(6) If after the grant of the planning permission a further application for planning permission is made in respect of all or any of the buildings to which the condition specified in subsection (4) of this section applies, and the further application involves a departure from the terms of the said condition as applying to any building, the application shall be subject to section 74(1) of this Act notwithstanding anything in these provisions exempting development from the requirements of that section in particular cases.

81.—(1) Any planning permission with respect to which Provisions section 78, 79 or 80 of this Act has effect shall not be invalid suPPl0-by reason only that the requirements of section 78(2), 79(2) 80.

or 80(3) of this Act, as the case may be, are not complied with; but in that case the planning permission shall be deemed to have been granted subject to the condition specified in section 78(3), 79(3) or 80(4) of this Act, as the case may be, or (if any other conditions are imposed by the authority granting the permission) to have been granted subject to the condition so specified in addition to the other conditions, and references in those sections to a condition imposed thereunder shall be construed accordingly as including references to a condition deemed to be imposed.

(2) In sections 78,79 and 80 of this Act—

“controlled area” means an area to which these provisions apply, or, as respects any time before the commencement of this Act, Part I of the Act of 1965 applied;

82.—(1) This section applies to any condition subject to which planning permission is granted in accordance with these provisions or subject to which planning permission is by virtue of these provisions deemed to have been granted, whether or not it is a condition which could have been imposed apart from these provisions.

(2) If the planning permission is or was granted by the local planning authority, the Secretary of State shall not be required to entertain an appeal under section 36 of this Act from the decision of the local planning authority, in so far as that decision relates or related to any condition to which this section applies.

(3) Where planning permission is granted subject to a condition to which this section applies, and it appears to the authority granting the permission that the condition could have been imposed apart from these provisions and would have been imposed if these provisions had not been enacted, the decision granting the permission may include a certificate to that effect; and, where such a certificate is included in a decision of the local planning authority—

2027

(b) the holder and the Central Land Board agreed that a development charge determined by the Board should be set off against any payment which might thereafter become payable to the holder by reference to that holding; or

(c) the Central Land Board refrained from determining a development charge, which would otherwise have fallen to be determined by them, in consideration of a mortgage of the holding, with or without other claim holdings.

(2) All pledges of claim holdings to the Central Land Board made by the same person, whether or not made at the same time, other than any pledge to which paragraph 2(1) of this Schedule applies, shall for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule be treated collectively as a single pledge made at the time when the last of those pledges was made.

(3) Where a development charge covered by a pledge to the Central Land Board was determined in respect of land consisting of, or forming part of, the area of a claim holding—

(a) which was not comprised in the pledge ; but

(b) whose holder immediately before the time of completion was the person who would, apart from the pledge, have been liable to pay the unpaid balance of the development charge,

then, for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, that claim holding shall be deemed to have been comprised in the pledge.

(4) In this Part of this Schedule references to the determination of a development charge in respect of any land are references to a determination of the Central Land Board that the charge was payable in respect of the carrying out of operations in, on, over or under that land, or in respect of the use of that land.

(5) For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule the amount of a development charge—

(a) in a case where the Central Land Board determined that

amount as a single capital payment, shall be taken to have been the amount of that payment; and

Sch. 15 (6) In relation to the pledging of a claim holding to the Central

Land Board, references in this Part of this Schedule to a development charge covered by the pledge are references to a development charge the payment of which was secured, or partly secured, by the pledge, or, as the case may be, which was agreed to be set off against any payment which might become payable by reference to that claim holding.

(7) References in this Part of this Schedule to a mortgage of a claim holding do not include a mortgage which was subsequently discharged.

2. —(1) Where a claim holding was pledged to the Central Land Board in accordance with the special arrangements relating to owners of single house plots, that claim holding shall, subject to sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, be deemed to have been extinguished as from the time when it was pledged to the Board.

(2) Where a claim holding (in this sub-paragraph referred to as “ the original holding ”) was pledged as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph but was so pledged by reference to a plot of land which did not extend to the whole of the area of the original holding, that sub-paragraph shall not apply, but there shall be deemed to have been substituted for the original holding, as from the time of the pledge, a claim holding with an area consisting of so much of the area of the original holding as was not comprised in that plot of land, and with a value equal to that fraction of the value of the original holding which then attached to so much of the area of the original holding as was not comprised in that plot.

3. Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Schedule, where a pledge to the Central Land Board comprised one or more claim holdings, and the unpaid balance of the development charge covered by the pledge, or (if more than one) the aggregate of the unpaid balances of the development charges so covered, was equal to or greater than the value of the claim holding, or the aggregate value of the claim holdings, as the case may be, the holding or holdings shall be deemed to have been extinguished as from the time of the pledge.

4. Where a pledge to the Central Land Board comprised only a single claim holding with an area of which every part either consisted of, or formed part of, the land in respect of which some development charge covered by the pledge was determined, and paragraph 3 of this Schedule does not apply, the value of that claim holding shall be deemed to have been reduced, as from the time of the pledge, by the unpaid balance of the development charge covered by the pledge, or (if more than one) by the aggregate of the unpaid balances of all the development charges covered by the pledge.

5. —(1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect in the case of a pledge of one or more claim holdings to the Central Land Board to which neither paragraph 3 nor paragraph 4 of this Schedule applies.

(3) Any claim holding comprised in the pledge with an area part of which did, and part of which did not, consist of, or form part of, such land as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall be treated as if, at the time of the pledge, the claim holding (in this sub-paragraph referred to as “ the parent holding ”) had been divided into two separate claim holdings, that is to say—

(a) a claim holding with an area consisting of so much of the area of the parent holding as consisted of, or formed part of, such land as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, and with a value equal to that fraction of the value of the parent holding which then attached to that part of the area of the parent holding; and

(b) a claim holding with an area consisting of the residue of the area of the parent holding, and with a value equal to that fraction of the value of the parent holding which then attached to the residue of the area of the parent holding,

and the claim holding referred to in head (a) of this sub-paragraph shall be allocated to the development charge in question, or (if more than one) to those development charges collectively.

(4) Paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 of this Schedule shall then apply in relation to each claim holding (if any) allocated in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) or sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph to any development charge, or to any development charges collectively, as if the pledge had comprised only that claim holding and had covered only that development charge or those development charges.

(5) If, after the application of the preceding provisions of this paragraph, there remains outstanding any claim holding not allocated in accordance with those provisions, or any claim holding which (having been so allocated) is deemed to have been reduced in value but not extinguished, an amount equal to the aggregate of—

(a) the unpaid balance of any development charge covered by the pledge to which no claim holding was so allocated; and

(b) the amount (if any) by which the value of any claim holding

so allocated which is deemed to have been extinguished falls short of the unpaid balance of the development charge, or the aggregate of the unpaid balances of the development charges, to which it was so allocated.

Sch. 15

Part n

Adjustment by Reference to Payments in Respect of War-Damaged Land

6. —(1) The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect where a payment under the scheme has become, or becomes payable in respect of an interest in land, and a claim holding related (or would, apart from this Part of this Schedule, have related) to the like interest in the whole or part of that land, with or without any other land.

(2) In this Part of this Schedule “ the scheme ” means the scheme made under section 59 of the Act of 1947, “the date of the scheme” means 12th December 1949, and “payment under the scheme ” means a payment which has become, or becomes, payable by virtue of the scheme.

7. If the payment area is identical with the area of the claim holding, then—

(a) in the case of a payment of an amount equal to the value of the claim holding, the claim holding shall be deemed to have been extinguished as from the date of the scheme;

(b) in the case of a payment of an amount less than the value of the claim holding, the value of the claim holding shall be deemed to have been reduced, as from the date of the scheme, by the amount of the payment.

8. —(1) If the payment area forms part of the area of the claim holding, the holding (in this paragraph referred to as “the parent holding”) shall be treated, as from the date of the scheme, as having been divided into two claim holdings, that is to say—

(a) a claim holding with an area consisting of that part of the area of the parent holding which constituted the payment area, and with a value equal to that fraction of the value of the parent holding which attached to that part of the area of the parent holding ; and

(b) a claim holding with an area consisting of the residue of the area of the parent holding, and with a value equal to that fraction of the value of the parent holding which attached to the residue of the area of the parent holding.

(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph applies, paragraph 7 of this Schedule shall have effect in relation to die claim holding referred to in sub-paragraph (l)(a) of this paragraph as if it were the parent holding.

9. If the payment area includes the area of the claim holding together with other land, paragraph 7 of this Schedule shall apply as if—

(a) the payment area had been identical with the area of the claim holding; but

(b) the amount of the payment had been so much of the actual amount thereof, as might reasonably be expected to have been attributed to the area of the claim holding if, under the scheme, the authority determining the amount of the payment had been required (in accordance with the same principles as applied to the determination of that amount) to apportion it between the area of the claim holding and the rest of the payment area.

10. If the payment area includes part of the area of the claim holding together with other land not comprised in the area of the claim holding—

(a) paragraph 8 of this Schedule shall apply as if the part of the

payment area comprised in the area of the claim holding had been the whole of the payment area ; and

(b) paragraph 9 of this Schedule shall apply as if the part of the area of the claim holding comprised in the payment area had been the whole of the area of the claim holding.

Part in

Adjustment in cases of Partial Disposition of Claim Holdings

11. The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect where, by virtue of a disposition of part of the benefit of an established claim, not being a mortgage made otherwise than by way of assignment (in this Part of this Schedule referred to as “ the relevant disposition ”), different persons became entitled to different parts of the benefit of that established claim.

12. As from the date of the relevant disposition, each of those different parts shall be treated as having constituted a separate claim holding.

13. The area and value of any such separate claim holding at any time after the relevant dispositon shall be taken to have been such as may, in the requisite manner, be or have been determined to be just and appropriate in all the circumstances.

(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, where a claim holding representing part only of the benefit of an established claim was pledged to the Central Land Board, otherwise than as mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Schedule, and by virtue of Part I of this Schedule the value of that claim holding is deemed to have been reduced by reference to an amount due by way of development charge, the value of that holding at the time of the pledge is not to be taken to have been less than the amount credited for the purposes of the pledge by reference to the holding.

(4) In the case of the claim holding representing the part of the benefit of an established claim which was the subject of the relevant disposition, if it was not a claim holding to which sub-paragraph (5) of this paragraph applies—

(a) the area of that claim holding is to be taken to be the claim

area of that established claim, less the area of any claim holding to which the said sub-paragraph (5) applies which represents part of the benefit of the same established claim; and

(b) the value of the claim holding immediately after the relevant disposition is, subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, to be taken to have been that part of the amount of the established claim to which the holder purported to become entitled under the terms of the relevant disposition.

( [b) became entitled to both that holding and that interest in such circumstances that the authority making the apportionment in question or the Lands Tribunal, as the case may be, were or are satisfied that the holding and the interest were intended to relate to one another, the area of that claim holding is to be taken to be that part of the claim area, and the value of the holding immediately after the relevant disposition (however that or any other disposition affecting the holding was expressed, but subject to sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) of this paragraph) is to be taken to have been an amount equal to so much of the amount of the established claim as might reasonably be expected to have been attributed to that part of the claim area if the authority determining the amount of that established claim had been required to apportion it, in accordance with the same principles as applied to its determination, between that part and the residue of the claim area.

16. Paragraph 1 of this Schedule shall apply for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule as it applies for the purposes of Part I thereof.

(b) the payment (whatever its amount) became or becomes payable under Case D (that is to say, by virtue of section 8 of the Act of 1954, which related to cases where a claim holding had been disposed of for valuable consideration),

the claim holding shall be deemed to have been extinguished; and if the principal amount of the payment (not being a payment under Case D) was or is less than the value of the claim holding, the value of that holding shall be deemed to have been reduced by the principal amount of the payment.

19. Paragraph 18 of this Schedule shall apply where two or more payments under Part I of the Act of 1954 were or are payable in respect of the same claim holding, with the substitution, for references to the principal amount of the payment, of references to the aggregate of the principal amounts of the payments.

(c) where in accordance with subsection (3) of section 14 or subsection (6) of section 58 of the Act of 1954 (which provided for cases of failure to apply for a payment within the appropriate period) an amount was determined as being the principal amount of a payment to which a person would have been entitled as mentioned in those subsections respectively, that payment shall be treated as if it had become due and as if the principal amount thereof had been the amount so determined.

22. —(1) Where in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule a claim holding is deemed to have been extinguished or the value of a claim holding is deemed to to have been reduced, the extinguishment or reduction, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have had effect immediately before the time of completion.

Town and Country Planning Act

c. 78

2037

(b) on the assumption that (apart from the provisions of Part Sch. 16

in of this Act, the provisions of Part ffl of the Act of 1962 or the provisions of the Act of 1947, as the case may be) the development could at that time lawfully be carried out,

and shall be taken to be the difference between the value which in those circumstances the land would have had at that time if planning permission for that development had been granted unconditionally immediately before that time' and die value which in those circumstances the land would have had at that time if planning permission for that development had been applied for and refused immediately before that time, and it could be assumed that planning permission for that development, and any other new development of that land, would be refused on any subsequent application.

3. If the development involved the clearing of any land, the reference in paragraph (2Xu) of this Schedule to the state of the land immediately before the development shall be construed as a reference to the state of the land immediately after the clearing thereof but before the carrying out of any other operations.

4. -—(l) If the development was initiated in pursuance of planning permission granted subject to conditions, paragraph 2 of this Schedule shall apply as if the reference to the granting of permission unconditionally were a reference to the granting of permission subject to the like conditions.

(2) If the permission referred to in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph was granted subject to conditions which consisted of, or included, a requirement expressed by reference to a specified period, the reference in that sub-paragraph to the like conditions shall be construed, in relation to the condition imposing that requirement, as a reference to a condition imposing the like requirement in respect of a period of like duration beginning at the time in question.

5. In the application of the preceding provisions of this Schedule to development initiated, but not completed, before the time in question, references to permission for that development shall be construed as references to permission for so much of that development as had been carried out before that time.

(b) that any rentcharge charged on that area is charged on the whole of it.

(3) Any area of the relevant land which has an unexpended balance of established development value and which complies with the conditions set out in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph is in this Schedule referred to, in relation to the interests subsisting therein, as “the relevant area”, and the subsequent provisions of this Schedule shall have effect separately in relation to each relevant area.

Preliminary calculations

2. There shall be calculated the amount referable to the relevant area of the rent which might reasonably be expected to be reserved if the relevant land were to be let on terms prohibiting the carrying out of any new development but permitting the carrying out of any other development; and the amount so calculated is in this Schedule referred to as “ the existing use rent

3. —(1) If, in the case of an interest in fee simple which is subject to a rentcharge, or in the case of a tenancy, so much of the rent reserved under the rentcharge or tenancy as is referable to the relevant area exceeds the existing use rent, there shall be calculated the capital value of the right to receive, for the period of the remainder of the term of the rentcharge or tenancy, an annual payment equal to the excess ; and any amount so calculated in the case of any interest is in this Schedule referred to as “ the rental liability ” of that interest.

(2) Where the interest in fee simple is subject to more than one rentcharge, then, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, in relation to any period included in the term of two or more of those rentcharges, those two or more rentcharges shall be treated as a single rentcharge charged on the relevant area for the duration of that period, with a rent reserved thereunder of an amount equal to the aggregate of so much of their respective rents as is referable to the relevant area.

4. In the case of any interest in reversion—

(a) there shall be calculated the capital value, as at the time immediately before the relevant date, of the right to receive a sum equal to the unexpended balance of established development value of the relevant area at that time, but payable at the end of the tenancy upon the termination of

which the interest in question is immediately expectant; and the amount so calculated in the case of any interest is in this Schedule referred to as “ the reversionary development value ” of that interest;

(b) if so much of the rent reserved under the said tenancy as is referable to the relevant area exceeds the existing use rent, there shall also be calculated the capital value as at the said time of the right to receive, for the period of the remainder of the term of that tenancy, an annual payment equal to the excess; and any amount so determined in the case of any interest is in this Schedule referred to as “the rental increment ” of that interest.

Apportionment of unexpended balance between interests

5. Where two or more interests (other than excepted interests) subsist in the relevant area, the portion of the unexpended balance of established development value of the relevant area attributable to each of those interests respectively shall be taken to be the following, that is to say—

(a)in the case of the interest in fee simple, an amount equal to the reversionary development value of that interest, less the amount (if any) by which any rental liability of that interest exceeds any rental increment thereof;

(b) in the case of a tenancy in reversion, an amount equal to the reversionary development value of that tenancy, less the aggregate of—

(i) the reversionary development value of the interest in reversion immediately expectant upon the termination of that tenancy ; and

(ii) the amount (if any) by which any rental liability of that tenancy exceeds any rental increment thereof;

(c) in the case of a tenancy other than a tenancy in reversion,

the remainder (if any) of the said balance after the deduction of the aggregate of—

(i) the reversionary development value of the interest in reversion immediately expectant upon the termination of that tenancy ; and

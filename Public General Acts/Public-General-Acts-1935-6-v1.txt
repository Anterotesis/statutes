Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the extent aforesaid shall be written off from the' assets of the Local Loans Fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

4. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in-

the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works

Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1991, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said Loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan

Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees aa defined in clause three of the said memorandum was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan,

(2) If it is shown by the income account of the

Local Loans Fund for the financial year beginning on the first day of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, or any subsequent financial year, that the income exceeds the expenditure, the excess shall, instead of being carried to the separate account mentioned in subsection (3) of section four of the Public Works Loans Act, 1897, be credited to the capital account of the said Fund; and accordingly the said subsection (3) is hereby repealed.

Standard Basis of Prescribed Rates and

Adjustments in respect of Variations

THEREFROM.

Definitions.

1. For the purposes of this Schedule the following expressions have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say:—

“Duty advantage ” means, subject as hereinafter provided,

the amount by which the excise duty chargeable in respect of a hundredweight of sugar of any polarisation wholly manufactured from home-grown beet is less than the full rate of customs duty chargeable in respect of a hundredweight of imported foreign sugar of that polarisation, so, however, that the duty advantage

1936.

Sugar Industry

(Reorganization )' Act, 1936.

Ch. 18.

561

shall be computed as if the full rate of customs duty chargeable on foreign sugar were, in the case of sugar of a polarisation exceeding ninety-eight degrees but not exceeding ninety-nine degrees a rate of eight shillings and ninepence and six-tenths of a penny per hundredweight, and, in the, case of sugar of a polarisation exceeding ninety-nine degrees a rate of nine shillings and fourpence per hundredweight:

Provided that, if before the making of any order determining the prescribed rate for any year any change in the rates of excise duty or of customs duty respectively chargeable on sugar has been made since the determination of the prescribed rate then in operation, the Minister may by order made with the consent of the Treasury make such modifications in the foregoing definition as may be necessary to correspond with the change;

“ Appropriate percentage” means such percentage as may be determined in accordance with rules made under this Act, so, however, that the percentage for any year shall be determined by reference to the effect which variations in the factors that under the Sugar Refining Agreement determine the maximum quota income, would have had on the total income of the Corporation, if the Corporation had in that year sold the maximum amount of white sugar consistent with the terms of that agreement.

Standard Conditions.

2 . The standard conditions upon the basis of which the prescribed rate for every year is to be determined are the following conditions, that is to say :—

(a) that the duty advantage in respect of sugar of any polarisation will be of the same amount as that which exists when the prescribed rate is determined;

(b) that the average raw sugar price for each week in the year will in the case of the year beginning on the first day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-six be four shillings and sixpence, and in the case of any subsequent year be a price equal to the estimate thereof specified in the order determining the prescribed rate for the year;

(c) that the quantity of sugar manufactured by the

Corporation in Great Britain from home-grown beet received by it in the year will be the standard quantity;

(d) that the maximum quota income for the year will be of an amount equal to the estimate thereof specified in the order determining the prescribed rate for that year.

Adjustments in prescribed rates in respect of variations from the standard conditions.

3. In determining the effective rates of assistance in force under this Act the following adjustments shall be made in respect of Variations from the standard conditions :—

(i) If in any week in which sugar is manufactured from home-grown beet the amount of the duty advantage in respect of sugar of any polarisation exceeds or falls short of the amount of that advantage when the prescribed rate in operation was determined, the effective rate of assistance payable in respect of sugar of that polarisation so manufactured in that week shall be calculated as if the standard rate in the case of sugar of that polarisation had been decreased or increased by one-tenth of' a penny for each complete- tenth of a

penny by which the duty advantage exceeds or falls short of the duty advantage when the prescribed rate was determined:

(ii) If in any week in which sugar is manufactured from homegrown beet the average raw sugar price for that week exceeds or falls short of the estimated rate specified in the order determining the prescribed rate for the year, the effective rates of assistance payable in respect of sugar so manufactured in that week shall be calculated as if the prescribed rate had been decreased or increased by one-tenth of a penny for each complete one-tenth of a penny by which the said average price exceeds or falls short of the said estimated rate: #

(iii) If the quantity of white sugar equal to the quantity of sugar manufactured by the Corporation in Great Britain from home-grown beet received by it in any year falls short of the standard quantity by seven and one-lralf per cent, or fhore, the total amount of assistance payable in respect of sugar manufactured from,

home-grown beet received by it in that year shall be calculated—

(a) where the quantity has fallen short by less than fifteen per cent., as if the prescribed rate had been increased by one penny;

(b) where the quantity has fallen short by fifteen per cent, or more, as if the prescribed rate had been increased by twopence:

(iv) If the maximum quota income for any year exceeds or 4t Sea.

falls short of the estimate thereof specified in the order coni *

determining the prescribed rate for that year, there shall be deducted from or added to the total amount of assistance payable in respect of sugar manufactured from home-grown beet received by the Corporation in that year, an amount which, subject as hereinafter provided, shall be equal to the appropriate percentage of the difference between the maximum quota income and the said estimate:

Provided that, if in respect of any year the Treasury after consultation with the Commission are satisfied that the addition of an amount equal to the said appropriate percentage would be insufficient to enable the Corporation to earn profits equivalent to such rates

' of interest as the Treasury consider reasonable having regard to the circumstances existing when the adjustment under this paragraph is to be made, then, the amount to he added to the total amount of assistance,

aforesaid shall be such as the Minister may with the consent of the Treasury think fit not exceeding the amount by which the total income of the Corporation has been diminished by reason of the variations by reference to the effect of which the appropriate percentage was determined.

FIFTH SCHEDULE. Section 15.

Calculation of Supplementary Payments *

The amount of the supplementary payment payable in respect of poverty of the crop of home-grown beet in any year shall be calculated in the manner following, that is to say, —

to) there Shall be ascertained the quantity of white sugar equal to the quantity of sugar manufactured by the

Corporation in Great Britain from home-grown beet received by it in the year;

(6) there shall be deducted from or added to the amount of assistance payable in respect of the quantity of sugar so manufactured as aforesaid, an amount equal to that by which, the assistance was Increased or decreased in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraphs (iii)

and (iv) of paragraph 3 of the Fourth Schedule to this Act and there shall be calculated the rate per hundredweight of white sugar obtained by dividing the sum so

ascertained by an amount equal to the quantity ascertained under paragraph (a) of this Schedule;

(c) there shall be ascertained the additional sum which would have been payable to the Corporation if assistance at the rate calculated under the last foregoing paragraph had been payable on an additional quantity of sugar equal to the difference between the quantity ascertained under paragraph (a) of this Schedule and the standard quantity;

and, subject as hereinafter provided, the amount of the supplementary payment shall be such as the Minister, after consultation with the Commission, considers equitable, having regard to the extent to which the crop has been affected by adverse farming conditions, not exceeding a sum equal to one-half of the amount ascertained under paragraph (c) of this Schedule:

Provided that the amount of the supplementary payment in respect of any year shall not exceed a maximum equal to one shilling for every ton of home-grown beet received by the

Corporation in that year under the contracts entered into in accordance with the provisions of section five of this Act; so,

however, that for the purposes of calculating that- maximum in relation to beet of which the sugar content is greater or less than fifteen and one-half per cent, the said sum of one shilling shall be subject to an addition or deduction of such amount as the Minister, having regard to the contracts aforesaid, may determine after consultation with the Commission.

(ii) if the securities are of such a character that the interest payable in respect thereof may be paid without deduction of tax, the owner shall be chargeable to tax at the standard rate under Case VI of Schedule D in respect of the interest which is deemed to be his income as aforesaid, unless he shows that it has borne tax at the standard rate.

(2) The references in subsection (1) of this section to buying back or re-acquiring the securities shall be deemed to include references to buying or acquiring similar securities, so, however, that where similar securities are bought or acquired, the owner shall be under no greater liability to tax than he would have been under if the original securities had been bought back or re-acquired.

Part X (2) The said percentage is such percentage as may be deter-—com. mined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to be appro-

priate to be applied for the purposes of this section in relation to machinery or plant of the class in question for the year of assessment in question:

Provided that it shall not be necessary for the said Commissioners to redetermine every such percentage yearly, and any determination of a percentage under this subsection for any year of assessment shall apply also to subsequent years except so far as it is superseded by any subsequent determination.

(3) In determining the said percentage in relation to machinery or plant of any class, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall have regard to the anticipated normal working life of machinery or plant of that class and shall select the percentage which in their opinion may fairly be taken as that which, if applied year by year throughout that life as a writing down percentage applicable, in the first year to the cost of such machinery or plant, in the second year to that cost as written down in the first year, in the third year to that cost as written down in the first and second years, and so on, would, at the end of that life, have caused that cost to be written down to one-tenth thereof.

(4) If, in the case of machinery or plant of any class—

(a) annual allowances for the year 1948-49 were commonly

arrived at by applying five-fourths of some percentage—

(i) in the case of the first year, to the cost of the machinery or plant; and

(ii) in the case of subsequent years, to a sum less than that cost; and

(b) a particular percentage was commonly in use for so arriving at those allowances,

that percentage shall, except where the Commissioners of Inland Revenue determined, in connection with die year 1949-50, that it was no longer an appropriate percentage, be deemed to be a percentage determined by diem in relation to machinery or plant of that class under subsection (2) of this section for the year 1949-50, and the said subsection (2), including the proviso thereto, shall have effect accordingly; and if it is shown to t}ie satisfaction of the said Commissioners that that percentage, if applied as a writing down percentage in the manner specified in subsection (3) of this section, would, at the end of the anticipated normal working life of the machinery or plant of that class (estimated as if during the year 1948-49), cause the cost to be written down to a fraction thereof which is smaller than one-tenth, the said subsection (3) shall have effect in relation to

machinery or plant of that class as if a reference to that smaller Part X faction were substituted therein for a reference to one-tenth. —cont.

In this subsection, and in the following provisions of this Chapter, “ the first year ” means the year of the acquisition of the machinery or plant or other the first year for which an annual allowance could be made to the person in question in respect of the machinery or plant.

(5) If, in the case of any machinery or plant not falling within any class with respect to which a determination of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue has been or is deemed to have been made under subsection (2) of this section for the year of assessment in question—

(a) a percentage was in use for determining the annual allowance in respect thereof for the year 1948-49; and

(6) that percentage is one which, multiplied by five-fourths, was intended to be applied to an amount which, except in the case of the first year, is less than the cost of providing the machinery or plant,

that percentage, or. if the Commissioners of Inland Revenue determine, as respects any year of assessment, that that percentage is no longer an appropriate percentage, such other percentage as the said Commissioners may determine, shall be deemed, in relation to that machinery or plant, to be a percentage determined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under the aid subsection (2) for the year 1949-50 or the year as respects which the determination is made, as the case may be, and the said subsection (2), including the proviso thereto, shall, in relation to that machinery or plant, have effect accordingly.

16) In this section, “the anticipated normal working life” means, in relation to machinery or plant of any class, the period which might be expected, when machinery or plant of that class is first put into use, to be going to elapse before it is finally put out of use as being unfit for further use, it being assumed that it is going to be used in the normal manner and to the normal extent and is going to be so used throughout that period.

Provided that it shall not be necessary for the said Commissioners to redetermine every such percentage yearly, and every such determination of a percentage under this subsection for any year of assessment shall apply also to subsequent years except so far as it is superseded by any subsequent determination.

(3) If, in the case of machinery or plant of any class—

(a) annual allowances for the year 1948-49 were commonly

arrived at by applying five-fourths of some percentage to the cost of the machinery or plant; and

(b) a particular percentage was commonly in use for so

arriving at those allowances,

that percentage shall, except where the Commissioners of Inland Revenue determined, in connection with the year 1949-50, that it was no longer an appropriate percentage, be deemed to be a percentage determined by them in relation to machinery or plant of that class under subsection (2) of this section for the year 1949-50, and the said subsection (2), including the proviso thereto, shall have effect accordingly; and if it is shown to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners that that percentage bears to the fraction specified in the said subsection (2) (computed by reference to an anticipated normal working life estimated as if during the year 1948-49) a higher proportion than nine-tenths, the said subsection (2) shall have effect in relation to machinery or plant of that class as if for the reference therein to nine-tenths there were substituted a reference to the said higher proportion.

(4) Machinery or plant may be treated for the purposes of this section as being of a different class from other machinery or plant where the one is new when it is acquired and the other is not new when it is acquired, or, in the case of machinery or plant which is not new when it is acquired, where different periods have elapsed between the date when the machinery or plant was made or first put into use and the date of the acquisition thereof.

(5) An election under this section shall not be effective for any year of assessment in relation to any machinery or plant unless the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are satisfied that the person making the election is keeping, and will keep and make available for inspection, all such records as are necessary to secure that the Commissioners, surveyors and other officers

283.—(1) Where an election under the last preceding section has effect with respect to any machinery or plant, and the annual allowance in respect of the same machinery or plant made to the same person for any previous year of assessment has been calculated in accordance with section two hundred and eighty-one of this Act, the annual allowance for that machinery or plant for the year of assessment with respect to which the election has effect shall be computed in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say—

(a) instead of being computed by reference to the amount of the person’s expenditure in providing the machinery or plant, it shall be computed by reference to the amount by which that amount exceeds any initial allowance, annual allowances, relevant exceptional depreciation allowances and scientific research allowances made to that person in respect of that machinery or plant for the years of assessment up to and including die said previous year or, if the annual allowance was calculated in accordance with the said section two hundred and eighty-one in the case of more than one previous year, up to and including the last of those previous years; and

(b) it shall be computed as if for the percentage mentioned in subsection (2) of the last preceding section there were substituted such other percentage as the Commis* sioners of Inland Revenue may determine.

(i) any such dividends or interest shall be taken into account

for the purposes of assessment to surtax; and

(ii) the amount actually paid or credited in respect of any

such dividends or interest shall be deemed for surtax purposes to be a net amount corresponding to a gross amount from which tax at the standard rate for that year has been duly deducted, and the amount on which surtax is to be charged in the case of any person shall be calculated accordingly; and

(iii) the provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to interest on any bank loan; and

(iv) the provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to any interest which is payable in respect of a loan to the society under a contract made before the beginning of the first year of assessment as respects which the society enters into arrangements under subsection (1) of this section, if and to the extent that, both at the time of the making of the contract and at the time when the interest becomes payable, it is contemplated by the parties that tax shall be deducted on payment of the interest.

Part II

Relief in Respect of Certain Payments

2. The question whether any, and if so, what, relief is to be given shall be determined separately in relation to each payment made under the scheme in respect of the trade, but for the purpose of determining that question regard shall be had, as hereinafter provided, to the sum (hereafter in this Schedule referred to as “ the total payment”) produced by adding the amount of the payment to the amount of any payments previously so made.

3. No relief shall be given in respect of the payment unless the person chargeable shows—

payment has been made; and

(b) how much of that amount is referable to damage in respect of which no relief may be given under this Act.

4. No relief shall be given in respect of the payment unless the total payment, or the amount of the damage in respect of which the total payment has been made, whichever is the smaller, exceeds the aggregate amount of the deductible contributions which have been paid in furtherance of the scheme in respect of the trade in question before the payment is made, exclusive of any contributions which have been repaid before the payment is made.

5. The amount of the reduction to be made in respect of the payment shall be arrived at by—

(b) the damage consists of any loss, liability, expense or other

burden in respect of which an allowance may be made in computing the profits or gains of the trade for the purposes of this Act:

Provided that where an allowance under the said Chapter I in respect of any damage falls to be reduced by the fraction specified in subsection (4) of section two hundred and sixty-seven of this Act, the same fraction, and the same fraction only, of the amount of the damage shall be treated as being referable to damage in respect of which relief may be given under this Act.

(2) Where any event occurs which would give rise to an allowance under this Act in respect of any asset in charging or computing the profits or gains of a trade but for any of the following matters, that is to say—

(a) that there are no profits or gains against which the allowance could be made; or

(b) that account is required to be taken of allowances previously

made or deemed to have been made in respect of the asset; or

(c) that account is required to be taken of any sum which falls

to be written off the expenditure incurred on the asset for the purpose of determining whether any and if so what allowance may be given by reason of the event; or

() that account is required to be taken of any sum falling to be taken into account as sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys,

the like consequences shall ensue under this Schedule as if an allowance had fallen to be made by reason of that event

(3) Where any damage is attributable to a permanent change in the purposes for which an asset is used, or the temporary or permanent putting out of use of an asset, the question whether the damage is damage in respect of which relief may be given under this Act shall be determined as if the damage had been attributable to a sale of the asset on the date upon which the change or putting out of use took place.

[1st August, 1952.]

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WHEREAS Your Majesty has been graciously pleased to signify to Your faithful Commons in Parliament assembled that Your Majesty placed unreservedly at their disposal those hereditary revenues which were so placed by Your Predecessor, and that Your Majesty is desirous that provision should be made for His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh and for Your Majesty’s children other than His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall, and that provision should be made for Her Royal Highness the Princess Margaret in the event of her marrying and for any future wife of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall in die event of her surviving his Royal Highness:

And whereas Your Majesty has further been graciously pleased to signify Your Majesty’s intention to assent to arrangements for applying, during the minority of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall, a part of the revenues of the Duchy in relief of the charge for Your Majesty’s Civil List, and, in the event of those revenues vesting in Your Majesty, to provide for Your Majesty’s Civil List out of those revenues in so far as they are sufficient:

And whereas it is expedient, forasmuch as it is happily to be expected that Your Majesty’s reign will last for many years, to make provision under which so much of the sum charged for Your Majesty’s Civil List as is not required for current expenditure will be set aside and accumulated in the hands of trustees so as to be applicable for meeting expenditure in later years, and it is expedient to reserve for the future determination of Parliament to what extent and by what means sums remaining in the hands of the trustees at the end of Your Majesty’s reign should be available for making provision for members of Your Majesty’s family other than those for whom provision is made by this Act corresponding to that which Your Predecessors have been accustomed to make out of savings accruing to the Sovereign's Privy Purse:

Now, therefore, we. Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled, have freely and voluntarily resolved to make such provision as hereinafter appears for the purposes aforesaid, and we do most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted.

the court may extend the said period.

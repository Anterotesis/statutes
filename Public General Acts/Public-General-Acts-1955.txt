as in force on 1st April, 1955, so as to make such a suit or other proceeding legally maintainable the agreement of the Government of the United Kingdom to indemnify the Government of India or Government of a State will cease to apply.

Schedule—Prohibited Sea Areas.

An Act to enable effect to be given to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, and otherwise to make new provision for preventing the pollution of navigable waters by oil.

[6th May, 1955]

WHEREAS a Convention entitled “ The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 ” (in this Act referred to as “ the Convention of 1954 ”) was signed on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in London on the twelfth day of May, nineteen hundred and fifty-four:

And whereas it is expedient to enable effect to be given to that Convention, and otherwise to make new provision for preventing the pollution of navigable waters by oil:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) If any oil to which this section applies is discharged from a British ship registered in the United Kingdom into a part of the sea which, in relation to that ship, is a prohibited sea area, or if any mixture containing oil to which this section applies is

1955

Oil in Navigable Waters

Act, 1955

Ch. 25

463

(2) This section applies—

(< a) to crude oil, fuel oil and lubricating oil, and

(b) to heavy diesel oil, as defined by regulations made under this section by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (in this Act referred to as “ the Minister ”),

and shall also apply to any other description of oil which may be prescribed by the Minister, having regard to the provisions of any subsequent Convention in so far as it relates to the prevention of pollution of the sea by oil, or having regard to the persistent character of oil of that description and the likelihood that it would cause pollution if discharged from a ship into a prohibited sea area.

(3) Regulations made under this section by the Minister may make exceptions from the operation of subsection (1) of this section, either absolutely or subject to any prescribed conditions, and either generally or as respects particular classes of ships, or in relation to particular descriptions of oil or mixtures containing oil or to the discharge of oil or mixtures in prescribed circumstances, or in relation to particular areas of the sea.

(4) For the purposes of any proceedings for an offence under this section in respect of the discharge of a mixture containing oil to which this section applies,—

(a) if it is proved that there were not less than one hundred

parts of the oil in a million parts of the mixture, it shall be conclusively presumed that the oil in the mixture fouled the surface of the sea;

(b) if it is proved that there were less than one hundred parts

of the oil in a million parts of the mixture, it shall be conclusively presumed that the oil in the mixture did not foul the surface of the sea.

(5) In this Act “ subsequent Convention ” means any Convention subsequent to the Convention of 1954, being a Convention accepted by Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom.

2.—(1) For the purposes of this Act the areas of the sea Designation of designated by or in accordance with this section shall be pro- prohibited sea hibited sea areas in relation to tankers, and to vessels other than areas* tankers, respectively.

(b) if he recovers a sum less than seventy-five pounds, shall not be entitled to any costs of the action;

so, however, that this section shall not affect any question as to costs if it appears to the High Court or a judge thereof (or where the matter is tried before a referee or officer of the Supreme Court, to that referee or officer) that there was reasonable ground for supposing the amount recoverable in respect of the plaintiff’s claim to be in excess of the amount recoverable in an action commenced in the county court.

For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, a plaintiff shall be treated as recovering the full amount recoverable in respect of his claim without regard to any deduction made in respect of contributory negligence on his part or otherwise in respect of matters not falling to be taken into account in determining whether the action could have been commenced in the county court.”

2.—(1) The amount by reference to which the jurisdiction of a county court in actions for the recovery of land, or in which the ' title to a hereditament comes in question, is limited by sections forty-eight and fifty-one of the principal Act shall be one hundred pounds in net annual value for rating (instead of one hundred pounds in value by the year or in rent).

BE it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows;—

1.—(1) Where a new valuation list is to be made for a rating area under Part III of the Local Government Act, 1948 (in this Act referred to as “ the Act of 1948 ”), the list shall be prepared in accordance with the following provisions of this section; and sections thirty-five to thirty-eight of that Act (which relate to the preparation and revision of draft valuation lists and to the settling of valuation lists) shall cease to have effect.

(2) The valuation officer shall prepare the list and (in addition to the other matters required to be included therein) shall insert in the list such particulars with respect to totals of values as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister of Housing and Local Government (in this Act referred to as “ the Minister ”), both in respect of the whole rating area and in respect of any parish or other area which is liable to be charged separately in respect of any expenses.

(3) Not later than the end of the month of December preceding the date on which the list is to come into force (or if in any particular case the Minister, either before or after the end of that month, allows an extended period, then not later than the end of that period), the valuation officer shall sign the list and transmit it, together with a copy thereof, to the rating authority.

(4) Where, after the valuation officer has transmitted the list to the rating authority, but before the date on which the list is to come into force, it appears to him that, by reason of a material change of circumstances which has occurred since the time of valuation, the list needs to be altered in any respect, he shall cause the list to be altered accordingly before that date.

In this subsection—

“ material change of circumstances ” means a change of circumstances which consists of the coming into occupation of a newly erected or newly constructed hereditament or of a hereditament which has been out of occupation on account of structural alterations, or consists of any of the events specified in paragraphs (b) to (g) of subsection (2) of section forty-two of the Act of 1948;

“ the time of valuation ”, in relation to a change of circumstances, means the time by reference to which the valuation officer prepared so much of the list as is affected by that change of circumstances.

(5) The omission from a new valuation list of any matter required by law to be included therein shall not of itself render the list invalid.

(6) In respect of any new valuation list, it shall be the duty of the rating authority immediately upon receipt thereof to take such steps as the authority may consider most suitable for giving notice of the list, and of the rights of persons to inspect the list and to make proposals for altering it.

(7) Where in the case of a hereditament—

(a) any value ascribed to it in a new valuation list exceeds the corresponding value of the hereditament as last previously determined (whether under Part III of the Act of 1948 or under the enactments repealed by that Act), and

(a) shall be entitled to recover so much of that rent as would

(b) references in those provisions to the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and fifty-six, had been references to the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and fifty-two;

actually levied on the Board by that rating authority for that rate period, the difference shall be repaid or allowed, or, if the amount so calculated is greater than the amount actually levied, the difference shall be paid and may be recovered as if it were arrears of those rates:

Provided that, if the rates levied by the rating authority for the rate period in question included any charge imposed separately on a part of the rating area (whether by means of a special rate or as an additional item of the general rate), so much of any rates leviable on the Board as was attributable to that charge shall be disregarded in ascertaining the total amount of rates actually levied on the Board for that rate period.

(2) For the purpose of calculating what amount of rates would have been leviable for a rate period in the circumstances mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph—

(a) any certificate issued under Part I of the Third Schedule to this Act shall have effect as if it had been issued at the beginning of that rate period, and

(b) as regards any excepted premises which, in that rate period, formed part of a hereditament shown in the valuation list and which, if those circumstances had existed, would have fallen to be included in the list as a separate hereditament in accordance with paragraph 11 of the Third Schedule to this Act, any determination of value in consequence of a proposal made under that paragraph, if the proposal is made within twelve months after the passing of this Act, shall have effect as if that determination had been made at the beginning of that rate period.

3. —(1) Paragraphs 6 to 8 of the Third Schedule to this Act shall apply for the purposes mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of the last preceding paragraph, as if the circumstances mentioned in that sub-paragraph had existed, with the modification that anything required by those paragraphs to be done before the end of the month of October or December, as the case may be, shall be done as soon as may be after the passing of this Act.

(2) In the application of paragraph 12 of the Third Schedule to this Act for the said purposes, sub-paragraph (3) of that paragraph shall apply with the substitution, for the words “before the end of the month of September preceding the beginning of that year ”, of the words “ within three months after the passing of this Act ”, and for the words “ after the end of that month ”, of the words “ after it has been made by him ”.

If the rateable value by reference to which rates would have been leviable by a rating authority on a Gas Board for such a rate period as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of this Schedule would, if the circumstances mentioned in that sub-paragraph had existed, have been greater or less than the rateable value, or aggregate of rateable values, by reference to which rates are or were so leviable apart from that sub-paragraph, then—

(a) the former rateable value shall be treated as substituted for the latter rateable value, or aggregate of rateable values, for

the purpose of calculating the amount of any Exchequer Equalisation Grant payable under Part I or Part n of the Act of 1948 in respect of that rate period, or any year comprising that rate period;

(b) any amount repayable or allowable to the Gas Board by the

rating authority, or recoverable from the Board by that authority, by virtue of paragraph 2 of this Schedule, shall be subtracted from, or, as the case may be, added to, the proceeds of the rates leviable by that authority in respect of the year in which that amount is found to be so repayable, allowable or recoverable; and

(c) for the purposes of any power to issue precepts, or of calculating

the amount of any Exchequer Equalisation Grant or other sum payable out of moneys provided by Parliament under any enactment, the amount of those proceeds, or the gross rate income for that year of the rating area of that authority, or of any part of that area, as the case may require, shall be treated as reduced or increased accordingly.

5. The last preceding paragraph shall apply in relation to payments under section ten of the Act of 1948 (which relates to payments by the London County Council to metropolitan boroughs) as that paragraph applies in relation to Exchequer Equalisation Grants.

FIFTH SCHEDULE Adjustment of rates payable by charitable and other

ORGANISATIONS

1. —(1) The provisions of this Schedule shall have effect for the purposes of subsection (2) of section eight of this Act (in this Schedule referred to as “ the principal section ”).

(2) In this Schedule “ the first year of the new list ”, in relation to a hereditament, has the same meaning as in the principal section, and “ the last year of the old list ” means the year immediately preceding the beginning of the first year of the new list.

2. If, by reason of any structural alteration or other event occurring in the case of a hereditament after the beginning of the last year of the old list, an alteration has been made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in the valuation list in force in that year with respect to the rateable value of the hereditament, then, for the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of the principal section, and for the purposes of the following provisions of this Schedule, any reference to the total amount of rates (including any special rates) which were charged or would have been chargeable in respect of the hereditament for that year, or for any part of that year, shall be construed as a reference to the total amount of such rates which would have been chargeable if the rateable value as so altered had been shown in the valuation list as from the beginning of that year.

3. If, by reason of any structural alteration or other event occurring in the case of a hereditament within the first year of the new list, an alteration is made in the valuation list with respect to the rateable value of the hereditament, and accordingly rates are charged in respect of the hereditament for that year partly by reference to one rateable

1955

Ch. 9

577

value, for the period before that structural alteration or event, and partly by reference to another rateable value, for the period thereafter, then subsection (2) of the principal section shall not apply, but—

(a) the amount of rates chargeable in respect of the hereditament

for the earlier of those periods shall not exceed the total amount of rates (including any special rates) which would have been chargeable in respect of the hereditament for a corresponding proportion of the last year of the old list; and

(b) if, by virtue of the preceding sub-paragraph, the amount of

rates chargeable in respect of the hereditament for the period referred to in that sub-paragraph is less than it would have been apart from that sub-paragraph, the proportion by which it is thereby required to be reduced shall apply to the later of the two periods referred to in this paragraph, and to any year subsequent to the first year of the new list, and accordingly the amount of rates chargeable in respect of the hereditament for that later period, or for any such subsequent year, as the case may be, shall be reduced by that proportion.

4. Where, by virtue of the last preceding paragraph, subsection (2) of the principal section does not apply in the case of a hereditament, any reference in subsection (3) of that section to paragraph (b) of the said subsection (2) shall be construed as a reference to the corresponding provisions of the last preceding paragraph:

Provided that a notice given for the purposes of the said subsection

(3) shall not be invalid by reason only that it refers (expressly or by implication) to paragraph (b) of the said subsection (2) and not to the corresponding provisions of the last preceding paragraph.

5. —(1) Where a hereditament is one to which the principal section applies for a part, but not the whole, of the first year of the new list, or of any subsequent year, the principal section, and the preceding provisions of this Schedule, shall have effect in relation to the hereditament subject to such modifications as may be requisite for securing—

(a) that the amount of rates chargeable in respect of the heredita-

ment shall not be reduced, and no remission or reduction of rates shall be granted in respect thereof, for that part of the year for which the hereditament is not a hereditament to which the principal section applies, and

(б) that any proportion by which the amount of rates chargeable

in respect of the hereditament would (apart from this sub-paragraph) be required to be reduced shall be adjusted proportionately.

(2) Where a hereditament was a hereditament to which the principal section applies (or would have been a hereditament to which it applied if it had then been in force) for a part, but not the whole, of the last year of the old list, the principal section, and the preceding provisions of this Schedule, shall have effect in relation to the hereditament subject to such modifications as may be requisite for securing that any amount calculated by reference to the rates which were or would have been chargeable in respect of the hereditament for that year or a part of that year shall be adjusted proportionately to the part of that year first mentioned in this sub-paragraph.

Provided that where relief has been afforded to the company under section three hundred and forty-seven or three hundred and forty-eight of the Income Tax Act, 1952 (which relate to double taxation relief by agreement with other countries or unilaterally), references in this sub-paragraph to tax actually borne or to tax which would have been payable shall be construed as references to the tax which would have been borne or payable if that relief had not been given.

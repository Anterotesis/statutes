amount duly demanded of him under this subsection, that amount may be recovered from him in like manner | as if he had been charged with tax of that amount;

Part n

deducted from an amount payable to another derivative lessee, that paragraph shall apply as if the sum had been collected from him under a demand made under this subsection by the collector, and where the amounts from which under that paragraph he is entitled to make deductions in respect of that sum during the following twelve months are less than that sum, he shall be entitled to recover from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue an amount equal to the difference, which shall be treated as reducing the tax recovered under this subsection.

(5) Where any person (hereinafter referred to as “ the agent”) is in receipt of rents or receipts from land on behalf of another person (hereinafter referred to as “ the principal ”), and any tax under Case VIII charged on the principal has not been paid, the collector may by notice in writing, in such form as may be prescribed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, require the agent to pay to the collector in or towards the satisfaction of the tax any sums from time to time received by the agent on behalf of the principal on account of rents or receipts from any land (including any sums so received which are in his hands when the notice is given) until the liability in respect of the tax has been satisfied; and the agent shall pay all such sums over to the collector accordingly and the payment shall acquit and discharge him as against the person on whose behalf he received them.

If the agent fails to comply with the requirements of a notice duly served on him, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds for each failure, non-compliance as respects sums in his hands when the notice is given, or as respects any one payment subsequently received by him, being treated as a separate failure.

(a) in a case falling within subsection (4) of the foregoing

section, or

(b) which arise under the terms of a lease, but to a

person other than the landlord, or otherwise arise out of any disposition or contract such that if they arose to the person making it they would be chargeable under Case VIII,

where payment is made (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) directly to a person whose usual place of abode is outside the United Kingdom, but section 170 of the Act of 1952 shall apply in relation to the payment as it applies to other

(a) that he has not received an amount which he was entitled

to receive in respect of any rents or receipts p * on the profits or gains arising from which he would be chargeable under Case VIII, and

the default of the person by whom it was payable, that the claimant has taken any reasonable steps available to him to enforce payment,

(c) if the claimant waived payment of the said amount,

that the waiver was made without consideration and was reasonably made in order to avoid hardship,

the claimant shall be treated for tax purposes for all relevant years of assessment as if he had not been entitled to the said amount, and such adjustment shall be made, by repayment or otherwise, as the case may require; but if all or any part of the said amount is subsequently received, the claimant or, if he is dead, his executors or administrators shall not later than six months thereafter give notice in writing of its receipt to the surveyor, and such re-adjustment of liability to tax (for all relevant years of assessment) shall be made as may be necessary and may be made at any time at which it could be made if it related only to tax for the year of assessment in which the amount, or the part of the amount, is received.

(2) The foregoing subsection shall be deemed to be included in the third column of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1960 (relating to penalties on persons failing to furnish particulars or furnishing false particulars).

(3) Profits or gains arising in any year of assessment from payments for any easement over or right to use any land made to the person who occupies the land shall not be excluded from the charge to tax under Case VIII by reason only that he is chargeable with respect to the land under Schedule B, but shall be treated for purposes of Case VIII as limited to the amount (if any) by which they exceed the assessable value of the land or, as the case may be, by which they exceed such proportion of that value as corresponds to the proportion of the year for which he occupies the land.

(a) where it is less than fifteen per cent of the relevant capital amount shall be increased so as to equal fifteen per cent, of that amount; or

(b) where it is between fifteen and twenty per cent, of the relevant capital amount, shall be increased so as to equal twenty per cent, of that amount; or

(c) where it is less than twenty-five but not less than twenty per cent, of the relevant capital amount, shall be increased so as to equal twenty-five per cent, of that amount.

(3) Where for the year 1963-64 or a subsequent year of assessment a percentage established before the year 1963-64 under the said section 281 falls to be redetermined or a percentage falls to be determined under that section for a new class of machinery or plant, the percentage shall for the purpose of its application to machinery or plant to which this section applies be redetermined or determined, and Chapter II of Part X of the Act of 1952 shall thereafter apply in relation to machinery or plant of the class in question to which this section applies, as if, instead of requiring the annual allowance to be five-fourths of the percentage therein specified of the relevant capital amount, the said section 281 required it to be a percentage of that amount determined by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue by reference to the anticipated normal working life of machinery or plant of the class in question, being such a percentage as is mentioned below, that is to say—

(a) where that life is eighteen years or more, fifteen per

cent.; or

Provided that where the percentage so established, as increased Part n by one quarter, is greater than the percentage mentioned in paragraph (c) of the said subsection (3), this subsection shall apply as if that greater percentage were instead so mentioned.

(6) Subsections (2) to (5) of this section shall apply in relation to allowances falling to be computed in accordance with section 282 (alternative method) of the Act of 1952 as if references to section 281 of that Act were references to that section, and as if for any reference to fifteen, twenty or twenty-five per cent, there were substituted a reference to six and one quarter, eight and one half or eleven and one quarter per cent, respectively.

(7) If, in relation to any machinery or plant to which this section applies, a direction falls to be made under section 285 (adjustments of annual allowances in cases of abnormal use) of the Act of 1952 for the year 1963-64 or any subsequent year of assessment, the anticipated normal working life of the machinery or plant shall be ascertained as though it were used throughout its working life in the manner in which and to the extent to which it is used in the year in question, and the annual allowance in respect of the machinery or plant for that year shall be calculated as, by virtue of subsection (3) of this section (or by virtue of that subsection as applied by the foregoing subsection), it would be if the relevant percentage for machinery or plant of that class fell to be redetermined for that year and its anticipated normal working life were as so ascertained.

(8) Where, in the case of machinery or plant of any class, annual allowances for the year 1962-63 or any earlier year of assessment falling to be computed in accordance with section 281 or 282 of the Act of 1952 were computed by reference to a percentage which, though not determined or deemed to have been determined by the Commissioners under that section, was commonly treated as if it had been so determined, that percentage shall, notwithstanding that a percentage is after the commencement of this Act so determined for that year, be regarded for the purposes of annual allowances under Chapter II of Part X of that Act for the year 1963-64 or any subsequent year of assessment in respect of machinery or plant of that class to which this section applies as the percentage so determined for the year 1962-63 or that earlier year, as the case may be.

(9) In relation to machinery or plant of any class, references in this section to a percentage established before the year 1963-64 shall be construed as references to a percentage established by a determination made or deemed to have been made under section 281(2) or, as the case may be, section 282(2) of the Act of 1952 and applying for the year 1962-63 to that class, and references to the anticipated normal working life of the machinery or plant shall be construed in accordance with section 281(6) or, as the case may be, section 282(6) of that Act.

Provided that no amount shall be allowed or charged by virtue of this subsection in respect of any sale if the sale gives rise to a balancing allowance or balancing charge under Chapter I or II of Part X of this Act

37,—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section* where, foi the purposes of a trade carried on or about to be carried on by him, a person incurs capital expenditure on the acquisition of a mineral asset the acquisition of which entitles him to work a mine, oil well or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature in the United Kingdom, and the trade consists of or includes the working of that source, he shall be entitled for any year of assessment the basis period for which ends after the incurring of the expenditure to an annual allowance in respect of the expenditure.

(2) Subject as aforesaid, the annual allowance for a year of assessment shall be equal to the fraction mentioned below of the royalty value of the output in the basis period for the year from the source to which the expenditure relates, that is to say-

fa) where the first working of the source after the expenditure was incurred was less than ten years before the end of that basis period, one-half;

(b) where that first working was less than twenty but not

less than ten years before the end of the basis period, one-quarter;

(c) in any other case, one-tenth.

(3) An annual allowance under this section in respect of any expenditure shall not be made to a person for a year of assessment unless the amount of the expenditure exceeds the aggregate of any allowances under this section made to him for previous years in respect of the expenditure together with any capital sums accruing to him in or before the basis period for the year by virtue of his acquisition of the mineral asset in question, and where made shall not be greater than the amount of the excess; and for this purpose there shall be deemed to have been made for years preceding the year 1963-64 such annual allowances as would have fallen to be made if this section had always had effect.

(4) Where in the basis period for any year of assessment a person ceases to work the source to which capital expenditure incurred by him relates and, apart from this and the foregoing subsection, an annual allowance under this section would faS

to be made to him for that year in respect of the expenditure, the allowance shall not be made, and—

(a) if the aggregate of any allowances under this section

made to him for previous years in respect of the expenditure exceeds so much of the expenditure as represents the cost of acquiring the output got by him from the source (other than output got before the 4th April 1963), a balancing charge on an amount equal to the excess shall be made on him for that year, or

(b) if that aggregate is less than so much of the expenditure as represents the cost of acquiring that output, a balancing allowance equal to the difference shall be made to him for that year.

(5) So much of the capital expenditure incurred by a person on the acquisition of a mineral asset as remains after deducting—

(a) the market value of the asset at the time the source to

which the expenditure relates ceases to be worked by him, and

(b) any capital sums accruing to him before that time by

virtue of his acquisition of the asset,

shall be taken for the purposes of the foregoing subsection to represent the cost of acquiring the output got by him from the source; and where part of the output was got by him before the 4th April 1963, the cost of acquiring the part got on or after that date shall be taken for those purposes to be an amount which bears to the amount so remaining the same proportion as the royalty value of the output from the source on or after that date bears to the royalty value of the whole output got by virtue of the expenditure.

In this subsection “ market value ”, in relation to an asset, means the price which it might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market (whether for use by the purchaser for mining purposes or other purposes) if, before the sale, the owner of the asset had carried out such works (if any) for restoring or otherwise making good the land surface at the site of the source as, having regard to the obligations imposed on him and other relevant circumstances, he might reasonably be expected to carry out whether or not he sold the asset, but reduced by so much of that price as is attributable to matters not representing any part of the capital expenditure in question.

(6) Where a balancing adjustment is made in respect of a person under subsection (4) of this section, or would fall to be so made if the relevant amounts were not equal, and after ceasing to work the source he carries out any works for restoring or otherwise making good the land surface at the site of the source, the cost of those works shall not be taken into account

(a) in computing, in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, the amount of an annual allowance for the later year or any subsequent year, the period between the cessation and recommencement of working shall be disregarded; and

(b) in computing, for the purposes of subsection (3) or

(4) of this section, the aggregate of allowances for previous years, those allowances shall be treated as reduced by the amount on which any balancing charge under paragraph (a) of the said subsection (4) has been made in respect of the expenditure.

(8) Allowances or charges falling to be made under this section to or on any person shall be made to or on him in charging the profits or gains of his trade.

(9) Where a person (in this subsection referred to as “the transferee ”) acquires a mineral asset from another person (in this subsection referred to as “ the transferor ”), and the transferee is a body of persons over whom the transferor has control, or the transferor is a body of persons over whom the transferee has control, or both the transferee and the transferor are bodies of persons and some other person has control over both of them, the capital expenditure incurred by the transferee on the acquisition of the asset shall be taken for the purposes of this section (including this subsection) not to exceed the capital expenditure incurred by the transferor on its acquisition by him or, where the asset consists of an interest or right granted by the transferor, so much of the capital expenditure so incurred by the transferor as, on a just apportionment, is referable to that interest or right; and the expenditure incurred by the transferee shall where necessary be treated as reduced accordingly.

(10) Where in the basis period for any year of assessment a person, having previously incurred capital expenditure on the acquisition of a mineral asset the acquisition of which entitled him to work a source, incurs for the purposes of the trade capital expenditure on the acquisition of another mineral asset the acquisition of which entitles him to work the same source, this section shall apply as respects that year and subsequent years of assessment as if the assets were one

(a) no greater allowances shall for the purpose of sub-

section (3) of this section be deemed by reason of this subsection to have been made before that date;

(b) the cost of acquiring output got before that date, as computed under subsection (5) of this section, shall not by reason of this subsection be treated as increased.

If the asset to which the further expenditure relates extends to mineral deposits or land not included in the asset to which the first-mentioned expenditure relates, so much of it as so extends shall be treated for the purposes of this section as a separate mineral asset, and the further expenditure shall be apportioned between the assets as may be just.

(11) References in this section to expenditure on the acquisition of an asset do not include—

(a) expenditure to which Chapter III of Part X of the Act

of 1952 applies; or

(b) expenditure on machinery or plant, or on any asset

which has been treated for any year of assessment as machinery or plant; or

(c) expenditure on any building or structure,

and where expenditure was incurred on the acquisition of an asset in respect of which, for years of assessment previous to a year for which he first becomes entitled in respect of the expenditure to an allowance under this section, the person incurring the expenditure has been allowed any deductions under Schedule 9 to this Act, the expenditure shall be treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by so much of those deductions as, if he had been entitled to an allowance under this section for earlier years, would have been excluded by paragraph 5 of that Schedule.

Deductions from rents: general rules Schedules 9, 12.

1. The deductions which may be made from rent to which a person (hereinafter referred to as “ the person chargeable ”) becomes entitled under a lease shall be such deductions of the amounts of payments made by him—

(a) in respect of maintenance, repairs, insurance or management;

(b) in respect of any services provided by him otherwise than by way of maintenance or repairs, being services which he was obliged to provide but in respect of which he received no separate consideration;

2. Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, from rent to which the person chargeable becomes entitled in a year of assessment there may be deducted the amount of any such payment as aforesaid which became due in the year of assessment or at an earlier time falling within the currency of the lease, in so far as the payment—

(a) was made in respect of the premises comprised in the lease,

and

(b) in the case of a payment for maintenance or repairs, was incurred by reason of dilapidation attributable to a period falling within the currency of the lease or, in the case of any other payment, was incurred in respect of such a period:

Sch. 4 3.—(1) In the case of a lease at a full rent, the foregoing paragraph

shall apply as if references to the currency of the lease included any period (hereinafter referred to as “ a previous qualifying period ”)—

(a) during which the person chargeable was the landlord in relation to a previous lease erf the premises, being a lease at a full rent, or

(b) which was a void period beginning either with the termination of a previous such lease as aforesaid or with the acquisition by the person chargeable of the interest in the premises giving him the right to possession thereof,

so however that a period shall not be a previous qualifying period if it preceded a period ending before the beginning of the lease which was not itself a previous qualifying period.

(2) Where during any period the conditions necessary for the period to be a previous qualifying period were fulfilled as respects part of the premises, but not the whole, the period shall be treated as a previous qualifying period as respects that part of the premises only, and the foregoing sub-paragraph shall apply accordingly, any necessary apportionment being made of rent, payments or other matters.

(3) In this and the next following paragraph, “void period” means a period during which the person chargeable was not in occupation of the premises or any part thereof, but was entitled to possession thereof.

4. Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, in the case of a lease at a full rent, not being a tenant’s repairing lease, there may also be deducted the amount of any payment made in respect erf other premises by the person chargeable—

(a) in so far as that amount could be deducted under para-

graphs 2 and 3 of this Schedule from rent to which he became entitled in the year of assessment under a lease of those other premises, being a lease at a full rent, or could be so deducted if that rent were not insufficient; or

(b) if any part of the year of assessment is, in respect of those other premises, a void period beginning with the termination of a lease at a full rent, in so far as the amount could be deducted as aforesaid if the lease had continued until the end of that period.

5. Where by reason of any change of circumstances a lease ceases to be, or becomes, a tenant’s repairing lease or ceases to be, or becomes, a lease at a full rent, paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Schedule shall apply in relation to the lease as it subsists after the change of circumstances as if it were a new lease granted when the change occurred. 6

6. Where the person chargeable retains possession of a part of any premises and that part is used in common by persons respectively occupying other parts of the premises, the foregoing provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if a payment made in respect of the part used in common had been made in respect of those other parts.

7.—(1) Where this paragraph applies to an estate for a year of assessment, the owner shall be treated—

(a) in relation to a part of the estate which for any period in the year is not comprised in a lease under which he is the landlord, as if he were entitled under a lease of that part at a full rent (not being a tenant's repairing lease) to rent for the said period, becoming due from day to day, at a rate per annum equal to the annual value of that part ascertained in accordance with Schedule 5 to this Act; and

(b) in relation to a part of the estate which for any period in

the year is comprised in a lease under which he is the landlord, not being a lease at a full rent, as if the lease were at a full rent and the rent, so far as it relates to that part, were at a rate per annum not less than the annual value of that part ascertained in accordance with the said Schedule 5,

and the foregoing provisions of this Schedule shall apply accordingly:

Provided that—

(i) a payment relating to premises comprised in the estate shall

not be deductible from rent in respect of premises not so comprised;

first year of assessment for which the person making it became entitled to make it or such further time as the Commissioners of Inland Revenue may allow;

(b) except in the case of the first election that can be made under this paragraph, shall not have effect unless the like election has had effect as respects the immediately preceding ownership;

(c) shall apply in relation*to the estate throughout the owner-

ship of the person making it. 3

(3) Where in any year of assessment the estate comprises premises not included in it at the end of the year 1962-63, sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph (except the proviso) shall apply in relation to the year of assessment as if the premises were not included in the estate in the year:

and, in respect of a lease granted out of, or disposition of, the lei estate or interest in respect of which tax so became or would h; become chargeable on the said amount (in this and the two follow paragraphs referred to as “ the amount chargeable on the supei interest ”), a person would apart from this paragraph be charges under the said provisions on any amount (in this and the follow paragraph referral to as “ the later chargeable amount ”), the amo on which he is so chargeable shall, where no claim is or can made by him under section 22(6) of this Act, be the excess (if a of the later chargeable amount over the appropriate fraction the amount chargeable on the superior interest

(2) Where a person would apart from this paragraph be chargeable in respect of a lease or disposition which extends t( part only of the said premises, the amount on which he is chargeable shall, where no claim is or can be made by him un section 22(6) of this Act, be the excess (if any) of the later charges amount over so much of the appropriate fraction of the amo chargeable on the superior interest as, on a just apportionment, attributable to that part of the premises. 3 * * * * * *

(3) For the purposes of this and the following paragraph

appropriate fraction of the amount chargeable on the superior inter

is the sum which bears to that amount the same proportion as

9. —(1) Where in relation to any premises tax has or would have become chargeable as mentioned in sub-paragraph (l)(a) or (b) of the foregoing paragraph in respect of a lease, estate or interest, then, subject to the provisions of the following sub-paragraph, the person for the time being entitled to the lease, estate or interest shall be treated for the purpose of deductions under the foregoing provisions of this Schedule from rent receivable by him in respect of those or other premises as paying rent for those premises (in addition to any actual rent), becoming due from day to day, during any part of the period in respect of which the amount chargeable on the superior interest arose for which he was entitled to the lease, estate or interest, and in all bearing to that amount the same proportion as that part of the period bears to the whole.

(2) Where the foregoing paragraph has effect in relation to a lease granted out of, or disposition of, the lease, estate or interest in respect of which tax has or would have become so chargeable, sub-paragraph (1) above shall apply for the period in respect of which the later chargeable amount arose only if the appropriate fraction of the amount chargeable on the superior interest exceeds the later chargeable amount, and shall then apply as if the amount chargeable on the superior interest were reduced in the proportion which the said excess bears to the said appropriate fraction:

Provided that where the lease so granted, or the said disposition, extends to a part only of the premises, sub-paragraph (1) above and this sub-paragraph shall be applied separately in relation to that part and to the remainder of the premises, but as if for any reference to the amount chargeable on the superior interest there were substituted a reference to that amount proportionately adjusted. 10

and where during any period the owner was in occupation of a part only of the premises there shall be disregarded for those purposes so much of any payment made during the period, or relief available to him in respect of the period, as is attributable to that part 3

(3) Where relief available in respect of any land managed as one estate fell to be computed in accordance with section 101(4) of the Act of 1952, payments made in respect of the estate, and the relief so available, shall for the purposes of the foregoing sub-paragraph be treated as apportioned between the premises comprised in the estate in accordance with their annual values for purposes of Schedule A, but so that as respects any premises in relation to which the owner was chargeable under section 175 of the Act of 1952 (excess rents) the annual value shall be taken to be that determined as mentioned in subsection (1) of that section.

(2) Where by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) above a deduction falls to be made in any year it shall be made notwithstanding anything in subsection (3) of the said section 346 (which requires relief under that section to be given as far as possible from the first subsequent Case VI assessment), and relief shall not be given under that section in respect of a loss in so far as a deduction in respect of it is made under this paragraph.

stituted an expense of that transaction, not being an expense of a capital nature;

() where, in or before the year, that person entered into any

if made before the beginning of the year 1964-65:

Provided that this paragraph shall not prevent the deduction of a payment in so far as a loss in respect of the payment is by virtue of section 346 of the Act of 1952 (relief in respect of losses under Case VI of Schedule D) carried forward to that year, and where the deduction falls to be made it shall be made notwithstanding anything in subsection (3) of that section (which requires relief to be given as far as possible from the first subsequent Case VI assessment), and to the extent that it is made relief shall not be given under that section.

15.—(1) Where the person entitled to possession of any land is in the practice of granting sporting rights over the land for payment, but in any year of assessment such rights are for any reason not granted by him, the aggregate of any amounts paid by him which, if such rights had been granted in the year, would have been deductible under paragraph 13 above from payments receivable by him in respect of the grant shall be treated for the purposes of paragraph 4 of this Schedule as a deduction which by virtue of paragraph 2 thereof might have been made by him from rent to which he was entitled for that year under a lease of the land, being a lease at a full rent:

Provided that if in the year sporting rights over the land are exercised by that person or by any other person at Ms invitation or, where the first mentioned person is a company to which section 245 of the Act of 1952 applies, by any person who is a director or member of the company within the meaning of Chapter III of Part IX of that Act, the aggregate of the said amounts shall be treated as reduced by an amount equal to the price which might reasonably be expected to have been paid for that exercise of the rights if the person exercising them had had to give full consideration therefor.

as making for the year of assessment in which the transfer takes place shall be treated as being made partly by the transferor and partly by the transferee, as may be just; and

(b) the transferee shall, to the exclusion of the transferor, be treated in any subsequent year, where the interest transferred is in the whole of the premises, as having made the whole of the payment for that year, and where the interest transferred is in part only of the premises, as having made so much of the payment for the year as is properly referable to that part of the premises.

For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, where an interest in any premises is a lease and that lease comes to an end, that interest shall be deemed to have been transferred—

(i) if an incoming lessee makes any payment to the outgoing

lessee in respect of the embankment in question, to the incoming lessee; and

(ii) in any other case, to the owner of the interest in immediate reversion on the lease and, in relation to Scotland, the expression “ the owner of the interest in immediate reversion on the lease” shall be construed as a reference to the landlord.

(3) In relation to expenditure in respect of which an allowance under section 94(1 Xc) erf the Act of 1952 would, but for the provisions of this Act, have fallen to be made in respect of the premises for the year 1964-65, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall apply as if the expenditure had been incurred in the year of assessment following that in which it was actually incurred and, so far as the expenditure was incurred in repairing the embankment in question, shall apply as if it had been incurred in making it, but those provisions shall not otherwise apply to expenditure incurred before the beginning of the year 1964-65:

Provided that the person who under the foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph would be treated, in respect of expenditure incurred in repairing the embankment, as having made in the year 1964-65 a payment as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph may before the expiration of the year 1965-66 by notice in writing to the surveyor claim that so much of that expenditure as exceeded the total allowances made in respect of it under the said section 94(1 )(c) shall instead be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as if it had been an amount paid by him in respect of the maintenance of the premises preserved or protected by the embankment in. and in respect of, the year 1964-65. 4 * *

(b) if the payment is payable under deduction of tax.

(4) An amount or part of an amount shall not be deducted under this Schedule more than once from any sum or from more than one sum, and shall not in any case be deducted thereunder if it has been otherwise allowed as a deduction in computing the income of any person for purposes of income tax.

SCHEDULE 6

Relief where Premium, etc. treated as Rent

1. The relief shall be computed in accordance with the following provisions of this Schedule, and in those provisions—

"chargeable sum" means an amount to which, under subsection (1), (2). (3) or (4) of section 22 of this Act, the claimant is treated as becoming entitled in the year of assessment, or in respect of which he is, by virtue of subsection (5) of that section or section 23 or 24 of this Act chargeable to tax for the year under Case VI of Schedule D;

"relevant period", in relation to any chargeable sum, means the period treated in computing the amount of the sum as being the duration of the lease in respect of which it arises or, where it arises (by virtue of the said section 24) in connection with the sale of an estate or interest in land, means the period mentioned in subsection (1) of that section;

44 yearly equivalent", in relation to any chargeable sum, means the amount which bears to that sum the same proportion as one bears to the number of years and fractions of years in the relevant period.

2. There shall be computed—

(a) the amount of the tax which, in respect of the chargeable gum or the aggregate of the chargeable sums, as the case may be, would be chargeable if—

(i) the relief were not given, and

392

Ch. 25

Finance Act 1963

Sch. 6 (ii) that sum or aggregate were treated as the hipest

part of the claimant’s total income, and

(iii) amounts deductible in computing the tax were so far as possible deducted from other sums from which they are deductible in the year rather than from that sum or aggregate; and

(b) the amount of the tax which, in respect of that sum or aggregate, would be chargeable if calculated by reference to the yearly equivalent of that sum or of each sum comprised in that aggregate, as the case may be, in accordance with the following paragraph,

and the relief shall consist of a reduction or repayment of tax equal to the difference between those amounts.

3.—(1) Where the relief is to be given in respect of one chargeable sum only, the tax shall be calculated for the purposes of paragraph 2(b) of this Schedule as follows, that is to say—

(a) from the yearly equivalent of that sum there shall be deducted such amounts as, following the principle set out in paragraph 2(a)(iii) of this Schedule, are deductible from that sum;

(b) if any balance of the yearly equivalent remains, the tax in respect of the chargeable sum shall be calculated at the rate which, apart from the relief, would apply if the amount of the sum were reduced to the amount of that balance and were then treated as the highest part of the claimant’s total income or, if two or more rates would then apply, at those rates in corresponding proportions;

(c) if no such balance remains, the tax shall be calculated at the rate applicable to the highest part of the remainder of the claimant’s total income for the year of assessment,

and whether or not any such balance remains the tax shall be arrived at by applying the said rate or rates to so much of the chargeable sum as remains after deducting such amounts as, following the principle set out in the said paragraph 2(aXiii), are deductible from that sum.

(2) Where the relief is to be given in respect of two or more chargeable sums, the tax for each shall be calculated for the said purposes as provided by the foregoing sub-paragraph, but so that—

(4) The provisions of subsections (5) to (7) of section 29 of this Act shall apply in relation to any proposals referred to the Minister as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section as if in those provisions any reference to the river authority were a reference to the Minister and any reference to the application were a reference to the proposals.

(5) In determining under this section whether a licence should be varied, and, if so, what direction should be given under subsection (3) of this section, the Minister shall consider whether any such direction would require the licence to be varied so as to authorise derogation from protected rights.

45.—(1) The provisions of this section shall have effect where at any time—

(a) one or more licences under this Act are in force in relation to a source of supply in a river authority area, authorising water abstracted in pursuance of the licences to be used for the purpose of spray irrigation, or for that purpose together with other purposes, and (b) by reason of exceptional shortage of rain or other emergency, it appears to the river authority that it is necessary to impose a temporary restriction on the abstraction of water for use for that purpose.

(2) In so far as any such licence authorises water to be used for the purpose of spray irrigation, the river authority may serve a notice on the holder of the licence reducing, during such period as may be specified in the notice, the quantity of water authorised to be abstracted in pursuance of the licence from the source of supply in question for use for that purpose, and, in relation to that period, the licence shall have effect subject to that reduction accordingly:

Provided that the river authority shall not serve such a notice in respect of abstraction of water from underground strata unless it appears to them that such abstraction is likely to affect

Ch. 38

997

the flow, level or volume of an inland water (not being an inland water failing within section 2(3) of this Act or an inland water comprised in an order under section 25 of this Act).

(3) In the exercise of the power conferred by the last preceding subsection, in a case where there are two or more such licences in force authorising abstraction from the same source of supply either at the same point or at points which, in the opinion of the river authority, are not far distant from each other,—

(a) the river authority shall not serve such a notice on the

holder of one of the licences unless a like notice is served on the holders of the other licences in respect of the same period, and

(b) the reductions imposed by the notices on the holders

of the licences shall be so calculated as to represent, as nearly as appears to the river authority to be practicable, the same proportion of the quantity of water authorised by the licences (apart from the notices) to be abstracted for use for the purpose of spray irrigation.

(4) The provisions of this section shall have effect without prejudice to the exercise of any power conferred by sections 42 to 44 of this Act.

46.—(1) Where a licence is revoked or varied under section 44 of this Act, and it is shown that the holder of the licence—

(b) has otherwise sustained loss or damage which is directly

attributable to the revocation or variation,

the river authority shall pay to him compensation in respect of that expenditure, loss or damage.

(2) For the purposes of this section, any expenditure incurred in the preparation of plans for the purposes of any work, or upon other similar matters preparatory to any work, shall be taken to be included in the expenditure incurred in carrying out that work.

(3) Subject to the last preceding subsection, no compensation shall be paid under this section in respect of any work carried out before the grant of the licence which is revoked or varied, or in respect of any other loss or damage arising out of anything done or omitted to be done before the grant of that licence :

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to a licence of right.

(4) No compensation shall be payable under this section in respect of a licence to abstract water, if it is shown that no

(6) For the purpose of assessing any compensation under this section, in so far as that compensation is in respect of loss or damage consisting of depreciation of the value of an interest in land, the rules set out in section 5 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 shall, so far as applicable and subject to any necessary modifications, have effect as they have effect for the purpose of assessing compensation for the compulsory acquisition of an interest in land.

(7) Where the interest in land, in respect of which any compensation falls to be assessed in accordance with the last preceding subsection, is subject to a mortgage—

(a) the compensation shall be assessed as if the interest were not subject to the mortgage;

(b) a claim for the compensation may be made by any

mortgagee of the interest, but without prejudice to die making of a claim by the person entitled to the interest;

(c) no such compensation shall be payable in respect of the

interest of the mortgagee (as distinct from the interest which is subject to the mortgage); and

(d) any such compensation which is payable in respect of the interest which is subject to the mortgage shall be paid to the mortgagee, or, if there is more than one mortgagee, to the first mortgagee, and shall in either case be applied by him as if it were proceeds of sale.

Application 47.—(1) Where a licence under this Act, not being a licence

by owner of of right, authorises abstraction from an inland water in respect forrevocSion no ^um acceptable flow has been determined

or variation under Part III of this Act, then, at any time after the end of the

of licence. period of one year beginning with the date on which the

licence was granted but before such a minimum acceptable flow has been so determined, any person who is the owner of fishing rights in respect of that inland water may apply to the Minister for the revocation or variation of the licence.

Ch. 38

999

(2) Any application under this section made by a person as owner of fishing rights in respect of an inland water shall be made on the grounds that, in his capacity as owner of those rights, he has sustained loss or damage which is directly attributable to the abstraction of water in pursuance of the licence in question, and either—

(a) he is not entitled to a protected right under this Act in

respect of that inland water, or

(b) the loss or damage which he has sustained in his capacity as owner of those rights is not attributable to any such breach of statutory duty as is mentioned in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of section 50 of this Act or is in addition to any loss or damage attributable to any such breach.

(3) Where an application is made under this section, the applicant shall serve notice in the prescribed form on the river authority and on the holder of the licence, stating that each of them is entitled, at any time before the end of the period of twenty-eight days beginning with the date of service of the notice, to make representations in writing to the Minister with respect to the application; and the Minister, in determining the application, shah take into account any representations in writing received by him from the river authority or from the holder of the licence within that period.

(4) On an application under this section, the Minister shall not determine that the licence in question shall be revoked or varied unless—

(a) the grounds of the application, as mentioned in sub-

section (2) of this section, are established to his satisfaction, and

(b) the Minister is satisfied that the extent of the loss or

damage which the applicant has sustained, as mentioned in that subsection, is such as to justify the revocation or variation of the licence,

or if he is satisfied that the fact that the abstraction of water in pursuance of the licence caused that loss or damage was wholly or mainly attributable to exceptional shortage of rain, or to an accident or other unforeseen act or event not caused by, and outside the control of, the river authority; and, where the Minister determines that the licence shall be varied, the variation shall be limited to that which, in the opinion of the Minister, is requisite having regard to that loss or damage.

(5) Subsections (2) and (3) of section 44 of this Act shall apply in relation to any matter required to be determined by the Minister under the last preceding subsection as they apply in relation to matters required to be determined by

(a) notice to treat for the acquisition of the fishing rights of

the applicant, or of an interest in land which includes those rights, has been served by the river authority, or

(b) an offer has been made by the river authority to the owner of those rights to acquire those rights (or, where they subsist only as rights included in an interest in land, to acquire that interest) on terms that the price payable shall be equal to (and shall, in default of agreement, be determined in like manner as) the compensation which would be payable in respect thereof if the rights or interest were acquired compulsorily by the river authority,

the owner of the fishing rights shall be entitled to compensation from the river authority.

(9) The amount of the compensation payable under the last preceding subsection in respect of any fishing rights shall be the amount by which the value of those rights (or, where they subsist only as rights included in an interest in land, the value of that interest) is depreciated by the operation of section 31(1) of this Act in relation to the licence to which the application related.

(10) Any question of disputed compensation under subsection

(7) or under subsections (8) and (9) of this section shall be referred to and determined by the Lands Tribunal; and in

(2) In this section “ alternative statutory provision ” has the meaning assigned to it by section 36 (3) of this Act, and “ authorised ” means authorised in whatsoever terms, and whether expressly or by implication, and “ authorisation ” shall be construed accordingly.

(2) Where under any provision of this Part of this Act a river authority are directed by the Minister to grant or vary a licence, then (without prejudice to the duty of the river authority, as between that authority and the Minister, to comply with that direction) if the licence as granted or varied in compliance with the direction authorises derogation from protected rights—

(a) the grant or variation of the licence shall, as between

the river authority and the person entitled to those rights, have effect as a breach on the part of the river authority of a statutory duty not to authorise derogation from those rights;

(b) the preceding subsection shall apply in relation to that

statutory duty as it applies in relation to the duty imposed by section 29 (2) of this Act; and

(c) the duty of the river authority to comply with the direc-

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to a direction given in consequence of an appeal against the decision of the river authority on an application for the grant of a licence of right.

(3) In any action brought against a river authority in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section (including that subsection as applied by the last preceding subsection) it shall be a defence for them to prove that the fact that the abstraction of water (or, as the case may be, the obstruction or impeding of the flow of the inland water) authorised by the licence, as granted or varied by the river authority, derogated from the protected right under this Act of the plaintiff was wholly or mainly attributable to exceptional shortage of rain or to an accident or other unforeseen act or event not caused by, and outside the control of, the river authority.

(4) Where the plaintiff in any such action is entitled to a protected right under this Act by reason only that he is the holder of, or has applied for, a licence of right, it shall be a defence for the river authority to prove—

1003

(b) that, if he had carried out such alterations, the abstrac- Part IV tion (or, as the case may be, the obstruction or impeding of the flow of the inland water) authorised by the licence to which the action relates would not have derogated from his protected right under this Act.

(5) In the last preceding subsection “ permissible alterations ”—

(a) in relation to a person who is the holder of a licence of

right, means any alteration of works, or modification of machinery or apparatus, which would fulfil the requirements of the licence as to the means whereby water is authorised to be abstracted;

any information before it which is relevant to his character and to his physical and mental condition.

(3) Where a court of summary jurisdiction imposes detention on an offender under twenty-one years of age, the court shall state the reason for its opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate, and the reason shall be entered in the record of the proceedings along with the finding and sentence.

(4) Where, after the commencement of this section, in the case of a person who is of or over seventeen years of age but less than twenty-one years of age the court is of opinion as aforesaid, and either—

(a) if the person has been convicted of an offence punish-

able with imprisonment, is satisfied, having considered all the circumstances of the case, that neither a sentence of borstal training nor a sentence of detention in a detention centre should be imposed; or

(b) would have power but for the said commencement to

impose imprisonment otherwise than by sentence;

it shall, subject to the following provisions of this Act, instead of imposing a term of imprisonment upon him impose detention in a young offenders institution for a term not exceeding the term for which he could have been imprisoned.

4. —(1) The maximum period for which a person sentenced to borstal training after the commencement of this section may be detained in pursuance of section 33 (2) of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952 shall be two years instead of three years.

(3) Where in pursuance of section 33 (4) of the said Act an order is made for the recall of a person sentenced to borstal training after the commencement of this section and subsequently released, the maximum period for which he shall be liable to be detained following recall shall be three months instead of one year.

5. —(1) Where in pursuance of section 33 (4) of the said Act of 1952 an order is made for the recall of a person who is under supervision after his release from a borstal institution, that person shall, after the commencement of this section, instead of being detained in a borstal institution, be detained in a young offenders institution.

(2) The Secretary of State shall have power, in the case of a person who is detained in a borstal institution at the commencement of this section after his recall as aforesaid, to transfer that person to a young offenders institution.

6. —(1) Where a person sentenced to borstal training, being under supervision after his release from a borstal institution, is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment, the court may, instead of dealing with him in any other manner, make an order for his recall.

Ch. 39

1137

(2) An order for the recall of a person made as aforesaid shall have the like effect as an order for recall made by the Secretary of State under section 33 (4) of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952.

Detention Centre

7. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in any case where a person who is not less than fourteen but under twenty-one years of age is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment, and the court has been notified by the Secretary of State that a detention centre is available for the reception from that court of persons of his class or description, it may pass on him a sentence of detention in that centre for a fixed term of three months.

(2) A court shall not pass a sentence under this section in the case of a person who has served or is serving a sentence involving his detention for two months or more in a prison or in a young offenders institution or a sentence of borstal training, or in the case of a person who has served a sentence of detention in a detention centre, unless the court is of the opinion that, having regard to special considerations arising out of the circumstances of the case and the character of the offender, this method of dealing with him is the most appropriate.

(3) Where it appears to the Secretary of State that a person detained in a detention centre is unfit for such detention by reason of his health, without prejudice to any other powers he may have in the matter, he may, after consultation where practicable with the judge by whom or the presiding chairman of the court by which the sentence was passed, release that person; and he shall then be required to be under supervision in accordance with section 11(1) of this Act.

(4) Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1949 shall cease to have effect.

8. —(1) The term for which a person may be detained in a detention centre shall not exceed three months at a time; and accordingly no court may pronounce an order the effect of which would be that a person would be liable to be detained for more than that period.

(2) Where a court has before it a person convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment who is serving a sentence of detention in a detention centre or who has been sentenced to and has not yet started to serve such a sentence as aforesaid, it may pass either of the following sentences (subject to the requirements of any enactment relating to those sentences)—

Transfer of Young Offenders

9.—(1) For section 32 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952 (which relates to transfers from prison to borstal institution and vice versa) there shall be substituted the following section:—

“Transfer of young offenders between institutions.

32.—<1) If the Secretary of State is satisfied that a person detained in a young offenders institution in pursuance of a sentence is under twenty-one yean of age and might with advantage be detained in a borstal institution, he may, after consultation where practicable with the judge by whom or the presiding chairman of the court by which the sentence was passed, transfer that person to a borstal institution; and the provisions of the next following section shall thereupon apply to him as if he had on the date of the transfer been sentenced to borstal training:

Provided that if on that date the unexpired term of his sentence is less than two years those provisions shall apply to him as if he had been sentenced to borstal training two years before the expiration of that term.

(2) If a person detained in a borstal institution is reported to the Secretary of State by the visiting committee to be incorrigible, or to be exercising a bad influence on the other inmates of the institution, the Secretary of State may present an application to the sheriff within whose jurisdiction the institution is situated for commutation to detention in a young offenders institution of the unexpired part of the term for which the said person is then liable to be detained in a borstal institution, and on any such application the sheriff may commute the said unexpired part to detention as aforesaid for such a term, not exceeding that unexpired part, as he may think fit; and for the purposes of this Act (other than those of subsections (3) and (4) of section 33) and of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1963 the said

Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1963

Ch. 39

1139

person shall be treated as if he had been sentenced to detention in a young offenders institution for that term.

(3) If in the case of a person who is not less than seventeen years of age, who is detained in a detention centre, it is reported to the Secretary of State by the visiting committee that he is not amenable to the discipline of the centre by reason of his health, the Secretary of State may transfer that person to a young offenders institution and there detain him for a period not exceeding the unexpired part of the term for which the said person was sentenced to be detained in the detention centre.

(4) The powers conferred upon the Secretary of State by the last foregoing subsection may be exercised in the case of a person who has not attained the age of seventeen years if the Secretary of State is satisfied, having regard to the character and development of the person, that it is appropriate that he should be detained in a young offenders institution.”

(2) On the coming into operation of the provisions of section 1 of this Act, the Secretary of State shall have power, in the case of any person who is under twenty-one years of age and who is serving a sentence of imprisonment under which he would not normally be released within the next three months, to transfer that person to a young offenders institution; and for the purposes of this Act and of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952, any person so transferred shall be treated as if he had been sentenced to detention in a young offenders institution.

(3) Where an order has been made under any of the enactments specified in the next following subsection for the committal or transfer to a civil prison in Scotland of a person who is under twenty-one years of age, that person shall be taken to a young offenders institution.

(4) (a) The enactments referred to in the last foregoing subsection are—

the Army Act 1955 the Air Force Act 1955 the Naval Discipline Act 1957, and any rules made thereunder.

(b) For the purposes of the aforesaid enactments, any reference therein to a like sentence of a civil court shall include, in relation to a person taken to a young offenders institution under the last foregoing subsection, a reference to a sentence of detention in a young offenders institution, and references to a civil prison and to imprisonment and any cognate references shall be construed accordingly.

10. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a person serving a sentence of detention in a young offenders institution has attained the age of twenty-one years, the Secretary of State shall have power to transfer him to prison.

(2) No person shall be detained in a young offenders institution after he has attained the age of twenty-three years, and accordingly any person so detained shall, not later than the day immediately preceding his twenty^third birthday, be transferred to prison.

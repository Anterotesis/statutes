Considering that such legislation may be insufficiently effective unless, as well as applying to persons resident in the country where h is enacted, it applies also to persons not so resident but resident in the other of the two countries and accordingly affects exemptions from tax conferred in pursuance of the said Agreement of 1926,

Recognising that the legislation which was the subject of the Agreement of the 4th April, 1959, made between the two Governments affected the said exemptions in particular ways, and desiring to supplement that Agreement by a more general Agreement,

1960

Desiring to declare that save as provided by this Agreement the 5th Sgb. continuance in force of the said Agreement of 1926 shall not be affected by the enactment of such legislation.

Have agreed as follows:—

Article 1

Legislation enacted in either country at any time after the date of this Agreement and affecting in any way exemptions from income tax of that country of persons resident in that country shall, except as otherwise provided by the legislation and subject to the next following Article of this Agreement, have the like effect on exemptions from that tax which persons enjoy as not resident in that country but resident in the other of the two countries, and the enactment of such legislation shall not affect the continuance in force of the said Agreement of 1926, as amended by Agreements of the 25th April, 1928, the 21st July, 1947, and the 4th April, 1959, and this Agreement

Article 2

If the Government of either country represents that any provisions of lejgislation enacted in the other country, being provisions falling within Article 1 of this Agreement, are nevertheless not within the intention of the Agreement, the two Governments shall consult and if they agree that Article 1 ought not to apply the Government of the country in which the legislation was enacted shall take the necessary steps to secure that the said provisions shall not affect, or be deemed to have affected, exemptions from the income tax of that country which persons enjoy as not resident therein but resident in the other country.

Article 3

This Agreement shall become effective on the exchange of notes confirming that the necessary steps have been taken to give it the force of law in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and thereafter shall remain effective only so long as it has the force of law in both countries.

Dated this 23rd day of June, 1960.

(5) For the purposes of this section, an exhibitor’s failure to comply with any requirement of this section shall be deemed to have been due to circumstances beyond his control if, owing to the character of the films available or to the excessive cost of such films, it was not commercially practicable to comply with that requirement

1960

Charities , 1960

Ch. 58

703

(ii) cannot be carried out, or not according to the directions given and to the spirit of the gift; or

(b) where the original purposes provide a use for part only of the property available by virtue of the gift; or

(c) where the property available by virtue of the gift and

other property applicable for similar purposes can be more effectively used in conjunction, and to that end can suitably, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, be made applicable to common purposes; or id) where the original purposes were laid down by reference to an area which then was but has since ceased to be a unit for some other purpose, or by reference to a class of persons or to an area which has for any reason since ceased to be suitable, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, or to be practical in administering the gift; or

(e) where the original purposes, in whole or in part, have, since they were laid down,—

(i) been adequately provided for by other means;

or

(ii) ceased, as being useless or harmful to the community or for other reasons, to be in law charitable ; or

(iii) ceased in any other way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property available by virtue of the gift, regard being had to the spirit of the gift.

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not affect the conditions which must be satisfied in order that property given for charitable purposes may be applied cy-prfcs, except in so far as those conditions require a failure of the original purposes.

(3) References in the foregoing subsections to the original purposes of a gift shall be construed, where the application of the property given has been altered or regulated by a scheme or otherwise, as referring to the purposes for which the property is for the time being applicable.

(4) Without prejudice to the power to make schemes in circumstances falling within subsection (1) above, the court may by scheme made under the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities, in any case where the purposes for which the property is held are laid down by reference to any such area as is mentioned in the first column in the Third Schedule to this Act, provide for enlarging the area to any such area as is mentioned in the second column in the same entry in that Schedule.

(5) It is hereby declared that a trust for charitable purposes places a trustee under a duty, where the case permits and

requires the property or some part of it to be applied cy-prfcs, to secure its effective use for charity by taking steps to enable it to be so applied.

14.—(1) Property given for specific charitable purposes which fail shall be applicable cy^pres as if given for charitable purposes generally, where it belongs—

(a) to a donor who, after such advertisements and inquiries

as are reasonable, cannot be identified or cannot be found; or

(b) to a donor who has executed a written disclaimer of his

right to have the property returned.

(2) For the purposes of this section property shall be conclusively presumed (without any advertisement or inquiry) to belong to donors who cannot be identified, in so far as it consists—

(b) of the proceeds of any lottery, competition, entertain-

ment, sale or similar money-raising activity, after allowing for property given to provide prizes or articles for sale or otherwise to enable the activity to be undertaken.

(3) The court may by order direct that property not falling within subsection (2) above shall for the purposes of this section be treated (without any advertisement or inquiry) as belonging to donors who cannot be identified, where it appears to the court either—

(a) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the

amounts likely to be returned to the donors, to incur expense with a view to returning die property; or

(b) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the

nature, circumstances and amount of the gifts, and to the lapse of time since the gifts were made, for the donors to expect the property to be returned.

(4) Where property is applied cy-prfcs by virtue of this section, the donor shall be deemed to have parted with all his interest at the time when the gift was made; but where property is so applied as belonging to donors who cannot be identified or cannot be found, and is not so applied by virtue of subsection (2) or (3) above,—

(a) the scheme shall specify the total amount of that

property; and

(b) the donor of any part of that amount shall be entitled,

if he makes a claim not later that twelve months after the date on which the scheme is made, to recover from

(c) the scheme may include directions as to the provision to be made for meeting any such claim.

(5) For the purposes of this section, charitable purposes shall be deemed to “ fail ” where any difficulty in applying property to those purposes makes that property or the pah not applicable cy-pr&s available to be returned to the donors.

(6) In this section, except in so far as the context otherwise requires, references to a donor include persons claiming through or under the original donor, and references to property given include the property for the time being representing the property originally given or property derived from it.

(7) This section shall apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before the commencement of this Act.

15,—(1) Where a Royal charter establishing or regulating a Charities body corporate is amendable by the grant and acceptance of a governed by further charter, a scheme relating to the body corporate or to the ^jgror by administration of property held by the body (including a scheme statute, for the cy-pr&s application of any such property) may be made by the court under the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities notwithstanding that the scheme cannot take effect without the alteration of the charter, but shall be so framed that the scheme, or such part of it as cannot take effect without the alteration of the charter, does not purport to come into operation unless or until Her Majesty thinks fit to amend the charter in such manner as will permit the scheme or that part of it to have effect

(2) Where under the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities or the corresponding jurisdiction of a court in Northern Ireland, or under powers conferred by this Act or by any enactment relating to charities of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, a scheme is made with respect to a body corporate, and it appears to Her Majesty expedient, having regard to the scheme, to amend any Royal charter relating to that body. Her Majesty may, on the application of that body, amend the charter accordingly by Order in Council in any way in which the charter could be amended by the grant and acceptance of a further charter; and any such Order in Council may be revoked or varied in like manner as the charter it amends.

(3) The jurisdiction of the court with respect to charities shall not be excluded or restricted in the case of a charity of any description mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to this Act by the

a charity, or is comprised in any testamentary gift to a charity, die property may with the agreement of the official custodian for charities be transferred to him; and his receipt for any such property comprised in a testamentary gift to a charity shall be a complete discharge of the personal representative.

(c) an advance of any amount to a person other than a body corporate, being a person who is, after the advance is made to him, indebted to the building society (taking into account the advance in question and all other debts of any description, whether immediately repayable or not) in an amount exceeding five thousand pounds, or such other sum as may be prescribed under this section.

For the purposes of paragraph (c) of this subsection, the amount in which a person is indebted to the building society shall be ascertained both immediately after the making of the advance and also at the end of a period of three months beginning with the date of the advance or (if sooner) at the end of the financial year in which the advance was made; and that paragraph shall not apply to an advance to any person so as to make it a special advance unless either the amount

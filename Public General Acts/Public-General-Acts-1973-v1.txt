a new rate or issue a new precept or requisition, as the case
may be.

as appear to him to be expedient.

loan under this section, there are two or more rates of interest
for the time being determined by the Treasury as mentioned in

regulations under section 33 of the Education Act 1944
( which relates in particular to the approval of schools
as special schools) ; and
( c ) make such modifications of any trust deed or other
instrument relating to or regulating any institution that
provides or is concerned in the provision of educational
services, or is concerned in educational research, as,
after consultation with the persons responsible for the

100 of the Education Act 1944 (which authorises the
making of grants in aid of educational services or
research ) ;
and any modification made by an order under this subsection

mentary provisions contained in Schedule 1 to this Act.
( 4 ) The enactments mentioned in Schedule 2 to this Act

2.-( 1 ) Where the premises of a voluntary school have ceased
( before or after the coming into force of this section) to be
used for a voluntary school, or in the opinion of the Secretary
of State it is likely they will cease to be so used, then subject
to subsections (2) to ( 4) below he may by order made by
statutory instrument make new provision as to the use of any
endowment shown to his satisfaction to be or have been held
wholly or partly for or in connection with the provision at the
school of religious education in accordance with the tenets of a
particular religious denomination ; and for purposes of this
section " endowment " includes property not subject to any
restriction on the expenditure of capital.
( 2) No order shall be made under subsection ( 1) above except
on the application of the persons appearing to the Secretary of
State to be the appropriate authority of the denomination con-
cerned ; and the Secretary of State shall, not less than one month
before making an order under that subsection, give notice of
the proposed order and of the right of persons interested to make
representations on it , and shall take into account any repre-
sentations that may be made to him by any person interested
therein before the order is made ; and the notice shall be given-
( a ) by giving to any persons appearing to the Secretary of
State to be trustees of an endowment affected by the
proposed order a notice of the proposal to make it ,
together with a draft or summary of the provisions
proposed to be included ; and
( b) by publishing in such manner as the Secretary of State
thinks sufficient for informing any other persons
interested a notice of the proposal to make the order
and of the place where any person interested may
( during a period of not less than a month ) inspect
such a draft or summary, and by keeping a draft or
summary available for inspection in accordance with
the notice.
( 3) An order under subsection ( 1) above may require or
authorise the disposal by sale or otherwise of any land or other
property forming part of an endowment affected by the order,
including the premises of the school and any teacher's dwelling-
house ; and in the case of land liable to revert under the third
proviso to section 2 of the School Sites Act 1841 the Secretary
of State may by order exclude the operation of that proviso, if
he is satisfied either-
( a) that the person to whom the land would revert in
accordance with the proviso cannot after due enquiry
be found ; or
( b) that, if that person can be found, he has consented
to relinquish his rights in relation to the land under the
c .16
Education Act 1973 151
proviso and that , if he has consented so to do in con-
sideration of the payment of a sum of money to him,
adequate provision can be made for the payment to him
of that sum out of the proceeds of disposal of the land.
( 4 ) Subject to subsection (3) above and to any provision
affecting the endowments of any public general Act of Parlia-
ment, an order under subsection (1) above shall establish and
give effect, with a view to enabling the denomination concerned
to participate more effectively in the administration of the
statutory system of public education, to a scheme or schemes for
the endowments dealt with by the order to be used for appro-
priate educational purposes, either in connection with voluntary
schools or partly in connection with voluntary schools and partly
in other ways related to the locality served or formerly served
by the voluntary school at the premises that have gone or are
to go out of use for such a school ; and for this purpose 66
use
for appropriate educational purposes " means use for educational
purposes in connection with the provision of religious education
in accordance with the tenets of the denomination concerned.
(5) A scheme given effect under this section may provide
for the retention of the capital of any endowment and
application of the accruing income or may authorise the appli-
cation or expenditure of capital to such extent and subject to
such conditions as may be determined by or in accordance with
the scheme ; and any such scheme may provide for the endow-
ments thereby dealt with or any part of them to be added to
any existing endowment applicable for any such purpose as is
authorised for the scheme by subsection (4) above.
(6 ) An order under subsection ( 1) above may include any such
incidental or supplementary provisions as appear to the Secretary
of State to be necessary or expedient either for the bringing into
force or for the operation of any scheme thereby established,
including in particular provisions for the appointment and
powers of trustees of the property comprised in the scheme or,
if the property is not all applicable for the same purposes, of
any part of that property, and for the property or any part of
it to vest by virtue of the scheme in the first trustees under the
scheme or trustees of any endowment to which it is to be added
or, if not so vested, to be transferred to them.
( 7 ) Any order under this section shall have effect notwith-
standing any Act of Parliament (not being a public general
Act), letters patent or other instrument relating to, or trust
affecting, the endowments dealt with by the order ; but section
15(3) of the Charities Act 1960 ( by virtue of which the court 1960 с. 58 .

2 of the Education Act 1973."

to inquire, so far as it reasonably can, into the facts alleged
by the petitioner and into any facts alleged by the respondent.

c. 18
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 167

other after that time shall be disregarded in determining for
the purposes of section 1 ( 2)( a) above whether the petitioner

(3) Where in any proceedings for divorce the petitioner
alleges that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the
petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, but

period or periods after the date of the occurence of the final
incident relied on by the petitioner and held by the court to

lived apart has been continuous, no account shall be taken of

section a husband and wife shall be treated as living apart

of ensuring that where in pursuance of section 1 ( 2)(d ) above
the petitioner alleges that the respondent consents to a decree
being granted the respondent has been given such information
as will enable him to understand the consequences to him of
his consenting to a decree being granted and the steps which
he must take to indicate that he consents to the grant of a
decree.

period of three years from the date of the marriage (hereafter
in this section referred to as " the specified period ").

allow the presentation of a petition for divorce within the
specified period on the ground that the case is one of excep-
tional hardship suffered by the petitioner or of exceptional
depravity on the part of the respondent ; but in determining the
application the judge shall have regard to the interests of any
child of the family and to the question whether there is reason-
able probability of a reconciliation between the parties during
the specified period.
( 3) If it appears to the court, at the hearing of a petition for
divorce presented in pursuance of leave granted under sub-
section ( 2) above, that the leave was obtained by the petitioner
by any misrepresentation or concealment of the nature of the
case, the court may-
( a ) dismiss the petition, without prejudice to any petition
which may be brought after the expiration of the
specified period upon the same facts, or substantially
the same facts, as those proved in support of the dis-
missed petition ; or
( b ) if it grants a decree, direct that no application to make
the decree absolute shall be made during the specified

Courts) Act 1960 or any corresponding enactments in force in
Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or any of the Channel
Islands.

by reference to which it was granted, but shall not grant a
decree of divorce without receiving evidence from the petitioner.

Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 169
( 3) Where a petition for divorce in such a case follows a decree of judicial separation or an order containing a provision
exempting one party to the marriage from the obligation to
cohabit with the other, for the purposes of that petition a period
of desertion immediately preceding the institution of the pro-
ceedings for the decree or order shall, if the parties have not
resumed cohabitation and the decree or order has been con-
tinuously in force since it was granted, be deemed immediately
to precede the presentation of the petition.
PART I
5.- (1 ) The respondent to a petition for divorce in which the Refusal of
decree in

the person so liable,
the amount received by the person entitled to payments under
the order in respect of a period after those circumstances
changed or after the death of the person liable to make payments
under the order, as the case may be, exceeds the amount which
the person so liable or his or her personal representatives should

to the application to pay to the applicant such sum, not
exceeding the amount of the excess, as the court thinks just.

order containing financial arrangements, then-

( b) any other financial arrangements contained in the agree-
ment shall not thereby be rendered void or unenforce-
able and shall, unless they are void or unenforceable

36 below ) , be binding on the parties to the agreement.
( 2 ) In this section and in section 35 below-

and liabilities with respect to the maintenance or
education of any child, whether or not a child of
the family.
35.- ( 1) Where a maintenance agreement is for the time
being subsisting and each of the parties to the agreement is for
the time being either domiciled or resident in England and
Wales, then, subject to subsection ( 3) below, either party may
apply to the court or to a magistrates' court for an order under
this section.
( 2 ) If the court to which the application is made is satisfied
either-
( a) that by reason of a change in the circumstances in the
light of which any financial arrangements contained
in the agreement were made or, as the case may be,
financial arrangements were omitted from it (including
a change foreseen by the parties when making the
agreement ) , the agreement should be altered so as
to make different, or, as the case may be, so as to
contain, financial arrangements, or
( b) that the agreement does not contain proper financial
arrangements with respect to any child of the family,
then subject to subsections ( 3), ( 4) and ( 5) below, that court may
by order make such alterations in the agreement-
( i) by varying or revoking any financial arrangements con-
tained in it, or
(ii ) by inserting in it financial arrangements for the benefit
of one of the parties to the agreement or of a child
of the family,
as may appear to that court to be just having regard to all the
circumstances, including, if relevant, the matters mentioned in
section 25(3) above ; and the agreement shall have effect there-
after as if any alteration made by the order had been made
by agreement between the parties and for valuable consideration .
( 3) A magistrates' court shall not entertain an application
under subsection (1) above unless both the parties to the agree-
ment are resident in England and Wales and at least one of
the parties is resident in the petty sessions area (within the
meaning of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1952 ) for which the
court acts, and shall not have power to make any order on
such an application except-
( a ) in a case where the agreement includes no provision for
periodical payments by either of the parties, an order
с. 18
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 191
inserting provision for the making by one of the parties
of periodical payments for the maintenance of the
other party or for the maintenance of any child of the
family ;
( b) in a case where the agreement includes provision for
the making by one of the parties of periodical pay-
ments, an order increasing or reducing the rate of, or
terminating, any of those payments.
( 4 ) Where a court decides to alter, by order under this section,
an agreement by inserting provision for the making or securing
by one of the parties to the agreement of periodical payments
for the maintenance of the other party or by increasing the rate
of the periodical payments which the agreement provides shall
be made by one of the parties for the maintenance of the other,
the term for which the payments or, as the case may be, the
additional payments attributable to the increase are to be made
under the agreement as altered by the order shall be such term
as the court may specify, subject to the following limits, that
is to say-
(a) where the payments will not be secured, the term shall
be so defined as not to extend beyond the death of
either of the parties to the agreement or the remarriage
of the party to whom the payments are to be made ;
( b) where the payments will be secured, the term shall be
so defined as not to extend beyond the death or re-
marriage of that party.
( 5) Where a court decides to alter, by order under this
section, an agreement by inserting provision for the making or
securing by one of the parties to the agreement of periodical
payments for the maintenance of a child of the family or by
increasing the rate of the periodical payments which the agree
ment provides shall be made or secured by one of the parties
for the maintenance of such a child, then, in deciding the term
for which under the agreement as altered by the order the
payments, or as the case may be, the additional payments
attributable to the increase are to be made or secured for the
benefit of the child, the court shall apply the provisions of
section 29(2) and ( 3) above as to age limits as if the order in
question were a periodical payments or secured periodical pay-
ments order in favour of the child.
(6) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that
nothing in this section or in section 34 above affects any power
of a court before which any proceedings between the parties to
a maintenance agreement are brought under any other enact-
ment (including a provision of this Act) to make an order

to apply for such an order in such proceedings.
36.-( 1 ) Where a maintenance agreement within the meaning
of section 34 above provides for the continuation of payments
under the agreement after the death of one of the parties and
that party dies domiciled in England and Wales, the surviving
party or the personal representatives of the deceased party
may, subject to subsections ( 2) and ( 3) below, apply to the High
Court or a county court for an order under section 35 above.
( 2) An application under this section shall not, except with the
permission of the High Court or a county court, be made after
the end of the period of six months from the date on which
representation in regard to the estate of the deceased is first
taken out.
( 3) A county court shall not entertain an application under
this section, or an application for permission to make an appli-
cation under this section, unless it would have jurisdiction by
virtue of section 7 of the Family Provision Act 1966 (which
confers jurisdiction on county courts in proceedings under the
Inheritance ( Family Provision ) Act 1938 or section 26 of
the Matrimonial Causes Act 1965 if the value of the deceased's
net estate does not exceed £5,000 or such larger sum as may be
fixed by order of the Lord Chancellor) to hear and determine
proceedings for an order under section 26 of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 1965 (application for maintenance out of deceased's
estate by former spouse) in relation to the deceased's estate.
( 4 ) If a maintenance agreement is altered by a court on an
application made in pursuance of subsection (1) above, the like
consequences shall ensue as if the alteration had been made
immediately before the death by agreement between the parties
and for valuable consideration.
( 5) The provisions of this section shall not render the personal
representatives of the deceased liable for having distributed any
part of the estate of the deceased after the expiration of the
period of six months referred to in subsection (2) above on
the ground that they ought to have taken into account the
possibility that a court might permit an application by virtue
of this section to be made by the surviving party after that
period; but this subsection shall not prejudice any power to
recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue
of the making of an order in pursuance of this section.

relief, about to make any disposition or to transfer
out of the jurisdiction or otherwise deal with any
property, make such order as it thinks fit for restraining
the other party from so doing or otherwise for pro-

of defeating the applicant's claim for financial relief, it shall be
presumed, unless the contrary is shown, that the person who

did so or, as the case may be, is about to do so, with the
intention of defeating the applicant's claim for financial relief.
(6) In this section " disposition " does not include any pro-

shall not be entitled to bring proceedings in respect of a cause
of action arising out of the circumstances mentioned in para-

the remarriage of the person entitled to payments
under it, and
( b) in the case of the collecting officer, for any act done
by him after that date in accordance with any enact-
ment or rule of court specifying how payments made
to him in compliance with the attachment of earnings
order are to be dealt with,
if , but only if , the act was one which he would have been under

order is made is incapable, by reason of mental disorder within
the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1959, of managing and
administering his or her property and affairs then, subject to any
order, direction or authority made or given in relation to that

time be reasonably practicable.
( 2) It shall be the duty of the Authority-
( a ) to provide the television and local sound broadcasting
services as a public service for disseminating informa-
tion, education and entertainment ;
( b) to ensure that the programmes broadcast by the
Authority in each area maintain a high general
standard in all respects, and in particular in respect

wide range in their subject -matter, having regard both
to the programmes as a whole and also to the days
of the week on which, and the times of the day at
which, the programmes are broadcast ; and
( c ) to secure a wide showing or (as the case may be)
hearing for programmes of merit.
( 3) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on the
Authority by this Act , the programmes broadcast by the Auth-
ority shall, so far as may be consistently with the observance

wise than by programme contractors for the purpose
of securing the inclusion in the programmes broadcast

gramme contractors ;
( b ) apart from the provision of such items, arrange for the
provision ( by programme contractors or otherwise)
of, or (if need be ) themselves provide, programmes or
parts of programmes so far as may be necessary by
reason of any temporary lack of suitable persons

obligations as such, or by reason of any interval
between the expiration or termination of one contract
with a programme contractor and the commencement
of another contract with that or another programme

persons, acquire such property and do such things as may
appear to them to be necessary or expedient.
( 3) Without prejudice to the generality of the preceding
provisions of this section, the powers of the Authority shall

other rights in respect of the broadcasting of any matters in

directions which may be given to him under this
subsection and, when any such directions have been
given to him, to enable the other programme contractor
to include the item to which the directions relate in
any comparable programme of his ; and
(b) that if financial and other arrangements for the supply
of any item in respect of which directions have been

the two programme contractors, or when so agreed do
not receive the approval of the Authority required
by virtue of subsection ( 2) of this section, the item will
be supplied in accordance with such financial and other
arrangements as may be determined by the Authority.
( 2 ) The contracts between the Authority and the various
programme contractors shall provide that, where items to be
included in the programmes of a programme contractor are not
originated by that programme contractor, the financial and
other arrangements between the programme contractor and the
supplier shall require the approval of the Authority-
( a ) in all cases where the supplier is another programme

resolution of the House of Commons for the time being in force
applicable to contracts of Government departments ; and if any
dispute arises as to what wages ought to be paid, or what con-

Arbitration Board upon a dispute referred to that Board under
this section, then, as from the date of the award or from such
other date, not being earlier than the date on which the dispute

under the contract shall, until varied in accordance with the
provisions of this section, be in accordance with the award.
( 3) In relation to employment in Northern Ireland, the

Contracts for local sound broadcasts
17.-( 1 ) Before entering into a sound programme contract the Accumulation
Authority shall seek to ascertain- of interests
insound
( a) whether the person or any of the persons with whom programme
the contract is proposed to be made is ( either alone or contracts.
in partnership with one or more other persons) entitled
to the benefit of one or more existing sound programme
contracts ; and
(b) where the person or any of the persons with whom the
contract is proposed to be made is a body corporate,
whether that body corporate, or any associate of that
body corporate, or any participant in that body cor-
porate or in any such associate, is a person or one
of the persons entitled to the benefit of one or more
existing sound programme contracts, or is a participant
in a body corporate so entitled or included among the
persons so entitled or in an associate of a body cor-
porate so entitled or so included ;
and, having regard to any matters ascertained by them under
this subsection, the Authority shall consider whether, if the
proposed contract were made, any one person would, in any
one or more of the capacities mentioned in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this subsection or in any combination of any such capa-
cities, have an aggregate interest in the benefit of two or more
sound programme contracts.
( 2 ) If, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection ( 1) of this
section, it appears to the Authority that a person would have
such an aggregate interest and that, having regard to-
( a ) the nature and extent of that aggregate interest , and
( b) any other circumstances appearing to the Authority to
bematerial,
the existence of that aggregate interest might prejudice the per-
formance by the Authority of any duty imposed on them by

с.19
Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973
this Act in relation to local sound broadcasting services, the
Authority shall refrain from entering into the proposed contract.
( 3) In this section " sound programme contract " means a
contract for the provision of local sound broadcasts, and " exist-
ing sound programme contract ", in relation to any contract
proposed to be entered into by the Authority, means a sound
programme contract which is in force at the time when the
Authority are considering entering into the proposed contract ;
and " participant ", in relation to a body corporate, means a
person who (whether alone or jointly with one or more other
persons, and whether directly or through one or more nominees)
holds or is beneficially entitled to not less than one-twentieth of
the shares in that body corporate.
18.-(1 ) This section applies to any contract made between
the Authority and a programme contractor, where the pro-
gramme contractor is a body corporate and the contract requires
local sound broadcasts to be provided by the contractor and
to be transmitted from one or more stations specified in the
contract.
( 2) Subject to section 19 of this Act, before the Authority
enter into a contract to which this section applies-
( a) they shall consider, in relation to the locality served or
to be served by the station or stations to be specified
in the contract (in this section referred to as " the
relevant locality "), whether there is any newspaper
which circulates wholly or mainly in that locality and
is a newspaper in respect of which the appropriate
conditions are fulfilled ; and
(b) the Authority shall fix a date before which representa-
tions may be made to the Authority under subsection
( 4) of this section and shall cause notice of that date
to be given or published as may appear to the Auth-
ority to be appropriate for bringing it to the attention
of persons who in their opinion are likely to be
affected by it.
( 3) For the purposes of this section the appropriate conditions
shall be taken to be fulfilled in respect of a newspaper if it has
in the relevant locality a circulation which, in the opinion of the
Authority, represents a substantial proportion of the population
of that locality, unless the Authority are satisfied that the broad-
casting of the programmes to be provided under the contract
in question is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the
financial position of the newspaper.
( 4 ) The appropriate conditions shall also be taken for the
purposes of this section to be fulfilled in respect of a newspaper
Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 c. 19 249
if, on representations being made to the Authority by or on
behalf of the proprietor of the newspaper before the date fixed
under subsection (2) (b) of this section, the Authority are satisfied
that (notwithstanding that its circulation falls short of the pro-
portion mentioned in subsection (3) of this section) the broad-
casting of the programmes to be provided under the contract in
question is likely to have a materially adverse effect on the
financial position of the newspaper.
( 5) Where it appears to the Authority that the appropriate
conditions are fulfilled in respect of a newspaper, then, subject
to section 19 of this Act, the Authority shall not enter into the
contract unless they are satisfied that-
(a ) arrangements have been made for enabling the pro-
prietor of the newspaper to acquire, on terms approved
by the Authority, a shareholding consisting of such
number of shares of such descriptions as may be so
approved ; and
( b) either the acquisition of the shareholding has been
completed, or it will be completed within a reasonable
time, or the proprietor of the newspaper has declined
to acquire it on the terms approved by the Authority.
( 6) The number and description of shares to be approved for
the purposes of any such arrangements-
( a) in the case of a newspaper which is the only local news-
paper circulating in the relevant locality, or the only
local newspaper having a substantial circulation in
that locality, shall not be such as to enable the pro-
prietor of the newspaper to obtain control over the
programme contractor ; but
( b) in any other case, or (in a case falling within the pre-
ceding paragraph) to such extent as is consistent with
that paragraph, shall be such as the Authority consider
appropriate, having regard to the adverse effect which
the broadcasting of the programmes to be provided
under the contract in question is likely to have on the
financial position of the newspaper.
( 7) Any terms approved by the Authority under subsection
( 5 ) (a) of this section shall be such as, in the opinion of the
Authority, will enable the shareholding to be acquired at a
price not exceeding its current market value or (if it has no
current market value) a price not exceeding a fair valuation of
the shareholding.
( 8) In this section and section 19 of this Act " newspaper
"
does not include any publication which is not printed for sale or
which is published at intervals of more than seven days, and
250 с.19 Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973

is a body corporate, means a holding of shares in that body
corporate.
Provisions 19.-( 1) Notwithstanding anything in section 18 of this Act,
supplementary the Authority shall not require arrangements to be made in
to section 18. relation to a newspaper as mentioned in subsection ( 5 ) of that
section if it is their opinion that it would be contrary to the
public interest for the proprietor of that newspaper to acquire
a shareholding in accordance with subsection ( 6) of that section,
and the Minister concurs in that opinion.
(2) Every contract to which that section applies shall include
provisions whereby, if during the currency of the contract
arrangements are made for extending ( otherwise than by way
of any minor modification ) the range of transmission of pro-
grammes to be provided under the contract, whether by an
alteration in the construction or operation of one or more
stations or by the addition of one or more stations or otherwise,
subsections ( 2) to (7) of that section and subsection ( 1) of this
section shall have effect in relation to those arrangements as if
they were a contract to which that section applies .
( 3) The Authority shall not be required to act in accordance
with subsections (2) to (7) of section 18 of this Act in connec-
tion with the making of a contract with a programme contractor
if-
( a ) the contract is to specify the same station as was, or the
same stations as were, specified in a previous contract
to which that section applied (whether the previous
contract was with the same programme contractor or a
different programme contractor) ; and
( b ) the range or aggregate range of transmission of broad-
casts under the new contract is not to be greater
(otherwise than by way of any minor modification)
than under the previous contract.
(4 ) Where subsection ( 3) of this section applies, it shall not
be construed as precluding the Authority from requiring such
arrangements as are mentioned in subsections (5) to (7) of
section 18 of this Act to be made in connection with the new
contract in respect of a newspaper whose proprietor acquired
a shareholding in accordance with such arrangements in connec-
tion with the previous contract , if it appears to the Authority
that by reason of special circumstances it would be just and
equitable to do so.

the Authority regard as necessary in order to discharge
their duty under section 25( 2) of this Act in relation to
that branch of their undertaking ; and

of this section, but not so as to create an accounting period of
more than 12 months.
(10 ) If part of an accounting period falls before, and part
after, the date on which an order under subsection (6) of this
section takes effect, the two parts shall be treated for the
purposes of this section and section 27 of this Act as separate
accounting periods.
Provisions
27.-(1) The contracts between the Authority and the
supplemental programme contractors for the provision of television pro-
to section 26. grammes-

for any accounting period at monthly intervals in that
period, for the computation of the amount, if any, of
the additional payments due by reference to the
advertising receipts for the part of the accounting
period down to the latest date of which account is
taken in the computation, and for the making of
additional payments in accordance with the compu-
tations (and after giving credit for any payments
already made) not later than four weeks from the said
latest date ; and
(b) shall authorise the Authority, in a case where a pro-
gramme contractor fails to make a return required by

Authority to be incomplete or inaccurate, to estimate
the amount of the additional payments due, and shall
provide that the amount estimated shall be treated as
payable, unless the contrary is proved ; and
(c) shall provide that where for any insertion of an
advertisement a programme contractor receives or is
entitled to an entire consideration not solely referable

to an apportionment made in such manner as any
such contract may provide,
and it shall be the duty of the Authority in framing the contracts
with the various programme contractors to include such terms
as are in their opinion necessary or expedient to ensure that

section and section 26 of this Act are paid promptly and in full.
( 2 ) The contracts between the Authority and the various
programme contractors for the provision of television pro-

deduction of commission by persons acting as advertising agents ,
the amount of the advertising receipts of a programme contractor
is not reduced under arrangements by which any part of the
consideration for the insertion of advertisements in programmes
provided by the programme contractor is receivable by any
person other than the programme contractor, whether that
person is under the control of the programme contractor or not.
( 3) Every contract between the Authority and a programme
contractor which provides for the supply of television pro-
grammes to be broadcast from stations of which some are in
Great Britain and some in Northern Ireland shall provide that,
as regards his advertising receipts for any period, the programme
contractor shall give to the Authority such information as they
may require for the purpose of ascertaining the proportions in
which those receipts derive from the broadcasting of advertise-
ments from stations in Great Britain and stations in Northern
Ireland respectively.
( 4 ) On receipt of any additional payments the Authority shall
deal with them as follows : -
(a) if they were paid under a contract for the supply of
programmes to be broadcast from stations all of which
are in Great Britain, the Authority shall pay them

programmes to be broadcast from stations all of which
are in Northern Ireland, the Authority shall pay them

( 3) Subject to section 17 below, a Measure shall have the
same force and effect as an Act of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom.
( 4 ) This section does not affect the power of the Parliament
of the United Kingdom to make laws for Northern Ireland but,
subject to the said section 17, a Measure may amend or repeal
any provision made by or under any Act of Parliament in so far
as it is part of the law of Northern Ireland.

in accordance with this section in relation to a proposed Measure
which contains any provision dealing with an excepted matter or
reserved matter; and the Secretary of State shall not give his

provision dealing with an excepted matter unless he considers
that the provision is ancillary to other provisions ( whether in
that Measure or previously enacted) dealing with reserved
matters or transferred matters.
(2) Every proposed Measure introduced in the Assembly
shall be considered by the Clerk to the Assembly on introduction
and if-
(a) he considers that it contains any provision dealing with
an excepted matter or reserved matter ; and

Secretary of State has consented to the Assembly
considering the proposed Measure,

Secretary of State's consent to the Measure is signified or the
Assembly is informed that in his opinion the Measure does not
contain any such provision as aforesaid.
( 4 ) Neither subsection (2) nor subsection ( 3) above shall
require the Clerk to the Assembly to refer any proposed
Measure to the Secretary of State, or preclude the Assembly from
proceeding with a proposed Measure, by reason only that it
contains a provision which, in the opinion of the Clerk, is
ancillary to other provisions ( whether in that Measure or
previously enacted) dealing with transferred matters only.
( 5) Every proposed Measure passed by the Assembly shall be
transmitted to the Secretary of State for submission to Her
Majesty in Council but if-
( a) he considers that it contains any provision dealing with
an excepted matter or reserved matter ; and
( b) it has not been referred to him under subsection (3)
above (whether by virtue of subsection ( 4) above or
otherwise ),
he shall not submit the Measure to Her Majesty in Council
unless he consents to the Measure.

Measure passed by the Assembly he shall refer it back to the

the Assembly and again transmitted to him, subsection ( 5) above
shall apply to it as if it were a new proposed Measure trans-
mitted to him after being passed by the Assembly.
(7 ) For the purposes of this section a provision is ancillary to
other provisions if it is a provision which is necessary or
expedient for making those other provisions effective or which
provides for the enforcement of those other provisions or which
is otherwise incidental to, or consequential on, those provisions ;
and references in this section to provisions previously enacted
are references to provisions contained in, or in any instrument
made under, another Measure, an Act of the Parliament of the
United Kingdom or an Act of the Parliament of Northern
Ireland.

Interpretation
23.-( 1 ) For the purposes of this Part of this Act a Measure,
and
an Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland or any other instru-

treats that person or that class less favourably in any circum-
stances than other persons are treated in those circumstances by
the law for the time being in force in Northern Ireland.
( 2) For those purposes a person discriminates against another
person or a class of persons if he treats that other person or
that class less favourably in any circumstances than he treats
or would treat other persons in those circumstances .
( 3) No Measure, Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland or
other instrument and no act done by any person shall be treated
for the purposes of this Act as discriminating if the instrument
has the effect, or, as the case may be, the act is done for the
purpose, of safeguarding national security or protecting public
safety or public order .
( 4) A certificate purporting to be signed by or on behalf of
the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the
certificate was done for the purpose of safeguarding national
security shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that
purpose.
(5) No provision of this Part of this Act shall affect the
operation before the coming into force of that provision of any
Measure, Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland or other
instrument.
(6) No provision of this Part of this Act shall render unlawful
anything required or authorised to be done by any Act of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom, whenever passed.

PART I
BOUNDARIES OF WATER AUTHORITY AREAS
General
1.- (1 ) An order under section 2 above which establishes a
water authority or alters the boundaries of a water authority area
shall define the water authority area to which it relates, and any
waters comprised in it which it is necessary to define for the purpose
of the exercise of any of the water authority's functions, in such a
way that that area and any such waters can be identified by members
of the public and, without prejudice to the generality of this para-
graph, any such order may define the whole or any part of a water
authority area or of any such waters-
(a ) by reference to areas or waters defined for the purposes
of the exercise of functions relating to water in enactments
in force immediately before the passing of this Act ;
( b ) by reference to any map ;
(c ) by reference to any instrument made under an enactment ;
or partly by one of those means and partly by another or the others.
( 2) For the purposes of this Schedule a map of any area or any
waters may consist of a number of maps of parts of that area or
those waters and there may be different maps in relation to different
functions of a water authority.

by an order under section 2 above or paragraph 3, 4 or 5 below, be
low water mark on the coast of the area.
( 2 ) Subject to any order made under section 2 above, where a
river, stream or other watercourse, whether natural or artificial and

part of such a watercourse, discharges into the sea, the whole of the
mouth of the watercourse within a line from low-water mark at the
seaward extremity of one bank to low-water mark at the seaward
extremity of the other bank, or the whole of the creek within such
a line, as the case may be, shall form part of a water authority
area, and, if both banks are in the same water authority area, shall
form part of that water authority area.
( 3) Where the entrance to a dock is on the coast, the whole of the
dock shall form part of a water authority area, and, if both sides
of the dock are in the same water authority area, shall form part of
that water authority area .
( 4 ) Where sub-paragraph (2) or sub-paragraph ( 3) above applies,
but the banks of the watercourse or creek or the sides of the dock,
as the case may be, are in different water authority areas, an order
under section 2 above may designate the water authority area in
which any part of the watercourse, creek or dock is to be comprised.
3. In any such case as is mentioned in paragraph 2( 4 ) above, an
order under section 2 above may designate any tidal waters and
direct that, so far as they are below low-water mark, they shall be
excluded from all the water authority areas ; and an order made
solely for that purpose may designate the waters to which it applies
as being all tidal waters which, in so far as they are below low-water
mark, lie to seaward of a line specified in the order by reference to
amap.

SCH. 2
prepared showing the boundaries of that area for the purposes of
the water authority's land drainage functions, the boundaries of the
water authority area as shown on the area map for the purposes
of the authority's functions relating to water conservation shall be
treated also as the boundaries of the water authority area for the
purposes of their land drainage functions.
11 .- (1 ) Where-
( a ) the area of a water authority is altered so as to affect any
of the particulars shown on their main river map, or

( a ) consult with such persons or representative bodies as they
consider it appropriate to consult at that stage ;
(b ) prepare a draft order ;
( c ) cause a notice to be published in the London Gazette and
in such other manner as they think best adapted for
informing persons affected-

15.- (1 ) Before making an order altering the boundaries of a
water authority area, the Ministers shall consider any objections
which may be duly made to the draft order, and may if they
think fit cause a local inquiry to be held with respect to any such
objections ; and the Ministers may make the order either in the form
of the draft or in that form as altered in such manner as they may
think fit, but no order shall be made so as to include in any water
authority area any tidal waters which would have been outside all
the water authority areas if the order had been made in the form
of the draft.
( 2) Subsections ( 2 ) to ( 5) of section 250 of the 1972 Act shall
apply in relation to a local inquiry under this paragraph as they

authority area the Ministers shall publish in the London Gazette,
and in such other manner as they think best adapted for informing
persons affected, a notice stating that the order has been made and
naming the places where a copy of the order may be seen at all
reasonable hours :

above applies, the notice shall not be published until the expiry of
the period of twenty-eight days referred to in that sub- paragraph, and
shall state whether or not the order is to be subject to special
parliamentary procedure.
19.- (1 ) Subject to sub-paragraph ( 2 ) below, if any person desires

the Secretary of State or the authority shall on demand be paid
to the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, the authority, by
the body in default, and shall be recoverable accordingly, and the

authority, may be necessary or expedient, and when any such order
is revoked the Secretary of State or the authority may, either by the
revoking order or by a subsequent order, make such provision as
appears to him or them to be desirable with respect to any property
or liabilities held by him or them for the purposes of the functions
transferred .

FINANCIAL PROVISIONS FOR LAND DRAINAGE
Notional local land drainage districts
10. For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule and of Part III
below, a water authority area in relation to which no scheme under
paragraph 4 or paragraph 6 above is in force shall be treated as a
single local land drainage district, and any parts of such an area in
relation to which no such scheme is in force shall be treated as
included in a single such district.
Precepts by water authorities
11 .- ( 1) For the purposes of this paragraph the aggregate amount
required to be raised by precepts to local authorities by a water
authority in respect of a local land drainage district for any financial
year shall be ascertained as follows, that is to say-
(a ) subject to paragraph ( b) below, that aggregate amount shall
be an amount equal to so much of the relevant expenditure
of the water authority for that financial year as is neither
defrayed out of any reserve fund, replacement fund or
sinking fund maintained by the authority nor defrayed out
of sums received by the authority in respect of that year
and that district otherwise than by virtue of this paга-
graph ;
( b ) there shall also be added to (or, as the case may be, deducted
from ) that amount-
( i ) any amount required to be provided in that financial
year by way of new working capital ;
( ii ) any amount required to be brought forward from a
previous financial year ;
which is required to be added or deducted in accordance
with this paragraph.
(2 ) Not later than the month of February immediately preceding
each financial year, each water authority shall estimate the aggregate
amount required to be raised for that year by precepts to local
authorities in respect of each local land drainage district in their
area ; and the amount so estimated shall be apportioned by the
water authority among the local authorities any part of whose area is
comprised in a local land drainage district on the basis of the
appropriate penny rate product for the relevant area for the relevant
year (calculated in accordance with Part III of this Schedule).
( 3) A water authority may issue precepts to local authorities
requiring payments of amounts apportioned to those authorities
under sub-paragraph ( 2 ) above ; and each such authority shall pay,
in accordance with any precept issued to them, the amount demanded
by that precept.
( 4 ) If at any time during a financial year it appears to a water
authority that the aggregate amount for which they have issued
precepts for that year in respect of any local land drainage district
will fall short of the aggregate amount required to be raised by
precept by them for that year in respect of that district , they shall
Water Act 1973 693
c . 37
estimate the amount of the deficiency ; and sub-paragraphs ( 2) and (3)
above shall have effect in relation to an amount estimated under this
sub-paragraph as they have effect in relation to an amount estimated
under sub-paragraph ( 2) above, except that the words from the
beginning of sub-paragraph (2 ) to " financial year " shall be omitted.
(5 ) Subject to sub-paragraph (6 ) below, the aggregate amount for
which precepts in respect of a local land drainage district may be
issued under this paragraph for any one financial year to a local
authority shall not , unless special consent has been obtained, exceed
1.7 times the appropriate penny rate product for the relevant area of
the authority for the relevant year.
( 6) Where a water authority have borrowed or propose to borrow
any money under this Act , if a special resolution is passed sub-
paragraph (5) above shall have effect, during the currency of the loan,
as if for the reference to 1.7 times the appropriate penny rate product
for any relevant area there were substituted a reference to such greater
amount as may be specified in the resolution.
( 7 ) In this paragraph " special consent " and " special resolution "
mean respectively a consent given and a resolution passed-
( a ) in the case of a local land drainage district with a local land
drainage committee, by a majority of the whole number of
the local authority members of that committee ; and
( b ) in the case of any other local land drainage district, by a
majority of the whole number of those of the local authority
members of the regional land drainage committee who were
appointed to that committee by or on behalf of constituent
councils any part of whose area is in the district.
( 8) It shall be the duty of a water authority to prepare, in such
form as the Minister may direct, a statement of the purposes to which
the amount demanded by any precept by the authority under this
paragraph is intended to be applied , and of the basis on which it is
calculated ; and a local authority shall not be liable to pay the
amount demanded by any such precept until they have received such
a statement.
( 9) It shall also be the duty of a water authority, as soon as
practicable after the end of each financial year, to calculate the
amount by which the amount demanded by any precept for that year
issued under this paragraph to a local authority in respect of
any relevant area exceeds, or falls short of , the amount which would
have fallen to be so demanded from that authority if the apportion-
ment under sub-paragraph ( 2 ) above had been made, in relation to
each of the local authorities referred to in that sub- paragraph, on
the basis of the actual penny rate product for that year for the
relevant area, multiplied by the appropriate factor for that year
notified to the authority with the notification of the conclusive
calculation of the amount ( if any ) of the resources element of rate
support grant payable to the authority for that year ; and-
(a ) if in any case the calculation under this sub-paragraph shows
an excess, the amount of the excess shall be recoverable by
the local authority from the water authority ;

( b ) if in any case it shows a deficiency, the amount of the
deficiency shall be recoverable by the water authority from
the local authority.
( 10 ) As soon as practicable after the end of each financial year,
each water authority shall ascertain the actual amount which was the
aggregate amount required to be raised by precept by them for that
year in respect of each local land drainage district in their area and
shall determine whether, and (if so ) how far, the aggregate amount
for which precepts have been issued by them for that year exceeds
or falls short of the amount ascertained under this sub-paragraph .
(11) If the comparison under sub- paragraph (10 ) above shows an
excess or a deficiency, the amount of the excess or deficiency shall
be brought forward to the next financial year and (if an excess) shall
be deducted, or (if a deficiency ) shall be added, in ascertaining the
aggregate amount required to be raised by precept by the water
authority for that next financial year.
(12 ) The duty imposed on water authorities by sub-paragraph ( 2 )
above shall apply in relation to the financial year beginning on
1st April 1974 as it applies in relation to any subsequent financial
year ; and the power of a water authority to issue precepts under
sub-paragraph ( 3) above shall accordingly be exercisable before that

age charge in respect of any local land drainage district
unless the regional land drainage committee for the
authority's area have recommended that such a charge
should be raised.

Schedule 5 to the Water Act 1973 in respect of
the year for which the charge is raised by the
aggregate amount of the appropriate penny rate

demanded was apportioned in pursuance of the
said sub -paragraph ( 2) ; and
(b ) multiplying the quotient by one new penny and
by such number as the Minister may specify
by order made for the purposes of this para-
graph .
( 2 ) The number specified in an order made under
subsection (1) above shall ( apart from any adjustment
made to it to take account of rough grazing land ) be such
as the Minister considers will secure, so far as reasonably
practicable, that the aggregate amount produced by
any charge levied by reference to a quotient ascertained
in pursuance of subsection (1) ( a ) above will be equal
to the aggregate amount which, if the chargeable land
in the local land drainage district were liable to be
rated, would be produced by a rate levied on that land
at an amount in the pound ( of rateable value ) equal
to that quotient multiplied by one new penny.
( 3) An order under this section may be made so as
to apply either to all general drainage charges or to
the general drainage charges proposed to be raised in
any one or more water authority areas specified in the
order or in any one or more local land drainage districts

year .
( 3) The appropriate penny rate product for each relevant
area of the authority for the relevant year shall be the product of
a rate of one new penny in the pound for that area for that year

THE INDEX TO
THE STATUTES IN FORCE
These two volumes (A-K, L -Z) index by subject-matter all the existing
public general statute law under well-established headings linked by
numerous cross-references. The index entries have against them
references to the enactment or enactments which support the subject
matter.
Since the references are to enactments (and not to pages of any book ) ,
the usefulness of the volumes is not limited to any particular set of
statutes.
There is a chronological table showing the headings under which each
Act or section is indexed in volumes, and a similar table for General
Synod Measures ( formerly Church Assembly Measures).
The INDEX provides a service which is of the utmost value and which
for its adaptability is unique.

(2) An appellant shall not be retried by virtue of this section for any offence other than—

(a) the offence of which he was convicted at the original trial and in respect of which his appeal is allowed as aforesaid;

(b) any offence of which he could have been convicted at the original trial on an indictment for the first-mentioned offence; or

(2) The Court of Criminal Appeal may, upon ordering a retrial under section 1 of this Act, make such orders as appear to the Court to be necessary or expedient for the custody or admission to bail of the appellant pending the retrial, or for the retention pending the retrial of any property or money forfeited, restored or paid by virtue of the original conviction or any order made on that conviction.

(3) Where a new trial is ordered under the said section 1 in the case of a person who, immediately before the determination of his appeal, was liable to be detained in pursuance of an order or direction under Part V of the Mental Health Act 1959, that order or direction shall continue in force pending the retrial as if the appeal had not been allowed and any order made by the Court of Criminal Appeal under this section for his custody or admission to bail shall have effect subject to the said order or direction.

(4) Section 1 of the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act 1930 shall apply in the case of an appellant who is to be retried by virtue of an order under section 1 of this Act as if he had been committed for trial for the offence or offences in question, and as if references in section 1(2) of that Act to the committing justices included references to the Court of Criminal Appeal; and if the appellant is acquitted on the retrial, the costs of the defence which may be ordered to be paid out of local funds under section 1 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1952 shall include—

(a) any costs which could have been ordered to be so paid

(b) if no order was made under section 3(2) or section 4 of

that Act in respect of his expenses on appeal, any sums for the payment of which such an order could have been made.

(5) On a retrial ordered under section 1 of this Act, section 13(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1925 (reading of depositions) shall not apply to the depositions of any person who gave evidence at the original trial; but a transcript of the shorthand notes of the evidence given by any witness at the original trial may, with the leave of the judge, be read as evidence—

and in either case may be so read without further proof if verified in accordance with rides of court.

3.—(1) Where a person ordered to be retried under section 1 Provisions as of this Act is again convicted on the retrial, the court before whom to sentence he is convicted may pass in respect of the offence any sentence authorised by law, not being a sentence of greater severity than on retriai. that passed on the original conviction.

(2) Without prejudice to its power to impose any other sentence, the court before whom an offender is convicted on retrial may pass in respect of the offence any sentence passed in respect of that offence on the original conviction notwithstanding that, on the date of the conviction on retrial, the offender has ceased to be of an age at which such a sentence could otherwise be passed.

(3) Where the person convicted on retrial is sentenced to imprisonment or other detention, the sentence shall begin to run from the time when a like sentence passed at the original trial would have begun to run; but in computing the term of his sentence or the period for which he may be detained thereunder, as the case may be, there shall be disregarded—

(a) any time before his conviction on retrial which would have been disregarded in computing that term or period if the sentence had been passed at the original trial and the original conviction had not been quashed; and

(b) any time during which he was at large after being admitted

to bail under section 2(2) of this Act.

(4) Section 17(2) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1962 (deduction from certain sentences of time in custody before sentence) shall apply to any sentence imposed on conviction on retrial as if it had been imposed on the original conviction.

(2) If more than one capital sum is, or is to be regarded as. obtained by the same person in respect of the lessee’s interest in the lease which constitutes a hire-purchase agreement, then, so far as in respect of one of those capital sums any deduction is made in respect of capital expenditure in pursuance of paragraph 8(1) of this Schedule, that capital expenditure shall be left out of account in applying paragraph 8 of this Schedule to any other such capital sum; and the order in which this subparagraph is applied shall be the order in which the capital sums are obtained.

(2) Subsection (1) above shall not have effect where the disposition is made in exercise of a special power of appointment, but where a period is specified under that subsection in the instrument creating such a power the period shall apply in relation to any disposition under the power as it applies in relation to the power itself.

I

Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 Ch. 55

879

have a child at the age of twelve years or over, but not under that age or over the age of fifty-five years; but

(b) in the case of a living person evidence may be given to show that he or she will or will not be able to have a child at the time in question.

(2) Where any such question is decided by treating a person as unable to have a child at a particular time, and he or she does so, the High Court may make such order as it thinks fit for placing the persons interested in the property comprised in the disposition, so far as may be just, in the position they would have held if the question had not been so decided.

(3) Subject to subsection (2) above, where any such question is decided in relation to a disposition by treating a person as able or unable to have a child at a particular time, then he or she shall be so treated for the purpose of any question which may arise on the rule against perpetuities in relation to the same disposition in any subsequent proceedings.

3.—(1) Where, apart from the provisions of this section and Uncertainty as sections 4 and 5 of this Act, a disposition would be void on the to remoteness, ground that the interest disposed of might not become vested until too remote a time, the disposition shall be treated, until such time (if any) as it becomes established that the vesting must occur, if at all, after the end of the perpetuity period, as if the disposition were not subject to the rule against perpetuities; and its becoming so established shall not affect the validity of anything previously done in relation to the interest disposed of by way of advancement, application of intermediate income or otherwise.

(2) Where, apart from the said provisions, a disposition consisting of the conferring of a general power of appointment would be void on the ground that the power might not become exercisable until too remote a time, the disposition shall be treated, until such time (if any) as it becomes established that the power will not be exercisable within the perpetuity period, as if the disposition were not subject to the rule against perpetuities.

(3) Where, apart from the said provisions, a disposition consisting of the conferring of any power, option or other right would be void on the ground that the right might be exercised

2 E 4*

880

Ch. 55 Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964

at too remote a time, the disposition shall be treated as regards any exercise of the right within the perpetuity period as if it were not subject to the rule against perpetuities and, subject to the said provisions, shall be treated as void for remoteness only if, and so far as, the right is not fully exercised within that period.

(4) Where this section applies to a disposition and the duration of the perpetuity period is not determined by virtue of section 1 or 9(2) of this Act, it shall be determined as follows: —

(a) where any persons falling within subsection (5) below

are individuals in being and ascertainable at the commencement of the perpetuity period the duration of the period shall be determined by reference to their lives and no others, but so that the lives of any description of persons falling within paragraph (b) or

period shall be twenty-one years.

(5) The said persons are as follows: —

(a) the person by whom the disposition was made;

(iv) in the case of a special power of appointment exercisable in favour of one person only, that person or, where the object of the power is ascertainable only on certain conditions being satisfied, any person as to whom some of the conditions are satisfied and the remainder may in time be satisfied;

4.—(1) Where a disposition is limited by reference to the Reduction attainment by any person or persons of a specified age exceed-of ^ge ?n(lf ing twenty-one years, and it is apparent at the time the disposi-ctemembers tion is made or becomes apparent at a subsequent time— to avoid

(a) that the disposition would, apart from this section, be remoteness.

void for remoteness, but

(b) that it would not be so void if the specified age had

been twenty-one years,

the disposition shall be treated for all purposes as if, instead of being limited by reference to the age in fact specified, it had been limited by reference to the age nearest to that age which would, if specified instead, have prevented the disposition from being so void.

(2) Where in the case of any disposition different ages exceeding twenty-one years are specified in relation to different persons—

(a) the reference in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) above

to the specified age shall be construed as a reference to all the specified ages, and

(b) that subsection shall operate to reduce each such age so far as is necessary to save the disposition from being void for remoteness.

(3) Where the inclusion of any persons, being potential members of a class or unborn persons who at birth would become members or potential members of the class, prevents the foregoing provisions of this section from operating to save a disposition from being void for remoteness, those persons shall thenceforth be deemed for all the purposes of the disposition to be excluded from the class, and the said provisions shall thereupon have effect accordingly.

(4) Where, in the case of a disposition to which subsection (3) above does not apply, it is apparent at the time the disposition is made or becomes apparent at a subsequent time that, apart from this subsection, the inclusion of any persons, being potential members of a class or unborn persons who at birth would become members or potential members of the class, would cause the disposition to be treated as void for remoteness, those persons shall, unless their exclusion would exhaust the class, thenceforth be deemed for all the purposes of the disposition to be excluded from the class.

6. A disposition shall not be treated as void for remoteness by reason only that the interest disposed of is ulterior to and dependent upon an interest under a disposition which is so void, and the vesting of an interest shall not be prevented from being accelerated on the failure of a prior interest by reason only that the failure arises because of remoteness.

7. For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, a power of appointment shall be treated as a special power unless—

(a) in the instrument creating the power it is expressed

to be exercisable by one person only, and

(b) it could, at all times during its currency when that

person is of full age and capacity, be exercised by him so as immediately to transfer to himself the whole of the interest governed by the power without the consent of any other person or compliance with any other condition, not being a formal condition relating only to the mode of exercise of the power:

Provided that for the purpose of determining whether a disposition made under a power of appointment exercisable by will only is void for remoteness, the power shall be treated as a general power where it would have fallen to be so treated if exercisable by deed. 8

(a) that having regard to the condition of the house and to

the other circumstances, any of the works of which particulars are given in the scheme (whether already carried out or not) are unreasonable in character or extent, or are unnecessary;

(b) that any of the works do not involve expenditure which

ought to be regarded as capital expenditure;

(c) that the number of individuals or households living in

the house, as specified by the local authority in the scheme, is unreasonably low;

(d) that the estimate of the surpluses on revenue account in

the scheme is unduly low on account of some assumptions, whether as to rents charged by the local authority or otherwise, made by the local authority in arriving at the estimate as to matters which are within the control of the local authority.

(2) Without prejudice to the right of appeal conferred by the foregoing subsection, either the local authority or any person having an estate or interest in the house may at any time apply to the county court for a review of the estimate of the surpluses on revenue account in the scheme.

(3) On an appeal or an application under this section the court may, as it thinks fit, confirm or vary the scheme (but on an application under subsection (2) not so as to affect the provisions of the scheme relating to the works).

(4) If an appeal has been brought against the control order and the court decide on the appeal to revoke the control order, the court shall not proceed with any appeal against the scheme relating to that control order.

(5) Proceedings on an appeal against a scheme shall, so far as practicable, be combined with proceedings on any appeal against the control order.

Ch. 56

979

mentioned in section 79(3)(c) of this Act have exceeded, or been less than, the surpluses on revenue account as settled by the scheme as for the time being in force, and shall also take into consideration whether there has been any change in circumstances such that the number of persons or households who should live in the house, or the net amount of the rents and other payments receivable by the local authority from persons occupying the house, ought to be greater or less than was originally estimated.

84.—(1) This section shall have effect if a control order is revoked by the county court on an appeal against the control order.

(2) The county court shall take into consideration whether the state or condition of the house is such that any action ought to be taken by the local authority under Part II of the Act of 1961 and shall take all or any of the following steps accordingly, that is—

(a) approve the making of an order under section 12 of the

Act of 1961,

(b) approve the giving of a notice under section 14, 15 or

16 of the Act of 1961, or

(4) In respect of the period from the coming into force of the control order until its revocation by order of the court, the local authority shall, subject to this section, be liable to pay to the dispossessed proprietor the balances which from time to time accrued to the local authority out of the net amount of the rent and other payments received by the local authority while

(i) compensation payable by the local authority under

section 78 and section 81 of this Act, and

(ii) all expenditure, other than capital expenditure, incurred

by the local authority in respect of the house while the control order was in force, together with the appropriate establishment charges.

(5) For the purpose of enabling the local authority to recover capital expenditure incurred in carrying out works in the house in the period before the control order is revoked, the local authority may on the hearing of the appeal apply to the court for approval of those works on the ground that they were works which, if a control order had not been in force, the local authority could have required some person to carry out under Part II of the Act of 1961, or under any other enactment relating to housing or public health, and that the works could not be postponed until after the determination of the appeal by the county court because the works were urgently required for the sake of the safety, welfare or health of persons living in the house, or other persons.

(6) Any expenditure reasonably incurred by the local authority in carrying out the works approved under the last foregoing subsection—

(a) may be deducted by the local authority out of the

(b) so far as not so deducted, shall be a charge on the

premises, and on all estates and interests in the premises, and section 76 of this Act shall not apply so as to restrict references to the premises in this subsection to references to the part of the premises to which a control order is applied.

(7) The charge under the last foregoing subsection shall take effect as from the date when the control order is revoked and the expenditure so charged shall carry interest at the rate provided by section 80(3) of this Act from that date; and subsections (5) and (6) of the said section 80 shall apply to the charge.

(8) If the court is satisfied that the balances which the local authority are, under subsection (4) of this section, liable to pay to the dispossessed proprietor are unduly low for any reason within the control of the local authority, having regard to the desirability of observing the standards of management contained in regulations made under section 13 of the Act of 1961, and to

Housing Act 1964

Ch. 56

981

the other standards which the local authority ought to observe Part IV as to the number of persons living in the house and the rents which they ought to charge, the court shall direct that, for the purposes of the local authority’s liability to the dispossessed proprietor under this section, the balances under subsection (4) of this section shall be deemed to be such greater sums as the court may direct:

Provided that the court shall not under this subsection give a direction which will afford to the dispossessed proprietor a sum greater than what he may, in the opinion of the court, have lost by the making of the control order.

(9) If on an appeal against the control order the county court decides that the control order should be revoked, the county court shall fix the date on which the control order is to be revoked without regard to whether an appeal has been or may be brought against the decision of the county court, but that shall not prevent the local authority from bringing an appeal in accordance with the provisions of section 108 of the County Courts Act 1959.

(10) If different persons are dispossessed proprietors in relation to different parts of the house, sums payable under this section by the local authority shall be apportioned between them in the manner provided by section 78(6) of this Act.

(11) In the application of this section to Scotland—

(a) in subsection (6)(b), for the words from “shall be a

charge ” to the end there shall be substituted the words “ shall be recoverable from the dispossessed proprietor “;

(b) subsection (7) shall not apply, but any expenditure

recoverable from the dispossessed proprietor by virtue of subsection (6)(b) of this section shall carry interest at the rate provided by section 80(3) of this Act from the date when the control order is revoked; and paragraphs (c) to (/) of section 80(8) of this Act shall, with any necessary modifications, apply for the purpose of enabling a local authority to recover any such expenditure as if they were incorporated in this section;

(c) subsection (9) shall not apply.

(2) If on the hearing by a county court of an appeal against a control order the appellant indicates that an appeal may be brought against any decision of the county court confirming the control order, and that any works ought not to be works the cost of which the local authority can recover under section 80 of this Act unless the control order is confirmed on the further appeal, the county court may direct that any such works shall not be works the cost of which may be recovered under section 80 of this Act—

(7) Where in a case falling under the last foregoing subsection the court is not satisfied as therein mentioned, but would be so satisfied if the date of revocation of the control order were a date later than the date of the hearing of the appeal, the court shall, if the appellant so requires, make an order for the revocation of the control order on that later date.

(8) If on an appeal under this section the county court decides to revoke the control order, the court may make an order under which the revocation does not take effect until the time for appealing against the decision of the county court has expired and until any such appeal brought within that time has been finally determined.

Resale Prices Act 1964

1964 CHAPTER 58

An Act to restrict the maintenance by contractual and other means of minimum resale prices in respect of goods supplied for resale in the United Kingdom; and for purposes connected therewith.

[16th July 1964]

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Restriction of contractual and other means of maintaining minimum resale prices

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to registration and to the powers of the Restrictive Practices Court thereunder, any term or condition of a contract for the sale of goods by a supplier to a dealer, or of any agreement between a supplier and a dealer relating to such a sale, shall be void in so far as it purports to establish or provide for the establishment of minimum prices to be charged on the resale of the goods in the United Kingdom; and it shall be unlawful for any supplier of goods (or for any association or person acting on behalf of such suppliers)—

(a) to include in any contract of sale or agreement relating

to the sale of goods any term or condition which is void by virtue of this section;

(b) to require, as a condition of supplying goods to a

dealer, the inclusion in any contract or agreement of any such term or condition, or the giving of any undertaking to the like effect;

Resale Prices Act 1964

Ch. 58

1035

(c) to notify to dealers, or otherwise publish on or in relation to any goods, a price stated or calculated to be understood as the minimum price which may be charged on the resale of the goods in the United Kingdom.

(2) This section applies to patented articles (including articles made by a patented process) as it applies to other goods; and notice of any term or condition which is void by virtue of this section, or which would be so void if included in a contract of sale or agreement relating to the sale of any such article, shall be of no effect for the purpose of limiting the right of a dealer to dispose of that article without infringement of the patent:

Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the validity, as between the parties and their successors, of any term or condition of a licence granted by the proprietor of a patent or by a licensee under any such licence, or of any assignment of a patent, so far as it regulates the price at which articles produced or processed by the licensee or assignee may be sold by him.

(3) Nothing in subsection (l)(a) of this section affects the enforceability of a contract of sale or other agreement, except in respect of the term or condition which is void by virtue of this section.

(4) Nothing in subsection (l)(c) of this section shall be construed as precluding a supplier, or any association or person acting on behalf of a supplier, from notifying to dealers or otherwise publishing prices recommended as appropriate for the resale of goods supplied or to be supplied by the supplier.

(5) References in subsection (2) of this section to patented articles shall include references to articles protected by the registration of a design and articles protected by plant breeders’ rights or a protective direction under Schedule 1 to the Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964, and references in that subsection to a patent shall be construed accordingly.

2.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to Prohibition of registration, to the powers of the Restrictive Practices Court other measures thereunder and to the next following section, it shall be un-for. lawful for any supplier to withhold supplies of any goods from a dealer seeking to obtain them for resale in the United Kingdom on the ground that the dealer—

(a) has sold in the United Kingdom at a price below the resale price goods obtained, either directly or indirectly, from that supplier, or has supplied such goods, either directly or indirectly, to a third party who had done so: or

1;

Exception for measures against loss leaders.

(b) is likely, if the goods are supplied to him, to sell them in the United Kingdom at a price below that price, or supply them, either directly or indirectly, to a third party who would be likely to do so.

(2) In this section “the resale price”, in relation to a sale of any description, means any price notified to the dealer or otherwise published by or on behalf of a supplier of the goods in question (whether lawfully or not) as the price or minimum price which is to be charged on or is recommended as appropriate for a sale of that description, or any price prescribed or purporting to be prescribed for that purpose by any contract or agreement between the dealer and any such supplier.

(3) For the purposes of this Act a supplier of goods shall be treated as withholding supplies of goods from a dealer—

(a) if he refuses or fails to supply those goods to the order of the dealer;

(b) if he refuses to supply those goods to the dealer except at prices, or on terms or conditions as to credit, discount or other matters, which are significantly less favourable than those at or on which he normally supplies those goods to other dealers carrying on business in similar circumstances; or

(c) if, although he contracts to supply the goods to the

dealer, he treats him in a manner significantly less favourable than that in which he normally treats other such dealers in respect of times or methods of delivery or other matters arising in the execution of the contract.

(4) For the purposes of this Act a supplier shall not be treated as withholding supplies of goods on any such ground as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section if, in addition to that ground, he has other grounds which, standing alone, would have led him to withhold those supplies.

(5) In any case where, by virtue of this section, it would be unlawful for a supplier to withhold supplies of goods, it shall also be unlawful for him to cause or procure any other supplier to do so.

3.—(1) It shall not be unlawful by virtue of section 2 of this Act for a supplier to withhold supplies of any goods from a dealer, or to cause or procure another supplier to do so, if he has reasonable cause to believe that within the previous twelve months the dealer or any other dealer to whom the dealer supplies goods has been using as loss leaders any goods of the same or a similar description, whether obtained from that supplier or not.

Resale Prices Act 1964

Ch. 58

1037

(2) The reference in this section to the use of goods as loss leaders is a reference to a resale of the goods effected by the dealer, not for the purpose of making a profit on the sale of those goods, but for the purpose of attracting to the establishment at which the goods are sold customers likely to purchase other goods or otherwise for the purpose of advertising the business of the dealer:

Provided that a sale of goods shall not be treated for the purposes of this section as the use of those goods as loss leaders—

(a) where the goods are sold by the dealer at a genuine

seasonal or clearance sale, not having been acquired by the dealer for the purpose of being resold as mentioned in this section; or

(b) where the goods are resold as mentioned in this section

with the consent of the manufacturer of the goods or, in the case of goods made to the design of a supplier or to the order and bearing the trade mark of a supplier, of that supplier.

4.—(1) No criminal proceedings shall lie against any person civil remedies on the ground that he has committed, or aided, abetted, for breach of counselled or procured the commission of, or conspired or restrictions, attempted to commit or incited others to commit, any contravention of the foregoing provisions of this Act

(2) The obligation to comply with the said provisions is a duty owed to any person who may be affected by a contravention of them, and any breach of that duty is actionable accordingly {subject to the defences and other incidents applying to actions for breach of statutory duty).

(3) Without prejudice to the right of any person to bring civil proceedings by virtue of subsection (2) of this section, compliance with the foregoing provisions of this Act shall be enforceable by civil proceedings on behalf of the Crown for an injunction or other appropriate relief.

(4) If in proceedings brought against a supplier of goods in respect of a contravention of section 2 of this Act it is proved that supplies of goods were withheld by the supplier from a dealer, and it is further proved—

(a) that down to the time when supplies were so withheld

the supplier was doing business with the dealer or was supplying goods of the same description to other dealers carrying on business in similar circumstances; and

(b) that the dealer, to the knowledge of the supplier, had

within the previous six months acted as described

Power of Court to exempt classes of goods.

in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of that section, or had indicated his intention to act as described in paragraph (b) of that subsection in relation to the goods in question,

it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the supplies were withheld on the ground that the dealer had so acted or was likely so to act:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply where the proof that supplies were withheld consists only of evidence of requirements imposed by the supplier in respect of the time at which or the form in which payment was to be made for goods supplied or to be supplied.

Provision for exemption of particular classes of goods

5.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Restrictive Practices Court may, on a reference made by the Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements, by order direct that goods of any class specified in the order (being goods of which particulars are entered in the register kept in accordance with those provisions) shall be exempted goods for the purposes of this Act; and where such an order is made—

(a) section 1 of this Act shall not apply in relation to any

contract of sale or other agreement relating to exempted goods of the class specified in the order, or anything done in relation to such goods; and

(b) section 2 of this Act shall apply in relation to the withholding of supplies of such goods as if paragraph

of subsection (1) were omitted, and as if the reference in paragraph (a) of that subsection to goods obtained from the supplier did not include any exempted goods so obtained.

(2) An order under this section directing that goods of any class shall be exempted goods may be made by the Restrictive Practices Court if it appears to the Court that in default of a system of maintained minimum resale prices applicable to those goods—

(a) the quality of the goods available for sale, or the

varieties of the goods so available, would be substantially reduced to the detriment of the public as consumers or users of those goods; or

(b) the number of establishments in which the goods are

sold by retail would be substantially reduced to the detriment of the public as such consumers or users; or

Resale Prices Act 1964

Ch. 58

1039

(c) the prices at which the goods are sold by retail would in general and in the long run be increased to the detriment of the public as such consumers or users; or id) the goods would be sold by retail under conditions likely to cause danger to health in consequence of their misuse by the public as such consumers or users; or

(e) any necessary services actually provided in connection with or after the sale of the goods by retail would cease to be so provided or would be substantially reduced to the detriment of the public as such consumers or users, and in any such case that the resulting detriment to the public as consumers or users of the goods in question would outweigh any detriment to them as such consumers or users (whether by the restriction of competition or otherwise) resulting from the maintenance of minimum resale prices in respect of the goods.

(3) On a reference under this section in respect of goods of any class which have been the subject of proceedings in the Court under Part I of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 the Court may treat as conclusive any finding of fact made in those proceedings, and shall do so unless prima facie evidence is given of a material change in the relevant circumstances since those proceedings.

(4) In this section “ necessary services ”, in relation to goods, means services which, having regard to the character of the goods, are required to guard against the risk of injury, whether to persons or to premises, in connection with the consumption, installation or use of the goods, or are otherwise reasonably necessary for the benefit of consumers or users; and “consumers” and “users” include persons consuming or using for the purpose or in the course of trade or business or for public purposes.

6*—(1) It shall be the duty of the Registrar to prepare, com- Registration pile and maintain for the purposes of this Act a register of of goods goods in respect of which notices are given to him under this for cxcmption' section, and to make reference to the Court under section 5 of this Act (subject to such directions as may be given by the Board of Trade with respect to the order in which such references are to be made) in respect of all goods of which particulars are for the time being entered in the register.

(2) Within the period of three months from the commencement of this section, any supplier who supplies goods under arrangements for maintaining minimum prices on resale, or any trade association whose members consist of or include such suppliers, may give notice to the Registrar in respect of goods of any description so supplied by that supplier or those suppliers claiming registration in respect of those goods.

(3) Where a notice under this section is duly given in respect of goods of any description, the Registrar shall cause particulars of the goods, of the person giving the notice and of the arrangements described in the notice to be entered in the register; and until the Court makes or refuses to make an order under section 5 of this Act in respect of a class of goods consisting of or comprising the goods of which particulars are so entered the foregoing provisions of this Act shall apply in relation to those goods as if such an order had been made.

(4) The Registrar shall from time to time publish lists of the classes of goods of which particulars are entered in the register kept by him under this section; and in any legal proceedings (including proceedings under this Act)—

(< a)the fact that goods of any description are included in a class specified in a list so published shall be conclusive evidence that they are goods of which particulars are so entered; and (b) the fact that goods of any description are not included in any such class shall be prima facie evidence that they are not goods of which particulars are so entered.

(5) The Registrar shall also from time to time publish lists of the classes of goods in respect of which the Court has made, refused to make or discharged orders under this Act, and any such list may be combined with a list published under subsection (4) of this section.

(6) For the purpose of compiling the lists described in subsection (4) of this section and, subject to rules made by virtue of section 8(2) of this Act, for the purpose of making references to the Court under the said section 5 the Registrar may combine or divide the goods in respect of which notice is given to him under this section into such classes as appear to him to be appropriate.

7.—(1) The Restrictive Practices Court may, upon application made under this subsection at any time after the expiration of the period mentioned in section 6(2) of this Act, make such an order as is described in section 5(1) of this Act in respect of goods of any class, not being goods of which particulars are entered in the register kept under the said section 6 or goods in respect of which a previous application has been made under this subsection.

(2) The Restrictive Practices Court may, upon application made under this subsection—

(a) discharge any order previously made by the Court directing that goods of any class shall be exempted goods;

(b) make such an order in respect of any class of goods in respect of which the Court has previously refused to make such an order or has previously discharged such an order.

(3) An application under this section may be made by the Registrar, by any supplier of goods of the class in question or by any trade association whose members consist of or include suppliers of such goods.

(4) No application shall be made under this section except with the leave of the Court; and such leave shall not be granted—

(a) in the case of an application under subsection (1) of

this section, except upon prima facie evidence of facts upon which an order could be made in accordance with section 5(2) of this Act in respect of the goods in question, or could be so made if any detriment to the public resulting from the maintenance of minimum resale prices were disregarded;

(b) in the case of an application under subsection (2) of

this section, except upon prima facie evidence of a material change in the relevant circumstances since the last decision of the Court in respect of the goods in question under the said section 5 or subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

(5) The provisions of section 5(2) and (3) of this Act shall apply with the necessary modifications in relation to proceedings on an application under this section as they apply in relation to proceedings on a reference by the Registrar under that section.

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1.—(1) No person shall keep a riding establishment except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

(3) Where an application for the grant of a licence for the keeping of a riding establishment at any premises is made to a

Riding Establishments Act 1964

Ch. 70

1167

local authority, they shall not proceed to a decision in the matter unless they have received and considered a report by a veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner authorised by them to carry out inspections under the next following section of an inspection of the premises carried out by him within the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date on which the application is received by the local authority or on or after that date, being a report containing such particulars as in their view enable them to determine whether the premises are suitable for the keeping thereat of a riding establishment, and describing the condition of the premises and of any horses found thereon or anything thereat.

(4) In determining whether to grant a licence for the keeping of a riding establishment by any person at any premises, a local authority shall in particular (but without prejudice to their discretion to withhold a licence on any grounds) have regard to whether that person appears to them to be suitable and qualified, either by experience in the management of horses or otherwise, to be the holder of such a licence and to the need for securing—

ia) that there will be available at all times, for horses, accommodation suitable as respects construction, size, number of occupants, lighting, ventilation, drainage, and cleanliness;

(b) that in the case of horses maintained at grass, there will

be maintained for them at all times during which they are so maintained adequate pasture and shelter;

(c) that horses will be adequately supplied with suitable

food, drink and (except, in the case of horses maintained at grass, so long as they are so maintained) bedding material, and will be adequately exercised and rested and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals;

(d) that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent and control the spread among horses of infectious or contagious diseases;

(e) that appropriate steps will be taken for the protection

of horses in case of fire;

(f) that horses will be maintained in a good state of

health and that, in the case of a horse kept for the purpose of its being let out on hire for riding or a horse kept for the purpose of its being used in providing instruction in riding, the horse will be suitable for the purpose for which in that case it is kept;

(g) that adequate accommodation will be provided for

forage, bedding, stable equipment and saddlery; and shall specify such conditions in the licence, if granted by them, as appear to the local authority necessary or expedient

Provided that the local authority by whom the licence was granted may from time to time on the application of those representatives, extend or further extend the said period of one year if the authority are satisfied that the extension is necessary for the purpose of winding up the deceased’s estate and that no other circumstances make it undesirable.

(9) Any person who contravenes the provisions of subsection

(1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence; and if any condition subject to which a licence is granted in accordance with the provisions of this Act is contravened or not complied with, the person to whom the licence was granted shall be guilty of an offence.

the Secretary of State, if, after consulting the council of the borough or urban district and also the county council or, where the county council is comprised in a joint board established under section 5 above, the joint board, and after taking account of any likely changes in the area and population of the borough or urban district and of other relevant matters, he is of opinion that to do so would lead to an improvement in the library facilities made available under this Act in the borough or urban district, may at any time before the next review date by order provide that on a date specified in the order the council of the borough or urban district shall cease to be a library authority.

(2) The power to make an order under subsection (1) above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.

(5) Where the council of a non-county borough or urban district is a library authority it may at any time resolve to relinquish its functions as such, and if the Secretary of State by

Ch. 75

order confirms the resolution the council shall cease to be a library authority on such date as is specified in that behalf in the order.

of this provision be transferred to and become officers of the authority assuming the library functions of the council, that is to say, where after that time the library area of the council will be comprised in the library area of a joint board, that joint board, and in any other case the county council; and

(b) the library assets and liabilities of the council shall, save as may be otherwise directed by the Secretary of State, be transferred by the operation of this provision to the said authority.

(7) Where the council of a non-county borough or urban district is approved by the Secretary of State under subsection

7.—(1) It shall be the duty of every library authority to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service for all persons desiring to make use thereof, and for that purpose to employ such officers, to provide and maintain such buildings and equipment, and such books and other materials, and to do such other things, as may be requisite:

(2) In fulfilling its duty under the preceding subsection, a library authority shall in particular have regard to the desirability—

(c) of securing, in relation to any matter concerning the

functions both of the library authority as such and any other authority whose functions are exercisable within the library area, that there is full co-operation between the persons engaged in carrying out those functions.

8. —(1) Except as provided by this section, no charge shall be made by a library authority (otherwise than to another library authority) for library facilities made available by the authority.

(2) A library authority may make a charge not exceeding such amount as may be specified in that behalf by the Secretary of State—

(a) a book, journal, pamphlet or similar article, or

(b) a reproduction made by photographic or other means of the whole or a part of any such article.

(4) A library authority may make a charge for supplying book catalogues or indexes, or any similar articles, where the articles become the property of the persons to whom they are supplied.

(5) Where facilities made available to any person by a library authority go beyond those ordinarily provided by the authority as part of the library service the authority may make a charge for the provision of those facilities.

9. —(1) A library authority may make contributions towards the expenses of another library authority or of any other person providing library facilities for members of the public.

10.—(1) If—

(a) a complaint is made to the Secretary of State that any

library authority has failed to carry out duties relating to the public library service imposed on it by or under this Act; or

annuation fund,

shall, in relation to a library officer transferred by the operation of this Act from one local authority to another, have effect (save in so far as, in the case of a provision coming into operation after the passing of this Act, the contrary is expressly provided) as if his employment by those authorities were one continuous employment

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not have effect for the purposes of section 29 of the Local Government Superannuation Act 1937 (which provides for the payment of transfer values on a change from one superannuation fund to another), but, with respect to any transfer values which apart from any direction under this sub-paragraph would, in the case of a transfer of a library officer, be payable under the said section 29 by the administering authority or joint committee maintaining one superannuation fund (in this sub-paragraph referred to as the transferor fund) to the administering authority or joint committee maintaining another superannuation fund, the Minister of Housing and Local Government, if in the circumstances he considers it equitable to do so, may give directions for securing that—

(3) In any case where the pensions provisions to which, by virtue of his employment as such, a library officer transferred by the operation of this Act is subject immediately before the transfer are not the same as the pensions provisions to which he becomes so subject immediately thereafter, the second-mentioned provisions shall have effect in relation to him as if they required him to make the like contributions (if any) as he would have been liable to make, and conferred on him rights corresponding with those which he would have enjoyed, if he had remained subject to the first-mentioned provisions, and as if they conferred on the authority to which he is transferred any discretionary power to pay pensions or increased pensions which was exercisable under the first-mentioned provisions by the authority from which he was transferred.

of the board, or otherwise ceased to be employed by the board; or

Power of investment

4. Until it is required for the purposes of the art fund, money therein may be invested by the local authority in the like investments as trustees are for the time being by law authorised to make, and for this purpose section 7 of the Trustee Investments Act 1961 (which applies the preceding sections of the Act to persons, other than trustees, having trustee investment powers) shall have effect as if this Act had been passed before that Act:

Provided that for the purpose of the making of investments by the authority under this paragraph, paragraph 9 of Part II of Schedule 1 to that Act (which specifies local authorities whose securities are to be authorised investments'' shall not apply to the authority or to a joint board comprising the authority and established under section 5 of this Act.

5. Income arising from investments made under paragraph 4 above shall be carried to the county fund or the general rate fund, as the case may be, and an equivalent sum shall be paid from that fund into the art fund.

(a) references in this Schedule to the county fund or general

rate fund shall be construed as references to the general revenues of the joint board, and references to the administrative area of the local authority shall be construed as references to the library area of the joint board;

2.—(1) A person in whose case a special verdict is returned Appeal may appeal against the verdict to the Court of Criminal again* special Appeal— verd,cl-

involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal;

and the Court of Criminal Appeal on any such appeal shall subject as hereinafter provided allow the appeal if they think that the special verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the order of the court giving effect to the special verdict should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and shall in any other case dismiss the appeal.

(2) The Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss an appeal against a special verdict if of opinion that notwithstanding that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

allowed, and

(b) none of the grounds for allowing it relates to the

where appeal against special verdict allowed.

(3) Subject to the foregoing subsection, the question of fitness to be tried shall be determined as soon as it arises.

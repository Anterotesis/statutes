(2) Subject to subsection (8) below—

(a) the gain realised by the exercise of any such right at any time shall be taken to be the difference between the amount that a person might reasonably expect to obtain from a sale in the open market at that time of the shares acquired and the amount or value of the consideration given whether for them or for the grant of the right, and

(b) the gain realised by the assignment or release of any such right shall be taken to be the difference between the amount or value of the consideration for the assignment or release and the amount or value of the consideration given for the grant of the right,

(a just apportionment being made of any entire consideration given for the grant of the right to acquire those shares and other shares or otherwise for the grant of the right to acquire those shares and for something besides):

Provided that neither the consideration given for the grant of the right nor any such entire consideration shall be taken to include die performance of any duties in or in connection with the office or employment by reason of which the right was granted, and no part of the amount or value of the consideration given for the grant shall be deducted more than once under this subsection.

(3) Subject to subsection (4) below a person shall, in the case of a right granted by reason of his office or employment, be chargeable to tax under this section in respect of a gain realised by another person—

(a) if the right was granted to the other person, or

by or under an assignment made by way of a bargain at arm’s length, or if the two are connected persons at the time when the gain is realised,

but in a case within paragraph (b) of this subsection the gain realised shall be treated as reduced by the amount of any gain realised by a previous holder on an assignment of the right.

(4) A person shall not be chargeable to tax by virtue of subsection (3 )(b)above in respect of any gain realised by another person if the first-mentioned person was divested of the right by operation of law on his bankruptcy or otherwise, but the other person shall be chargeable to tax in respect of the gain under Case VI of Schedule D.

(5) If a right to acquire shares in a body corporate is assigned or released in whole or in part for a consideration which consists of or comprises another right to acquire shares in that or any other body corporate, that right shall not be

treated as consideration for the assignment or release, but this section shall apply in relation to it as it applies in relation to the right assigned or released and as if the consideration for its acquisition did not include the value of the right assigned or released but did include the amount or value of the consideration given for the grant of the right assigned or released so far as that has not been offset by any valuable consideration for the assignment or release other than the consideration consisting of the other right.

(6) If as a result of two or more transactions a person ceases to hold a right to acquire shares in a body corporate and he or a connected person comes to hold another right to acquire shares in that or any other body corporate (whether or not acquired from the person to whom the other right was assigned) and any of those transactions was effected under arrangements to which two or more persons holding rights in respect of which tax may be chargeable under this section were parties, those transactions shall be treated for the purposes of the last foregoing subsection as a single transaction whereby the one right is assigned for a consideration which consists of or comprises the other right.

This subsection applies in relation to two or more transactions whether they involve an assignment preceding, coinciding with, or subsequent to, an acquisition.

(7) This section applies in relation to rights granted at any time in the year 1965-66 or any earlier year of assessment as well as in relation to rights granted in any later year of assessment, but subject to the following subsection.

(9) For the purposes of this section a right to acquire shares is obtained by a person as a director or employee of a body corporate—

(a) if it is granted to him by reason of his office or employ-

ment as a director or employee of the body corporate who is chargeable to tax in respect of that office or employment under Case I of Schedule E, or

(b) if the right is assigned to him and was granted by reason

of any such office or employment of his to some other person,

(b) the dividend is paid to a company within paragraph 3

in the said Part I (that is to say a company resident in the United Kingdom which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than a fraction of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the fraction being, by virtue of paragraph 4(3) of Schedule 16 to the Finance Act 1965, one-tenth as respects dividends paid by a company resident in the Commonwealth territories and one-quarter in other cases), or

(2) Subject to this section and the said Schedule, the amount of income tax under Schedule F chargeable in respect of a dividend to which this section applies shall be subject to such limitation or exemption, if any, as would apply under the relevant agreement in the converse case (that is in die case of a dividend paid by a company resident in the overseas territory to a person resident in the United Kingdom, and assuming that all the circumstances of that case are the exact converse of those of the

(3) If without this subsection subsection (2) above would attach a condition making the limitation or exemption dependent on the recipient of the dividend being subject to tax where he resides in respect of the dividend, that condition shall not apply if he is not so subject to tax by reason only of a provision in an agreement having effect under section 347 of the Income Tax Act 1952 which in all or any circumstances confers exemption from all tax where he resides in respect of dividends.

(4) Any limitation (as well as any exemption) applied by subsection (2) above to the amount of income tax under Schedule F chargeable in respect of a dividend—

(5) If any agreement, or any provision in an agreement, ceases to have effect, this section and Schedule 9 to this Act shall cease to have effect in relation to that agreement or that provision as respects dividends paid after the time when that agreement ceases to have effect for the purposes of income tax (other than surtax), or as the case may be as respects dividends paid after the time when that provision ceases to have effect

(6) If effect is given by an Order in Council to an amending agreement which, as regards dividends paid after a specified time, affords (in any circumstances) relief from income tax at the standard rate under Schedule F (other than relief corresponding to that afforded by section 227(2) of the Income Tax Act 1952) this section and Schedule 9 to this Act shall, as regards dividends paid after that time, cease to have effect in relation to the agreement which is amended.

(7) In determining for the purposes of section 347(4) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (under which effect may be given to double taxation agreements giving retrospective relief) whether retrospective provisions are provisions for relief the relief afforded by this section, and the withdrawal of that relief by virtue of the last foregoing subsection in consequence of the amendment of the relevant agreement, shall be disregarded.

1963 c. 25.

38.—(1) Any redundancy payment, and the corresponding amount of any other employer’s payment, shall be exempt from income tax under Schedule E.

(2) Where a redundancy payment or other employer’s payment is made in respect of employment wholly in a trade, profession or vocation carried on by the employer, and within the charge to income tax or corporation tax, the amount of the redundancy payment or the corresponding amount of the other employer’s payment shall (if not otherwise so allowable) be allowable as a deduction in computing for the purposes of Schedule D the profits or gains or losses of the trade, profession or vocation, but if it is so allowed by virtue of this section the amount of the rebate recoverable shall (if it is not otherwise to be so treated) be treated as a receipt to be brought into account in computing those profits or gains; and if the employer’s payment was made after the discontinuance of the trade, profession or vocation the net amount so deductible shall be treated as if it were a payment made on the last day on which the trade, profession or vocation was carried on.

(3) Where a redundancy payment or other employer’s payment is made in respect of employment wholly in a business carried on by the employer, and expenses of management of the business are eligible for relief under section 57 of the Finance Act 1965 as extended by section 67(1)(6) of that Act (investment companies and unit trusts) the amount by which the redundancy payment, or the corresponding amount of the other employer's payment, exceeds the recoverable rebate shall (if not otherwise so allowable) be allowable as expenses of management eligible for relief under that section; and if the employer’s payment was made after the discontinuance of the business the net amount so allowable shall be treated as if it were expenses of management incurred on the last day on which the business was carried on.

(4) Where a redundancy payment or other employer’s payment is made in respect of employment wholly in maintaining or managing property the expenses of maintaining or managing which were eligible for relief under paragraph 1 or paragraph 13 of Schedule 4 to the Finance Act 1963 (allowable deductions

for tax under Case VIII and certain other tax), the amount by Part IV which the redundancy payment or the corresponding amount of the other employer’s payment exceeds the recoverable rebate shall (if not otherwise allowable under that Schedule) be treated for the purposes of the said Schedule as a payment made by the employer in respect of the maintenance or management of the property, or of such part of it as he may elect; and if the employer’s payment was made after the latest time when it could be taken into account for the purposes of relief under the said Schedule 4 as a payment in respect of the maintenance or management of the property or any part of it, it shall be treated as having been made at that time.

(5) Relief shall not be given under subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, or otherwise, more than once in respect of any employer’s payment, and if the employee was being employed by the employer in such a way that different parts of the employee’s remuneration fell for income tax or corporation tax purposes to be treated in different ways, the amount by which the redundancy payment, or the corresponding amount of the other employer’s payment, exceeds the recoverable rebate shall be apportioned to the different capacities in which the employee was employed, and subsections (2), (3) and (4) above shall apply separately to the employment in those capacities, and by reference to the apportioned part of the said amount, instead of by reference to the full amount of the employer’s payment, and the full amount of the rebate.

(a) references to the corresponding amount of an employer’s payment (other than a redundancy payment) are references to the amount of that employer’s payment so far as not in excess of the amount of the relevant redundancy payment (and so that where in consequence of section 30(2) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 or section 40(2) of the said Act of Northern Ireland, there is no relevant redundancy payment, the corresponding amount of the employer’s payment is nil,

Cancellation of tax advantages from certain transactions in securities.

(b) " relevant redundancy payment " shall be construed in accordance with paragraph 8 of Schedule 5 to the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 or paragraph 8 of Schedule 6 to the said Act of Northern Ireland, and a source of income is " within the charge to " income tax or corporation tax if that tax is chargeable on the income arising from it, or would be so chargeable if there were any such income.

(8) In subsection (1) above the reference to tax under Schedule E does not include a reference to tax under section 37 of the Finance Act I960 (which relates only to sums exceeding a limit of £5,000 or more) and accordingly payments exempted by subsection (1) above may be taken into account under that section.

(9) This section shall apply as respects payments made on or after 6th December 1965 (which is the appointed day under the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the said Act of Northern Ireland), and as respects tax for past years of assessment and profits tax chargeable accounting periods, and the reference in subsection (3) of this section to section 57 of the Finance Act 1965 includes a reference to section 425 of the Income Tax Act 1952 as extended by section 438 of that Act and section 69 of the Finance Act 1960 (all of which are repealed by the Finance Act 1965).

39.—(1) For the purposes of the definition of tax advantage in section 43(4)(g) of the Finance Act 1960 it shall be assumed that a person who might have received from a company any dividend or other distribution (as defined for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts) would have borne the income tax chargeable under Schedule F which the company would have had to account for under section 47(3) of the Finance Act 1965 in respect of the distribution, and an assessment under section 28(3) of the Finance Act 1960 to counteract a tax advantage consisting of the avoidance or reduction of an assessment to income tax which would be payable by a company under the said section 47(3) in respect of a distribution may be made under Case VI of Schedule D on a person other than the company, and may be so made in addition to any assessment to counteract a tax advantage in respect of surtax.

(2) An assessment so made on a person other than the company may be of an amount arrived at without regard to any set off to which the company would have been entitled under Schedule 12 to the Finance Act 1965.

(3) After paragraph (2)(d) in the said section 28 there shall be added the following paragraph—

" (e) in connection with the transfer directly or indirectly of assets of a company to which paragraph (d) above

Finance Act

Ch. 18

233

applies to another such company, or in connection with any transaction in securities in which two or more companies to which paragraph (d) above applies are concerned, the person in question receives non-taxable consideration which is or represents the value of assets available for distribution by such a company, and which consists of any share capital or any security (as defined by paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 11 to the Finance Act 1965) issued by such a company."

(4) So far as the paragraph (e) added to the said section 28(2) by subsection (3) above relates to share capital other than redeemable share capital, it shall not apply unless and except to the extent that the share capital is repaid (in a winding-up or otherwise), and where the said section 28 applies to a person by virtue of the said paragraph (e) on die repayment of any share capital any assessment to tax under subsection (3) of the said section 28 shall be an assessment to tax for the year in which the share capital is repaid.

(5) Any notice or notification under subsection (3) or (4) of the said section 28, or under section 29(h) of the Finance Act 1960, concerning the application of the said section 28 to a person who has died may be given or issued to his personal representatives, and the provisions of the said section 28 relating to the making of a statutory declaration, to rights of appeal and to the giving of information shall be construed accordingly.

(6) In this section—

" assets available for distribution " means assets which are, or apart from anything done by the company in question would have been, available for distribution by way of dividend, or trading stock of the company,

" non-taxable ", in relation to a person receiving consideration, means that the recipient does not pay or bear tax on it as income (apart from the provisions of section 28 of the Finance Act 1960),

" share " includes stock and any other interest of a member in a company,

and the references in subsection (4) above to the repayment of share capital include references to any distribution made in respect of any shares in a winding up or dissolution of the company.

(7) The amendments made by this section in sections 28 and 29 of the Finance Act 1960, and in the definition of tax advantage as it applies for the purposes of that section, shall not apply to a person in respect of any transaction or transactions in securities if they were carried out before 3rd May 1966, and if

Part V

Estate duty: interests limited to cease on death.

1894 c. 30.

1940 c. 29. 1958 c. 56.

Estate Duty and Capital Gains

40.—(1) In the case of a death after 3rd May 1966 the provisions of this section shall apply in determining for the purposes of section 2(l)(h) of the Finance Act 1894 whether an interest in property ceased on the death of the deceased and the extent to which a benefit accrued or arose by the cesser of that interest.

(2) If the deceased had immediately before his death an interest in the property limited to cease on his death, then in determining the questions in subsection (1) above as regards that interest, any other interest in that property belonging to the deceased at his death shall be treated as if it belonged to someone other than the deceased.

(3) If immediately before the death of the deceased a number of persons were, as beneficiaries under a discretionary trust, together entitled to an interest in the property limited to cease on the death and the deceased was then one of those persons, or at some earlier time had been a beneficiary under that discretionary trust, then, in determining the questions in subsection

(1) above as regards that interest, any other interest in the property which, whether as arising from the same trusts or otherwise, belongs to those who immediately before the death were the beneficiaries under the discretionary trust shall be treated as being held by persons other than those beneficiaries, and other than the deceased.

(4) For the purposes—

(a) of this section, and

(b) so far as they relate to estate duty leviable on a death after 3rd May 1966, of section 43 of the Finance Act 1940 and section 28 of the Finance Act 1958 (disposition or determination of interest limited to cease on death, and purchase of interest in expectancy in property subject to an interest limited to cease on death),

an interest including an interest limited to cease on death shall be treated as two separate interests one of which is the interest limited to cease on death, and for the purposes of this subsection the following interests shall be deemed to include an interest limited to cease on a death—

(i) an interest enjoyed under two or more titles one of which confers an interest limited to cease on a death.

Finance Act

Ch. 18

235

(ii) an interest so related to a death that it cannot ter- Part V minate before the death, and

(iii) an interest so related to a death that, except in contingencies not related to the death, it cannot terminate before the death:

Provided that where an interest belongs to persons as beneficiaries under a discretionary trust which throughout the subsistence of that trust was such that it could not terminate before the death of the survivor of two or more persons, estate duty shall only be payable by virtue of this section in respect of the cesser of the interest on the death of that survivor.

(5) It is hereby declared that this section has effect for the purposes of estate duty not only as respects the question whether property is deemed to pass on a death but also as respects the questions—

(a) whether, in any circumstances specified in section 43 of

the Finance Act 1940, property would have passed on 1940 c. 29. a death or would have been deemed to be included to a particular extent in property passing on a death, and

(b) whether (as under section 28(12) of the Finance Act 1958 c. 56.

1958 which relates to the purchases of interests in expectancy) in specified circumstances estate duty would have been chargeable by reason of the coming to an end of an interest in property.

(6) In this section "discretionary trust" includes a trust under which the disposition of any of the trust income is at the discretion of the trustees or of any other person.

41.—(1) This section has effect as respects securities which Restriction of the Treasury issue or have issued before or after the passing exemption of this Act subject to any condition authorised by section 47 "Jate of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1915 or section 22 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1931 for an exemption from taxation so long as government the securities are in the beneficial ownership of persons neither securities, domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, and 1915 c. 89. this section is enacted for the purpose of preventing that exemp-1931 c. 49. tion from enuring for the benefit of, or of the estate of, a person domiciled or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.

(2) Where in respect of any government securities any such exemption applies apart from this section to estate duty leviable on the death after 3rd May 1966 of a person who immediately before the death was domiciled or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, then, subject to the exceptions provided by the following provisions of this section,—

(a) if the exemption is subject to a condition relating to any law directed to preventing avoidance of taxation

Finance Act 1966

Part V

1894 c. 30.

1940 c. 29.

by persons domiciled, resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, the said exemption shall not apply to that estate duty, and (b) if the exemption is not subject to any such condition, there shall be deemed for purposes of estate duty on the death to be included in the property passing at the death a sum equal to the value upon which, but for the exemption, estate duty would have been payable, and any sum so deemed to pass shall for the purposes of aggregation and of determining the persons accountable for duty be treated as having been property to which the deceased was absolutely entitled at his death,

but so far as the duty imposed by paragraph (b) above has not been paid by the deceased’s personal representatives accountability for the duty shall be imposed on any person who, if the exemption had not applied to the duty, would have been accountable for it under the enactments relating to estate duty; and any payment made by the personal representatives shall for the purposes of this subsection be regarded as a payment of the duty imposed by paragraph (b) above only so far as there is no other estate duty leviable on the death for which they are accountable and which has not been paid.

(3) Subsection (2) above shall not apply where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, or on an appeal under section 10 of the Finance Act 1894 of the court entertaining the appeal, that the circumstances in which, apart from this section, the exemption applies in respect of any government securities were not brought about for the purpose, or for purposes which include the purpose, of obtaining the benefit of the exemption directly or indirectly for, or for the estate of, a person domiciled or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, or for a company to which section 56 of the Finance Act 1940 (closely controlled companies) applies and in which a person domiciled or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom has an interest; and where the circumstances in which the exemption so applies in respect of any government securities were not brought about by the deceased subsection (2) above shall not apply so as by virtue of paragraph (b) of that subsection to make the personal representatives accountable for duty or to increase the amount of duty beyond what would have been due had there been no exemption.

(4) Subsection (2) above shall not apply in respect of any government securities if no person who would be accountable for estate duty leviable on the death on the government securities on the assumption that the exemption did not apply in respect of those government securities is a person domiciled or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or a company to which the said section 56 of the Finance Act 1940 applies.

(5) If a donee or other person being, on the assumption in Part V subsection (4) above, contingently accountable for estate duty pre-deceases the deceased, that subsection shall apply, so far as it

relates to that donee or other person, by reference to him and not by reference to his personal representatives or successors in title, and according to where he was domiciled or ordinarily resident at his death.

(6) If the persons who would, on the assumption in subsection

(4) above, be so accountable consist of or include trustees under a settlement created before the death, whether or not subsisting at the death, subsection (4) above shall not have effect but subsection (2) above shall not apply in respect of the government securities if and to the extent that it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, or on an

appeal under section 10 of the Finance Act 1894 of the court 1894 c. 30. entertaining the appeal, that the burden of the duty, having regard to interests subsisting immediately after the death, would be borne by any person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, and for the purposes of this subsection interests in income, interests in capital, interests in possession and interests in reversion shall all be taken into account.

at an earlier time, effected at or before that earlier time,

the principal value of the property for the purposes of estate duty on the death shall be reduced by the amount of that tax, and that reduction shall be made before any reduction of that value under section 64 of the Finance Act 1960 (graduation of charge by reference to period between gift and death).

(2) If any property ceasing to be settled property is by virtue of subsection (8) proviso or subsection (12) proviso of section 38 of the Finance Act 1957 to be treated as comprised in a gift inter vivos deemed for purposes of estate duty to pass on a death, or as the case may be as comprised in property in which an interest within section 43 of the Finance Act 1940 subsisted, and capital gains tax is chargeable on a chargeable gain accruing

(b) the principal value of the asset for the purposes of

a part of any estate duty payable in respect of that asset on the death shall be treated for the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965 as if it were an amount of expenditure incurred by the donee on the asset and falling within the said paragraph 4(l)(h); and that part shall be the proportion of the duty which the said excess bears to the said principal value.

(4) References in this section to any amount of capital gains tax or corporation tax are references to the amount which would not have been payable if the relevant asset had not been disposed of, and, if any part of the chargeable gain accruing on a disposal within subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section is not chargeable to capital gains tax or corporation tax in the year of assessment or accounting period in which it accrues because of relief for losses accruing in that or any earlier year or accounting period, the amount of tax in respect of that part of the chargeable gain shall be the tax which would have been charged on that part of the gain if it had been the only gain accruing in the year or accounting period and had all been chargeable.

(2) The said price shall be determined on the assumption that the buyer will bear freight, insurance and all other costs, charges and expenses incurred in respect of the vessel or structure and other items in question after their delivery as aforesaid or, where delivery is to be effected outside the United Kingdom, after their departure from the United Kingdom for the purpose.

(3) For the purposes of this paragraph, a sale in the open market between a buyer and seller independent of each other presupposes—

(a) that the vessel or structure and other items in question are

the sole consideration for the price paid, and

(b) that the price is not influenced by any commercial, financial

or other relationship, whether by contract or otherwise, between the seller or any person associated in business with him and the buyer or any person associated in business with him (other than the relationship created by the sale of the said vessel or structure and other items), and

with him has provided any part of the price, and that no part of the price will be returned to the buyer or any person associated in business with him.

(b) if the whole or any part of the price is payable twelve months or more after the time when the property in the vessel or structure passes or, if later, the time of delivery of the vessel or structure or of its departure from the United Kingdom for the purpose of delivery, the price shall be treated for those purposes as reduced by an amount representing the discount which would be chargeable for obtaining payment at that earlier time at a rate of interest equal to the bank rate then prevailing.

(2) In the foregoing sub-paragraph "bank rate" means the minimum rate at which the Bank of England will lend to a discount house having access to the Discount Office of the Bank.

(2) If under Part II of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 it is to be assumed that, at a time after the creation of the rights and before their disposal, the said person sold and immediately reacquired the shares in respect of which the rights were created, the same assumption shall be made as respects the rights.

1.—(1) The functions of the Minister of Overseas Development (hereafter in this Act referred to as " the Minister ") shall include power, subject to the following provisions of this section, for the purpose of promoting the development of, or maintaining the economy of, a country or territory outside the United Kingdom or the welfare of its people, to furnish any person or body with assistance, whether financial, technical or of any other nature; and any such assistance may be provided on such terms and subject to such conditions (if any) as the Minister may

determine, and in particular any such assistance, other than financial, may be provided free of charge or on such terms as to payment as the Minister may determine, or, being financial, may be provided by way of grant or loan, or partly in one way and partly in the other, so however that no assistance shall be provided by way of loan except on such terms and subject to such conditions (if any), as may be approved by the Treasury.

(2) For the purpose of enabling him to furnish technical assistance under this section, the Minister may undertake, or promote the undertaking of, such research in the fields of economic development, administration and social services as appears to him appropriate.

(3) Except in so far as subsection (1) above relates to the furnishing of technical assistance, the said subsection shall not, subject to the provisions of the next following subsection, have effect in relation to a country or territory in respect of which

(5) A person at whose expense any work is carried out shall not be guilty of an offence under this section by reason of the fact—

(a) that any limit as to cost having effect in relation to the

work by virtue of section 2 of this Act or of a licence issued under this Act has been exceeded; or

(b) that any other condition or limitation having effect in

to carry out that work, no account shall be taken of the time during which his application is pending; and

(b) he shall not be treated as having acted in contravention

of that enactment by reason of his failure to carry out that work in so far as the failure to carry it out is attributable to the refusal of his application or to any condition or limitation subject to which the licence applied for is granted.

(11) Where a person contracts to carry out any work to which this Act applies, that person shall not be precluded from recovering payment for the work under the contract by reason only that it was carried out in contravention of this section or of the terms of a licence issued under this Act if he proves that at the time when the work was carried out he did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that it was being carried out in contravention of this section or, as the case may be, of the terms of the licence.

SCHEDULE 2

General Considerations relating to Prices and Incombs

In the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomes, representatives of the T.U.C and the employers* organisations have accepted that major objectives of national policy must be:

to ensure that British industry is dynamic and that its prices are competitive;

to raise productivity and efficiency so that real national output can increase, and to keep increases in wages, salaries and other forms of incomes in line with this increase; to keep the general level of prices stable.

2. They have also agreed with the Government’s proposals, set out in the White Paper on Machinery of Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2577) that:

(i) the National Economic Development Council should keep

under review the general movement of prices and of money incomes of all kinds; and

(ii) a National Board for Prices and Incomes should be set up to examine particular cases in order to advise whether or not the behaviour of prices or of wages, salaries or other money incomes is in the national interest as defined by the Government after consultation with Management and Unions.

Trends in national productivity

3. The figure for the growth of the economy between 1964 and 1970 which is being assumed in the preparation of the Government’s plan for economic development is 25 per cent This gives an average annual rate of growth of rather less than 4 per cent In calculating the long-term annual rate of growth of national production per head of the working population allowance has to be made for the growth of the total national output due to increases in the numbers of the working population and for short-term variations in the rate of growth which result from fluctuations in the level of demand and the level of employment The most recent forecasts indicate that between 1964 and 1970 the labour force may grow, as the result erf the natural increase in the population of working age and the continuance of rising trends in the proportions working or seeking work, by no more than 1£ per cent over the whole period. Some further increase in the numbers employed should result from the more vigorous regional policies to which the Government is committed.

Prices and Incomes Act 1966

Ch. 33

599

4. These assumptions imply an average annual rate of growth in Sch. 2 output per head of something approaching per cent During the

early years of the plan period the underlying rate of growth will inevitably be below the average for the period as a whole; in addition the rate of increase may be slowed down by reductions in working hours and extension of holidays. By comparison the underlying rate of growth per head in the nineteen-fifties averaged about 2 per cent a year. It is now probably about 3 per cent

Considerations of the national interest

5. Against this background the Government have now drawn up, after consultation with Management and Unions, a statement of considerations which should be taken into account if the pricing policy of individual enterprises and increases in money incomes are to conform to the national interest and in particular to achieve the objectives accepted by Management and Unions in the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomes. These considerations are outlined below. They will help all those concerned with determining prices and incomes to act in a manner consistent with the national interest They are also intended to guide the National Board for Prices and Incomes in its examination of particular cases.

Considerations affecting prices

6. The development of an effective policy for keeping the general level of prices stable will call for considerable efforts on the part of management generally to increase efficiency, avoid cost increases and wherever possible to stabilise or reduce prices. The rate of change of the average level of prices over any period of time is determined by differing movements of a very large number of individual prices. Even when the average level of prices is rising, there are many prices which fall. It would be impossible to lay down detailed rules which would cover all the circumstances which individual enterprises face when deciding the prices to ask for their products. On the other hand, unless some general guidance is given on the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to raise or reduce prices, there will be no basis for deciding whether individual price decisions are consistent with the national objectives. The considerations set out in paragraphs 9-10 are for the guidance of all concerned with the determination of prices.

7. It is not intended that the considerations set out in paragraphs 9-10 should inhibit the structural changes that will be necessary in the interests of faster economic growth. These take account of the fact that competition has an important part to play in stimulating economic expansion, and are consistent with the smooth working of a competitive system. It should be a normal part of enterprising business behaviour to increase efficiency, keep down costs and hold prices at a level compatible with its long-term growth. This would speed up the replacement of old techniques and out-of-date equipment by new techniques and modem equipment Moreover, the considerations recognise not only that an enterprise must make sufficient profit to secure the capital necessary to meet home and overseas demand, but also that the vigorous and efficient enterprise can reasonably expect a higher level of profit than one that is not

600

Ch. 33

Prices and Incomes Act 1966

Sch. 2 8. These considerations apply equally to the prices of goods and

of services whether provided by private or public enterprise. The Government regard the nationalised industries as being under the same obligations as private enterprises to contribute to the general objective of price stability, while taking account of their financial and social obligations.

Criteria for price behaviour

9. To keep the general level of prices stable, it is vital that price increases should be avoided where possible and that prices should be reduced wherever circumstances permit. Enterprises will not be expected to raise their prices except in the following circumstances:

(i) if output per employee cannot be increased sufficiently to

allow wages and salaries to increase at a rate consistent with the criteria for incomes stated in paragraph 15 below without some increase in prices, and no offsetting reductions can be made in non-labour costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;

(ii) if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costs such as materials, fuel, services or marketing costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in labour or capital costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;

(iii) if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in noncapital costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;

(iv) if, after every effort has been made to reduce costs, the enterprise is unable to secure the capital required to meet home and overseas demand.

10. Enterprises will be expected to reduce their prices in the following circumstances:

(i) if output per employee is increasing faster than the rate of

increase in wages and salaries which is consistent with the criteria for incomes stated in paragraph 15 below, and there are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in nonlabour costs per unit of output;

(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of output are falling and there are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;

(iii) if capital costs per unit of output are falling and there are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-capital costs per unit of output;

(iv) if profits are based on excessive market power.

Considerations affecting incomes policy

11. The development of an effective policy for keeping increases in money incomes in line with increases in real national output will call for considerable efforts on the part of unions and management and all others concerned with the determination of incomes.

Prices and Incomes Act 1966

Ch. 33

601

The object must be to increase productivity and efficiency as rapidly as possible in order to raise real incomes and to avoid, wherever possible, increases in money incomes that push up costs and prices. An important step will be to lay down a "norm* indicating the average rate of annual increase of money incomes per head which is consistent with stability in the general level of prices. In present circumstances the appropriate figure for this purpose is 3-3$ per cent. This would be subject to re-examination by the Government in the light of reviews to be conducted from time to time by the National Economic Development Council.

Employment incomes

12. Wages and salaries are determined by many factors, including changes in the supply and demand for different kinds of labour, trends in productivity and profits, comparisons with levels or trends of incomes in other employments and changes in the cost of living. The weight given to these different factors varies with circumstances. They are also influenced by the policies which the Government pursue in relation to the distribution of incomes. The Government in the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomes have affirmed that their social objective is to ensure that the benefits of faster growth are distributed in a way that satisfies the claims of social need and justice. It is in that context that the following considerations are set out for the guidance of all those concerned with the determination of wages and salaries.

13. If wages and salaries per head are to keep in step with the long-term rate of increase in national productivity, less weight than hitherto will have to be given to the factors mentioned in paragraph 12 and more weight will have to be given to the incomes norm. Moreover, in applying the norm to wages and salaries, it will be necessary to take into account not only increases in wage and salary rates, but also increases in costs resulting from reductions in working hours without loss of pay, from higher rates of pay for overtime or shift work and from improvements in fringe benefits.

14. It would be impracticable and undesirable to lay down detailed rules so as to provide an indication of what changes in wages and salaries were warranted case by case. Nor would it be desirable to inhibit the structural changes necessary in the interests of faster growth. However, experience has shown that in conditions of full employment the normal processes of collective bargaining both at national and local level can result in pay increases which are inflationary in effect. It is accordingly important to ensure that increases in wages and salaries above the norm should be confined to cases in which exceptional treatment can be shown to be required in the national interest These exceptional increases should be kept to a minimum, bearing in mind that they will need to be balanced by lower than average increases to other groups if the increase in wages and salaries over the economy as a whole is to be kept within the norm.

15. Exceptional pay increases should be confined to the following circumstances:

(i) where the employees concerned, for example by accepting more exacting work or a major change in working practices.

Sch. 2

602

Ch. 33

Prices and Incomes Act 1966

See. 2 make a direct contribution towards increasing productivity

in the particular firm or industry. Even in such cases some of the benefit should accrue to the community as a whole in the form of lower prices;

(ii) where it is essential in die national interest to secure a change in the distribution of manpower (or to prevent a change which would otherwise take place) and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for this purpose;

(iii) where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levels are too low to maintain a reasonable standard of living;

(iv) where there is widespread recognition that the pay of a certain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.

Other incomes

16. Some types of incomes, for example those of farmers and landlords, are to a considerable extent determined by Government policy. The Government will, in accordance with its general objective of price stability, have regard to the fact that increases in incomes of this type have an effect on the prices of goods and services. The income of nationalised industries, local authorities, etc. accrues directly to the community, but this does not mean that the price charged by such undertakings should not be susceptible to the general considerations outlined above. The incomes of self-employed persons are an important category of personal incomes. They differ from those of employees in some respects, and allowance must be made for these differences. Nevertheless, those who are responsible for determining or are capable of influencing the incomes of self-employed persons should be guided by the considerations relating to the settlement of incomes and, where appropriate, to the criteria for price behaviour. Increases in these incomes may therefore be referred to the National Board. The other main category of non-employment incomes is profits, a part of which is distributed in the form of personal income to shareholders. An effective policy for avoiding price increases and securing price reductions wherever possible should ensure that increases in profits arise from increased efficiency. Where the growth of profits or dividends is based on excessive market power this could indicate scope for price reductions and such cases would be referred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes for examination.

General considerations

17. The requirement that total money incomes should rise in line with the growth of real national output does not mean that all forms of income should increase at the same rate. It is necessary not only to create the conditions in which essential structural readjustments can be carried out smoothly but also to promote social justice. The general review of money incomes of all kinds to be carried out by the National Economic Development Council will involve not only the assembly of the facts about the movement of the main categories

Prices and Incomes Act 1966

Ch. 33

603

at income—wages, salaries, income from self-employment, profits Sen. 2 (distributed and undistributed) and rent—but also an appraisal of the way the distribution of the national income is developing under die impact of the prices and incomes policy. The Government have pledged themselves to use their fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct any excessive growth in aggregate profits as compared with the growth of total wages and salaries, after allowing for short-term fluctuations.

(5) In determining whether, and in what way, and as from what date, provision for maintenance ought to be made by an order, the court shall have regard to the nature of the property representing the deceased’s net estate and shall not order any such provision to be made as would necessitate a realisation that would be improvident having regard to the interests of the deceased’s dependants and of the person who, apart from the order, would be entitled to that property.

(6) The court shall, on any application made under this Act, have regard to any past, present or future capital or income from any source of the dependant of the deceased to whom the application relates, to the conduct of that dependant in relation to the deceased

and otherwise, and to any other matter or thing which in the circum- Sch. 3 stances of the case the court may consider relevant or material in relation to that dependant, to persons interested in the estate of the deceased, or otherwise.

(7) The court shall also, on any such application, have regard to the deceased's reasons, so far as ascertainable, for making the dispositions made by his will (if any), or for refraining from disposing by will of his estate or part of his estate, or for not making any provision, or any further provision, as the case may be, for a dependant, and the court may accept such evidence of those reasons as it considers sufficient including any statement in writing signed by the deceased and dated, so, however, that in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to any such statement the court shall have regard to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement.

(8) The court in considering for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section whether the disposition of the deceased's estate effected by the law relating to intestacy, or by the combination of the deceased's will and that law, makes reasonable provision for the maintenance of a dependant shall not be bound to assume that the law relating to intestacy makes reasonable provision in all cases.

2. —(1) Except as provided by section 4 of this Act, an application Time within under this Act shall not, without the permission of the court, be made after the end of the period of six months from the date on which ^ust be representation in regard to the estate of the deceased is first taken

out.

(IB) The provisions of this Act shall not render the personal representatives of the deceased liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the expiration of the said period of six months on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might permit an application under this Act after the end of that period, but this subsection shall be without prejudice to any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order under this Act.

(IQ In considering under the foregoing subsections the question when representation was first taken out, a grant limited to settled land or to trust property shall be left out of account and a grant limited to real estate or to personal estate shall be left out of account unless a grant limited to the remainder of the estate has previously been made or is made at the same time.

(2) For the purpose of section 162(1) of the Supreme Court of 1925 c. 49. Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925 (which relates to the discretion of the court as to the persons to whom administration is to be granted) a dependant of a deceased person by whom or on whose behalf an application under this Act is proposed to be made shall be deemed to be a person interested in his estate.

3. —(1) Where an order is made under this Act then for all purposes Effect and including the purposes of the enactments relating to death duties the form of ordcr-will or the law relating to intestacy or both the will and the law relating

Sch. 3 to intestacy, as the case may be, shall have effect, and shall be deemed to have had effect as from the deceased’s death, subject to such variations as may be specified in the order for the purpose of giving effect to the provision for maintenance thereby made. (1A) Any order under this Act providing for maintenance by way of periodical payments may provide for payments of a specified amount, or for payments equal to the whole or part of the income of the net estate or of the income of any part to be set aside or appropriated under this Act of the net estate, or may provide for the amount of the payments or any of them to be determined in any other way which the court thinks fit. (2) The court may give such consequential directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of giving effect to an order made under this Act, but no larger part of the net estate shall be set aside or appropriated to answer by the income thereof the provision for maintenance thereby made than such a part as, at the date of the order, is sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision. (3) A copy of every order made under this Act shall be sent to the principal probate registry for entry and filing, and a memorandum of the order shall be endorsed on, or permanently annexed to, the probate or letters of administration under which the estate is being administered.

Variation of orders. 4.—(1) On an application made at a date after the expiration of the period specified in section 2(1) of this Act the court may make such an order as is hereinafter mentioned, but only as respects property the income of which is at that date applicable for the maintenance of a dependant of the deceased, that is to say, (a) an order for varying the previous order on the ground that any material fact was not disclosed to the court when the order was made, or that any substantial change has taken place in the circumstances of the dependant or of a person beneficially interested in the property under the will or, as the case may be, under the law relating to intestacy, or (b) an order for making provision for the maintenance of another dependant of the deceased. (2) An application to the court for an order under paragraph (a) of the preceding subsection may be made by or on behalf of a dependant of the deceased or by the trustees of the property or by or on behalf of a person beneficially interested therein under the will or, as the case may be, under the law relating to intestacy.

Interim orders. 4A.—(1) Where on an application for maintenance under this Act it appears to the court— (a) that the applicant is in immediate need of financial assistance, but it is not yet possible to determine what order (if any) should be made on the application for the provision of maintenance for the applicant; and

Family Provision Act

Ch. 35

649

(b) that property forming part of the net estate of the deceased Sch. 3 is or can be made available to meet the need of the applicant;

the court may order that, subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the court may impose and to any further order of the court, there shall be paid to or for the benefit of the applicant out of the deceased’s net estate such sum or sums and (if more than one) at such intervals as the court thinks reasonable.

(2) In determining what order, if any, should be made under this section the court shall, so far as the urgency of the case admits, take account of the same considerations as would be relevant in determining what order should be made on the application for the provision of maintenance for the applicant; and any subsequent order for the provision of maintenance may provide that sums paid to or for the benefit of the applicant by virtue of this section shall be treated to such extent, if any, and in such manner as may be provided by that order as having been paid on account of the maintenance provided for by that order.

(3) Subject to subsection (2) above, section 3 of this Act shall apply in relation to an order under this section as it applies in relation to an order providing for maintenance.

(4) Where the deceased’s personal representative pays any sum directed by an order under this section to be paid out of the deceased’s net estate, he shall not be under any liability by reason of that estate not being sufficient to make the payment, unless at the time of making the payment he has reasonable cause to believe that the estate is not sufficient.

5.—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the Interpretation, following expressions shall have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say—

1966 CHAPTER 42

An Act to make further provision, in relation to England and Wales, with respect to the payment of grants to local authorities, rating and valuation, the classification and lighting of highways and the powers of local authorities to place staff and facilities at the disposal of Ministers concerned with highways and to make payments offsetting the effect of the selective employment tax; to repeal or amend certain enactments relating to local licences and registrations; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

[13th December 1966]

Be it enacted by the Queen's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

Part I Grants

Rate support grants for local authorities

1.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, the Rate support Minister shall, for the year 1967-68 and each subsequent year, grants, make grants to local authorities in England and Wales in accordance with this section; and any grants made in pursuance of this subsection shall be known as "rate support grants".

(2) For the purpose of fixing the aggregate amount of the rate support grants for any year the Minister shall determine—

(a) the aggregate amount which is to be available for the payment out of moneys provided by Parliament of grants (other than housing subsidies) to local authorities in respect of their relevant expenditure for that year; and

726

Ch. 42

Local Government Act

Part I

1964 c. 18. 1966 c. 9.

(b) the portion of that amount which the Minister estimates will be allocated to grants in respect of specific services and grants under the Rating (Interim Relief) Act 1964 and the Rating Act 1966;

and the amount remaining after deducting that portion from the aggregate amount aforesaid shall, subject to section 3 of this Act, be the aggregate amount of the rate support grants for that year.

(3) Before determining the amount and the portion mentioned in paragraphs (a)and (b) of subsection (2) of this section the Minister shall consult with such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be concerned and with any local authority with whom consultation appears to him to be desirable, and shall take into consideration—

(a) the current level of prices, costs and remuneration, any

future variation in that level which can be foreseen and the latest information available to him as to the rate of relevant expenditure;

(b) any probable fluctuation in the demand for services

giving rise to relevant expenditure so far as the fluctuation is attributable to circumstances prevailing in England and Wales as a whole which are not under the control of local authorities; and

(c) the need for developing those services and the extent to

which, having regard to general economic conditions, it is reasonable to develop those services;

and for the purpose of determining the said amount and portion the Minister may make such adjustments in respect of relevant expenditure and grants as appear to him to be required to offset the effects on those factors of the constitution or alteration after the passing of this Act of any joint board.

(4) The aggregate amount of the rate support grants for any year shall be divided by the Minister into three parts (to be known respectively as "the needs element", "the resources element " and " the domestic element ") which shall be of such amounts respectively as may be prescribed; and the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Act shall, subject to sections 3 and 4 of this Act, have effect with respect to the determination of the amounts payable to any local authority in respect of those elements for any year and with respect to the other matters there mentioned.

(5) Payments in respect of elements of rate support grant shall be made to any local authority at such times as the Minister may with the consent of the Treasury determine and shall be made in aid of the revenues of the authority generally; but no payment in respect of the needs element shall be made to the

Calculation of standard penny rate product

3.—(1) For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, the standard penny rate product for an area for any year is the sum which bears to the product of a rate of one penny in the pound for that year for the whole of England and Wales the same proportion as the population of the area bears to the population of England and Wales; but in ascertaining the standard penny rate product for a county or county borough the population of any county in the case of which the ratio of the population to the road-mileage of the county is less than seventy shall be increased by one half of the additional population needed in order that the population divided by the road-mileage should be seventy.

(2) In this paragraph " population " means estimated population.

Calculation of expenditure

4.

ought to be regarded as capital expenditure;

(c) that the number of individuals or households living in

the house, as specified by the local authority in the scheme, is unreasonably low;

(d) that the estimate of the surpluses on revenue account in

the scheme is unduly low on account of some assumptions, whether as to rents charged by the local authority or otherwise, made by the authority in arriving at the estimate as to matters which are within the control of the authority.

(2) On an appeal under this section the sheriff may, as he thinks fit, confirm or vary the scheme. 3

(3) If an appeal has been brought against the control order and the sheriff decides on the appeal to revoke the control order, the sheriff shall not proceed with any appeal against the scheme relating to that control order.

(6) If an appellant under subsection (4) of this section has an estate or interest in the house which, apart from the rights conferred on the local authority by the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to control orders, and apart from the rights of persons occupying any part of the house, would give him the right to possession of the house, and that estate or interest was, when the control order came into force, subject to a lease for a term of years which has subsequently expired, then, if that person satisfies the sheriff that he is in a position and intends, if the control order is revoked, to demolish or reconstruct the house or to carry out substantial work of construction on the site of the house, die sheriff shall revoke the control order.

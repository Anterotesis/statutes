Provided that where between the first and the subsequent relevant day changes have been made in the system of management of the sheep kept on the farm and the changes are of such a nature as to reduce the amount of subsidy payments, then in so far as it appears to the appropriate Minister that the changes are not justifiable by circumstances occurring since the first relevant day the appropriate Minister may make a corresponding reduction in the subsidy payments payable by virtue of this subsection.

(3) As respects subsidy payments relating to any such subsequent relevant day as aforesaid, the provision made by a hill sheep scheme by virtue of the last foregoing subsection may be made so as to apply either generally or in any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the appropriate Minister that by reason of the circumstances of a particular applicant for a payment it is equitable that the provision should apply in his case.

(5) Where by reason of the division of a hill farm or any other alteration of boundaries a hill farm occupied on a subsequent relevant day consists of part of a hill farm occupied on the first relevant day, either with or without other land, or of the whole of the last-mentioned farm together with other land, the appropriate Minister may for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section treat the two farms as one, but where by virtue of this subsection two farms are so treated the appropriate Minister may direct that subsection (2) of this section shall apply as if the number and description of sheep in the flock last therein referred to were varied in such manner as appears to him appropriate having regard to the division or the alteration of boundaries, as the case may be.

3.—(1) A hill sheep scheme may provide for the making out of moneys provided by Parliament, in the case of subsidy payments thereunder relating to the second and third relevant days calculated in accordance with subsection (2) of the last foregoing section, of advances in respect of the payments of amounts not exceeding the limits hereinafter provided, and in particular—

(a) for varying the rate for advances, subject to the said

limits, according to the rate of loss by weather conditions sustained by flocks during such period in the year nineteen hundred and forty-seven as may be specified in the scheme or, in the case of payments relating to the second relevant day, according to such other circumstances as may be so specified;

(b) for prescribing a different rate for advances in respect of sheep of different descriptions or comprised in flocks

kept for different purposes or in flocks wherein the number of sheep is maintained by different methods;

(c) for determining the persons to whom and the time at which advances may be made, and for treating the making of an advance as a satisfaction pro tanto of the subsidy payment in question notwithstanding that the person receiving the advance and the person receiving the balance of the payment are not the same;

(d) for prescribing the time within which and the manner in which applications for advances are to be made.

(2) The limits hereinbefore referred to are ten shillings for each sheep in the case of subsidy payments relating to the second relevant day, and seven shillings and sixpence for each sheep in the case of subsidy payments relating to the third relevant day.

(3) Any advances made before the coming into operation of any provision of a hill sheep scheme having effect by virtue of this section, being advances which would have been authorised by that provision if it had then been in force, shall be deemed to be advances authorised by the scheme.

part of the payment in or towards the discharge of any such other liabilities as they think fit, being liabilities for sums which are or may thereafter become payable by way of excess profits tax, the profits tax or income tax in respect of profits, or profits or gains, of the trade or business; and

accepted or agreed to be accepted or acknowledged to be in discharge of all or any part of the liability of all or any of the persons liable under the original direction under the said section twenty-four; and

made the payment; or

(6) the efficient training of the members of the fire brigade;

(c) efficient arrangements for dealing with calls for the assistance of the fire brigade in case of fire and for summoning members of the fire brigade;

(d) efficient arrangements for obtaining, by inspection or otherwise, information required for fire-fignting purposes with respect to the character of the buildings and other property in the area of the fire authority, the available water supplies and the means of access thereto, and other material local circumstances;

(2) For the purposes of such arrangements as are mentioned in paragraph ( d) of the last foregoing subsection, any member of a fire brigade maintained in pursuance of this Act shall, if authorised in writing by the authority maintaining the brigade, have the like powers of entering premises as are conferred upon authorised officers of councils by section two hundred and eighty-seven of the Public Health Act, 1936; and 26 Geo. 5. & accordingly that Act shall have effect as if the references in that1 Edw* 8*c*49 section to an authorised officer of a council included references

to a member of a fire brigade authorised as aforesaid, and as if among the purposes specified in subsection (1) of that section there were included the purposes of carrying out such arrangements as aforesaid.

(3) The Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council constituted under this Act, make regulations prescribing standards of efficiency with respect to any of the matters mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, and the standards may vary according to the requirements of, and the facilities available in, different kinds of locality; and any fire authority whose services are of a standard so prescribed shall, as respects the matter for which the standard is prescribed, be deemed to have complied with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section.

(a) it is necessary to supplement the services provided under the last foregoing section by the authority in whose area the fire occurs, or

(b) reinforcements at any fire can be more readily obtained from the resources of other authorities participating in the scheme than from those of the authority in whose area the fire occurs.

(3) Where in the case of any fire authorities no reinforcement scheme has been made, or it appears to the Secretary of State that any such scheme is no longer satisfactory, the Secretary of State may, after affording an opportunity to all fire authorities appearing to him to be concerned to make representations to him, make a reinforcement scheme for the authorities in question.

(4) A reinforcement scheme may make provision for apportioning between the fire authorities concerned, in such proportions as may be specified by or under the scheme, expenses incurred in taking measures to secure the efficient operation of the scheme.

(5) A reinforcement scheme may contain such provisions requiring uniformity of equipment as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the fire brigades affected will be able to render efficient assistance in pursuance of the scheme.

(a) it is necessary to supplement the services provided by

the authority under the last foregoing section, or

(b) reinforcements at any fire occurring in the area of the authority can be more readily obtained from the resources of the said persons man from the resources of the authority.

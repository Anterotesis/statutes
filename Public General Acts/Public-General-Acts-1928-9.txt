as follows:—

1.—(1) For the purpose of calculating the amount Increase of

of any pension under the Pensions (Governors of units of

Dominions, &c.) Act, 1911 (hereinafter referred to as pensions

“the principal Act”) the unit of pension for every

completed month’s service as Governor shall be increased amount of

State, then, if the amount of the pension payable to

him under the principal Act would, together with any

further pension which might be granted to him under

section three of that Act, be less than the amount of the

pension payable to him under this section, a pension

may be granted to him under the Superannuation

Acts, 1834 to 1919, as if the number of years served

by him as Governor had been passed in service in the

permanent civil service of the State and as if the rate of

salary received by him had been that last received in

respect of his employment in that service (emoluments

being reckoned for this purpose as salary).

3. — (1) Where in any special case it appears to the

Secretary of State and the Treasury that it is impracticable to find appropriate employment in the public service

been employed in service in the permanent civil service

of the State, is entitled neither to a pension under section

nine of the principal Act nor to a pension under the

Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919, by reason of his

having neither completed ten years’ service as a Governor

nor attained the age of sixty years, and that it is nevertheless in the interest of the public service to grant him

a pension, the Treasury may grant lfim a pension under

the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919, as if he had

attained the age of sixty years, and the provisions of subsection (1) of section five of the principal Act shall apply

for the purpose of computing any such pension subject,

save as hereinafter provided, to the modification that so

much of the pension as is payable in respect of his service

as a Governor shall be reduced by one-two-hundred-and-

fortieth for every completed month which must elapse

thereof; or

the office last held by him in the permanent

civil service of the State have been entitled to

receive a pension, by more than will permit of the payment under this section of a pension as

nearly as may be equivalent to that which ho

would have been so entitled to receive.

(2) In this section the expression “unhealthy place ”

has the same meaning as in the Superannuation Act,

1876, and in determining for the purposes of proviso (b) of the last foregoing subsection what pension a Governor

would have been entitled to receive if he had retired

while holding the office last held by him in the permanent

civil service of the State, his service as Governor in an

unhealthy place shall be reckoned in manner provided

by section two of that Act.

(3) Every Minute of the Treasury granting a pension under this section shall set forth the amount of the

pension granted and the reasons for the grant and shall

be laid before Parliament.

(4) This section shall be deemed to have been in

operation as from the ninth day of March, nineteen

hundred and twenty-two.

4. Where a Governor who was, immediately before

his appointment as Governor, serving in an office in the

permanent civil service of a colony, protectorate or

mandated territory dies while he is a Governor, the

Treasury may grant out of moneys provided by Parliament to his legal personal representatives a gratuity

equal to such gratuity, if any, as would, if he had died

at the date at which he ceased to serve in that office have

been payable out of the revenues of the colony, protectorate or mandated territory.

5. For section six of the principal Act (which

relates to deduction from pension on account of salary

or emolument other than pension) there shall be substituted the following section :—

granted under this Act becomes entitled, otherwise than by way of pension, to any salary or

emolument in respect of any employment in

(4) Notwithstanding anything in the Rating and

Valuation (Apportionment) Act, 1928, no hereditament

it ought to be so treated being made to the rating

authority by the owner or occupier of the hereditament

in the prescribed form, which shall be supplied by the

rating authority on the demand of the owner or occupier

of any hereditament in their area.

71. It shall not be necessary for any rating authority

in defining by resolution the class of hereditaments

whereof the owners are to be rated instead of the

at which rent from time to time becomes payable or is

collected, and accordingly the following amendments

shall be made in subsection (1) of section eleven of the

pay to the tenant or allow by way of deduction from

his rent a sum equal to the difference between every

amount payable by the landlord by way of those rates,

after deducting any allowance, commission, abatement,

or deduction granted to him by the rating authority,

and the amount which would have been so payable

at the rate in the pound current for the time being if

the rateable value of the hereditament had been equivalent to the net annual value thereof.

(2) Where any part of any premises for the time

being assessed as an industrial hereditament is let out

to a tenant, that part shall, notwithstanding that it is

not separately assessed for rating purposes, be deemed

for the purposes of this section to be a separate hereditament, and the amount of the sums payable under this

section by the landlord to the tenant of that part in

respect of any rate or instalment of a rate becoming

due before it is assessed as a separate hereditament

aside; the residue of the county apportionment after

such sums as aforesaid have been so set aside, shall be

paid to the council of the county and shall be called

the “ General Exchequer Grant ” of that council:

Provided that, if in the case of any county the

county apportionment is less than the amount to be so

set aside, the deficiency shall be paid out of moneys

provided by Parliament, and the sums so paid shall be

treated as part of the county apportionment.

in the case of any county the county apportionment falls

short of an amount arrived at by adding to the standard

sum a sum equivalent to one shilling per head of the

period be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament

to the council of the county a sum equal to the deficiency.

(2) As respects each subsequent fixed grant period,

period in question be paid out of moneys provided by

Parliament to the council of the county a sum equal to

the deficiency.

(3) For the purposes of this section, the standard

sum as respects any county shall be the amount of the

loss on account of rates and grants of that county, so,

however, that—

(a) if, for the fixed grant period in question the

General Exchequer Contribution is less than

the General Exchequer Contribution for the

first fixed grant period, the standard sum shall

be the said amount reduced proportionately to

such diminution in the General Exchequer

Contribution;

(6) if for the fixed grant period in question the

weighted population of the county is less than

the weighted population of the county for the

first fixed grant period adjusted as regards

unemployment, the standard sum shall be the

said amount reduced (or if a reduction therein

has been made under paragraph (a) of this

subsection, that reduced amount further

reduced) proportionately to such diminution

in weighted population.

(4) In this section the expression “adjusted as

regards unemployment” means calculated as if the

appropriate multiple mentioned in Rule 2 of Part III

of the Fourth Schedule to this Act had been the multiple

appropriate to the fixed grant period in question, and

not the multiple appropriate to the first fixed grant

period.

Parliament to the council of a county under this section

in respect of any year shall be called the “Additional

Exchequer Grant ” of that council.

expenditure which will be defrayed by the council of the district upon services in connection with maternity

and child welfare; and where such a scheme is made,

the sum to be set aside out of the county apportionment-

in respect of the district shall be increased accordingly.

called the “ Railway Freight Rebates Fund ” (hereinafter referred

to as " the fund ”) which shall be administered and controlled

House, and as from the first day of October, nineteen hundred

and twenty-nine, each of the companies shall, by equal monthly

instalments beginning on the fifteenth day of November, nineteen

hundred and twenty-nine, pay to the fund in respect of every

year sums equal in the aggregate to the estimated rate relief

of the company in that year; and as soon as the difference, if

any, between the actual rate relief of a company in any year

and the estimated rate relief of the company in that year has

been ascertained, a sum equal to the difference shall be paid by

way of adjustment out of the fund to the company or by the

company to the fund, as the case may require.

3. The companies shall jointly, on or before the first day

of June, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine, prepare and submit

to the tribunal a scheme (hereinafter referred to as “ the

—cont. 0 f companies (being companies to which this Schedule applies)

of which the aggregate total expenditure on capital account is

not less than ninety per cent, of the aggregate total expenditure

on capital account of all the companies.

4. If the scheme so provides there shall, in every year, be

set aside in the fund for the purpose of meeting any deficiency

therein at the end of the year a contingency reserve of such

an amount, not exceeding five per cent, of the aggregate of the

sums paid and payable into the fund in respect of that year

under paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule, as the scheme

may determine.

5. —(1) There shall in respect of every year be paid out of the general moneys of the fund—

(a) in respect of administrative expenses, a sum equal to

one-half of one per cent, of the aggregate of the estimated rate relief of the companies in respect of that

may allow on application in that behalf being made by

the companies; and

(b) any interest payable on sums borrowed by the Railway

Gearing House in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule; and

(c) to each of the companies a sum, determined in accordance with the provisions of the scheme, equal to the

amount of the rebates allowed by the company under

the scheme in respect of selected traffics delivered in

that year for conveyance by railway.

(2) Out of the sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) (a)

of this paragraph there shall be allocated and paid to the Railway

Clearing House a sum equal to the amount of the administrative

expenses incurred by them in that year in giving effect to

the provisions of this Schedule and the balance shall be

appropriated for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the

companies incurred in that year under or for the purposes of the scheme and shall be apportioned between the companies

and paid to them in proportion to the rebates respectively allowed

by them under the scheme.

6. —(1) The rebates provided for by the scheme shall be so

calculated, as nearly as may be, that—

(a) the aggregate of the rebates in respect of the group of

selected traffics contained in Part II. of this Schedule

205

(c) the aggregate of the rebates in respect of the group of

selected traffics contained in Part IV. of this Schedule

will amount annually to a sum equal to one-tenth of the annual net revenue of the fund.

(2) The scheme shall make provision for securing that the

rebates in respect of the selected traffics contained in each of the several groups, other than rebates from tolls, will be at a

uniform rate and that rebates from any toll in respect of the

selected traffics shall be such percentage of the toll as may be

determined by the scheme.

(3) In preparing the scheme—

(a) the receipts of the companies in respect of the several

selected traffics shall, for the purpose of calculating

the rebates to be allowed under the scheme, be taken

to be those estimated for the year nineteen hundred

and twenty-seven; and

(b) the rate-relief of the companies in the year beginning

on the first day of October, nineteen hundred and

twenty-nine, shall be taken to be of such amount as

may be estimated by the companies.

(4) The scheme shall provide for the manner in which the

rebates thereby provided for are to be allowed, and for the time

at which payments or instalments of payments are to be made

out of the fund to the companies, and contain such supplemental and consequential provisions as may be necessary for

giving effect to the objects of this Schedule, and, in particular,

may make provision for enabling rebates to be allowed in

respect of merchandise consigned as being intended to be

so used, shipped or delivered as to constitute it a selected

traffic, before it has been so used, shipped or delivered, and

may contain provisions enabling the Railway Clearing House

to remit any repayment due to the fund by any company in

respect of any amount allowed in error by the company in excess

of the rebates required by the scheme if the Railway Clearing

apportionment being obtained by the companies and for the

allowance of rebates apportioned upon the basis thereof, subject

to occasional verification of the facts thereby certified.

7. —(1) Printed copies of the scheme as submitted to the

tribunal shall be made available by the companies for purchase

at such places and at such price as the tribunal may direct, and

notice of the places and price at which such copies may be purchased shall be published in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes.

Not less than twenty-one days after the publication of the said

notices the tribunal shall consider the scheme, and, after-hearing

any of the companies or any representative body of traders interested which may be desirous of being heard, shall have power

to make such modifications therein, if any, as the tribunal think

necessary or desirable, and upon receiving a certificate, as respects

England from the Minister of Health and as respects Scotland from

the Secretary of State, showing the amount estimated by them

respectively as being the estimated rate-relief of the companies

in the year beginning on the first day of October, nineteen

hundred and twenty-nine, shall adopt the estimates shown by

the certificates and shall make such modifications in the scheme

as may be thereby rendered necessary.

(2) After making such modifications in the scheme as the

tribunal are hereinbefore required to make and any other modifications which they think necessary or desirable, and upon being

satisfied that the scheme complies with the requirements of this

Schedule, the tribunal shall, not later than the thirty-first day

of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine, approve the scheme.

8. If the companies fail to submit the scheme to the

tribunal before the said first day of June, or before such later

date as may be allowed by the tribunal, the scheme shall be

prepared and made by the tribunal before the said thirty-first

day of July, and the companies shall furnish to the tribunal

such information as the tribunal may require for that purpose.

9. The scheme, as so approved or made by the tribunal

under the foregoing provisions of this Schedule, shall come into

operation on the first day of October, nineteen hundred and

10.—(1) The tribunal shall review the operation of the

scheme within two months after the end o c every year and

shall give not less than twenty-one days’ notice of the date,

time and place of the sitting at which the review will take place,

and at any such review the tribunal, after hearing any of the

companies or any representative body of traders interested which

may be desirous of being heard, and after considering all the

circumstances (including the receipts of the companies in respect

of the several selected traffics delivered during the year preceding

the review for conveyance by railway), shall, subject as hereinafter provided, by order make in the scheme such modifications,

if any, as they think necessary or desirable, but so that the

provisions thereof shall comply with the requirements of this

Schedule:

Provided that—

(a) the tribunal shall not by any such order alter the rate

for the time being in force of any rebate provided for

by the scheme unless—

(i) a debit balance is brought forward in the

fund from the last preceding year; or

(ii) the tribunal is of opinion that in tho year in

which the review takes place the amount of the

rate-relief of the companies will be less than the

amount thereof estimated for the purpose of calcu

lating the rebates in force, and that, unless such

alterations are made, there will be a deficiency in

the fund in respect of that year; or

(iii) the tribunal is of opinion that, Hnless such

alterations are made, the aggregate of the rebates

in respect of any group of selected traffics will, in

the year in which the review takes place, fall short

of a sum equal to the appropriate proportion of the net revenue of the fund for that year by more

than the fixed marginal allowance; and

(b) the rates of rebates for the time being in force in

respect of any group of selected traffics shall not be

reduced by any alteration made under sub-para-

graph (iii) of paragraph (a) of this proviso, unless the

tribunal is of opinion that, if such reductions are not

made, the aggregate of the rebates in respect of that

group will, in the year in which the review takes place,

exceed a sum equal to the appropriate proportion of the net revenue of the fund for that year by more

than the fixed marginal allowance; and

(c) no alteration shall in any case be made in the rates of

rebates to be allowed in respect of the selected

traffics which would cause the aggregate of the

rebates to be allowed in respect of any group of

selected traffics to fall short of a sum equal to the

appropriate proportion of the net -revenue of the

fund.

(2) In this paragraph the following expressions have the

meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say :—

“ Appropriate proportion of the net revenue of the

fund " means, as respects any group of selected traffics,

the proportion specified in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 6 of this Part of this Schedule in relation to that

group:

“ Fixed marginal allowance ” shall in any year be

taken to be, in relation to any group of selected traffics,

an amount equivalent to one per cent, of the amount

estimated by the tribunal as being the aggregate of the

carriage charges made and to be made by the companies

in respect of the traffics contained in that group, delivered

in that year for conveyance by railway.

11. If it appears to the Minister of Transport that by reason

of some exceptional occurrence the net revenue of the fund for

any year is or will be abnormally greater or less than the amount

which, upon the basis of the rebates for the time being in force,

will be required, to pay the sums payable thereout under

paragraph five of this Part of this Schedule to the companies

in respect of that year, and that there is danger of such instability

being thereby occasioned in the rates of the said rebates as to

affect prejudicially the operation of the scheme, he shall issue

to the tribunal a certificate that in his opinion the rates of the

rebates to be allowed in respect of any group of selected traffics

specified in the certificate ought to be reviewed, and upon receipt

of such a certificate the tribunal shall, notwithstanding anything

in this Part of this Schedule, have power to make such alterations

in the scheme as they consider desirable for stabilising, so far as

practicable, the rates of the rebates to be allowed in respect of

that group, and, if they think fit, for securing that any abnormal

excess shall be expended, or abnormal deficiency made good, as

the case may be, over such period of years as they think proper.

12. —(1) The tribunal shall have the like powers to make

general rules governing their procedure and practice and generally

for carrying into effect their functions under this Schedule, and

to prescribe a scale of fees for and in connection with proceedings before them, as they have under section twenty-two of the

Railways Act, 1921, with respect to their functions under

Part III of that Act, but subject to the like approval, consent

and limitations as are required or imposed by that section, and

court so directs, the following provisions shall have effect,

entitled to object, and for that purpose shall

ascertain, as far as possible without requiring

not entered on the fist are to claim to be so

entered or are to be excluded from the right of

objecting to the reduction:

(c) Where a creditor entered on the fist whose debt

or claim is not discharged or has not determined

does not consent to the reduction, the court may,

creditor, on the company securing payment of

his debt or claim by appropriating, as the court

may direct, the following amount:—

subject to supervision, the court may by that or any

subsequent order appoint an additional liquidator.

(2) A liquidator appointed by the court under this

Provided that the powers specified in paragraphs (d),

(e) and (/) of subsection (1) of section one hundred and

creditor’s voluntary winding up, with the sanction of

either the court or the committee of inspection.

for a winding up subject to supervision shall for all

purposes be deemed to be an order for winding up by

the court:

Provided that, where the order for winding up

subject to supervision was made in relation to a creditor’s

voluntary winding up in which a committee of inspection

had been appointed, the order shall be deemed to be an

order for winding up by the court for the purpose of

thereof) and section two hundred and one of this Act,

except in so far as the operation of those sections is

excluded in a voluntary winding up by general rules.

of any cash paid to the company at the time of or

subsequently to the creation of, and in consideration

for, the charge, together with interest on that amount

at the rate of five per cent, per annum.

267.—(1) Where any part of the property of a

company which is being wound up consists of land of any

tenure burdened with onerous covenants, of shares or stock

in companies, of unprofitable contracts, or of any other

property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by

reason of its binding the possessor thereof to the performance of any onerous act, or to the payment of any sum

of £ money, the liquidator of the company, notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken

possession of the property, or exercised any act of

ownership in relation thereto, may, with the leave of the court and subject to the provisions of this section,

by writing signed by him, at any time within twelve

months after the commencement of the winding up or

such extended period as may be allowed by the court,

disclaim the property:

Provided that, where any such property has not

come to the knowledge of the liquidator within one

month after the commencement of the winding up, the

power under this section of disclaiming the property

may be exercised at any time within twelve months

after he has become aware thereof or such extended

period as may be allowed by the court.

(2) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as

from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interest, and

liabilities of the company, and the property of the

company, in or in respect of the property disclaimed,

but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company and the property of the

company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of

any other person.

(3) The court, before or on granting leave to disclaim, may require such notices to be given to persons

interested, and impose such terms as a condition of

granting leave, and make such other order in the matter

as the court thinks just.

(4) The liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim

any property under this section in any case where an

application in writing has been made to him by any

persons interested in the property requiring him to

decide whether he will or will not disclaim, and the

liquidator has not, within a period of twenty-eight days

after the receipt of the application or such further period

as may be allowed by the court, given notice to the

applicant that he intends to apply to the court for

leave to disclaim, and, in the case of a contract, if the

liquidator, after such an application as aforesaid, does

not within the said period or further period disclaim

the contract, the company shall be deemed to have

adopted it.

(5) The court may, on the application of any person

who is, as against the liquidator, entitled to the benefit

or subject to the burden of a contract made with the

company, make an order rescinding the contract on such

terms as to payment by or to either party of damages for

the non-performance of the contract, or otherwise as the

court thinks just, and any damages payable under the

order to any such person may be proved by him as a debt

in the winding up.

(6) The court may, on an application by any person

who either claims any interest in any disclaimed property

or is under any liability not discharged by this Act in

respect of any disclaimed property and on hearing any

such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the

vesting of the property in or the delivery of the property

to any persons entitled thereto, or to whom it may seem

just that the property should be delivered by way of

compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee

for him, and on such terms as the court thinks just, and

on any such vesting order being made, the property

comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person

therein named in that behalf without any conveyance

or assignment for the purpose:

Provided that, where the property disclaimed is

of a leasehold nature, the court shall not make a vesting

order in favour of any person claiming under the

company, whether as under-lessee or as mortgagee by

demise, including a chargee by way of legal mortgage,

except upon the terms of making that person—

(a) subject to the same liabilities and obligations

as those to which the company was subject

under the lease in respect of the property at

the commencement of the winding-up; or

(b) if the court thinks fit, subject only to the same

liabilities and obligations as if the lease had

been assigned to that person at that date;

and in either event (if the case so requires) as if the lease

had comprised only the property comprised in the

vesting order, and any mortgagee or under-lessee declining

to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be

excluded from all interest in and security upon the

property, and, if there is no person claiming under the

company who is willing to accept an order upon such

terms, the court shall have power to vest the estate and

interest of the company in the property in any person

liable either personally or in a representative character,

and either alone or jointly with the company to perform

the lessee’s covenants in the lease, freed and discharged

from all estates, incumbrances and interests created

therein by the company.

of the company to the amount of the injury, and may

accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding up.

against the goods or lands of a company or has attached

any debt due to the company, and the company is

subsequently wound up, he shall not be entitled to

retain the benefit of the execution or attachment against

the liquidator in the winding up of the company unless

he has completed the execution or attachment before

the commencement of the winding up:

resolution for voluntary winding up has been passed, the

sheriff shall, on being so required, deliver the goods and

any money seized or received in part satisfaction of the

execution to the liquidator, but the costs of the execution

shall be a first charge on the goods or money so

delivered, and the liquidator may sell the goods, or a

sufficient part thereof, for the purpose of satisfying that

charge.

effects if sold shall be made forthcoming to the

liquidator:

Provided that any arrester or poinder

payment of the whole debts of the company,

principal and interest, accumulated at the said

is to that provision as modified by any statute for

the time being in force.

Unless the context otherwise requires, expressions defined

in the Act or any statutory modification thereof in

force at the date at which these regulations become

binding on the company, shall have the meanings

so defined.

Shares.

2. Subject to the provisions, if any, in that behalf of the

memorandum of association, and without prejudice to any special

rights previously conferred on the holders of existing shares,

any share may be issued with such preferred, deferred, or other

special rights, or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend,

voting, return of share capital, or otherwise, as the company

may from time to time by special resolution determine, and

any preference share may, with the sanction of a special resolution,

be issued on the terms that it is, or at the option of the

company is liable, to be redeemed.

3. If at any time the share capital is divided into different

classes of shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class)

may be varied v ith the consent in writing of the holders of three-

fourths of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction

of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general

meeting of the holders of the shares of the class. To every

such separate general meeting the provisions of these regulations

relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but

one shilling, and on such terms, if any, as to evidence and

indemnity, as the directors think fit.

a fully paid share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or

not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share, and

the company shall also have a lien on all shares (other than fully

paid shares) standing registered in the name of a single person

for all moneys presently payable by him or his estate to the

company; but the directors may at any time declare any share

to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this regulation. The company’s lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all

dividends payable thereon.

think fit, any shares on which the company has a lien, but no sale

shall be made unless some sum in respect of which the hen exists

the proceedings in reference to the sale.

and applied in payment of such, part of the amount in respect

of which the lien exists as is presently payable, and the residue

entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

Calls on Shares.

11. The directors may from time to time make calls upon

the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares

fourteen days’ notice specifying the time or times of payment)

liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.

on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom

the sum is due shall pay interest upon the sum at the rate of five

pounds per centum per annum from the day appointed for the

payment thereof to the time of the actual payment, but the

directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of that interest

wholly or in part.

14. The provisions of these regulations as to the liability of

joint holders and as to payment of interest shall apply in the case

of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a

share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the share, or by way of premium, as if the same had

become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

15. The directors may make arrangements on the issue

of bhares for a difference between the holders in the amount

of calls to be paid and in the times of payment.

member willing to advance the same all or any part of the moneys

uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him; and upon

all or any of the moneys so advanced may (until the same would,

but for such advance, become presently payable) pay interest

at such rate (not exceeding, without the sanction of the company

was lodged with the company send to the transferee notice

of the refusal.

nominal amount of the shares.

28. A statutory declaration in writing that the declarant

is a director of the company, and that a share in the company

has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall

persons claiming to be entitled to the share. The company

may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on

any sale or disposition thereof and may execute a transfer

of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or

disposed of and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder

of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application

of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be

affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in

reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.

29. The provisions of these regulations as to forfeiture shall

apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms

of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on

shares of any denomination.

31. The holders of stock may transfer the same, or any part

thereof, in the same manner, and subject to the same regulations,

as, and subject to which, the shares from which the stock arose

might previously to conversion have been transferred, or as near

thereto as circumstances admit; but the directors may from

time to time fix the minimum amount of stock transferable, and

restrict or forbid the transfer of fractions of that minimum, but

the minimum shall not exceed the nominal amount of the shares

from which the stock arose.

32. The holders of stock shall, according to the amount of the stock held by them, have the same rights, privileges, and

advantages as regards dividends, voting at meetings of the

company, and other matters as if they held the shares from which

the stock arose, but no such privilege or advantage (except

participation in the dividends and profits of the company) shall

be conferred by any such aliquot part of stock as would not, if

existing in shares, have conferred that privilege or advantage.

meetings in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to

the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled. The

offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares

offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not

accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and after the expiration

of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person

to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares

offered, the directors may dispose of those shares in such maimer

as they think most beneficial to the company. The directors may

likewise so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio

which the new shares bear to shares held by persons entitled to

an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the directors, be

conveniently offered under this article.

35. The new shares shall be subject to the same provisions

wiih refer* nee to the payment of calls, lien, transfer, transmission,

forteituie, and otherwise as the shares in the original share

in default, at such time in the third month following that in which

the anniversary of the company’s incorporation occurs, and at

such place, as the directors shall appoint. In default of a general

month next following, and may be convened by any two members

40. The above-mentioned general meetings shall be called

ordinary general meetings; all other general meetings shall be

called extraordinary general meetings.

41. The directors may, whenever they think fit, convene

an extraordinary general meeting, and extraordinary general

meetings shall also be convened on such requisition, or, in default,

may be convened by such requisitionists, as provided by section 114 of the Act. If at any time there are not within the

United Kingdom sufficient directors capable of acting to form

may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner

as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened

by the directors.

of some particular meeting, that meeting may be convened by

such shorter notice and in such manner as those members may

vote for each share of which he is the holder.

55. In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior who

tenders a vote whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted

to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and

for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in

which the names stand in the register of members.

56. A member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom

authority been calculated as if this Act had not passed:

payable to the authority under this section shall be such

as may be estimated and certified as the sum which

would have been so payable if the said amount in the

pound had not been so increased as aforesaid.

or any part thereof and shall transmit the same and the grounds

thereof in writing to the auditor and a copy thereof to the officer

concerned and to the county clerk or town clerk, as the case may

be, two clear days before the time notified as aforesaid, and any

of this Schedule that any payment is in his opinion contrary

to law and should be disallowed or that any sum which in his

opinion ought to have been is not brought into account by any

person, whether such payment or failure to account has been

made matter of objection or not, he shall, by an interim report

under his hand, report thereon to the Secretary of State setting

forth the grounds of his opinion as aforesaid, and the Secretary

of State shall cause such interim report to be intimated to the

objector, if any, to the officer or other person affected thereby,

and to the council concerned, and shall consider any statement

in writing which may be made to him thereon by or on behalf

of any party to whom such intimation was given within fourteen

days of the date of such intimation, and after such further

inquiry as he may think fit the Secretary of State shall decide

all questions raised by such interim report and shall disallow

all illegal payments and surcharge the amount of any illegal

payment or of any loss or deficiency due to failure to bring a

sum into account upon any person or persons by whose negligence

or wrongful act that payment has been made or authorised or

that loss or deficiency has been incurred:

interim report, the Secretary of State may, on the application

of the auditor or of any party to whom the interim report requires

law arising on the interim report for the opinion of either division

of the Court of Session, and the procedure in the stated case shall

be such as may be prescribed by Act of Sederunt.

9. If the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person

making the illegal payment or authorising it to be made, or

failing to bring the sum into account, acted reasonably, or in the

belief that his action was authorised by law, or that the payment

was made, or the failure took place under such circumstances

as to make it fair and equitable that a disallowance or surcharge

should not be made, the Secretary of State shall abstain from

ma king a disallowance or surcharge.

the Secretary of State, provided that, if the Secretary of State

shall so determine, such abstract may come in place of and render

unnecessary a return of the receipts and expenditure of the

council in pursuance of the Local Taxation Returns (Scotland)

every burgh being a county of a city with a report and certificate

thereon as aforesaid.

burgh of the time and place during which the said abstract shall

be open to the inspection of all ratepayers within the county

or within the burgh, as the case may be.

13. Where any surcharge has been made as hereinbefore

provided or the auditor has made any report (other than an

interim report) respecting the accounts or the receipts and

expenditure of the council, the Secretary of State may require

the council to cause such public notice as he may direct to be

given of the surcharge or report and in case of default in such

publication the Secretary of State may cause such notice to be

given, and the cost of such notice to the amount certified by the

Secretary of State shall be a debt due from the council to His

Majesty and the county clerk or town clerk, as the case may

be, shall be liable in case of such default in such notice being

given to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.

to the auditor that in the event of any expenditure

Rules for Calculations in respect op General

Exchequer Grants.

Part I.

Rules for determining Losses on account of Rates.

1. There shall be estimated and certified as respects each

rating area—

(a) the expenditure in respect of the standard year which

would have fallen to be borne by rates levied in that area

on the assumption that the expenditure on the transferred functions was expenditure by the transferee

authority except that expenditure on any function

for the purpose of which a large burgh is included

within a county, shall, so far as such expenditure

relates to the large burgh, be assumed to be expenditure

by the town council of the burgh;

(b) the unreduced rateable value of the area ;

(c) the reduced rateable value of the area;

(d) the difference between the unreduced rateable value and

the reduced rateable value of the area. That difference

increased by a percentage ascertained in the prescribed

manner in respect of unoccupied lands and heritages is

hereinafter referred to as “ the loss of rateable value.”

2. In estimating and certifying the expenditure on the

transferred functions by a county or large burgh for the

burgh shall be deemed to be the expenditure by the county

council or the council of the burgh on the transferred functions.

3. The loss on account of rates of a rating area shall be

a sum bearing the same proportion to expenditure which

would have fallen to be borne by rates as aforesaid as the loss

of rateable value of the area bears to the unreduced rateable

value thereof.

4. The loss on account of rates of a county shall be the

aggregate of the losses on account of rates of the several separate

rating areas within the county.

5. For the purpose of estimating the loss on account of a

special rate, the foregoing rules shall have effect as if the

burghs into which the area extends, and the amount apportioned

1929. Local Government (Scotland) Ch. 25.

Act, 1929.

to any county or large burgh shall be deemed to be an amount

paid or payable to a spending authority within that county or

burgh.

4. The loss on account of grants of a spending authority shall

pound specified in the precept shall be taken to be the

amount which would have been so produced if this Act

CHAPTER 28.

An Act to permit the issue by Friendly Societies

and Industrial Assurance Companies of policies

of assurance on the duration of certain lives for

a specified period, to validate certain endowment

policies issued by such societies and companies,

to exclude repayments of premiums under

endowment policies from the computation of the

maximum sums which may be paid on death

by such societies and companies, and to make

provision as to the rights of owners of certain

endowment policies upon the surrender thereof.

[10th May 1929.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

may issue policies of assurance, there shall be included

insuring money to be paid to the member or person

assured on the duration for a specified period of the life

of his parent, child, grand-parent, grandchild, brother or

sister, either with or without provision for the payment

of money in the event of the death of any such person

before the expiration of the period:

Provided that no such society or company shall

insure or pay on the death of any person under such a

policy as aforesaid, issued after the commencement of this Act, any sum of money exceeding a reasonable

amount for funeral expenses.

(2) The issuing of such policies by a collecting

society or an industrial assurance company shall, unless

the premiums in respect thereof are payable at intervals

of two months or more, be treated as part of the

industrial assurance business of the society or company.

section four of the Industrial Assurance Act, 1923, shall

not apply as respects any such repayment.

last premium was paid or, if no premium has been paid

since the date of the commencement of this Act, within

one year from that date, to surrender the policy and to

claim either—

rules contained in the Schedule to this Act; or

(b) payment of a surrender value equal to ninety

per cent, of the value of the sum or sums

payable under such a free paid-up policy as

aforesaid, calculated in accordance with the last

four rules contained in the Fourth Schedule to

the Industrial Assurance Act, 1923,

and if any society or company fails to comply with any

claun made in accordance with the provisions of this

subsection, then, without prejudice to any other liability,

the society or company shall, in the case of a friendly

society not being a collecting society, be guilty of an

offence under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and, in

the case of a collecting society or industrial assurance

company, be guilty of an offence under the Industrial

Assurance Act, 1923.

5. A person intending to purchase an annuity for

years, or some person on his behalf, shall sign and

and according to the average price of consolidated stock

on the day preceding the date of the authority or certificate hereinafter mentioned.

(2) Where the consideration for the annuity is

consolidated stock, the annuity shall be of such amount

as the consolidated stock would purchase according to

such tables approved by the Treasury under this Part

of this Act as are for the time being in force.

(3) Where the consideration for the annuity consists

of other Government stock or annuities or money, the

stock, annuities or money shall first be converted into

terms of consolidated stock, according, in the case of

stock or annuities, to the average price thereof, to be

ascertained as hereinafter mentioned, and the annuity

shall be calculated with reference to the amount of

consolidated stock produced by such conversion, and

whenever the consideration is a sum of money, a charge

of two shillings and sixpence shall be made for every

entire one hundred pounds of consolidated stock produced

by such conversion as aforesaid.

(4) Where the amount of the annuity so calculated

produces a fraction less than fourpence, the fractional

part of the annuity less than fourpence shall be omitted

from the annuity.

price of stock and annuities according to which the

amount of annuity to be granted under this Part of this Act is to be so calculated, the Bank of England shall

place in the office of the Comptroller-General, for the

purpose of enabling persons to ascertain the price at

which stock or annuities may be transferred or money

laid out in the purchase of annuities.

(6) If no stock or annuities have been so bought on

any day, the calculation shall be made in accordance with

the average price of the stock or annuities on the nearest

preceding day.

(7) The amount of every annuity shall be calculated

been discharged under the provisions of this schedule relating

to warranties, any proceedings under this schedule for giving

and bridge

owners to

enter into

agreements

Ch. 33. Bridges Act, 1929. 19 & 20 Geo. 5.

Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

as follows :—

1. —(1) The bridges to which this Act applies are

bridges or viaducts by which a public carriage road is

carried over any railway, canal, river, creek, watercourse, marsh or other place where water flows or is

collected, or any ravine or other depression, not being

bridges or viaducts for the maintenance and repair of

which a highway authority is responsible.

(2) The powers conferred by this Act on a highway

authority shall be exercisable—

(a) in the case of a bridge in a county borough, by

the council of the borough;

(b) in the case of a bridge in the City of London,

by the common council of the City;

(c) in the case of a bridge in an urban district, if

the road at each end of the bridge is vested in

the county council, and in the case of a bridge

in a rural district, by the council of the county

in which the bridge is situate;

(d) in the case of any other bridge, either by the

council of the county in which the bridge is

situate, or by the council of the metropolitan

borough or urban district in which the bridge

is situate, or by such councils jointly.

Where a bridge is situate partly in one area and

partly in another, any council may exercise the powers of

a highway authority in relation to the bridge if the council

could have exercised those powers in relation thereto

had the bridge been situate wholly within the area for

which the council acts.

For the purposes of this subsection, “ bridge ” includes the road carried thereby and the approaches

thereto.

2. —(1) A highway authority may agree with the

owner of a bridge—

(a) for the payment by the highway authority of

contributions towards the cost of the maintenance, improvement, or reconstruction of the

bridge, or the road carried thereby, or the

approaches thereto;

(b) for the transfer to the highway authority, on

such terms as may be agreed, of the responsibility

1929.

Bridges Act, 1929.

Ch. 33.

763

for the maintenance and improvement of the

road carried by the bridge or the approaches

thereto;

(c) for the transfer to the highway authority, on

such terms as may be agreed, of the property in

the bridge and the road carried thereby and

the approaches thereto, and of all or any rights

and obligations attaching to such bridge, road

or approaches;

and it shall be lawful for the owner of the bridge,

notwithstanding that the bridge was constructed under

statutory powers, to enter into and carry into effect any

such agreement.

(2) Where any such agreement provides for the

transfer to the highway authority of any rights or

obligations attaching to a bridge, then, as from the date

of the transfer, it shall be lawful for the highway

authority to exercise the rights, and they shall, to the

exclusion of the owner, be subject to the obligations,

so transferred.

3. — (1) If the owner of a bridge, or a highway

authority, considers that the bridge is or may be, by

reason of its construction, position, or state of repair,

dangerous or unsuitable for the requirements of road

traffic as then existing or the anticipated development

thereof, or that the responsibility for the maintenance

and improvement of the road carried by the bridge or

the approaches thereto should for any reason be

transferred from the owner to a highway authority,

the owner or authority may apply to the Minister for

an order to provide for the reconstruction or improvement or maintenance of the bridge or road carried

thereby or the approaches thereto.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Minister

on any such application, after consultation with the

owner of the bridge and every highway authority

entitled to exercise with respect thereto the powers

conferred by this Act and after holding an inquiry, if

either the owner or any such highway authority requests

him in writing to hold an inquiry, may make an order,

and may by the order—

(a) require the execution of such works of reconstruction or improvement either by the owner

of bridges.

or by a highway authority as may he specified

in the order;

(b) determine and direct by whom the bridge and

the road carried thereby and the approaches

thereto shall be maintained;

(c) in the case of a swing bridge, determine and

direct by whom and in what manner it shall be

operated, so, however, that in the case of a

swing bridge crossing a canal, he shall not

direct that the bridge shall be operated otherwise than by the owner of the canal unless

he is satisfied, after considering any representations made to him by the owner, that

the facilities for traffic on the canal will not be

prejudiced thereby;

(d) provide for the transfer to and vesting in a

highway authority of the property in the bridge

or the road carried thereby or the approaches

thereto and of all or any rights and obligations

attaching thereto;

(e) modify, so far as he considers necessary to give

effect to the order, any statutory provisions

applicable to a bridge other than the provisions

of any general Act; so, however, that, in the

case of a bridge crossing a railway or a canal,

he shall not, without the consent of the owner

of the railway or canal, modify any provisions

relating to the headway of that bridge or the

width of the canal and, in the case of a swing

bridge, he shall not modify any provisions

relating to precedence of traffic;

(f) make such incidental, consequential, and supplemental provisions as may appear necessary

or proper for the purposes of the order, including such provisions authorising the acquisition

of land or casements or the construction of

works as could have been made under paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section three of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, for the

purposes specified in that paragraph.

(3) Before making any order under this section with

respect to a bridge crossing tidal lands, the Minister shall

consult with the Board of Trade, and any order made

1920.

Bridges Act, 1929.

Cri. 33.

705

by him with respect to such bridge shall include such

provisions as the Board of Trade may deem necessary.

(4) Before making an order under this section for

the reconstruction or improvement of a bridge, the Minister shall take into consideration the desirability of

special facilities or accommodation being provided for

carrying across the bridge the mains, pipes, cables or

wires of public utility undertakings:

Provided that, in any case where the provision of

facilities or accommodation greater than those available

in the bridge before reconstruction or improvement would

increase the cost of the reconstruction or improvement,

he shall have regard to the amount of any contribution

towards such cost which any public utility undertaking

may be willing to make.

(5) No order shall be made under this section

with respect to any bridge to which any right to take

tolls attaches.

(6) The Minister may postpone the date of the

operation of an order made under this section in any

case where it appears to him that, owing to the number

or nature of the orders and applications affecting the

same highway authority or bridges belonging to the same

owner, the making of an order which would be

immediately operative would work hardship to the

authority or to the owner.

(7) An order made under this section shall be final

and have effect as if enacted in this Act.

4.—(1) An order made under this Act with respect

to a bridge owned by a railway company which carries

a road over a railway of the company, or carries both a

road and a railway of the company, or with respect to

a bridge owned by a dock authority, shall not, without

the consent of the owners of the bridge, either require

works for the reconstruction or improvement of the

structure of the bridge to be carried out otherwise

than by the owners, or direct the structure of the

bridge to be maintained otherwise than by the owners,

or transfer the property in the structure of the bridge

to a highway authority, or, in the case of a swing

bridge, direct the bridge to be operated otherwise than

by the owners.

and crossing any railway, lock, passage or other work of the dock authority, nothing in any order made under

this Act shall, without the consent of the owners of the bridge, require the bridge to be altered or reconstructed in such a manner as to necessitate any alteration

in the level, or reduction in the width, of that railway,

canal, lock, passage or work, or to reduce the headway

of the bridge as existing at the date of the order.

(3) An order made under this Act requiring the

reconstruction of a bridge crossing a canal, or of the

approaches to such a bridge, shall, unless the owner of the bridge agrees to the contrary, direct the structure

of the bridge and the road carried thereby and the

approaches thereto to be maintained by a highway

authority.

(4) Nothing in this Act or in any order made thereunder shall be construed as authorising the stoppage of

traffic on any canal without the consent of the owner

thereof, and any highway authority carrying out any

works authorised by this Act, or by any order made

thereunder, with respect to a bridge crossing a canal

shall take such steps as may be necessary to prevent, so

far as practicable, any interference with traffic on that

canal:

Provided that the consent of the owner of a canal

to the temporary stoppage of traffic thereon shall not be

unreasonably withheld, and any question whether such

consent has been unreasonably withheld shall be determined by the Minister.

5. Where an order made under this Act provides for

the transfer to or vesting in a highway authority of the

property in a bridge or the road carried thereby or the

approaches thereto, or the responsibility for the maintenance of, or any rights and obligations attaching to,

such bridge, road or approaches, any statutory provisions

in force in relation thereto for the protection or benefit

of any public utility undertaking, shall, except so far as

may be otherwise expressly provided by the order after

agreement between the parties concerned, remain in

force notwithstanding such transfer and vesting, and in

relation to any property, responsibilities, rights or

obligations so transfeiTed as aforesaid, those statutory

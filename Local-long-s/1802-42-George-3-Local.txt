The Second Dislrid or Division, and certain Commissioners were thereby appointed to carry the said Act into Execution within each respective District, who were empowered to assess, rate, tax, and charge the several Owners and Occupiers of certain of the,said Fen Lands and Low Grounds held in Severalty, or being private Property within the said Second District (except such as in the said Act are excepted), by and with equal and proportionable yearly Rates, Taxes, or Sums of Money, for the Purposes of the said Act; and were authorized to borrow Money upon the Credit and Security of such Rates and Taxes; and in the said Act were contained sundry other Powers and Provisions for effecting the Purposes of the said Act: And whereas the Commissioners of the said Second District, in pursuance of the Powers given to them by the said recited Act, have made several Cuts, Drains, and Outlets, and made several Banks, and done other Works, in, through, and upon the said Lands and Grounds comprized within the said Second District, for the draining and preserving of the fame; and have act'efled the said Lands and Grounds with the several Rates and Taxes authorized by the said recited Act

, And whereas for the Purpose of making and preserving the said Works of Drainage, the said Commissioners have borrowed several Sums of Money upon the Security of the Rates and Taxes chargeable upon the said Lands and Grounds by virtue of the said Act, and have assigned over the said Rates and Taxes for securing the Monies so borrowed, with the Interest thereof, and a considerable Debt now remains due upon the Al-flgnment of the said Rates and Taxes, and otherwise, on Account of the said Lands and Grounds: And whereas the said Lands and Grounds comprized within the Limits of the said Second District, as mentioned in the said recited Act, might be further greatly improved by additional Works of Drainage; but the Rates and Taxes authorized to be raised by the said Act have been found insufficient for Payment of the Interest of the Monies already borrowed, and for maintaining and keeping in Repair the present Works; and the Powers given to the said Commissioners are also found to be insufficient for, the effectual Drainage and Preservation of the said Lands and Grounds; and the Mode of appointing the said Commissioners is found to be inconvenient; and it is therefore necessary to repeal certain Parts of the said A* t, and to make several Alterations and Amendments in other Parts thereof, so far as the fame relates to the said Second District: May it therefore pleaft* Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by 'the Authority of the same, That so much of the said recited Act as appoints Commissioners for the Purpose of carrying the fame into Execu-

be effected, by the Means of a Sinking Fund, to be formed with such extra Tonnage, and with the Portions of Tonnage after mentioned, for the Purpose of discharging the Costs and Expences to be incurred in finishing, making, and maintaining such Works; ai d as certain Parts of the said Scmerfetshire Coal Canal will be made and formed out of the Forty five thousand Pounds herein-after authorized to be raised, the said Scmerfetshire Coal Canal Company have agreed, in Augmentation of such extra Tonnage, to contribute such a Proportion of the Tonnage to be received by them for Good* navigated on the said Canal as herein-after mentioned; and as the Companies of Proprietors of the Kennet and Avon and JVilts and Berks Canal Navigations are interested in having the said Lines of Canal finished by Water Communications, and in putting an End to such extra Tonnage inrefptft to Locks as hrrein-,after mentioned, it is also thought reasonable and proper that such individual Proprietors of the last mentioned respective Companies as may think fit, shall be permitted to subscribe such Proportions of the Money necessary to be raifedfor the said Purposes as herein-aftermentioned; and that in the Event of their so doing, the said Somersetshire Coal Canal Company shall be required, in Manner sfrer-mentioned, to raise such a Proportion thereof as is also afeer-mentioned; and Deputations shall be appointed to conduit such Works, and to receive from the said Companies’ Treasurer, in Manner hertin-af-ter mentioned, the Subscriptions for erecting the fame, and the Tonnage to arise therefrom, and to apply-such Tonnage, with the Proportion agreed to be contributed by the Scitierfetshire Coal Canal Company of their other Tonnage as aforesaid, for the several Purposes herein-after mentioned, with a View ultimately to put an End to such extra Tonnage by Means of the Sinking Fund herein-after directed to be formed: And whereas there is a further Sum of Money wanting and necessary, more than the Proprietors are able to borrow or raise under the said Aits, to liquidate and dilcli3rge the Debts of the said Company, and to finish and complete the said Canal and Works on the Upper Level of the Radjlock Line thereof to the said Field called Ranfcomb: And whereas, in order to facilitate the finishing and completing the said Canal and Works on the Radjlock Line thereof, from the Place before mentioned to the Lower Level, and forming such Water Communications on both Lines of the said Canal, and railing Money to enable the said Company so to do, in the Manner most beneficial to themselves and the Publick, and to enable the said Company to collect and receive the additional Kates or Tonnage, and form such Sinking Fund for the Purpose aforesaid, it is necessary the said Company should have further Powers granted to them; and the Powers and Provisions of the said Acts having in many Respects been found insufficient, it is requisite that the fame should be extended, altered, and amended: May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted , and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That, from and immediately after the passing of this Act, the said Company of Proprietors of the SomerJ'et/hire Coal Canal Navigation, and their Successors, shall and may have Power and Authority, and they are hereby authorized and empowered, by themselves, their Deputies, Agents, Officers, Workmen, and Servants, to vary and alter the said Canal on the Dunkcrton Line thereof, from or near to a certain Bridge over the said

An Act for opening several new Streets in the Town of Kilmarnock and County of Ayr; for altering and widening some of the Streets, Lancs, and Passages within the said Town; for building Two new Bridges over the Water of Kilmarnock \ for removing the present Slaughter-houses in the said Town, and building new ones, and a Town-hall, and Guard house; for enlarging and repairing the Gaol or Tolbooth; for enlarging the Burial Ground of the said Town; for paving the said Town and Places adjoining thereto, and removing Nuisances and Annoyances therein; and for extending the Jurisdiction of the Magistrates of the said Town over certain adjacent Lands. [7th May 1802.J

WHEREAS the Town of Kilmarnock is the larged Town in the County of Ayr, and is a great Thoroughfare to T ravellers of every

Description, yet the Approach and Access to the Town from almost every Quarter is extremely dangerous and inconvenient, and many of the Streets are very narrow and incommodious, and from, the Increase of Population the Demand for Houses and other Buildings render it expedient to open certain new Streets and PafiT.tges in the said Town: [Lee. & f><r.~| Si?

Town-hall, and Guard-house were built, and the Gaol properly repaired: And whereas from the Increase of Inhabitants in the Town and Neighbourhood thereof, the Burying Ground is too small, and that it would be an Advantage to the Police if the Jurisdiction of the Magistrates of Kilmarnock was to be extended over the Street called Netbertown Holm, or Glencairn Street, and to the Buildings which have been erected on the Lands of Grange, and to such of the intended new Streets as are beyond their present Jurisdiction; all which will be attended with great Utility and Advantage to the Publick in general, and to the Inhabitants and Proprietors of Houses and Ground in the said Town of Kilmarnock and Neighbourhood thereof in particular, but which cannot be done without the Aid and Authority of Parliament: May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Truflcti.

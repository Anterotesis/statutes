An Act for altering and amending an Act of His present Majesty for building a Bridge over the River Thames at Henley-upon-Thames, in the County of Oxford.

[18th fune 1808.]

WHEREA5 an Act was passed in the Twenty-first Year of the A a 21 Geo. Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, An Act for building IU« ch. 33, a Bridge over the River Thames at the Town of Henley-upon-Thames, in the County of Oxford, and making commodious Avenues thereto, for widening feme Part of the High-Street, and the Market Placet for lighting and watching, for regulating the Footways in, and for removing Nutfances, obstructions, and Annoyances from the said Town:. And whereas by virtue of the said recited Act a fqbftantial Stone Bridge over the River Thames - was built ax Henley-upon-Thames, and called Henley Bridge, and compleated several Years ago, and certain Avenues made thereto, and the said Bridge hath always since the building thereof been kept, and now is in good Repair: And whereas the building of the said Bridge hath been attended with great Conveniences Hot only to the said Town and Neighbourhood, but also to ail Persons travelling the great Turnpike Road which leads to and from London through the said Town, and which is and for several Years past hath been a grear Thoroughfare to the North-west Parts of England and South Wales: And whereas the Commissioners appointed in or authorized by Money b- the recited Act have borrowed several considerable Sums of Money for rmYed‘ the Purposes therein mentioned: And whereas Parcs of certain public Road9 ,ead-Streecs in the said Town of Henley, called Bell Street, Hart Street, and to the ILoc.V Per.-] 240 Duke ing KPa"

Duke Street, being the principal Roads leading to the said Bridge, are extremely narrow and out of Repair, and at Times so much so as to render it difficult for Carriages to pass with Safety, and particularly in dark Nights, as those Streets are not lighted, and the Materials to be procured in the Neighbourhood are not sufficient in Substance to refill the Pressure of the great Number of Carriages that travel the said Road, some of which are very heavily laden: And whereas it would tend not only to the Accommodation and Convenience of Travellers if the said Screets were pitched or otherwise substantially amended, improved, and lighted, and some of the Corners of the said Streets rounded, but would be the Means of increasing the said Tolls by encouraging Travellers to pass through Henley on their Way to and from London: And whereas the Commissioners of the said Bridge have paid off a considerable Part of the Money borrowed for building the fame, and the Surplus of the Money arising from the Toils after Payment of Interest Money for the borrowed Sums remaining due and keeping the said Bridge in Repair, and other incidental Expences, amounts to the Sum of Four hundred Pounds or thereabouts, and which Surplus by being laid out annually as saved it is presumed would be sufficient to complete the Improvements of the said Streets, without borrowing any further Sum on the Credit of the said Tolls: But as the Commissioners conceive that such Improvement, Matters, and Things cannot be done and effected without the Aid and Authority of Parliament: May it therefore please your Majesty, That it may be enacted j and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Confenc of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the Commissioners named and authorized in, and appointed or to be appointed under or by virtue of the said recited Act, to apply all or any Part of the said Surplus of the said Tolls, or of the Balance now remaining in the Hand, of their Treasurer, and by borrowing any Sum of Money not exceeding the Sum of One thousand Five hundred Pounds on the Credit of the Tolls as after mentioned, in or towards pitching or otherwise substantially amending and improving the Carriage Roads and Ways in the said Streets called Bell Street, Hart Street, and Duke Street, in Henley-upon-Thomes aforesaid, leading to the said Bridge, called Henley Bridge, with such Materials and in such Manner as the said Commissioners shall think proper, and in rounding and widening the Corner of the said Street called Bell Street, at the South East Corner thereof next to Hart Street, and the Corner of the said Street called Duke Street at the North East Corner thereof next to Hart Street aforesaid, and in or towards providing and fixing up such Number of LampPofts with Lamp Irons, Lamps, and other Materials in such Places in or near the said Streets respectively, or upon or near the said Bridge, and for lighting such Lamps in such Manner as the said Commissioners shall direct, for the Purpose of rendering the said Streets leading to the said Bridge more safe, commodious, and convenient for Travellers.

An Act for regulating the Proceedings in the Courts Baron of the Manors of Sheffield and Ecclesall, in the County of York. [18th °June 1 808.]

WHEREAS within the Jurisdiction of the respective Manors of Sheffield and Ecclesall in the County of JTork, there are several Very considerable Manufactories which employ great Numbers of People who contract many small Debts which they often refute to pay; and although an Act was pafed in the Twenty.ninth Year of the Reign of Ills late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, An Act for regulating 29 G ». the Pr ceedings in Personal Actions in the Courts Baron of the Manors of Sheffield and Ecclesail in the County of York, yet it is found that as the Powers of the Paid Act extend only to recover Debts contracted within the respective ] urifdiGions of the Paid Courts, Persons contracting L ebts within the Jurisdiction of one of the Paid Courts, do often, to avoid Suit remove into the adjacent Jurisdiction, whereby i he Plaintiffs in such Suits are frequently delayed in recovering their just Debts, and it is found that the Proceedings in the said respective Courts, to bring a Cause to Trial or Inquiry are very prolix, and the Fees allowed by the said Act to the Solicitors profecuiing or defending Suits therein, are greatly in dispropoi tion to the Sums in dil'pute, and the said Act is found in many other Refpeits inadequate for the speedy Recovery of Debts within the Limits of the said Courts:

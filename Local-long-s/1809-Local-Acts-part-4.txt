and others, are Defendants; and in the Second of which the said Ann Farrer is plaintiff, and Richard Orlebar and others are Defendants; and in the Third of which tnc Reverend James Morgan Dost ir in Divinity, and others, are Plaintiffs, and John Page and oihtrs, are Defendants; it was declared, that the said Will of the said Testator William Famr was well proved, and that the fame ought to be established, and the Trulls thereof performed and carried into Execution; and his Lordship did order and decree the fame accordingly, and that it should be referred to Mailer Ord one of the Mailers of the said Court, to take an Account of thr Personal Estate of the said Testator not specifically bequeathed, and of his Debts, Funeral Expences and Legacies; and the said Mailer was to inquire what Mortgages or other Incumbrances affected the said Testator’s Ell tes, or any, and what Parts or Part thereof: And whereas the said Master, by his Report, dated the Twenty-eighth Day of March One thousand tight hundred and seven, made in pursuance of the said Decree, and of a Decree made in a Supplemental Cause, in which the said Farrer Grove Spurgeon Farrer was Plaintiff, and John Harrison and others Defendants, on the Twenty-fourth Day of June One thousand eight hundied and two, certified, that he had taken the Accounts direct.d by the said D crecs, and Hated the several Particulars of which the Pe fonal Estate of the said Tellator did then confilt, and the said Mailer alto Hated the several Debts and Legacies of the said Tellator then remaining unsatisfied, exclusive of the said several Sums of Two thousand six hundred and fifey Pounds, Two thousand five hundred Pounds, and Two thousand five hundred Pounds, in the said Will, and herein-after mentioned; and the said Master found, that by virtue of the several Deeds and Will, in his lard Report mentioned, there was due to the said Ann Farrer, the Sifter of the said Testator, the said Sum of Two thousand six hundred and fifty Pounds; and to the said Jams Morgan, as surviving Trullee, in the Settlement made on the Marriage of the said John Morgan and Amelia his Wile, the aforesaid Sum of Two thousand five hundred Pounds; and to George Alorgan Esquire, as surviving Trullee in the Settlement made on the Marriage of the said John Grove Spurgeon, and Ann his Wife, the like Sum of Two thousand five hundred Pounds: And whereas, by the Order made on the said causes coming on to be heard, on the Twenty-ninth Day of June One thousand eight hundred and (even, on further Directions on the said Mailer’s Report, it was ordered, that the said Miller should inquire and Hate to the Court, whether the Deficiency of the said Testator’s Personal Estate, to pay his Debts and Legacies, and the Colls of the said Suits, and also the said Sums of Two thousand six hundred and fifty Pounds, Two thousand five hundred Pounds, and Two thousand five hundred Pounds, could be raised in the Manner directed by the said Will of the said Teltator William Farrer: And whereas the said Master, by his Report, made in pursuance of the said last-mentioned Order, and dated the Eleventh Day of March One-thousand eight hundred and nine, certified, that it had been alledged before him, on Behalf of the said Farrer Grove Spurgeon Farrer, that he had made various Applications, and uled every Diligence by himself and his Agents, to raile the said Deficiency by Mortgage of the several Estates respectively charged therewith, but had been unable to procure the fame by Way of Mortgage, and hefubmi.ted to the said Master, that it would be greatly detrimental to the Property of the Testator and the several Persons now interested therein, if the several Sums to be raised out of his Estates should be raised by Sale for Terms of

Years

3404

49° GEORGII III. Cap. 166.

Years only, as by the said Will directed; and that on the contrary, it would be very beneficial to the several Persons interested as aforesaid, if the said several Sums were to be raised by a Sale of the Fee Simple of a sufficient Part of the detached and unconnected Parts of the said Testator's Estates; and that it would be for the Benefit of the several Parties inte-relted in the said Estates, if a Private Act of Parliament was obtained for velting the Fee Simple of the Estates, mentioned in the Schedule to the said Matter's Report, in Trustees for Sale, under the Directions of the Court of Chancery, as the said Estates would fell to much greater Advantage than if fold for Terms of Years only; upon Consideration of which several Matters, the said Matter certified, that he was of Opinion, that notwithstanding the Deficiency of the said Testator’s Personal Estate to pay his Debts and Legacies, and the Colts of the said Suit«, and also the said Sums of Two thousand six hundred and fifty Pounds, Twothou-sand five hundred Pounds, and Two thousand Five hundred Pounds, could pofiibly be raised in the Manner directed by the Will of the said Ttftator, no Evidence having been produced to him to prove the contrary thereof; yet that nevertheless such Procedure would be very inconvenient and injurious to the Parties interested, ro whom it would be much more beneficial if the said Deficiency were to be raised by Sale of the Fee Simple of a sufficient Part of the detached Estates of the said Testator: And whereas, by another Order, made in the said causes, on the Fifteenth Day of March One thousand eight hundred and nine, upon the Petition of the said Farrer Grove Spurgeon Farrer, and the said John Grove Spurgeon, and Ann his Wife, the said last-mentioned Report is confirmed; and it was ordered, that the said Petitioners should be at Liberty to apply for an Act of Parliament, for veiling the Fee Simple of the detached and unconnected Parts of the Estates of the said William Farrer deceased, mentioned in the Schedule to the said Matter’s Report, in Trustees for Sale, under the Direction of the Court of Chancery, for the Purpose of raising and paying so much, and such Parts of the Debts, Legacies, and Incumbrances aftefting the Estates of the said Testator as his Personal Estate was

not sufficient to pay: And whereas it appears by the said Matter’s said

Reports, that the Sums of Money, which the said Tcftator’s Ettate was not sufficient to pay, consist of the several Particulars let forth in the First Schedule to this Act: Wherefore Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the said Farrer Grove Spurgeon Farrer, the said John Grove Spurgeon, and Ann his Wife, and the said John Higgins, and Martha his Wife, do most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Content of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this prefenc Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, Eitatei com- That all and singular the Messuagts, Farms, Lands, Tenements, and

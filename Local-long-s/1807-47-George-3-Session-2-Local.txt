Grounds, and to lay an additional Tax on the said Lands and Grounds,

in order to raise Money to answer the said Purposes; May it therefore please Your Majrlly, That it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Par-Pmvtrs of liament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said recited

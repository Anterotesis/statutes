are expressed, willing and desiring thereby, that the said trustees, or any seven or more of them, should make their humble application to His Majesty, or to Parliament, at the next session after his decease as should be thought most proper, in order to pay the full and clear sum of twenty thousand pounds, of lawful money of Great Britain, unto his executors, or the survivors of them, within twelve months after his decease, in consideration of the said Collection or Museum; and also to obtain such sufficient and

by either of the said foreign Academies, his executors, or the survivors of them, should, be at liberty with all convenient speed to sell and dispose of all and every part of his said Museum or Collection, in the most speedy and advantageous manner; and that the monies arising by such sale or disposition should be considered as part of his personal estate; and further his will was, and he did thereby direct, that in case his said Collection should be sold or disposed of to either of the said foreign Academies, or in case of their refusal, or non-acceptance by his executors, or the survivors of them, that then his said Manor house and garden, with the appurtenances and the water, should go and belong to such person or persons, and in such manner, as he had given and devised the rest of his manors, lands, and tenements, at Chelsea or elsewhere, as by the said Codicil, relation being thereunto had, may more fully and at large appear : and whereas the said Sir Hans Seoane having, by several other Codicils of a subsequent date, annexed to his said Will, added to the number of the said trustees, did, on or about the eleventh day of January one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three, depart this life: and whereas the said trustees, or seven or more of them, have, pursuant to the will, and intention of the said Sir Hans Sloane, in this session of Parliament, being the next session after his decease, made their application for payment of the said sum of

26 GEORGII II. 5

twenty thousand pounds, in consideration of the' said Collection or Museum: and whereas the said trustees, at a general meeting assembled, have consented to the removal of the said Museum or Collection from the manor house at Chelsea, to any proper place within the cities of London or Westminster, or the suburbs thereof, if such removal shall be judged most advantageous to the public, so as the said collection be preserved entire without the least diminution or separation, and be kept for the use and benefit of the public, with free access to view and peruse the same, at all stated and convenient seasons agreeable to the will and intentions of the testator, and under such restrictions as the Parliament shall think fit: and whereas the said Museum or Collection of Sir Hans Sloane is of much greater intrinsic value than the sum of twenty thousand pounds: and whereas all arts and sciences have a connexion with each other, and discoveries in natural philosophy, and other branches of speculative knowledge, for the advancement and improvement whereof the said Museum or Collection was intended, do and may, in many instances, give help and success to the most useful experiments and inventions; therefore to the end that the said Museum or Collection may be preserved and maintained, not only for the inspection and entertainment of the learned and the curious, but for the general use and benefit of the public; may it please Your most excellent

And whereas by an Act, made in the twelfth and thirteenth years of the reign of King William the Third, intituled, "An Act for the better " settling and preserving the Library kept in the " House at Westminster, called Cotton House, " in the Name and Family of the Cottons, for the " benefit of the Public," reciting. That Sir Robert Cotton, late of Connington, in the county of Huntingdon, baronet, did, at his own great charge, and by the assistance of the *po6t learned antiquaries of his time, collect and purchase the

most useful manuscripts, written books, papers, parchments, records, and other memorials, in most languages, of great use and service for the knowledge and preservation of our constitution both in Church and State; and further reciting. That the said library had been preserved with the utmost care by Sir Thomas Cotton, son of the said Sir Robert, and by Sir John Cotton, then liv* ing, grandson of the said Sir Robert; and had been very much augmented by them, and lodged in a very proper place in the said Sir John’s an-cient mansion house at Westminster, for public use and advantage j it was enacted. That the said mansion house, with the garden, and all other appurtenances, and also the said Library, should be vested in trustees in the said Act named, and their successors, for ever, for the purposes therein mentioned; and as for and concerning the said Library, and the room wherein the same was or should be contained, together with a convenient passage for resorting therer unto, upon this trust and confidence, that the said trustees, and their successors, should, from time to time, and at all times thereafter, as occasion should require, inspect, consult, and take care of the said Library, and other particulars abovementioned,and also make and appoint such order? and rules as they should think proper, for the reading and using the same, and % their better preservation, and to the intent and purpose that the said trustees, or the majpr part of

for want of due care, and that it ihight be in Her Majesty’s power to make that most valuable collection useful to her own subjects, and all learned foreigners, had given directions for treating with the said Sir John Cotton, for the pur* chase of the said Cotton House and garden; and that an agreement had been made for the purchasing the inheritance thereof for the sum of four thousand and five hundred pounds, which Her Majesty had directed to be paid on the investing the inheritance of the premises in Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, which could not be done but by Act of Parliament, the said recited Act having directed it might not be sold or aliened j it was therefore enacted. That the said capital messuage called Cotton House, and the garden and buildings used and .enjoyed with the same, with the appurtenances, should be. vested in Her Majesty, her heirs and successors: and it was thereby further enacted and declared, That a convenient room should be built in or near part of the said ground thereby intended to be vested in Her Majesty, as Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, should, by writing, under the sign manual, appoint; in which room when built, all the said manuscripts, written books, papers, parchments, records, and other memorials, as also all coins, medals, and other rarities and curiosities in the said library contained, should be lodged and there remain to all posterity; and that the said room when built,

not before disposed of by that his will and testament, should, after the decease of Mistress Elizabeth Milles, amount to so much) to erect in a proper situation such a house as might be most likely to preserve that library, as much as can be, from all accidents; but if it should so happen, that before this part of his will could take place, there should be erected such a proper building for this use, then he did give, devise, and bequeath, the aforesaid sum of seven thousand pounds to the said trustees, to be employed in purchasing such manuscripts, books of antiquities, ancient coins, medals, and other curiosities, as might be worthy to increase and enlarge the said library; and did also thereby give to the said trustees of the said library, to be placed in some by-room or corner thereof, all his books, and the cases in which they were then placed, and also his pictures in his said last will and testament described; which books, book cases, and pictures, he did desire and require might be delivered and given, as soon after his decease as might be, to be placed in the said libraryj and which, with the approbation of the said trustees, have been placed according to such desire in the said library; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when and as soon as the said legacy of seven thousand pounds shall on the decease of the said Elizabeth Milles become payable to the trustees of the Cottonian Library, the same shall be paid to the Trustees by this Act appointed.

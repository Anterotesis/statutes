[Assignees to be appointed and engagements entered into for payment of debts not satisfied.]

and such Court shall appoint a proper person or proper persons to be assignee or assignees of the estate and effects of such prisoner, for the purposes of this act, and shall order proper conveyances and assignments of such estate and effects to be made by such prisoner according to this act, together with an engagement to be executed by such prisoner to pay so much of the just debts and demands of the several persons against whom such prisoner shall by such Court ba adjudged entitled to the benefit of this act, as shall not be paid out of the estate and effects to be conveyed and assigned by such prisoner for such purpose, in case he or she shall at any time thereafter be enabled to pay such debts and demands, or to pay such part or parts thereof as he or she shall be able at any time to pay;

[Copyhold or customary estate to be surrendered to assignees.]

XI. Provided always, and be it further Enacted, that in case any prisoner who shall be discharged by virtue of this act shall be entitled to any copyhold or customary estate, the same shall be surrendered or conveyed by such prisoner according to the custom of the manor of which such estate shall be holden, either to the assignee or assignees of the estate and effects of such prisoner, or to any purchaser or purchasers of any such copyhold or customary estate from such assignee or assignees, as the said Court shall direct, and the rents and profits thereof shall be in the mean time received by such assignee or assignees for the benefit of the creditors of such prisoner, without prejudice nevertheless to the lord or lords of the manor of which any such copyhold or customary estate shall be holden.

[Sale of annuities or contingent interests may be restrained by the Court.]

XII. And whereas prisoners discharged by virtue of this act may be entitled to annuities for their own lives, or other uncertain interests, or to reversionary or contingent interests, or to property under such circumstances, that the immediate sale thereof for payment of their debts may be very prejudicial to them, and deprive them of the means of subsistence which they might otherwise have after payment of their debts; and it may be proper in some cases to authorize the raising of money by way of mortgage for payment of the debts, or part of the debts of a prisoner discharged by virtue of this act, and defraying expenses attending the execution of this act, instead of selling the property of such prisoner for such purposes; be it enacted, that in all such cases, it shall be lawful for the said Court to take into consideration all circumstances affecting the property of any prisoner who shall be discharged by virtue of this act, either at the time of the discharge of such prisoner, or at any subsequent time; and if it shall appear to the said Court, that it would be reasonable to make any special order touching the same, it shall be lawful for the said Court so to do, and to direct that such property as it may be expedient not to sell, or not to sell immediately, according to the provisions of this act, shall not be so sold, and from time to time to order and direct in what manner such property shall be managed for the benefit of the creditors of such prisoner, until the same can be properly sold, or until payment of all such creditors according to the provisions of this act, and to make such order touching the sale or disposition of such property as to the said Court shall seem reasonable, considering the rights of the creditors of such prisoner to payment of their demands, and the future benefit of such prisoner after payment of his or her debts, and upon such terms and conditions with respect to the allowance of Interest on debts not bearing interest, or other circumstances, as to the said Court shall seem just; and if it shall appear to the said Court that the debts of such prisoner can be discharged by means of money raised by way of mortgage on any property of such prisoner, instead of raising the same by sale, it shall be lawful for the said Court so to order, and to give all necessary directions for such purpose, end generally to direct all things which may be proper for the discharge of the debts of such prisoner in such manner as may be most consistent with the interests of such prisoner, in any surplus of his or her effects after payment of such debts.

[Court may on complaint of creditor, within one year, avoid the discharge of prisoner, on being satisfied that he obtained his discharge fraudulently.]

XIII. Provided always, and be it further enacted, that in ease any creditor against whom any prisoner shall have obtained his or her discharge by virtue of this act, shall within one year after the .date of the order for such discharge apply to the said Court to avoid such discharge as improperly obtained, and upon such application it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Court that such prisoner has acted in any manner fraudulently in obtaining such discharge, or has wilfully concealed any of his or her estate or effects by not specifying or not properly specifying the same in such schedule as aforesaid, for the purpose of depriving the creditors against whom he shall have obtained such discharge of the benefit thereof, it shall be lawful for such Court to declare the discharge so obtained by such prisoner null and avoid; and it shall thereupon be lawful for any creditor or creditors of such prisoner against whom such discharge shall have been obtained, to proceed against such prisoner as if such discharge had not been obtained, such creditor or creditors relinquishing all benefit of the assignment of the estate or effects of such prisoner which shall remain unapplied by the assignee or assignees appointed under this act; and any of such creditors who shall have detained such prisoner in custody at the time of such discharge shall be at liberty to apply to such Court to remand such prisoner again into custody on the same process from which he or she had been so discharged; and such Court shall have power to remand such prisoner accordingly, by warrant under the hand and seal of the commissioner of the stud Court, which warrant shall be executed by an officer of the said Court to be appointed for such purpose, and shall be sufficient authority for the arrest and detention of such prisoner upon the process from which such prisoner was before discharged; and so much (if any) of the estate or effects of such prisoner as shall then remain in the hands of the assignee or assignees thereof, after paying all the just charges and expenses of such assignee or assignees to be allowed by the said Court, shall be re-conveyed or re-assigned or paid to such prisoner, as the said Court shall direct; but so much of such estates and effects as shall have been before applied in payment of the debts of such prisoner, shall be retained by the creditors who shall have received the same in part of their respective demands, excepting only the creditor or creditors who shall apply to the Court to avoid such discharge, who shall repay the dividend or dividends received by him, her, or them respectively, to the assignee or assignees of the estate and effects of such prisoner, before such order, declaring such discharge null and void, shall be delivered out by the said Court.

[When it shall appear to the Court after prisoner shall have obtained discharge that he is able to pay his debts, the Court shall revoke such discharge.]

XIV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in case any prisoner who shall have been discharged by virtue of this act, shall become able to pay all or any part of the debts due from him or her, and against which he or she shall have obtained such discharge, after a reasonable allowance for the maintenance of such debtor, and his or her family, and payment of his or her debts, contracted after such discharge, or to which such discharge did not extend, it shall and may be lawful for any creditor or creditors against whom he or she shall have obtained such discharge, to apply to the Court for liberty to proceed against such debtor, notwithstanding such discharge; and in case it shall appear to die satisfaction of such Court, that such debtor is of ability to pay such demand, or any part thereof, it shall be lawful for such Court to revoke such discharge either wholly or upon payment of such sum or sums of money for the benefit of the persons against whom such discharge shall have been obtained, either in gross, or by several payments, as to such Court shall appear reasonable, or to permit execution to be taken out on the judgment entered up in such Court upon the engagement of such prisoner, for such sum of money as the said Court shall think fit, to be distributed rateably amongst the creditors entitled under such engagement, and such proceedings shall and may be had according to the discretion of the said Court from time to time, until the whole of the debts due to the several persons against whom such discharge shall have been obtained, shall be fully paid and satisfied, together with such costs as such Court shall think fit to award: Provided always, that in case any such application shall appear to the Court to be ill founded and vexatious, it shall be lawful for the Court not only to refuse to make any order on such application, but also to dismiss the same, with such Costs as to the Court shall appear reasonable.

[Allowance to be made for a discovery of the prisoner's estate six months after the appointment of assignees.]

XV. And be it further enacted, that all and every person who shall, at any time after the expiration of six calendar months from the date of the appointment of any assignee or assignees of the estate and effects of any prisoner under the authority of this act, voluntarily come and make discovery of any part of such prisoner’s estate not specified in the said schedule and not before come to the knowledge of the assignee or assignees of such prisoner’s estate, either to the said assignee or assignees or the commissioner of the said Court, shall be allowed five pounds per centum, and such further and other reward as the said assignee or assignees, or the major part in value of the creditors of such prisoner present at any meeting of the said creditors, shall think fit, to be paid out of the net proceeds of such prisoner’s estate which shall be recovered on such discovery, which shall be paid to the person or persons so discovering the same by the said assignee or assignees who shall be allowed the same in his, her, or their accounts.

[Disclosure of the estate of the prisoner six months after discharge.]

XVI.

I have none of my witnesses here, which would be of service to me; my partner, if she was here, could tell your Lordship the fame. I. went up to iiillingfgafc in the morning; I have a great many children;

I work hard for them; I went up for some mackare!; I came down this East-lane, a-I fruited son.e money there; I went down to Iliilingfgute in the afternoon; I could not get any mackare!; I thought I would go and receive this money as my husband earns but little; it was next door to the house they burnt down that I had trusted some money in the morning, because the lady wanted change; I went and got my money. As I came up again these people were all about Capt. French's house; I don't know the name of the lady I trusted; they are gentlemens' houses there, and when their own settled fishwomcn come, they lay out their money with them. I saw the people there when they began to break the frames of the window; I said, “dear, what a fad thing*' it is to break a gentleman's house that i» so good to the poor !” for Capt. French is a very worthy ^'ntlemin, 1 would go ten miles to save hia house, rather than dcilroy it; oneof them said, “you papist bitch,you

arc

are as bad as they the n they took my hand-

kerchief away, cut n;y apron-wrings, ami tumbled rue into the house, where I was Itcpcy I b..ircve, for an hour; I was over my Ihots in something, what it was I cannot *e!l; I laid, “ for Christ's fake, give me my hat, that I may go home to my children;

I-was stabbed in two places in my hands, and went home all of a gore of blood; I never got my hat uv-in. As I came down the PuirSof the door, one of Capt. French's men said, “what do you do here ?” he hid me wi'.fh my felt in this; whether it was in a pot or what, f do not know; Out I washed the tolocd oft', and as I came through the alley something. fell down unon my head that knocked me down. Mr. flilyeriaid, “wh.tt <lo you do here ?” they began to throw the feathers ' about; they took fotnc oh' the ground, then a calc of knives and forks came out; Mr. Hilycr kicked them into the fire; I said, <fcit is a fad thing to destroy those good things, and your houfr is fitter to be down than Capt. b i t itch's ;” I tumbled over f'mcth'ng, and then came home di»-redtly-, and \V ilkins and Bafernan were taken up the dav before me on account of things *t Capt. French being found upon them, and so to get themselves out of the hobble, they bring me here. They said, they were sorry fof v.hat they had said, and that they would not spea.k a word in court, unless they had the money down first. I had that intelligence brought me to the New Gaol.

MARNS's DEFENCE.

I'was employed that nrght, as a watchman, in IIaft Lane; when I went down the mob were in Captain French's house.

I. went into the back yard; I flood there a good while. I said to several people, who are in court, “ it is a pity to fee things going on ih this manner.”. I took hold of one of tiic boys that were ther e, indeed they were mostly boy % and took a wax candle out of his hand. I went backwards, I found a parcel of books lying the re; 1 put them into my apron, and carried them i:Uo the garden. I said, to one James Chrifinals, there is a parcel of books I have put into such a place in the garden,” fori durst not

I

carry them out for fear of the mob; after that I came forward into E.‘lft Lane again. 1 walked up and down the lane fc-verai times; they were breaking and dell loving all this time. I was afraid, as they saw mebufy taking thing- away, that they should do me a mi (chief; having a wife and five children, I was willing t6 keep as much out of ;t as I could. James Christmafs said to me, about one. in the morning, u I wish you would be fb kind as to ftav in the front of the honfe with me, and lee that nobody takes away what is litre, we hare people of our own in the batk yard.” I told him I would x;ot be out of the way at all. t ft aid there till morning; and, in the morn ing', I helped Mr. French's partner, and some more gentlemen there, to carry away the goods, which lay in the lane, into tnc yard; and then I went home about my business.

JOHN JEWELL

I am a victualler; I keep the Black-Horse in Maze-Pond. '

Wa-> you in Tooley-street on the Sth of June lait, when the mob were at Mr. Connolly's house r — I was there about three; wo were collecting some of the neighbours in a body, to go and oppose the mob. I v/ent down to Connolly's, that! might be able to form some idea of the numbers of the mob; i looked at them five or six minutes: I saw Ambrofc Lane on the upper part of the ruins which had been thrown from the house. The mob were before the door; the street was covered with feathers and with the materials belonging to the front of the house; Ambrose Lane was upon the upper part of the ruins, with a tdue ribband round his hat, and huzzaing among the mob.

What was he doing He seemed to' be encouraging some boys wrho were then in the front or the house, who appeared to be tearing down the front. " '

Dcicnbu again what he did or said ?--- He was in a very active situatioti; sometimes he would be {looping," then looking up to the- people; a coach was coming by at chat time; 1 saw as much as I wanted to fee; I was a good 'leal fluttered; 1 took the opportunity to pals with the coach. The ir.ub {topped thr coach, and said, D — n your tye», no popery. One of them handed a pail into the coach, with some beer in it; then 1 went away: they

gave toe a pickling jar. While the coach {topped, I turned lound and looked at him, fori knew Film perfect] y well, arid I did not \yifh lie should fee me; I thought that might not be so agreeable.

What had he in his hand ? — I think a bludgeon.

Lid you know him before ? — I did.

What numbers of the mob were then round Mr. Connolly's house t the greatest part of them did not seem' so very active: 1 told the neighbours when 1 came back, that I thought twenty people might have opposed them and kept them out of the street

And you say at that time the greatest: part of Mr. Connolly's house was destroyed I — Yes, it was.

And Lane wras upon the min? ? — - Yes j and particularly active.

What morning ? — Not expecting a thing of this kind to happen, I did not take notice of the day of the month j my business keeps me much at home.

But do you remember the mob ? — Yes; and that there was a great piece of work at several places. After Connolly's house was pulled down, they threatened to come to the corner of the bank whete we live; I saw Lane come down with fume mackarel upon a string, and to the best of my knowledge, he was there from that time till Mr. Connolly's house was destroyed.

You was not in Garns's house, was you ? — No; but 1 was opposite; I was so much terrified that I was at the door almost all the time in expectation they would come down our way, because they had threatened hard to come.

You don't know what day it was ? — No, not expecting to be called, i do not, but I am sure it was the fame day that Connolly's house was destroyed. Lane and another man were singing; a neighbour said to me, uAirs. Innot, 1 with Mrs. Garns would “ make them cease that noise, for if the 41 mob should come they would impute her “ house to be served like the rest.” I went over to Mrs, Garns's; they ceased the noise;

[ i3 ]

1 heard Lane lay, “Mrs. G<rn«, what “ have you got for dinner ?” fhc fuid “ nothing, what wiil you have;” he said, 5‘ veal.” I law her go out and bring the veal; fhc had a iump of butter upon it, it rather vexed me, as I fold butter, that she did not buy it of me; they font the veal to be baked. I was in the hnule when it came home, and they aikcd me to eat some of it.

You was in your own house the rest of the time ? — I was at my own door, or in my ihop, which directly faced their windows; as 1 expected the mob to come down every minute, I did very little that day but watched the place.

Did you fee them go away from Mrs. Garns's house ? — Yes, I did fee them go away in the afternoon; it might be between three and four o'clock, or rather turned of four, Lane and that tailor, but their stay was very short; they carjie back again together.

How long might they remain in Mrs. Garns's house ? — They might remain there an hour or two; I heard no disturbance. afterwards, except, that one of the head of the mob, I think his name is Smith, /that pulled down the Bell, the corner house; I saw him come to Mrs. Garns's house, I was afraid he was coming to destroy the house; I went in to Mrs. Garns's, I saw Lane there then, that might be about six or seven o'clock; that man Brazell, laid, “ Ambrofc, come a-Jong with us, w*e are going to have some more fun;” Lane replied, “ no, I am black-guard enough, you shall not catch me among the rioters.”

Court. Repeat that again?! — I went into the house, suspecting the mob were coming to destroy Mrs. Garns's house, for they had threatened it; these men were there, Brazell laid, “ Ambrofc, will you go with us ? we have more fun in hand,” or something to that purport; “ no, (said he) I am black-guard enough, but you shan't catch me in none of the riotings.” MARTHA WILSON sworn.

I was at Mrs. Ini.ot's house all the day that Mr. Connolly's house. was pulled

down; I saw Lane Tinging the re all the day.

Where do you live? — Just by.

You was not in Mrs. Garris's house yourself? — No, but I was opposite the window.

What time did they go away ? — About six in the evening; Brazell came to him, and said, “ come, Ambrose, we have got some fine fun, come along ;” Lane said, “ he was black-guard enough but he would “ not be in no riot.”

ELIZABETH ARMSTRONG sworn.

I saw this man at Mrs. Garns's house, the while Connolly's hove was pulling down and the mob were burning of the ruins; I live opposite Mrs. Garns's house.

Did you fee Lane when he went towards Connolly's house ? — I did not indeed

THOMAS DUNN

What arc you ? — An undertaker.

Do you know the house of Margaret Cooper? — Very well, it is in the parish of St. George's, in Kent-street, on the left hand side of the way; I live withm six or eight doors, of Mrs Cooper; 1 was called up at about seven in the morning; when I went out I saw the itiob attacking Mrs. Cooper's house; they wore, along while pulling the house about before I went nigh it; they made a bonfire of the things;

I went up to the place and threw water upon the front of that house, and the two houses adjoining; at the same time pavis was at work in the front part of the house, pulling up the boards in the window it is a kind of a bow window: there arc about two boards I imagine, in the front of the window; he was pulling those boards

«P- .; "

While he was do ng that, what were the

mob about? — Throwing the goods out and the partition and wainfeorinr, and burning the m.

Did you know Davis before ? — No, after they had done there they went up to the King's arms, and assembled before ;the house, in order to pull it down: they had been three times there the aighcJit-focg,*,. but the neighbours had got them away from the place; he afterwards came to my mother's; he had a link in his hand at both places, he struck at me with it: he then went to a house, No. 2, in Stone Cutter's-yard, opposite the Kings-arms: fheexpof-tulated with him, and told him he w^s mistaken, they had got to the wrong house; he, Davis went into the house; he said,

all is wellon Saturday I saw- him going through Blackman's street, towards St. George's fields; I laid hold of him, and brought him as far as the Church, and had him secured.

When you saw him 20 towards the church was he alone -No, several persons were with him.

How did thfcy appear ?--- In a very riotous manner* hollowing, end hooping, and swearing the house should come down.

What time was that?- — I look upon it* a little after ten o'clock.

You saw him first between seven and eight ? — >! believe it was, or it might be rather later, that-was on the Thursday morning; he was in liquor when I saw him first,- and so he Was ail that day whenever I saw him; 1 believe- he really did not know what he did while he was there, but was encouraged by others; he looked at the books, but I believe he could not read a letter in the books.

Did he look at more than one ? Yes, he turned over several leaves and looked at them backward? and forwards, but I believe he could not read a word: there were Others looked over them as well as he.

You don't think he knew what he was about when he told them to go away ? — I do not believe he rightly did; when my mother came to expostulate with him, he seemed to have some kind of companion. t Several. people fiid the house shoeid come down, was the prisoner one c f thoie ? ---1 did not hear him say so.

DAVIS's defence.

I really was in liquor; I was up in St. George's-fields; there was a house on fire, I helped to work the engine; I had drank more beer than was proper, and really did not know what I did afterwards: I worked the engine to ftive otherhouses: we had plenty of beer, and bottles, wirh drams brought out to us to drink; 1 went up to the calves of my legs to serve the engine?.

Had any of the mob cockades ? — A great many had blue cockades.

Had the prisoner any? — I did not take particular notice of that.

Who did you a(k the question “ who directed them to that house ?” — The man that answered me was in a high coloured coat, but I cannot tell who he was; he said, “ it was a man that flood opposite gave him informationthe answer (was, that they were to have gone down to the next house.

Which of the houses was. you speaking of when you ashed them that question ? — I was speaking of the house which my mother lived in, which was No. i, Stone-cutter's yard; they were to have gone to No. 2, and that man had moved oft belt part of his things,

Do you remember seeing him at any time on the 7th of June la ft ? — Yes, hearing a noiie, I went from my own house on the Wednesday night out of curiosity to fee what they were about; it was then about a quarter after eight o'clock; I went into Bermondsey-street; I law a great many people with different things, two or three had ragged flags; i went in amongst them; I saw one man with a drawn sword in his hand; there was a flag hung out at a wool-(tapter'* or some such occupation on the left hand tide.

What colour was the flag-: — I cannot exadfly remember; I should Know it if I was to fee it again, it was something like an English ensign, a fag or white Jiripcd with red; I had fevn l'everal such fort, it may be blue perhaps.

Don't you remember what colour k was ? — I cannot be particular; I remember it was a long strip; some of the rabble wanted the flag down; the ring-leaucr or captain who had the drawn sword, and who is the prisoner at the bar, deiired the -two little boys peaceably to give it down.

Who were these little boys, did they belong to the house ? — I do not know, the boys were in the room; he desired them to hand it down; the flag was on the first or second story of the ware-house; the boys with some reluctance handed the flag down, and then one of the rabble took it and carried it along amongst the others.

Do you remember how the captain, as you cali him, was then d re (led ? — He had a grey or a blue-grey, coat, rather bluer than mine, with a scarlet or plulh coloured cape, but there was one arm a little ra-g d; it was a red cape I think, I know Vart VIII.

it was not a cap? of the fame colour as the

coat.

How near was you to him when the flag was demanded ? — Very near, within two or three people perhaps; from thence they proceeded to the sign of the fhtp in Long-lane (Welsh's) some of the rabble said that house was pointed out to be defrayed; the landlord came to them and told them he would give them a barrel of beer, or even a butt of beer, if they would desist from pulling down his house, for he was no Catholic; there were a great many words passed' amongst them, one for and another a-gaiaft; but however, they went away.

Was the prisoner there I — Yes.

How did he appear there ?--The fame as in other places; I saw him go into no house with any harm, only the fame a3 the other people.

Had he a drawn sword in his hand -He had.

Did you hear any body spealc to him at the ffiip ? — I am not very particular in my memory.

Then you neither heard him nor saw him do any thing the re ? — Not that I can recollect; the house was not then setroyed; the mob went away from thence; I cannot certainly tell which way, but I heard, several say, lets go to , ahoy

East-hmc, ahoy I the Rotnish Chapel next; come along, fays another, let's go to East-lane, let's go to East-lane.

You did not hear ary thing said by the -prisoner? — Nothing that I know of; I flopped but two or three minutes; I then went down to East-lane; when I came there, I saw the goods throwing out of the chapel or a place that was called the chapel or the dwelling-house; I saw tho furniture and wainfcoting, the doors, benches and other things thrown out at the window; there was a house adjoining to it on the river-side of it, inhabited one Mrs. Curry, I saw a good many people there, and heard they wanted ro pull that house down; I went in, thinking I might be an instrument of saving it; I . q told

Then i law the pnioner walk up towards a place where they were going to make a frre, and where afterwards they did make a fire of the goods* wainfeoting and things which were brought up from opposite the windows of* the Roinan-Catholick chapel to th?.t place, which is at the top of Ealt-ian?, 'rarhtr inclining to the right.

Was it put over the ribband to hide it? — No, the ribband displayed itself tmder that; it was a piece of paper with writing on it, and the sword was fiiuck into it as one would stick a prece of meat;

I taw the prisoner fiouriih the fworu al-mofl upright With this ribband and paper upotr it; they gave three huzzas* and cried out, no popery; there were a vail number of voices indeed, I did the fame among the rfeft, but it was through tear that 1 did it.

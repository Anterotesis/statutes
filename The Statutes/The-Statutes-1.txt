LETTER OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR TO SIR JOHN G. SHAW LEFEVRE.

Sir, of Lords, 9 July 1868.

I have had under consideration the subject of a Revised Edition of the Statutes, a work the expediency of which has been three times affirmed by Parliament, in the preambles of the Statute Lam Revision Acts.

That series of Acts, embodying the results of labours begun under the direction of Lord Campbell, as Lord Chancellor, and Lord

Westbury ( then Sir Richard Bethell), as Attorney-General, and continued under that of succeeding Lord Chancellors and Generals, has removed many difficulties that would have obstructed the application to the Statute Rook of the process of expurgation.

I have, therefore, with the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, determined that an edition of the Statutes shall now be prepared and published, containing, as far as may be, only such Acts as are in force.

I propose to nominate a Committee to make the necessary arrangements, and to superintend the, execution of the work, reporting to me from time to time.

The connexion of your official duties with the forms of legislation, and the attention you have given to subjects relating to the improvement of the condition of the Statute Law, lead me to request you to act on the Committee; and I desire to associate with you the following gentlemen, namely,— Sir Thomas Erskine May, K.C.B., Clerk Assistant of the Souse of Commons; Mr. Rickards, Mr. Speaker'8 Counsel; Mr. Thring, the Parliamentary Counsel to the Some Office; and Mr. Reilly, who was for some time engagednn the work of Statute Law Revision.

Mr. Arthur John Wood, who has been engaged in that work from its commencement to the present time, will be the Editor, subject to the superintendence of the Committee.

I am, Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

Sir John G. Shaw Lefevre, K.C.R., CAIRNS C.

Clerk of the Parliaments.

INTRODUCTION.

This first volume of the Revised Edition of the Statutes, to he published under the authority of the foregoing letter, extends to the end of the reign of James the Second.*

It shows the effect of repeals to the latest Session, that of 1870 (33 & 34 Vict.), inclusive.

It is based on the edition of the Record Commission, known as The Statutes of the Realmf, as regards (among other things) the text, the instruments to be printed, and their order.

Some errors of the text, ascertained to be such by inspection of the Statute roll or Parliament roll, have been corrected. The Queen’s Printers are responsible for the correct printing of unaltered matter.

The Chronological Table prefixed enumerates all Statutes and Acts printed in the Statutes of the Realm for the period comprised in this volume, and shows at what pages those now printed will be found, and why the others are not now printed. It also accounts for the omission of parts of Statutes and Acts, where the omission is not explained in the body of the volume.

A repealed part of an Act, if required to be given for the construction of the unrepealed part, is printed in small type, with a note of the repeal; if not so required, it is omitted. Ordinarily whole sections only are omitted; but, in some peculiar cases, parts of sections are omitted. Omissions of sections are shown by asterisks, of parts of sections by dots.J

This applies equally to specific repeals and to repeals express, but not specific, as for instance, a repeal of so much of an Act as relates to a particular subject.

* In the preparation of it Mr. Wood has been assisted by Mr. James A. Foot.

f The Statutes of the Realm. .Printed by Command........................From Original

Records and Authentic Manuscripts.

% In the earlier part of the volume, chapters of Statutes are in this respect treated as sections of Acts.

Where there might possibly be a question as to the operation of a repeal, the part considered to he covered by the repeal is printed in small type, and the note of the repeal states the terms of repeal.

A partial repeal, not capable of being dealt with exhaustively by excision or distinctive printing, in manner before described, is entered in connection with the title of a Statute or Act, if applicable to the whole of it; if not, then in connection with the portion affected. .

The preamble of an Act is omitted where the first section is repealed - and the preamble does not relate to the unrepealed part.

Repeals limited in terms to England are treated as unrestricted.

Some Acts, not being of practical legal value, are omitted and reserved for a Supplemental Volume.

Acts of a local or personal or private nature are omitted. Sections and occasionally parts of sections of a like nature are also omitted,* these omissions being respectively shown by asterisks and dots, as in cases of repeal.

The variances between the Statutes of the Realm and other editions, with respect to the order of Statutes and Acts, are considerable. The Statute Law Revision Acts of 1863 and 1867 show, for the periods to which they respectively relate, the variances between the Statutes of the Realm and Ruffhead’s Edition (by Runnington, 1786);   and this course has been followed in the Chronological Table.. The variances are there shown in foot notes, or (in the third column) in, parentheses; and prefixed to the Chronological Table is a complete Table of Variances for the same period, in a double form, one following the order of the Statutes of the Realm, the other that of Ruffhead’s Edition, f

Some matters in the textf, and in the notes, of the Statutes of the Realm, not of a sufficiently practical character to be now reproduced, are omitted. Sometimes notes have been modified as

* In the earlier part of the volume, chapters of Statutes are in this respect treated as sections of Acts.

f Some marginal references in the Statutes of the Realm are to Statutes, Acts, and sections as given in other editions. These references have been copied in this volume. They may be corrected by aid of the Table of Variances.

X For instance, directions and statements relating to promulgation only.

circumstances required, and sometimes notes by the present Editor have been substituted. His additions are between brackets J Omissions of parts of notes are shown by dots.

Subjoined to this Introduction are extracts from the explanatory matter prefixed to the first and other volumes of the Statutes of the Bcalm, relative to (among other things) the text, the translation, and the repositories of documents.

These repositories have been in many instances changed since the publication of the Statutes of the Realm; no alteration has, however, been made in the references to them throughout the volume, the adaptation of Appendix C. to the present state of things (as explained in a note thereon) being considered sufficient.

CHAP. III.

Sect. I.—Of the Matter8 inserted in this Collection of The Statutes; and their Arrangement.—Sect. II. Of the Sources from whence the several Matters have been taken.—S^ct. III. Of the Mode used in searching for, transcribing, collating, noting, and printing the Text of the Statutes.

Sect. I.

Of ike Matters inserted in this Collection of the Statutes; and their

Arrangement.

All INSTRUMENTS whatever, comprehended in any of the several collections of statutes printed previous to the edition by Hawkins, are inserted in this work; these having for a long series of years been referred to, and accepted as statutes in courts of law: Together with these are inserted all matters of a public nature, purporting to be statutes, first printed by Hawkins or any subsequent editor; and also new matters of the like nature, contained in any statute rolls, inrollments of Acts, exemplifications, transcripts by writ, and original Acts, although not heretofore printed in any general collection of statutes. All these #re placed in the body of the work as text. But it is to be particularly observed, that any decision upon the degree of authority to which any new instrument may be entitled, as being a statute or not, is entirely disclaimed.

At the foot of the text in each page, there are added, such various readings as appeared necessary to correct its errors, or to supply its deficiencies; or to reconcile any material contradiction or repugnancy between the text and the translation; or between different copies of the text, where they were of equal or of nearly equal authority. In the earlier reigns, or in the absence of any authentic source for the text, such various readings are noted with much greater freedom than in later times, or where authentic sources exist. Writs and other instruments, having direct or material reference to the several statutes, are occasionally subjoined by way of notes. These various readings and instruments are taken from the following sources: Inrollments of Acts; exemplifications; transcripts by writ; original Acts; rolls of Parliament; close, patent, fine, and charter rolls; books containing entries of record; antient books and manuscripts not of record, but preserved in the repositories of courts of justice, and corporation offices; or in the libraries of cathedrals, universities, colleges, or inns of court, and at the British

xii v IExtbact from Introduction &c.I

Museum: Various readings have been also admitted from the printed editions; occasionally in confirmation of the manuscript sources, and more frequently in cases where those sources have been found deficient.

Every thing heretofore printed in any former collection of statutes, is in this volume printed in an uniform type; and all new matters, whether various readings, notes, or entire statutes or instruments, are distinguished by a smaller type. The entire matters whether old or new, of which the dates are ascertained, are placed in chronological order; and all, during the reigns of Hen. III. Edw. I. and Edw. II., the dates of which are uncertain, are classed together, after the manner of former editions, at the end of the reign of Edward II. ,. '

*###'*####

In the 31st year of Henry VIII. the distinction between public Acts and private Acts is for the first time specifically stated on the inrollment in Chancery. No private Acts passed after that date have been admitted into this collection: It has been thought sufficient to notice them, by the insertion of their-titles only.

Sect. II.

Of the Sources from whence the several Matters have been taken.

I. The sources from which the materials have been taken for this collection, are necessarily of a different character and description in different periods of our history.

The earliest statutes contained in the several collections are those of Henry III; but no parliamentary record of statutes is now known to be v extant, prior to the statute roll 6 Edw. I. To this interval nevertheless belong the statutes of Merton, Marlborough, Westminster the First, and several others, always included in the printed editions. For this early period, therefore, recourse must be had to inferior sources fonthe text of our statute law: And even in subsequent times, there is not only an interruption in the series of statute rolls, namely, after 8 Hen. VI, until 23 Hen. VI, inclusive, during which the like recourse must be had to sources of an inferior degree of authority; but the statute rolls themselves do not, within their own period, contain all the instruments which have been acknowledged as statutes. After 8 Edw. IV. the statute roll is not preserved; after 4 Henry VII. it ceased to be made up; and ultimately it was succeeded, for practical purposes, by the inrollment in Chancery; though during a short period the statute roll and the inrollment appear t6 have been contemporary.

The materials for the several periods during which no statute rolls or parliamentary records exist, can only be collected from records, on which copies or extracts of statutes have been entered; or from other manuscripts not of record; or, in default of other authority, from the oldest printed editions in which such matters were first inserted. With respect to entries of record, in these periods, that has been judged to be the most authentic evidence of a statute, which has been preserved as a record or authentic copy from antient times, in the custody of the highest courts authorized for that purpose. Such are copies or extracts of particular statutes found in the close, patent, fine, and charter rolls, being records of Chancery. Such also are the

^Extract from Introduction &c.j

• •• Xlll

Red Books of the Exchequer of Westminster, and Dublin. On failure of these records, recourse has, of necessity, been had to manuscripts not of record, preserved in the custody of courts of justice, public libraries, or other public repositories. Such are some antient books of statutes in the Exchequer at Westminster, in the town clerk's office, London, in the several cathedrals, in the public and other libraries of the several* universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, and in the British Museum: When all these sources have proved deficient,. and in such case only, a copy has been admitted, from the oldest printed edition, with various readings from subsequent printed editions.

During the periods in which statute rolls or other parliamentary records do actually exist, the authentic evidence of statutes, (and of other proceedings in Parliament, before the commencement of the journals,) must be searched for upon statute rolls; inrollments of Acts; exemplifications of such statute rolls or inrollments; transcripts by writ into Chancery for the purpose of such exemplifications; original Acts; and rolls of Parliament.—These are the only authentic sources from whence, during those periods, a knowledge can be obtained of the different occurrences in Parliament, whether important or minute.................

II. The nature and qualities of the several records and manuscripts from whence all the statutes, as well those of an earlier as of a later period, have been taken for insertion or collation in this work, and the place where each original record and manuscript is kept, will more fully appear from the following detail. JaJ

1. Statute rolls.—These are records of Chancery, of the highest authority, on which were entered the several statutes when drawn up in form, for the purpose of being proclaimed and published; these statutes being framed upon such original petitions and answers, or entries thereof on the Parliament rolls, as related to public concerns. The earliest statute roll now known to exist, is that which commences with the Statute of Gloucester 6 Edw. I. A.D. 1278. From that period to 8 Edw. IV. inclusive, A.D. 1468, with an interruption, after 8 Hen. VI. until 23 Hen. VI. inclusive, the statutes are preserved in the Tower of London in a regular series, on six separate rolls, each roll consisting of several membranes tacked together. The contents of each roll are as follows, viz.

Of the Great roll; statutes from 6 Edw. I. to 50 Edw. III. But this roll does not contain all the statutes which have been printed aa of that period.

Second roll; statutes temp. Ric. II. There is also a separate roll, of one membrane, containing a duplicate of the statutes 21 Ric. II.

Third roll; statutes temp. Hen. IV. and V.

Fourth roll; statutes 1 Hen. VI. to 8 Hen. VI.

Fifth roll; statutes 25 Hen. VI. to 39 Hen. VI.

Sixth roll; statutes 1 Edw. IV. to 8 Edw. IV. This is the last statute roll now known to exist, none of a later date having been found.

................There is evidence also that statute rolls have existed of a subsequent time; for the statutes after 8 Edward IV, until 4 Henry VII. inclusive, are inserted in the early printed editions in a form manifestly copied from

See Appendix C., post, p. xxi, in which the respective repositories are particularized. This Appendix has been corrected to the time of publication.!

xiv JEXTRACT from INTRODUCTION &C.J

complete statute rolls; and they are found in the like form in Lib. XI. in the Exchequer at Westminster,, MS. Cott. Nero C. I, in the British Museum, and in several other manuscript collections. But there is reason to conclude, that the making up of the statute roll entirely ceased with the session 4 Hen.YII, as no such roll of a later date, nor any evidence thereof has been discovered; and it is observable that in the next session, 7 Hen. VII, public Acts were, for the first time, printed from the several Bills passed in Parliament, and not as part of one general statute drawn up in the antient form.

2. Inrollments of Acts of Parliament.—These are records, containing the Acts of Parliament certified and delivered into Chancery. They are preserved in the chapel of the Rolls in an uninterrupted series from 1 Ric. III. to the present time; except only during the Usurpation. By the officers of Chancery they are commonly termed “Parliament Rolls;” and they are

variously endorsed, some with the phrase “ Inrollments of Acts.”.

After 5 Hen. VII. they may be considered in effect, as coming in the place of the statute roll......

At present, after all the public-general Acts of the session have received the- royal assent, a transcript of the whole is certified by the clerk of the Parliaments and deposited in the Rolls Chapel: On that occasion the clerk of the Parliaments sends the roll, or rolls, containing such transcript, apparently in a complete state, engrossed on parchment, signed, and certified by him as clerk of the Parliaments; and it is thereupon arranged with the other records; and thus becomes the inrollment of the statutes of that session of

Parliament jaJ........

* ##*###•*

3. Exemplifications; and transcripts by writ—Exemplifications are copies

sent out of Chancery under the King’s seal; either to sheriffs of counties and cities in England, or to the chancellor or chief justice of Ireland, or to other courts or places, for the safe custody and for the proclaiming or confirming of the statute; or in other cases for affording authentic evidence of the statute........

It is not irrelevant to remark, that an exemplification differs from an original grant under the great seal, or an original Act of Parliament, in this; that an exemplification is a copy, and can be made only from the record. ..... .

Transcripts by writ were copies sent into Chancery in answefr to the King’s writ or mandate, calling for a copy of the statute from the officer in whose custody it was preserved......

4. Original Acts.—These, from the 12th year of Henry VII. to the present time, with some interruption, particularly in 14 & 15 Hen. VIII. and

21 Hen. VIII. are preserved in the Parliament Office.....The

original Acts in the Parliament Office consist of the Bills as ingrossed after being brought into Parliament, and in the state in which, after such ingross-ment> they passed both Houses, and received the royal assent. Each Act is on a separate roll numbered; and reference is made to them from a calendar kept of the Acts of each session in the Parliament Office. These are the materials from which the clerk of the Parliaments makes up the inrollments

Ift These Acts, since 1849 exclusive, have been printed on vellum in duplicate, and one of the duplicates, signed by the clerk of the Parliaments, is sent to the master of the rolls, and preserved in the Public Record Office.J

{Extract from Introduction &c.J

xv

of public Acts sent by him into Chancery, and preserved there; or certifies Acts into Chancery, when required so to do. JaI

As to the comparative authority of the original Acts and the inrollments in Chancery, it is to be observed, that all the original Acts are separate from each other; and that they are frequently interlined, defaced, erased, and in m^ny instances, With great difficulty intelligible: The inrollment in Chancery is always fair and distinct; and the Acts are entered in a regular series, on one roll or subsequent rolls, as part of the proceedings of a Parliament, the time of the holding of which is stated at the beginning of the roll. In modem practice, if any doubt arises as to the correctness of the inrollment in Chancery, application is made to .the clerk of the Parliaments  ’; and the original Act is thereupon produced, and compared with the inrollment, and an amendment, if requisite, is made in the inrollment accordingly. {aJ

5. Rolls of Parliament.—These contain entries of the several transactions in Parliament; when complete they include the adjournments, and all other common and daily occurrences and proceedings from the opening to the close of each Parliament, with the several petitions or Bills, and the answers given thereto, not only on public matters, on which the statute was afterwards framed, but also on private concerns. In some few instances the statute as drawn up in form is entered on the Parliament roll: But in general the petition and answer only, are found entered; and in such case the entry, of itself, furnishes no certain evidence, that the petition and answer were at any time put into the form of a statute.

6. The close, patent, fine, and charter rolls, among a variety of grants,

recognisances, and other miscellaneous matters, concerning the state of the realm and the rights of the Crown, recorded in them, include entries of statutes, and some instruments having direct reference to statutes wherein such statutes are recited at length...........

7. Books of record, containing entries of statutes and parliamentary pro-

ceedings.—Of this sort is, the Red Book of the Exchequer at Westminster, some of the early part of which was compiled by Alexander de Swereford, first a clerk and afterwards a baron of the Exchequer, in the reign of Henry III. It seems afterwards to have been considered and used as an authorized repository by the court itself; and contains entries and inrollments of many charters and antient Acts of Parliament, as well as other instruments relating to the King and the rights of the Crown, from the time of William the Conqueror to the end of Edw. III .: ... . . The

Red Book of the Exchequer at Dublin is considered as of the same authority: It contains entries of Magna Carta 1 Hen. III. especially granted to the people of Ireland; of the Statute of Westminster the First, 3 Edw. I, (which is not to be found on the Great roll of statutes in the Tower of London, being prior in date to the present commencement of that roll,) and also of the statutes of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I, de Viris Religiosis 7 Edw. I and Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I, agreeing in general with the text of those statutes on the statute roll in the Tower. There is reason to conclude that these statutes were entered in the Red Book at Dublin, from

EA See note ante, p. xiv.J

xvi JExtract from Introduction &c.j

an exemplification sent over from England in the 13th year of Edw. I, as is noticed in a memorandum on the close roll of that year. A register book marked A., preserved at the Chapter House at Westminster, as in the custody of the treasurer and chamberlains of the Exchequer, contains entries or inrollments made in the time of Edward I. Among these are the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I, and the Statute of Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I. The originals of the several statute^ and instruments, it is stated in the register, were deposited in certain chests in the Chapter House; but these originals have not been discovered.

8. Books and manuscripts not of record, containing entries or copies of

statutes, are very numerous...............

• * # # # * * * #

III. . . . . . the following rules op preference have been-adhered to, in the use of the several sources for the text, and for various readings of the statutes, in the present collection.

During the periods in which statute rolls exist, such statute rolls have been considered and used as the highest authority for the statutes contained in them

But for such statutes as, during the period of the existence of the statute rolls, do not appear on those rolls; and for statutes made in any period of

which the statutefroll is not now in existence,...............and also for the

correction of manifest errors or omissions in the text, whether taken from statute rolls or elsewhere, the following sources have been recurred to in regular gradation; preference being given to them according to the following order, but all being used and collated, where necessary: viz. 1. Inrollments of Acts.—2. Exemplifications .and transcripts.—3. Original Acts.—4. Rolls of Parliament.—5. Close, patent, fine, and charter rolls.—6. Entries and books of record.—7. Books and manuscripts not of record.—And finally, 8. The printed copies; the earliest of which was not published until more than two hundred years subsequent to the present commencement of the statute rolls.

The following reasons for preference among manuscripts not of record have been adopted: 1. Their professing to be authentic copies from any records, exemplifications, or transcripts: 2. Their age; the oldest being on the whole the most worthy of credit: 3. The uniformity and regularity of the series of statutes, and instruments in each collection: 4. Their having been already printed, and received in use, as evidence of the text of statutes; or, if not so printed, their according with the printed copies, and with each other, so that when the manuscripts differ, the majority should prevail: 5. Certain manuscripts have been holden to be of superior authority upon some particular subjects, having special connection with the places in which they are preserved: Such as the books preserved in the Exchequer, for statutes relating to that court, or to accounts, or to money; books at the town clerk's office, London, relating to the assises of bread and ale, weights, and measures, &c: 6. In all manuscripts some articles are found much more correct than others; a judgment has therefore frequently been formed from internal evidence in favour of a particular statute or reading, although the manuscript in which such statute or reading were found, might not, in other instances, be entitled to preference: 7. Where it has happened that several manuscripts agreed in

jExtract from Introduction &c.j

xvii

the text or reading of any instrument, and were so equal in their claims for preference, that it was entirely matter of indifference which should be chosen for a source of extract or quotation, that manuscript has been used which has been quoted or extracted from for other purposes, in preference to one not before quoted; and one which has already been printed from, in preference to one which has not.

Sect. III.

Of the Mode used, in searching for, transcribing, collating, noting, and printing the Text of the Statutes.

• • # m * * #" # * *

The various readings are suggested, in the following manner; first, by substituting one reading for another: In this case the word or sentence in the text, of which an alteration is suggested, is included between two crotchets, with a figure of reference to the note; and in the note is inserted the word or sentence proposed to be substituted, with a quotation of the record or manuscript or printed copies in which it is found. Secondly, by inserting some word or sentence omitted: In this case a reference is included within a parenthesis, and the word or sentence to be inserted is supplied in the note. Thirdly, by noting the omission, in other copies, of a word or sentence inserted in the text: In this case the word or sentence in the text is included between crotchets with a reference, and in the note the copies which omit such word or sentence are particularized.

The entries on the statute rolls and records of Chancery are very seldom broken into separate paragraphs; though other manuscripts are more frequently so divided. In all cases where there is any division of paragraphs in the record or manuscript, the like division has been made in the transcript. The transcript has been also occasionally divided into separate chapters or paragraphs, in conformity with the printed editions of the statutes, and for the convenience of reference, in places where such division did not occur in the record or manuscript: But this has been done only when a full stop or other mark in the manuscript appeared to justify the complete separation of the sentences. The points or stops are conformable to those in the record; and in printing the text of the antient statutes, the same mode has been adopted as with respect to the charters, of exhibiting the contractions as near as may be to the likeness of the original characters. Where the chapters or clauses are numbered in the record or manuscript, such number has been inserted in the transcript. And tie numbers of the chapters and clauses in Cay's edition, or the other printed editions from which the translation is taken, are inserted at the head of the side note or abridgement affixed to tho translation.

Sect. II. Of tee Translation m this Collection of the Statutes.

Sect. II.

Of the Translation in this Collection of the Statutes.

The printed translation of the statutes previous to Hen. VII. used for the present work, is that of Cay's edition 1751: But as many statutes and parts of statutes are omitted from the English of that edition, the deficiencies have been supplied from the edition by Hawkins 1735, the folio edition 1618, usually called RastalTs; Pulton's edition of the same year; RastalTs collection in English 1603; and, in some few instances from earlier English collections, and other authorities. Of statutes and instruments or parts thereof, not heretofore translated, and of such only, a translation has been now made, which is always distinguished by being printed in a smaller type........

In the Bodleian Library, Bawlinson manuscript, No. 230, is a very antient translation of some of the statutes of the time of Hen. III. and Edw. I. There is reason to think, that this translation is of a time certainly not later than Edward III, and probably of an earlier period: It does not contain any statute later than 25 Edward I. In the British Museum, Harleian manuscript No. 4999, is a translation of the statutes 1 Edw. III. to 18 Hen. VI., made apparently in the time of Henry VI, or Edward IV.

For the purpose of correcting errors in the translation, the several editions, as well of the text as of the translation, have been compared with each other; and much use has also been made of the two manuscript translations just noticed, which are cited thus, the Bawlinson manuscript as MS. Tr. 1. and the Harleian manuscript, as MS. Tr. 2: After the commencement of the reign of Henry VI., the petitions or Bills entered in English on the Parliament roll, from whence the statute was drawn up in French or Latin, have been consulted.

Corrections of errors in the translation which arise from misinterpretation or omission, are suggested either from other translations, or, where no other translation supplies a probable correction, by new expressions. Errors or inconsistencies which arise from the insertion of words or sentences, not authorized by the text as given in the present work, are noticed, either by a reference to records or manuscript authorities, or to antient printed copies of the Latin or French text as authorizing such insertion, or by a proposed omission of the words so inserted, in consequence of their not being justified by any authority. Trifling variances between the text and the translation, manifestly not affecting the sense, have not been considered worthy of notice; particularly where all former translations agree in the same reading. But as it was difficult, not to say impossible, to lay down any certain standard on this latter head, a consistency entirely perfect may not have been uniformly observed, and is not to be expected.

The notes and marks suggesting the corrections in the translation, are to be thus understood: First, words which are included between crotchets, without any note of reference, are such as are contained in all translations, and are

{Extract from Introdtjction &c.J

xix

authorized by printed copies of the Latin or French text; though not authorized by the text, or by any various reading, here given, from manuscript records or authorities. Secondly, words in the translation included between crotchets, with a figure, refer to a correction thereof, suggested in the note such collection, if authorized by any printed or manuscript translation, is printed in the note in roman letter; but if not so authorized, then such correction is printed in italic letter; if the correction be justified by the rolls of Parliament or old manuscript translations, they are quoted. Thirdly, a ^reference within a parenthesis between two words, suggests an omission, which is supplied in the notes, in roman or italic character, according as it is or is not authorized, as before specified. Fourthly, where any words in the translation are inclosed between crotchets, with reference to the note “ not in original/’ it is to be understood, that neither the text, as now given from the record or manuscript, nor any printed copy, appears to authorize the insertion of the words. The term “ old translations ” is applied to all published previous to the year 1618; in which year the editions distinguished as Rastall’s and Pulton’s statutes were both published: The edition called Rastall’s, however, having followed the current of several former editions of the statutes, is included in the term “ old ” translations; and Pulton’s translation being in many parts new, and having been generally adopted by Cay and subsequent editors, is therefore included in the term “ modem.”

Short abstracts or side notes have been prepared, as well to the matters heretofore translated, as to those of vhich a translation is now for the first time given in this publication; of those relating to matters heretofore translated, some have been'taken from Cay’s, or former English editions of the statutes; and like abstracts are added to the Acts subsequent to the reign of Hen. VII.

APPENDIX. D. Ito the Introduction to the Statutes

Explanation op the Contractions,

Used in printing the Records and Manuscripts copied in this Collection.

............With respect to the Printed Contractions, it is to be observed, that

wherever the Manuscript is abbreviated, the Print has a mark of contraction, as similar to that of the Manuscript as the types will admit. The different Manuscripts vary a little from each other in the mode of making the several contractions. The following explanation of the marks of contraction used in the Print (applying both to the Latin and French text, though the latter is generally less abbreviated than the former), may serve as well to render rthe printed copy intelligible, as also to explain the contractions in the Manuscripts, and to make the reading and consulting of them, when necessary, more easy to persons not used to antient records.

A straight Line over a Vowel denotes the Omission of the Letter m or n following:

stati - - statim

qua - -antiq* -hoiu - -

quam

antiquam

hominum

n5 - - non

comun - commun

avaudia - avauntditz

volutate - voluntatem

The straight Line over m in the Middle of a Word denotes the Omission of the Letter n following:

omes

- omnes

omia - -

omnia

A crooked Line over some Letter, or a Line through some Letter, of the Word contracted, denotes the Omission of one or more Letters of the Word:

~ fcio or tio

co, to -

Lcion or tion coronacois - coronacionis expeditaco - expeditacio malicose - maliciose

A small superior Letter denotes an Omission, of which such Letterforms a Part:

primis || s* - sibi

1 Qfa - - Gratia 1 Epis- - Episcopis

'* Baffin - Ballivis oms - • omnes

noli - - nobis liUtates - libertates

The following Characters or Abbreviations have certain explicit Significations, viz.

At the End of Words in the Dative or Ablative Plural: Abbatib3 - Abbatibus | quib3 - - quibus

83 - - set (sed) | poss3 - - posset

Or as a comprehensive Mark of Abbreviation:

^Extracts from Prefaces to various Volumes of the Statutes of the Realm.}

{Extract from Preface to Vol. 2.1

• •******•

....Notea of amendment of the existing translation of the statutes

of these years {aJ are inserted, from the Parliament roll, in all instances where the Bills or Acts are found entered thereon in English.

{Similar remarks are made in this Preface as to the Statute 23 Hen. 6. and the statutes 12 to 22 Edw. 4, qualified, however, with this observation with respect to the last-mentioned period,—that the Bills or Acts during this period are uniformly entered on the contemporary Parliament roll in English.!

{Extract from Preface to Vol. 3.J

The titles of the Acts as inrolled in Chancery, during the period contained in this volume, {b| differ from those on the original Acts; and in the calendars in Chancery and in Parliament there are still further differences:..........The title prefixed to each chapter, in the body of the work,

is that which is inserted in the margin of the roll at the beginning of the Act, in all esses where any such appears: Sometimes a list of the Acts is given at the commencement of the roll, with titles differing from those in the margin of the entry of each Act; and sometimes, where a list is so given, no titles are inserted in the margin; in this latter case, the titles in the list are also prefixed to each chapter as printed. The titles of the Acts which are printed from the originals are those which are generally indorsed on, but sometimes written at the head of, such original Acts.

[Extract from Preface to Vol. 4.1

...........In one year, 18 Jac. I., it has happened that the deficiency

arising from the non-inrollment of the two subsidy Acts could not be supplied by the original Acts, nor by any manuscript or printed copy, although very diligent searches were made for the purpose. [These two Acts not being extant (their titles only being preserved) are in this edition treated as nonexisting, and accordingly are not noticed even in the Chronological Table!

• • •• * • • * •

[It appears from the prefeces to volumes 2-6, that after 12 Hen. 7. Acts printed from the inrolment in Chancery have been compared with the original Acts in the Parliament Office, whenever these were still preserved.!

Damages to widows on a writ of dower.

Widows may bequeath the com on their lands.

IV. Common of pasture by freeholders within great manors.

First, of widows which after the death of their husbands are deforced of their dowers, [and cannot have their dowers or quarentinel] without plea, [2 whosoever deforce them of their dowers or quarentine of the lands, whereof their husbands died seised, and that the same widows after shall recover by plea; they that be convict of such wrongful deforcement shall yield damages to the same widows;2] that is to say, the value of the whole dower to them belonging, from the time of the death of their husbands unto the day that the said widows, by judgement of our court, have recovered seisin [of their dower, &c.3] and the deforcers nevertheless shall be amerced at the King's pleasure.

Also, from henceforth widows may bequeath the [crop of4] their ground, as well of their dowers as of other their lands and tenements, saving to the lords [of the fee,] all such services as be due for their dowers and other tenements.

Also, because many great men of England, which have infeoffed knights and their freeholders of small tenements in their great manors, have complained that they cannot make their profit of the residue of their manors, as of wastes, woods, and pastures, whereas (5) the same feoffees 0 have sufficient pasture 0 as

1 or cannot have their dowers, within the time of quarentine,

2 and who afterwards by plea recover their dowers of the tenements whereof their husbands died seised, they shall recover together with their dowers, from those which be convict of such wrongful deforcement, their damages;

To the King's writ of bastardy, whether one being bora before matrimony, may inherit in like manner as he that is born after [matrimony,] all the bishops answered, that they would not, nor could not answer to it; because it was directly against the common order of the church. And all the bishops instanted the lords, that they would consent that all such as were bora afore matrimony should be legitimate, as well as they that be bom within matrimony, as to the succession of inheritance, forsomuch as the church Accepteth such for legitimate. And all the earls and barons with one voice answered, that they would not change the laws of the realm, which hitherto have been used and approved.

Moreover, distresses shall be reasonable, and not too great; and he that taketh [great1] and unreasonable distresses, shall be grievously amerced for the excess of such distresses.

The Great Charter shall be observed in all his articles, as well in such as pertain to the King, as to other; and that shall be enquired afore the justices in eyre in their circuits, and afore the sheriffs in their counties, when need shall be; and writs shall be freely granted against them that do offend, before the King, or the justices of the bench, or before justices in eyre, when they come into those parts. Likewise the Charter of the Forest shall be observed in all his articles, and the offenders, when they be convict, shall be [grievously] punished by our sovereign lord the King [in form above mentioned.]

. For doing suits unto courts of great lords, [or of meaner persons,2] from henceforth this order shall be observed; that none that is infeoffed by deed, from henceforth shall be distrained to do such suit to the court of his lord, without he be specially bound thereto by the form of his deed: These only except, whose ancestors or they themselves, have used to do such suit before the first voyage of the [said] King [Henry] into [Britain,8] since which nine and thirty years and an

Likewise from henceforth none that [is infeoffed without deed, from the time of the conquest, or (2) any other ancient feoffment, shall be distrained to do such suits, unless that he or his ancestors used to do it before the said voyage (8). And they that are infeoffed by deed to do a certain service, as for (4) service of so many shillings by year, to be [acquitted6] of all service, from henceforth shall not be bounden to such suits, or other like, contrary unto the form of their feoffment. And if any inheritance, whereof but one suit is due, descend unto many heirs, (®) as unto parceners, whoso hath the eldest part of the inheritance, shall do that one suit for himself and his fellows, and the other coheirs shall be contributaries, according to their portion, for doing such suit. And if many feoffees be seised of an inheritance, whereof but one suit is due, the lord of the fee shall have but that one suit; and shall not exact of the said inheritance but that one suit, as hath been used to be done before. And if those feoffees have no [warrant7] or mean which ought to acquit them, then all the feoffees, according to their portion, shall be contributaries for doing [the suit for them.8]

And if it chance that the lords [of the fee 9] do distrain their tenants for such suits, contrary to this act, then at the complaint of the tenants, the lords shall be attached to appeal* in the King’s court at a short day, to make answer thereto, and shall have

the whole realm.

And because elections ought to

be free, the King commandeth upon great forfeiture, that [no man *] by force of arms, nor by malice, or menacing, shall disturb any to make free election. (2)

And that no city, borough, nor town, nor any man be amerced, without reasonable cause, and according to the quantity of his trespass; that is to say, every freeman saving his [freehold8] a merchant saving his merchandise, a villain saving his waynage,

and that by his or their peers. ******

And forasmuch as the peace of this realm hath been [evil observed 4] heretofore for lack of quick and fresh suit making after felons in due manner, and namely, because of franchises, where felons ate received; it is provided, that all generally be ready and apparelled, at the commandment and summons of sheriffs, and at the

In like manner it is to be inquired of them that be drowned, or suddenly dead: And after, [such bodies are to be seen,1] whether they were so drowned, or slain, or strangled, by the sign of a cord tied straight about their necks, or [about any of their members, or upon2] any other hurt found upon their bodies: Whereupon they shall proceed in the form above-said: And if they were not slain, then ought the coroner to attach the finders, and all other in the company. A coroner also ought to inquire of treasure that is found, who were the finders, and likewise who is suspected thereof; and that may be well perceived where one liveth riotously, haunting taverns, and hath done so of long time; hereupon [he3] may be attached for this suspicion by four, or six, or more pledges, [if be may be found.4] Further, if any be appealed of rape, he must be attached, if the appeal be fresh, and [they must see 5] apparent sign of truth by eflusion of blood, or an open cry made; and such shall be attached by four or six pledges, if they may be found: If the appeal were without cry, or without any manifest sign or token, two pledges shall be sufficient.

The STATUTES of GLOUCESTER.

Ex magno Rot Stat in Turr. Lond. m. 47.*

T E an de g*ce M°CC°Lxxviij. e del Regne le Rey Edward, fiz le Rey Henri sisme, a Gloucestre Le mois de Aust, purveaunt mesme le Rei, pnr Le amendement- de sun reaume, e pur [plus1] plenere exhibi-cion de dreit, si com le profit de office regal demaunde, appelez les plus descrez de sun regne, ausi bien des greindres, cum des meindres: establi est e concordaument ordeine, qe cum 1 Reg. A. omits.

mHE year of grace MCCLXXVIII, ^ and the sixth of the reign of King Edward son of King Henry, at Gloucester, in the month of August, the King himself providing for the amendment of his realm, and for a fuller administration of justice, as the good of the kingly office requireth, having called unto him the more discreet persons of his kingdom, as well of the greater as of the less: It is established and ordained with one accord, that whereas

•The whole of this statute, as here given from the Tower Roll in French, is entered, with some variations, in a register-book of the time, marked A. among the records in the Treasury of the Court of the Receipt of the Exchequer, preserved in the Chapter House at Westminster; fo. 276; a copy or translation of the statute in Latin is given in fo. 272 b. &c. of the same register; as also in the Liber Custumarum in the Town Clerk’s office, London; and in other manuscripts. The Tower Roll being injured and illegible in some places, the words defective have been supplied from the French entry in the register-book A., and are distinguished by Wing included in brackets without any figure of reference. In MS. Cott. Claudius D. II. the statute is given in French; with a note at the end ‘Exr p rotulum,’ and agrees very exactly with the Statute Roll in the Tower. In that Cotton manuscript, and in very many other manuscripts, the introductory part of the statute relating to franchises is given in Latin, with some variations from the French text, as a separate statute, de Quo Warranto or de Libertate clamanda. The Roll of Statutes in the Bodleian library, No. 1036, MS. Cott. Vespas. B. VII, and very many other MSS. give this Statute of Gloucester, in French, commencing only with a short introduction something similar to the first paragraph of the statute on the Tower! Roll, and then proceeding to chapter I. respecting damages in novel disseisin. The old printed copies give this statute with a like short introduction in French: and also give a copy of the introductory part in Latin, as a Statute of Quo Warranto, 30 Edw. I. In all English editions of the statutes previous to Hawkins’s edition, a translation of the thort introduction is given at the beginning of the statute, and the translation of the Latin introduction is given as a Statute of 30 Edw. I. In Hawkins’s and subsequent editions the original of the French introduction on the Tower Roll is given without a translation; and a translation of the Latin introduction is given without the original.

6 Edward I.

the same kingdom, in many divers cases, as well of franchises as of other things, wherein aforetime the law hath failed, and to avoid the grievous damages and innumerable disherisons which this default of the law hath caused to the people of the realm, hath need of divers additions to the law, and of new provisions, therefore the statutes, ordinances, and provisions under-written should be sted-fastly observed by all the people of the kingdom.

Whereas heretofore damages were not awarded in assises of novel disseisin, but only against the disseisors: It is provided, that if the disseisors do aliene the lands, and have not whereof there may be damages levied, that they to whose hand such tenements shall come, shall be charged with the damages, so that every one shall answer for his time. It is provided also, that the disseisee shall recover damages in a writ of entry upon novel disseisin, against him that is found tenant after the disseisor. It is provided also, that where before this time damages were not awarded in a plea of mortdaun-cestor, but in case where the land was recovered against the chief lord, that from henceforth damages shall be awarded in all cases where a man recovereth by assise of mort-dauncestor, as before is said in assise of novel disseisin: And likewise damages shall be recovered in writs of cosinage, aiel, and besaiel.

And whereas before time damages were not taxed, but to the value of the issues of the land; it is provided, that the demandant may recover against the tenant the costs of his writ purchased, together with the damages abovesaid.

And every person from henceforth (') shall be compelled to render damages, [where the land is recovered2] against him upon his own

It is provided also, that a man from henceforth shall have a writ of waste (*) in the Chancery against him that holdeth by law of England, or otherwise for term of life, or for term of years, or a woman in dower; and he which shall be attainted of waste, shall leese the thing that he hath wasted, and moreover shall recompense thrice so much as the waste shall be taxed at. And for waste made in the time of wardship, it shall be done as is contained in the Great Charter. And where it is contained in the Great Charter, that he which did waste during the custody, shall leese the wardship, it is agreed that he shall recompense the heir his damages for the waste, if bo be that the wardship lost do not amount to the value of the damages before the

STATUTES of KING EDWARD,

Made at Westminster in his Parliament, at Easter,

In the Thirteenth Year of his Reign.

WHEREAS of late our lord the King, in the quinzim of Saint John Baptist, the sixth year of his reign, calling together the prelates, earls, barons, and his council at Gloucester, and considering that divers of this realm were disherited, by reason that in many cases, where remedy should have been had there was none provided by him nor his predecessors, ordained certain statutes right necessary and profitable for his realm, whereby the people of England and Ireland, being subjects unto his power, have obtained more speedy justice in their oppressions, than they

bad before; and certain cases, wherein the law failed, did remain undetermined, and some (*) remained to be enacted, that were for the reformation of the oppressions of the people: Our lord the King in his Parliament, after the feast of Easter, holden the thirteenth year of his reign at Westminster, caused many oppressions [of the people,] and defaults of the laws, for the accomplishment of the said Statutes of Gloucester, to be rehearsed, and thereupon did provide certain acts, as shall appear here following.

First, concerning lands that many times are given upon condition, that is to wit, where any giveth bis land to any man and his wife, and to the heirs begotten of the bodies of the B&me man and his wife, with such condition expressed that if the same man and his wife die without [heirs *] of their bodies between them begotten, the land so given shall revert to the giver or his heir: In case also where one giveth lands in free marriage, which gift hath a condition annexed, though it be not expressed in the deed of gift, which is this, that if the husband and wife die without heir of their bodies begotten, the land so given shall revert to the giver or his heir: In case also where one giveth land to another, and the heirs of his body issuing; it seemed very hard, and yet seemeth to the givers and their heirs, that their will being expressed in the gift, was not heretofore, nor yet is observed: (*) In all the cases aforesaid, after issue begotten and bom between them, to whom the lands were given under such condition, heretofore such feoffees had power to aliene the land so given, and to disherit their issue of the land, contrary to the minds of the givers, and con-

trary to the form expressed in the gift: And further, when the issue of such feoffee is failing, the land so given ought to return to the giver, or his heir, by form of the gift expressed in the deed, though the issue, if any were, had died: Yet by the deed and feoffment of them, to whom land was so given upon condition, the donors have heretofore been barred of their reversion, which was directly repugnant to the form of the gift: Wherefore our lord the King, perceiving how necessary and expedient it should be to provide remedy in the aforesaid cases, hath ordained, that the will of the giver, according to the form in the deed of gift manifestly expressed, shall be from henceforth observed; so that they to whom the land was given under such condition, shall have no power to aliens the land so given, but that it shall remain unto the issue of them to whom it was given after their death, or [shall revert] unto the giver or his heirs, if issue fail [whereas1] there is no issue at all, or if any issue be, [and fail by death, or heir of the body of such issue failing.2] Neither shall the second husband of any such woman, from henceforth, have any thing in the land so given upon condition, after the death of his wife, by the law of England, nor the issue of the second husband and wife shall succeed in the inheritance, but immediately after the death of the husband and wife, to whom the land was so given, it shall [come to their issue, or return unto8] the giver, or his heir, as before is said. And forasmuch as in a new case new remedy must be provided, this manner of writ shall be granted to the party that will purchase it: [Precipe A. quod juste,

And it is to wit that this statute shall hold place touching alienation of land contrary to the form of the gift hereafter to be made, and shall not extend to gifts made before. And if a fine be levied hereafter upon such lands, it shall be void in the law; neither shall the heirs, or such as the reversion belongeth unto, though they be of full age, within England, and out of prison, need to make their claim.

And if any take pledges otherwise, he shall answer for the price of the beasts, and the lord that distraineth shall have his recovery by writ, that he shall restore unto him so many beasts or cattle; and if the bailiff be not able to restore, his superior shall restore. And forasmuch as it hapneth sometime, that after the return of the beasts is awarded unto the distrainor, and the party so distrained, after that the beasts be returned, doth replevy them again, and when he seeth the distrainor appearing in the court ready to answer him, doth make default, whereby return of the beasts ought to be awarded again unto the distrainor, and so the beasts be replevied twice or thrice, and infinitely, and the judgements given in the King's court take no effect in this case, whereupon no remedy hath been yet provided; in this case such process [shall be awarded,8] that so soon as return of the beasts shall be awarded to the distrainor, the sheriff shall be commanded by a judicial writ to make return of the beasts unto the distrainor; in which writ it shall be expressed, that the sheriff shall not deliver them without writ, making mention of the judgement given by the justices, which cannot be without a writ issuing out of the rolls of the

Whereas for waste done in the inheritance of any person, by guardians, tenants in dower, tenants by this courtesie of England, or otherwise for term of life, [or years,] a writ of prohibition of waste hath been used to be granted, by which writs many were deceived, thinking that such as had done the waste should not need to answer but only for waste done after the prohibition to them directed; our lord the King, to remove from henceforth this error, hath ordained, that of all manner of waste done to the damage of any person, there shall from henceforth be no writ of prohibition awarded, but a writ of summons, so that he of whom , complaint is shall answer for waste done at any time; and if he come not after the summons, he shall be attached, and after the attachment he shall be distrained; and if he come not after the distress, the sheriff shall be commanded that in proper person he shall take with him twelve, &c. and shall go to the place wasted, and shall inquire of the waste done, and shall return an inquest, and after the inquest returned, they shall pass unto judgement, like as it is contained in the Statute of Gloucester.1

In every case whereas such as be within age may sue, it is ordained, that if such within age be eloined, so that they cannot sue personally, their next friends shall be admitted to sue for them.

When debt is recovered or know-ledged in the King’s court, or damages awarded, it shall be from henceforth in the election of him that sueth for such debt or damages, [to have a writ of fieri facias unto the sheriff for to levy the debt2] of the lands and

Whereas after the death of a person dying intestate, which is bounden to some other for debt, the goods come to the ordinary to be disposed; the ordinary from henceforth shall be bound to answer the debts as far forth as the goods of the dead will extend, in such sort as the executors of the same party should have been bounden, if he had made a testament. « * • • * '*•

Whereas two or more do hold wood, turf-land, or fishing, or other such thing in common, wherein none knoweth his several, and some of them do waste against the minds of the other, an action may lie by a writ of waste; and when it is come unto judgement, the defendant shall choose either to take his part in a place certain, by the sheriff, and by the view, oath, and assignment of his neighbours, [sworn and tried1] for the same intent, or else he shall grant to take nothing from henceforth in the same wood, turf-land, and such other, but as his partners will take; and if he do choose to take his part in a place certain, the part .wasted shall be assigned for his part, [as it was *] before he committed the waste.

lords of wastes, woods, and pastures, have been hindered heretofore by the contradiction of neighbours having sufficient pasture: And because foreign tenants have no more right to common in the wastes, woods, or pastures of any lord than the lord's own tenants; it is ordained, that the Statute of Merton, provided between the lord and his tenants, from henceforth shall hold place between lords of wastes, woods, and pastures, and their neighbours; saving sufficient pasture to their tenants and neighbours, so that the lords of such wastes, woods, and pastures, may make approvement of the residue. And this shall be observed for such as claim pasture as appurtenant to their tenements. But if any do claim common (*) by special feoffment or grant for a certain number of beasts, or otherwise [which 2] he ought to have of common right, [whereas covenant barreth the law,8] he shall have such recovery as he ought to have had by form of the grant made unto him; By occasion of a windmill, sheepcote, deyry, inlarging of a court necessary, or courtelage, from henceforth no man shall be grieved by assise of novel disseisin for common of pasture.

T^ORASMUCH as writs of quo warranto, and also judgements given upon pleas of the same, were greatly delayed, because the justices in giving judgement [were not1] certified of the King’s pleasure therein; our lord the King, at his Parliament holden at Westminster, after the feast of Easter, the eighteenth year of his reign, of his special grace, and for the affection that he beareth unto his prelates, earls, and barons, and other of his realm, hath granted, that all under his allegiance, whatsoever they be, as well spiritual as other, which can verify by good enquest of the country, or otherwise, that they and their ancestors or predecessors have used any manner of liberties, whereof they were impleaded by the said writs, before the time of King Richard our cousin, or in all bis time, and have continued hitherto (*) so that they have not misused such liberties, that the parties shall be adjourned further unto a certain day reasonable before the same justices, within the which they may go to our lord the King with the record of the justices, signed with their seal, and also return; and our lord the King, by his letters [patents] shall confirm their estate. And they that cannot prove the seisin of their ancestors or predecessors in such manner as is before declared, shall be ordered and judged after the law and custom of the realm; and such as have the

Also our said lord the King hath granted, for sparing of the costs and expences of the people of his realm, that pleas of quo warranto from henceforth shall be pleaded and determined in the circuit of the justices; and that all pleas (8) now depending (4) shall be adjourned into their own shires, until the coming of the justices into those parts: (B)

Another New Statute of Quo Warranto.

QONCERNING the writ that is called quo warranto, our lord the King, at the feast of Pentecost, in the eighteenth year of his reign,

hath established, that all those which claim to have quiet possession of any franchise before the time of King Richard, without interruption, and can shew the same by a lawful enquest, shall well enjoy their possession; and in case that such possession be demanded for cause reasonable, our lord the King shall confirm it by title. And those that have old charters of franchise, shall have the

Confirmation of the charters.

King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Guyan, to all those that these present letters shall hear or see, greeting. Know ye that we, to the honour of God, and of holy church, and to the profit of our realm, have granted for ns and our heirs, that the Charter of Liberties, and the Charter of the Forest, which were made by common assent of all the realm, in tae time of King Henry our father, shall be kept in every point without breach. And we will that the same t^^t*on charters shall be sent under our seal, as well to our justices of the forest, as to others, and to all sheriffs of shires, and to all our other officers, and to all our cities throughout the realm, together with our writs, in the which it shall be contained, that they cause the foresaid charters to be published, and to declare to the people that we have confirmed them in all points; and [that *] our justices, sheriffs, mayors, and other ministers, which under us (*) have the laws of our land to guide, [shall allow the said charters pleaded before them in judgment in all their points; *] that is to wit, the Great Charter as the common law, and the Charter of the Forest (4) for the wealth of our realm.

And we will, that if any judgement II. be given from henceforth contrary to the points of the charters aforesaid charter* voia. by the justices, or by any other our ministers that hold plea before them

against the points of the charters, it shall be undone and holden for nought.

And we will, that the same charters shall be sent, under our seal, to cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the people two times by the year.

And that all archbishops and bishops shall pronounce the sentence of (x) excommunication against all those that by [word,] deed, (*) or counsel do contrary to the foresaid charters, or that in any point break or undo them. And that the said curses be twice a year denounced and published by the prelates aforesaid. And if the same prelates, (8) or any of them be remiss in the denunciation of the said sentences, the Archbishops of Canterbury and Tork for the time being (4) shall compel and distrein them [to the execution of their duties 5] in form aforesaid.

And for so much as divers people of our realm are in fear, that the aids and tasks which they have given to us beforetime towards our wars and other business, of their own grant and good will, howsoever they were made, might turn to a bondage to them and their heirs, because they might be at another time found in the rolls, and [likewise for ®] the prises taken throughout the realm by our ministers (*);  we have granted for us and our heirs, that we shall not draw such aids, tasks, nor prises into a custom, for any thing that hath been done heretofore, [be it by roll or any other precedent that may be founden.8]

Moreover we have granted for us and our heirs as well to archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, and other folk of holy church, as also to earls, barons, and to all the communalty of the land, that for no business from henceforth we shall take (a) such manner of aids, tasks, nor prises, but by the common assent of the realm, and for the common profit thereof, saving the ancient aids and prises due and accustomed.

And for so much as the more part of the communalty of the realm find themselves sore grieved with the [maletent *] of woolls, that is to wit, a toll of forty shillings for every sack of wooll, and have made petition to us to release the same; we at their requests have clearly released it, and have granted [for us and our heirs] that we shall not take [such things8] without theH^ a^mmon assent and good will; saving lo us and our heirs the custom of woolls, skins, and leather, granted before by the communalty aforesaid. In witness of which things we have caused these our letters to be made patents. Witness Edward our son at London the tenth day of October, the five and twentieth year of our reign.

And be it remembered that this same charter, in the same terms, word for word, was sealed in Flanders under the King’s great seal, that is to say, at Ghent the fifth day of November in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of our aforesaid lord the King, and sent into England.*

******

Forasmuch as sheriffs and others ILL heretofore have let out by replevin ^^haUbe common felons, and openly defamed also justices of being taken and imprisoned for mur- ? der and [felony,1] and such as be not Westm. l. replevisable, contrary to the form of chap'15’^ our statute of persons replevisable and not replevisable lately made; whereby such transgressors not replevisable [be let out, and to deliver them *] deceitfully, before the coming of the justices errant, or other assigned for their deliverance, [they procure8]‘by themselves and by their friends jurors of the country, and some they threat, whereby as well for fear of the sheriff, and other that let them at large by plevin, as for fear of the thieves (4) being so delivered, before the justices assigned for gaol deliveries such felonies and murthers are concealed, and so being concealed, remain still unpunished: We, for the utility of our realm, and for the more assured conservation of our peace, have provided and ordained, that justices assigned to take assises in every county where they do take assises, as they be appointed, incontinent after the assises taken, in the shires, shall remain both together, if they be lay; and if one of them be a clerk, then one of the most discreet knights of the shire being associate to him that is a layman, by our writ shall deliver the gaols of * the shires, as well within liberties as without, of all manner of prisoners,

And they shall plead no plea of trespass, other than that which shall be attached by them before the King depart from the verge where the trespass shall be committed; and shall plead them speedily from day to day, so that they may be pleaded and determined before that the King depart out of the limits of the same verge where the trespass was done.

with that on the Statute Roll from which the text is printed. From the original bill

which said articles, with the answers of the same, the tenors here ensue.

First, whereas laymen do purchase L prohibitions generally upon tythes, obventions, oblations, mortuaries, redemption of penance, violent laying hands on clerks or [converts,1] and in cases of defamation, in which cases [spiritual penance ought to be enjoined: *] the King doth answer to

this article, that in tythes, oblations, No prohibition r , • ..i.i in suits for

obventions, mortuaries, when they are tythes, &c .;

propounded under these names, the King's prohibition shall hold no place, although for the long withholding of the same, [the money may be esteemed at a sum certain.8] But if a clerk or unless they be a religious man do sell his tythes being gathered in his bam, or otherwise, to any man for money, if the money be demanded before a spiritual judge, the Kings prohibition shall lie; for, by the sale, the spiritual goods are made temporal, and the tythes turned into chattels.

Also if debate do arise upon the . H-right of tythes, having his original from the right of the patronage, and patronage, the quantity of the same tythes do come unto the fourth part of the goods of the church, the King's prohibition shall hold place, if the cause come before a judge spiritual. Also if Penance

. , .. . pecuniary and

a prelate enjoin a penance pecuniary corporal.

to a man for his offence, and it be demanded, the King's prohibition shall hold place; but if prelates enjoin a penance corporal, and they which be so punished •will redeem upon their own accord such penances by money, if (4) money be demanded before a judge spiritual, the King's prohibition shall hold no place.

Moreover, if any lay violent hands on a clerk, the amends for the peace broken shall be before the king, and for the excommunication before a prelate, that penance corporal may be enjoined; which if tbeoffender will redeem, of his own good will, by giving money to the prelate, or to the party grieved, it [shall l~] be required before the prelate, and the king’s prohibition shall not lie. {Rep., 9 Geo. 4. c. 31. s. l.J

Also if any do erect in his ground a

mill of new, and after the parson of the same place demandeth tythe for the same, the King’s prohibition doth issue in this form: [Quia de tali molendino hactenus decimse non fue-runt solutge, prohibem9, &c. & senten-tiam excommunicationis, si quam hac occasione promulgaveritis, revocetis omnino.2 *] The answer. In such case the King's prohibition was never granted by the King’s assent, [nor never shall, which 8] hath decreed that it shall not hereafter lie in such cases.

Also if any cause or matter, the knowledge whereof belongeth to a court spiritual, and shall be definitively determined before a spiritual judge, [and doth pass4 * 6] into a judgement, [and shall not be suspended *] by an appeal; and after, if upon the same thing a question is moved before a temporal judge between the same parties, and it be proved by witness or instruments, such an exception is not to be admitted in a temporal court. The answer. When any one case (®) is debated before judge spiritual [or7] temporal, as above appeareth upon the case of laying violent hands on a clerk, [it is thought,8] that notwithstanding the spiritual judgement, the King's court shall discuss the same matter [as the party shall think expedient for himself. ®]

Also the King’s letter (*) directed unto ordinaries, that bave wrapped those that be in subjection unto them in the sentence of excommunication, that they should assoil them by a certain day, or else that they do appear, and shew wherefore they have excommunicated them. The answer. The King decreeth, that hereafter no such letters shall be suffered to go forth, but in case where it is found that the Kings liberty is prejudiced by the excommunication.

Also barons of the King’s Exchequer claiming by their privilege, that they ought to make answer to no complainant out of the same place, extend the same privilege unto clerks abiding there, called to orders or unto residence, and inhibit ordinaries that by no means, or for any cause, so long as they be in the Exchequer, or in the King s service, they shall not call them to judgement. The answer. It pleaseth our lord the King, that such clerks as attend in his service, if they offend, shall be correct by their ordinaries like as other; but so long as they are occupied about the Exchequer, they shall not be bound to keep residence in their churches. [This is added *] of new by the King's council The King and his ancestors since time out of mind have used, that clerks, which are employed in his service, during such time as they are in service, Bhall not be compelled to keep residence at their benefices; and such things as be thought necessary for the King and the commonwealth, ought not to be said to be prejudicial to the liberty of the church.

King's highway, where they have nothing but the land belonging to the church. The answer. The King's pleasure is, that from henceforth such distresses shall neither be taken in the King’s highway, nor in the fees wherewith churches in times past have been indowed; nevertheless he willeth distresses to be taken in possessions of the church newly purchased by

ecclesiastical persons.

Also it is desired that spiritual persons, whom our lord the King doth present unto benefices of the church, if the bishop will not admit them, either for lack of learning, or for other cause reasonable, may not be under the examination of lay persons in the cases aforesaid, as it is now attempted, contrary to the decrees canonical, but that they may sue unto a spiritual judge, (*) for remedy, as right shall require. The answer. Of the ability of a parson presented unto a benefice of the church the examination belongeth to a spiritual judge; and so it hath been used heretofore, and shall be hereafter.

Also if any dignity be vacant, where election is to be made, it is moved that the electors may freely make their election without fear of any power temporal, and that all prayers and oppressions shall in this behalf cease. The answer. They shall be made free according to the form of statutes and ordinances.

* Statutum de Scaccario * in the statute of 16 Ed. II. relating to the form of sending estreats into the Exchequer. The various readings marked MS. Cott. are from the

Cotton MS. Claudius D. 2.fo. 224. from whence these articles were printed by Cay.

(a) The words * Districcftes de Sc*cio 9 in this place, and * de scHrio9 in the margin below, before chapter xiiij, Jin the Statutes of the Realm,} are inserted in red ink: A line is drawn round the part of the manuscript, which contains this division, and at the bottom of the leaf is the following note, in a hand-writing similar to that of the words in red ink, being different from and apparently of a later date than that of the text: “ Hie est tangposicb lit?e, q* distfcciones Sc*cij hie scribuntr in? Captm xiij k xii^j Statuto^ Sc*cij.” It appears that the numbers of the chapters in the margin are in the same hand-writing as this note: The words 1 distr sc*cij ’ in the margin, after chapter xiij, are in a hand-writing different from that of either the text or note. In the printed copies this part has always been given as a separate instrument: as it ia also in MS. Cott.fo. 226; and in MS. Tr. 1.

Wards and Reliefs.

JT is to wit, that where any relief is given, there wardship is incident, and contrariwise; and such as hold by seijeanty to go with the King in his host, there ward and relief are incident; and such as hold by petty seijeanty, as to bear shield or spear in the King's host, or to bear or to carry, there is neither ward, marriage, or relief; also a free sokeman shall not give ward nor relief but he shall double his rent after the death of his ancestor, according as he hath used to pay to his lord, and shall not be immeasurably grieved. Now somewhat is to be said of the nature of having wards; there be two manner of writs to have wards; one is where lands be holden in knight's service, the other is where lands be holden in socage; the ward of land that is holden in knights service belongeth to the chief lord, and the marriage, which ought to be without disparagement as the Great Charter limiteth, [until he cometh to the age of1] one and twenty years: The ward of an heir that holdeth in socage; if the land or inheritance descend of his

Another manner is when a man is infeoffed of a verge of land by one man, and Q) by another of a carve of land, the second lord may not bring a writ of ward to recover either the land or the heir, for the ward belongeth to him of whom he was first infeoffed. The third manner is where a man hath land in his hands by reason of ward, and [hath not the heir,2] then he may bring a writ to demand the heir, and not the land.

against the peace; it is ordained and enacted, that such charter shall not be granted, but only where the King may do it by his oath, that is to say, where a man slayeth another in his own defence, or by misfortune: {Rep., Stat. Law Rev. Act, 1863.} And also they have been encouraged, because that [2 the justices of gaol-delivery, and of oyer and terminer, have been procured by great men *] against the form of the statute made in the xxvij year of the reign of King Edward, grandfather to our lord the King that now is, wherein is contained, that justices assigned to take assises, if they be laymen, shall make deliverance; and if the one be a clerk, and the other a layman, that the lay judge, with another of the country associate to him, shall deliver the gaols: Wherefore it is enacted, that such [justices8] shall not be made against the form of the said statute; and that the assises, attaints, and certifications be taken before the justices commonly assigned, which should be good men and lawful, having knowledge of the law, and none other, after the form of another statute made in the time of the said [King Edward the First ;4] and that the oyers and terminers shall not be granted but before justices of the one bench or the other, or the justices errants, and that for great [hurt,] or horrible trespasses, and of the King's special grace, after the form of the statute thereof ordained in time of the said grandfather, and none otherwise.

Item, whereas divers opinions have Decla^<m been before this time [in what case ^hai offence* treason shall be said, and in what not ;J] the King, at the request of the Reason/ lords and of the commons, hath made a declaration in the manner as here-

a man doth compass or imagine the |£elfog of

death of our lord the King, or of our Queen, or their

lady his [Queen2] or of their eldest

son and heir; or if a man do violate Queen, or the

And if percase any man of this realm ride armed [covertly6] or secretly with men of arms against any other, to slay him, or rob him, or take him, or retain him till he hath made fine or ransom for to have his deliverance, it is not the mind of the King nor his council, that in such case it shall be judged treason, but shall be judged felony or trespass, according to the laws of the land of old time used, and according as the case requiretli. And if in such case, or other like, before this time any justices have judged treason, and for this cause the lands and tenements have comen into the King’s hands as forfeit, the chief lords of the fee shall have the* escheats of the tenements holden of them, whether that the same tenements be in the King’s hands, or in others, by gift or in other manner; saving always to our lord

Item, because that many presentments to divers benefices of Holy Church, as well of the patronage of lay people, as of people of Holy Church, which were void by six months, whereof the collation of such benefices by lapse of time was devolute, and of right pertaining to the ordinaries of the places, were recovered by the King by judgements thereof given of the assent of the said patrons, in deceit of the said collations so made reasonably by the said ordinaries; in which pleas (*) the ordinaries nor their clerks, to whom they did give such benefices, were not received to shew nor defend their right in this behalf, [nor to counterplead the King's right so claimed,4] which is not reasonable; wherefore the King, by the assent of the said Parliament, will and granteth for him and his heirs, that when archbishops, bishops, or other ordinaries, have given a benefice of right devolute to him by lapse of time, and after the King presenteth and taketh the suit against the patron, which percaae will suffer that the King shall

First, that in every county of England shall be assigned for the keeping of the peace, one lord, and with him three or four of the most worthy in the county, with some learned in the law, and they shall have power to restrain the offenders, rioters, and all other barators, and to pursue, arrest, take, and chastise them according their trespass or offence; and to cause them to be imprisoned and duly punished according to the law and customs of the realm, and according to that which to them shall seem best to do by their discretions and good advisement; and also to inform them, and to inquire of all those that have been pillors and robbers in the parts beyond theses, and be now come again, and go wandering, and will not labour as they were wont in times past; and to take and arrest all those that they may find I jindictment, or by SOS' pieion, and to put them in prison; and to take of all them that he [not1]

Item, whereas the commons have complained them of escheators, which by colour of their office have seised divers lands and tenements as forfeit to the King for treason surmised in dead persons, which were never attainted of treason in their lives; the King thereof hath good regard; but because he and his progenitors have been seised of the forfeitures of wars of all times, the King will not exclude himself of such right, whereof he found his crown seised, and will continue

Statute the First.

"TN [the1] Parliament holden at A- Westminster the Monday next after the feast of Saint Hillary, the thirteenth year of the reign of King Richard the second after the conquest, our lord the King, to the honour of God and Holy Church, and for the common profit of his liege people of his realm, of the assent of the prelates and lords temporal, and commons, being in the same Parliament, hath ordained and established the things under-written.

First, whereas it is ordained by a statute made the twenty-fifth year of the reign of King Edward the grandfather of our lord the King that now is, that at what time that the King shall make collation or presentment to any benefice in another's right, that the title upon which he groundeth himself shall be well examined that it be true; and at what time before judgement given, the title be found by good information untrue, and not just, the collation or presentment

Of whose contracts the constable hath cognizance.

thereupon made shall be repealed; and notwithstanding the same statute, some of the King’s presentees, by favour of the ordinaries be instituted and inducted in benefices of Holy Church without due process, the parties not warned nor called, and sometime [taken by false inquests favourably,1] and the incumbents in such manner put out; it is ordained and assented, that the said statute be firmly holden and kept; and moreover our lord the King, for the reverence of God and Holy Church, doth will and grant, that if he present to any benefice that is full of any incumbent, that the presentee of the King shall not be received by the ordinary to the benefice, till the King hath recovered his presentment by process of the law in his own court: And if any presentee of the King be otherwise received, and the incumbent put out without due process, as afore is said, the said incumbent shall begin his suit within a year after the induction of the King's presentee [at the least.2]

Item, because that the commons do make a grievous complaint, that the court of the constable and the marshal had incroached to him, and daily doth incroach contracts, covenants, trespasses, debts, and detinues, and many other actions pleadable at the common law, in great prejudice of the King and of his courts, and to the great grievance and oppression of the people; our lord the King, willing to ordain a remedy against the prejudices and grievances aforesaid, hath declared in this Parliament, by the advice and ussent of the lords spiritual and temporal, the power and jurisdiction of the said constable, in the form that followeth: To the Constable it per-taineth to have cognisance of con-

And if any will complain, that any plea be commenced before the constable and marshal, that might be tried by the common law of the land, the same plaintiff shall have a (*) privy seal of the King without difficulty, directed to the said constable and marshal, to surcease in that plea, until it be discussed by the King's council, if that matter ought of right to pertain to that court, or otherwise to be tried by the common law of the realm of England, and also that they surcease in the mean time.

Item, forasmuch as a great and common clamour and complaint hath been oftentimes made before this time, and yet is, for that the admirals and their deputies hold their sessions within divers places of this realm as well within franchise as without, accroaching to them greater authority than belongeth to their office, in prejudice of our lord the King, and the common law of the realm, and in diminishing of dirers franchises, and in destruction and impoverishing of the common people: It is accorded and assented, that the admirals and their deputies shall not meddle from henceforth of any thing done within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea, as it hath been used in

pvUR lord the King, at his Parlia-^ ment holden at Westminster the Monday next after the feast of Saint Hillary, the thirteenth year of his reign, hearing the grievous complaint of his said commons in the same Parliament, of the outrageous mischiefs and damages which have happened to his said realm, for that treasons, murders, and rapes of women be commoriy done and committed, and the more because charters of pardon have been easily granted in such cases; the said commons requested our lord the King, that such charters might not be granted; [to whom2] the King answered, that he will save his liberty and regality, as his progenitors have done heretofore;

Our lord the King seeing the mis- The causes and chiefs and damage before mentioned, and having regard to the said statute statute, made in the time of his said grandfather, and to the causes contained in the same; which statute holdeth always his force, and was never defeated nor adnulled in any point, and by so much as he is bounden by his oath to cause the same to be kept as the law of his realm, though that by sufferance and negligence it hath been sithence attempted to the contrary; also having regard to the grievous complaints made to him by his people in divers his Parliaments holden heretofore, willing to ordain remedy for the great damages and mischiefs which have happened, and daily do happen to the Church of England by the said cause; by the assent of all the great men and the commonalty of the said realm, to the honour of God, and profit of the said Church of England, and of all his realm, hath ordained and stablished, that the free elections Elections of of archbishops, bishops, and all other dignities and benefices elective in of the Church

Item, whereas in an article of a statute made in the Parliament holden at Westminster, the Monday next after the feast of St. Hillary, the thirteenth year of the [reign2] that now is, it waS ordained and granted, that no charter of pardon from thence should be allowed before any justices, for murder, death of a man slain by await, assault, or malice prepensed, treason, or rape of a woman, if [it8] were not specified in the same charter. And if any charter of the death of man were alledged before any justices, in which charter was not specified, that he of whose death any such was arraigned, was murthered, or slain by await, assault, or malice prepensed, the justices should inquire, by a good inquest of the visne where the dead person was slain, if he were murthered or slain by await, assault, or malice prepensed, and if they should find that he was murdered or slain by await, assault, or malice prepensed, the charter should be disallowed, and moreover done as the law should require; which things our lord the King doth will and grant, that they shall be firmly holden and kept: And moreover, by the assent of the lords in this present Parliament, and at the prayer of the commons, he hath ordained and granted, that the residue of the said article shall be wholly out, repealed, and adnulled;

Saving as to the master of the Mint

in the second year of the reign of King Heniy the sixth after the conquest, by the advice and assent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and at the special instance and request of the commons of England being in the same Parliament, certain ordinances, declarations and statutes were made and stablished to the honour of God, and for the wealth of the King and of his realm, in the form following.

First, that Holy Church, and all the lords spiritual and temporal, and all other the King’s people, having liberties and franchises, and also all the cities and boroughs shall have and enjoy all their liberties and franchises well used, and not repealed, nor by the common law repealable.

Item, forasmuch as great scarcity of white money is within the realm, because that silver is bought and sold not coined, at the price of xxxij s. the pound of troy, whereas the same pound is no more of value at the coin than xxxij. s. abated for the coinage twelve-pence; it is ordained and established, for the increase of (1) white money, that no man, of what estate or condition that he be within [the1] realm, shall buy or sell no silver in plate [piecea] nor in masse, being as good of allay as the sterling, above thirty shillings the pound of troy, over the fashion, upon the pain of forfeiture of the double value of as much as he buyeth or selleth contrary to this ordinance; and that the one half be forfeit to the King’s use, and the other half to the use of him that will sue and prove the same forfeiture. Provided always, that they which go to the coin, may have and take of the master of the same coin, according as is lawfully contained in the indentures thereof made betwixt the King and him; and also the master of the said Mint for the time being, may take and deliver as is contained in the said indentures, without taking more, for the ease and profit of the common people. |Rep., 21 Ja. 1. c. 28. s. ll.J

Bang of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, in his Parliament holden at Westminster the morrow after Saint Matthew the Apostle, the eighth year of his reign, by the advice and assent of the prelates (1) and great men of his realm of England, and at the special request and assent of the commons of the same realm, being in the said Parliament, hath made certain statutes and ordinances for the common profit of the said realm, and especially for the good and wholesome government and due execution of the law to be had in the same, in the form following.

First, because the prelates and I. clergy of the realm of England called to the Convocation, and their servants tion and 1 2

and familiars that come with them to such Convocation, oftentimes and commonly be arrested, molested, and inquieted; our said lord the King willing graciously in this behalf to provide for the security and quietness of the said prelates and clergy, at the supplication of the same prelates and clergy, and by the assent of the (}) great men and commons aforesaid, hath ordained and established, that [all1 2 3] the clergy hereafter to be called to the Convocation by the King's writ, and their servants and familiars, shall for ever hereafter fully use and enjoy such liberty or [defence *] in coming, tarrying, and returning, as the (4) great men and commonalty of the realm of England, called or to be called to the King’s Parliament, do enjoy, and were wont to enjoy, or in time to come ought to enjoy.

* # # * # * Item, whereas the elections of knights of shires (5) to come to the Parliaments of [our lord] the King, in many counties of [the realm of] England, have now of late been made by very great, [outrageous,] and excessive number of people dwelling within the same counties [of the realm of England,] of the which most part was [of6] people of small substance, [and7] of no value, whereof every of them pretended a voice equivalent, as to such elections to be made, with the most worthy knights and esquires dwelling within the same counties; whereby manslaughters, riots, batteries, and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties, shall very likely rise and be, unless convenient [and due] remedy be provided in this

Item, our lord the Bang considering how divers persons for their private revenge, and not of right, maliciously by subtile imagination have caused and procured many of his faithful liege people falsely to be indicted and appealed of several treasons, felonies, and trespasses, before justices of the peace, and other commissioners and justices, and others having power to take indictments or appeals in divers foreign counties, liberties, and franchises of England, in which the said lieges be not, nor at any time were, conversant nor dwelling; by force of which indictments and appeals, and the processes upon them made in the said counties, franchises, and liberties, the said persons so indicted have been, and daily be put in exigent, and after outlawed, and thereupon their goods and chattels lands and tenements forfeit, and they in great jeopardy, of their lives, whereas the said persons so indicted, appealed, or put in exigent or outlawed, had never knowledge of such indictments, appeals, exigents, or outlawries; which falsehood and malice daily doth abound and increase in divers counties, liberties, and franchises of England, in great hinderance, loss, and perpetual destruction of many of his said faithful and innocent liege people, and very likely to increase hereafter, if convenient remedy be not ordained and provided in this behalf: And therefore the same our lord the King, of his special grace, and by authority of this Parliament, for ease (l) and tranquillity of his faithful lieges of this realm, hath caused to be ordained and stablished, that upon every indictment or appeal by the which any of the said lieges dwelling in other counties than there where such indictment or appeal is or shall

First, whereas by a Statute made

at Westminster in the twenty-third year of the reign of King Henry, late in deed and not of right King of England, called King Henry the Sixth (1) it was ordained, that no sheriff should occupy his office of sheriff above a year, upon pain of two hundred pounds, except certain persons in the said statute excepted; as in the same is more plainly specified; divers and many of the King’s liege people have been grievously indamaged, and greatly delayed of their suits and processes every year, in the term called Michaelmas term, as for their actions, writs, and precepts to be returned within the same term, after the sixth day of the month of November, [because that2] the Kings letters patents whereby any (s) sheriff is made, do most commonly bear date the sixth day of November; and [though it so be4] that new sheriffs

* Parliament was continued by divers prorogations and adjournments, from 6 October 12 Edw. IV. A.D. 1472. to 14 March 15 Edw. IV. A.D. 1474-5. The petitions, on which this Statute 12 Edw. IV. was framed, are entered in English on Memb. 7. of the Parliament-Roll 14 Edw. IV. nu. 45. to nu. 53.

f The French text of these statutes from hence to the end of 22 Edw. IV. was not inserted in any printed collection of the Statutes at large after Pynson’s [circ. 1497], until Cay’s [1758]: In that, and subsequent printed copies, the French text of all those statutes is stated to be taken from MS. Cott. Nero C. I  .; but, on examination, that manuscript appears incorrect in many particulars in which it is printed, as correct, by Cay and subsequent editors. A more perfect copy is found in the Petyt Manuscript Nu. 8. in the Inner Temple library. The corrections in the notes are from both these manuscripts; and, in their default, from the old printed copies; of which the earliest by Maclinia [circ. 1482] is, in the statutes of these years, much the most accurate.

In Lib. Scacc. IVestm. XI. and many other Manuscripts, the statutes of these years are entered in English, agreeing with the old printed English copies, and in

the Acts contained in the statute, is printed fin the Statutes of the Realm} hum the inrollment on the Roll of Parliament of this year: Such variations as occur in Lib. Scacc. wherewith the old printed copies in general agree, are inserted in the notes.........

{• The beginning, printed here, of the statutes of this year forms no part of chapter I. according to the numbering of the English text in the Statutes of the Realm, and appears therefore not to be included in the repeal of that chapter by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1863.J f In all printed editions this forms part of chapter 1.

It also appears that in all the printed editions the numbers of the several chapters that arc on the roll, (which numbers are adopted in the Statutes of the Realm,) disagree with thu»c on the roll except as to chapters 1-4.1

II. are intituled “ Stat. 1.” “ Stat. 2.” to prevent confusion in reference from the private editions, and in conformity to the ancient method of mating up the statute roll.

neglect of the faithfull execution of such lawes & statutes as have formerly

beene made for the apprehending of rogues and vagabonds and for the good

of the poore For remedy whereof and for the preventing the perishing of any

CHAPTER XI.

An Act to prevent the delivery up of Merchants Shipps, and for the Increase of good and serviceable Shipping.

WHEREAS it often happeneth that masters and commanders of merchants * * shipps doe suffer their shipps to be boarded, and their goods to be taken out by pirates and sea-rovers, notwithstanding they have sufficient force to defend themselves, whereby not onely the merchants are much pjudiced but the honour of the English navigation is thereby much diminished, and merchants discouraged from ladeing their goods on board English shipps to the decay of shipping. In the pservation of which the wealth, honour and safety of this nation is soe much concerned, to which the said masters are incouraged by a practice used towards them by the Turkes and others who after they have taken out the goods as encouragement to masters of shipps to yeild, doe not onely restore the shipp with such goods as are claimed by the masters or seamen but many times pay unto the masters all or some part of the freight, which hath many times caused suspition of treachery in the said masters to the great dishonour of the English nation. For the pvention thereof for the future and for the better incouragement to merchants as well foreigners as English to freight and use English shipps bee it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majestie by and with the advice and consent of the lords spirituall and temporall and commons assembled in Parlyament and by authoritie of the same that where any goods or merchandices shall be laden on board [any1] English shipp, which shipp shall be of the burthen of two hundred tunns or upwards and mounted with sixteene gunns or more, if the master or commander shall yeild up the said goods to any Turkish shipps or vessells, or to any pirates or sea rovers whatsoever without fighting, that then and in such case the master shall upon proofe thereof made in the High Court of Admiraltie be from thenceforth incapeable of takeing charge of any English shipp or vessell as master or commander thereof. And if he shall at any time thereafter presume to take upon him to command any English shipp or vessel], he shall suffer imprisonment by warrant from the said court dureing the space of six months for every such offence; and in case the persons soe takeing the said goods shall release give backe or lett passe (8 ) the said shipp shall pay unto the said master any summe or summes of money, or any goods in lieu of money for freight or other reward or gift, that in all or any such cases the said goods or money soe given or the value thereof, as alsoe the masters part of such shipp her tackle, apparell and furniture soe released, given backe or lett. passe, out of which the said goods were taken shall be lyeable to repaire the persons whose goods were soe delivered or taken by action in the High Court of Admiralty, and in case the commanders or masters part of the shipp, tackle, apparell and furniture together with such money and goods given as aforesaid shall not be sufficient to repaire all the dammages sustained, then the reparations to be recovered on the toasters or commanders part of the shipp to be divided pro rata amongst the p^fsehs prosecuting and proveing their damages, and the persons damaged to have their action against the master for the remainder.

And bee it further enacted by the authoritie aforesaid that noe master of any such English shipp as aforesaid being at sea, and haveing discovered any

shipp to be a Turkish shipp, pirate or sea rover shall depart out of his shipp upon any ptence whatsoever least by his detention on board any such shipp the safety of his owne shipp be hazarded.

And bee it further enacted that if the master of any English shipp or vessell though not of the burthen of two hundred tunns or mounted with sixteene gunns as aforesaid shall yeild his shipp unto any Turkish shipp, pirate or sea rover (not haveing at the least his double number of gunns) without fighting, every such master shall be lyeable to all and every the penaltyes in this Act contained.

And bee it further enacted by the authoritie aforesaid that upon processe made out of the High Court of Admiralty, it shall and may be lawfull to and for all commanders of his Majestyes shipps of warr or the commanders of any other English shipps to seize such shipps or masters soe offending according to the said processe in such case to be issued, and the same to bring or send in custody into any ports of His Majestyes dominions there to be proceeded against according to the intent and meaning of this Act.

Provided that none be hereby encouraged to violate the rights of the ports of any forreigne prince or state in amity with the Kings Majestie.

And bee it further enacted by the authoritie aforesaid that if the marriners or inferiour officers of any English shipp laden with goods and merchandices as aforesaid shall decline or refuse to fight and defend the shipp when they shall be thereunto commanded by the master or commander thereof, or shall utter any words to discourage the other marriners from defending the shipp, that every marriner who shall be found guilty of declineing or refuseing as aforesaid shall loose all his wages due to him together with such goods as he hath in his shipp, and suffer imprisonment not exceeding the space of six monthes and shall dureing such time be kepte to hard labour for his or their maintenance.

Provided alwayes that if any shipp shall have beene yeilded as aforesaid

contrary to the will and endeavour of the master or commander by the

disobedience of the marriners, testifyed by their haveing laid violent hands

on him. That in such case the master or commander shall not be lyable to

the sentence of incapacity as aforesaid, nor to any action for the losses

sustained by the merchants unlesse he shall have received backe from the

takers thereof his shipp, or some recompence gift or reward as aforesaid.

# #'# * * * # * *

And for the better encouragement to captaines, masters officers and seamen to defend their shipp bee it enacted by the authority aforesaid that when any English shipp shall have beene defended by fight and brought to her designed port, in which fight any of the officers or seamen shall have beene wounded it shall and may be lawfull to and for the judge of his Majestyes High Court* of Admiralty or his surrogate or the judge of the Vice-Admiralty, within which the shipp shall arrive at her retume upon petition of the master or seamen of such shipp soe defended as aforesaid to call unto him such and soe many as he shall be informed to be adventurers or owners of the shipp and goods soe defended, and by advice with them to raise and leavy upon the respective owners and adventurers by processe out of the said court such summe or summes of money as himselfe with the major part of the adventurers or owners then present shall judge reasonable not exceeding the value of two per cent of the shipp and goods soe defended according to the first cost of the goods to be made appeare by the envoice (which the owner or his factor or correspondent

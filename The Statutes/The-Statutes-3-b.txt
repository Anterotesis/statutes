THE STATUTES (revised) - 1

INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD VOLUME.

The present volume embraces the period from the 11th year of George the Third (A.D. 1770) to the end of the last Parliament of Great Britain in the 41st year of that reign (A.D. 1800); and shows the effect of repeals to the Session of 1871 (34 & 35 Vict.) inclusive. The volume is somewhat smaller in bulk than the approved standard of the edition; but it appeared convenient that it should conclude at a marked epoch in the history of our statute law, — the Union of Ireland with Great Britain, — and that the legislation of the United Kingdom should be entered upon in a fresh volume.

As an exception to the rule of printing all enactments not actually repealed, the Editor has been authorised, as in the case of the preceding volume, to omit certain enactments, included, with a view to their immediate repeal, in a Bill, following the series of expurgatory Acts already passed, which has been laid before Parliament in the present Session. These enactments are described in the Chronological Table prefixed to this volume as Virtually Repealed. Among them are certain Acts, and parts of Acts, relating to the constitution and powers of the East India Company, as it existed before the passing of the 21 & 22 Vict. c. 106. It is understood that a complete revision, with a view to an extensive repeal, of the Statutes relating to India, has been undertaken by the East Indian Executive, and that a Bill to carry it into effect will be submitted to Parliament at an early date. Had such a Bill been passed antecedently to the present publication, a considerable quantity of matter, which is obsolete or superseded, might advantageously have been omitted from these pages. But the Editor did not think himself warranted either in anticipating the action of the Legislature in this respect, or in delaying for an uncertain period the publication of this portion of the Revised Statutes.

The text followed in the present volume is that of the original King's Printers' copies of the Acts. The marginal notes, however, have been revised throughout, so as to bring them into more exact accordance with the text.

In other respects the work has been conducted on the same plan as that already described, and by the same Editor and assistants as the preceding volume.

At the next ensuing general election^nstead of 24,there shall be chosen 6 directors for the term of one year; 6 for two years; 6 for three years;

6 for four years; and yearly hereafter, 6 for four years.

All transfers made in a collusive manner, to qualify voters at elections,

CHAPTER LXIII.

An Act for establishing certain Regulations for the better Management of the Affairs of the East India Company, as well in India as in Europe.

WHEREAS the several powers and authorities granted by charters to the * United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies have been found by experience not to have sufficient force and efficacy to prevent various abuses which have prevailed in the government and administration of the affairs of the said united company, as well at home as in India, to the manifest injury of the publick credit, and of the commercial interests of the said company; and it is therefore become highly expedient that certain further regulations better adapted to their present circumstances and condition should be provided and established: And whereas the electing and chusing of directors of the said united company every year, in such manner as at present prescribed by charter, has not answered the good purposes intended thereby, but on the contrary, by limiting the duration of their office to so short a time, evidently tends to weaken the authority of the court of directors and to produce instability in [the councils and measures of the said company: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that at the next ensuing general election of directors of the said united company, instead of an election of twenty-four directors to serve for the space of one year only, there shall be chosen, in such manner and order as the directors of the said united company for the time being shall appoint, six directors expressly for the term of one year, and six other directors for the term of two years, and six other directors for the term of three years, and the remaining six directors for the term of four years, and not otherwise; and from thenceforth yearly and every year, and at the expiration of each and every of the said terms respectively, six new directors and no more shall be chosen from time to time in the place of such directors whose term shall have expired, and who are hereby declared incapable of being then rechosen; and at every subsequent election during the continuance of the charter of the said united company, six new directors shall be chosen and shall continue to be directors for the term of four years and no longer, to be accounted from the day on which the election of such directors was respectively made; and in case the office and authority of any such director shall become void by death, removal or otherwise, another shall be chosen from time to time in his place, to serve as a director during the remainder of such term for which the person whose office shall have become void was chosen, and no longer.

[III.] And whereas it has been found that the provision made by the charter of the tenth year of the reign of King William the Third, under which persons possessed of five hundred pounds stock are intitled to vote in general courts, has been productive of much inconvenience in the present situation of the company, and tends to promote the mischievous practice of making collusive transfers, which practice hath not been sufficiently prevented

13 George III. c. 63.

39

by the provision made by an Act of the seventh year of his present Majesty's reign, whereby the right of voting is limited to persons having been six calendar months in possession of their stock; Be it farther enacted, that all transfers of stocks whatsoever made to any person or persons in any fraudulent or collusive manner on purpose to qualify him, her or them to give his, her or their vote or votes at any election of members of the court of directors, or in any general court of the said united company (subject nevertheless to conditions or agreements, either verbal or in writing, to defeat or determine such transfers, or to retransfer or return the same), shall be deemed and taken against those persons who transferred the same as free and absolute, and be holden and enjoyed by all and every such person or persons to whom such transfer shall be made as aforesaid, freely and absolutely acquitted, exonerated and discharged of and from all manner of trusts, conditions, powers of revocation, provisoes of redemption, or other defeazances between or with the said parties, or any other person or persons in trust for them; and that all bonds, covenants, notes collateral or other securities, contracts or agreements between or with the said parties, or any other person or persons in trust for them or any of them, for the retransferring, redeeming, revoking or defeating such transfer, or for the restoring or retransferring thereof or any part thereof, to any person or persons who made such transfer, or to any other person or persons in trust for them or any of them, shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever: And that every person to whom such transfer shall have been made, and who shall have voted by virtue thereof at any election of members of the court of directors, or in any general court of the said united company, and who shall afterwards retransfer or return the same, in consequence of any trust, condition, powers of revocation, proviso of redemption or other defeazance whatsoever as aforesaid, shall for every such offence forfeit the sum of one thousand pounds, one moiety whereof shall go and be disposed of to any person who shall sue for the same, and the other moiety to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, to be recovered, together with full costs of suit, by action of debt, bill, plaint or information, in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, wherein no essoin, privilege, protection, wager of law, or more than one imparlance, shall be admitted or allowed: And that from and after the first day of October one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, no member or proprietor of the said united company shall be deemed qualified or capable to vote, or be admitted to give any vote or votes, at any election of directors) or at any general court of the said united company, in respect of any stock amounting to less than one thousand pounds, nor in respect of any stock transferred to him, her or them, after the said first day of October one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, until he, she or they shall have been possessed of such stock twelve calendar months, in his, her or their own right, and not in trust for any other person or persons whatsoever, freed and discharged of all incumbrances which can or may affect the same, unless such stock shall have been acquired, or shall have come to such proprietor by bequest, or by marriage, or by succession to any intestate's estates, or by the custom of the city of London, or by any deed of settlement after the death of any person who shall have been intitled for life to the dividends of such stock, any law, statute or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

and after Oct.

1,1773, no proprietor shall vote at any election of directors in respect of stock amounting to less than 1,000/., nor until he shall have been possessed of such stock 12 calendar months, unless entitled by bequest, &c.

[XXI.] And whereas the improvement of the breed of sheep is a matter of great national importance, and the turning of rams upon wastes and open common fields at certain times of the year has been found to be very prejudicial: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no ram shall be turned upon or be suffered to remain upon any wastes or common fields between the twenty-fifth day of August and the twenty-fifth day of November in every year.

An Act for the more effectual preventing Frauds and Embezzlements by-Persons employed in the Woollen Manufactory.

WHEREAS frauds are frequently committed and embezzlements made by persons employed in the woollen manufactory, particularly by their secreting, selling or otherwise illegally disposing of the working tools and materials they are intrusted with, by the weavers taking the biers out of the chains and withholding part of the woof or abb yam delivered to them, and by the pickers, scribblers and spinners embezzlemg part of the wool and yam intrusted to them, and also by damping, steaming and watering the residue in order to make up the deficiency in weight occasioned by such embezzlements, and also by taking off, picking or cutting out the list, forrel or other marks of any piece or pieces of cloth, by means whereof the clothiers sustain great damage and loss: And whereas the abuses committed in the cloathing manufacture by persons carrying, collecting, buying and receiving from the labourers employed in that manufacture ends of yam, wefts, thrumbs, short yam and other refuse of cloth, drugget and other woollen goods and goods mixed with wool, have been found very detrimental to the said manufactures; and the said frauds and abuses are frequently carried on and committed so secretly that the laws now in being are by no means sufficient to prevent the same, whereby persons employed in the said manufacture are tempted and encouraged to embezzle, purloin, secrete, sell and detain the goods and materials with which they are intrusted by the clothiers and other woollen manufacturers, so that the cloth made comes out defective in the substance, perfection and excellence intended by the clothier, to the discredit of the manufacturer and injury of the publick: And whereas it is apprehended such frauds and embezzlements would not be so frequent if the detection and punishment of the said offences were made more easy and certain: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that if any picker, scribbler, spinner or weaver or other person or persons whatsoever who shall be any-ways employed in or about the making or manufacturing of woollen cloth, or in preparing materials for that purpose, shall not return all working tools or voi* m. e

shall appear to such justices that the person or persons so charged hath or have been already convicted of the like offence for *which he, she or they is or are then charged, that then such justices shall not proceed to convict such person or persons, but shall commit him, her or them to the house of correction or some other publick prison, there to remain until the next general or general quarter sessions of the peace to be held in and for the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place where the offence shall have been committed, or until such offender or offenders shall have entered into a recognizance to answer for such offence at the said next general or general quarter sessions; and the justices in such general or general quarter sessions are hereby authorised and required to take cognizance thereof, and to hear and determine the same; and if such person shall be convicted upon the oath or (being of the people called Quakers) upon the affirmation of one or more credible witness or witnesses, the person so convicted shall forfeit and pay for such offence any sum not more than one hundred pounds nor less than fifty pounds, as the said justices shall judge to be most proper; and every such penalty shall be applied and disposed of under the direction of the said justices in their general or general quarter sessions in such manner and proportions as the penalty herein-before imposed for the first offence of the like nature is by this Act directed to be applied and disposed of; and if such penalty shall not be paid on conviction, the said justices shall commit the person so convicted to the house of correction or other publick prison, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not more than six months nor less than three months, as the said justices shall in their discretion think fit, unless such penalty shall be sooner paid; or the said justices may send the person convicted to the house of correction or other publick prison, there to remain for three days exclusive of the day of commitment, with an order that within the said time such person shall be once publickly whipped at such market-place or other publick place as aforesaid.

[V.] And whereas many frauds are practised in respect to such materials as aforesaid by persons who sell them knowing them to have been purloined or embezzled: Be it therefore further enacted, that after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, if any person shall sell, pawn, pledge, exchange or otherwise unlawfully dispose of, or offer to sell, pawn, pledge, exchange or otherwise unlawfully dispose of, any such materials as aforesaid, whether wrought or unwrought, mixed or unmixed, knowing them to have been purloined or embezzled, every such person lawfully convicted shall be liable to the same punishment as he or she would be liable to by virtue of this Act on being convicted of receiving purloined or embezzled materials, knowing them to have been purloined or embezzled.

[VI.] And whereas such materials as aforesaid which have been purloined or embezzled are frequently received by persons knowing the same to have been so purloined or embezzled,.and such materials being afterwards worked up or otherwise disposed of renders it difficult to convict such offenders: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, when any person or persons shall be brought or charged upon oath before any two or more justices of the peace, by virtue of this Act, with being suspected of or with having purloined or embezzled, or with having received any such

materials as aforesaid, *whether the same be wrought or unwrought, mixed or unmixed, knowing the same to have been either purloined or embezzled, or received from some person or persons not intitled to dispose thereof, and it shall be made appear upon the oath, or (being of the people called Quakers) upon the affirmation of one or more credible witness or witnesses to the satisfaction of such justices, that such person or persons hath or have purloined or embezzled, or hath or have received any such materials as aforesaid, knowing the same to have been purloined or embezzled, or received from some person or persons not intitled to dispose thereof, it shall and may be lawful for such justices, or for the justices at their general or general quarter sessions of the peace, and they are hereby respectively authorized and impowered (if they shall think fit) to convict such person or persons of having purloined or embezzled or of having received such materials as aforesaid, knowing the same to have been purloined or embezzled, or received from some person or persons not intitled to dispose thereof, although no proof shall be given to whom such materials belong; and the person or persons so convicted shall for every such offence be subject to such and the like penalties and punishments at the discretion of such justices respectively as persons convicted of buying or receiving any such materials as aforesaid, knowing the same to have been purloined or embezzled, are by this Act subject and liable to.

[VII.] And whereas by the said recited Act of the twenty-second of King Act 22 Geo. 2 George the Second it was also enacted, that if any person or persons intrusted 7'

with any of the materials therein and herein-before mentioned, in order to prepare, work-up or manufacture the same, should not use all such materials in the preparing, working-up or manufacturing of the same, and should neglect or delay, for the space of twenty-one days after such materials should be prepared, worked-up or manufactured, to return (if required by the owner or owners of such materials so to do) so much of the said materials as should not be used as aforesaid to the person or persons intrusting him, her or them therewith, such neglect or delay should be deemed a purloining or embezzling of such materials; and the person or persons so neglecting or delaying, being thereof convicted in manner therein-before prescribed for the conviction of offenders against the said Act, should suffer the like punishment as persons convicted of purloining or embezzling any of the materials therein-before mentioned are by the said Act rendered subject and liable to: And whereas the space of twenty-one days allowed by the said recited Act is thought too long a time to be allowed for returning the said materials under the circumstances and in manner aforesaid, and it may be proper to make the punishment for not returning such materials the same as for purloining or embezzling under this Act: Be it therefore further enacted, that from and after the said and altered, first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, so much of the said recited Act as allows twenty-one days after the preparing, working-up or manufacturing the said materials for returning so much of the said materials as shall not be used in such preparing, working-up or manufacturing, and declares that the punishment for not so returning the said materials within the said time shall be the same as under the said Act is directed for purloining or embezzling, shall be repealed, and only eight days shall be allowed for returning the said materials in manner aforesaid, and the punishment for not returning them within the said eight days shall

Sect [9.] of the said Act recited,

and repealed.

Any person being employed to work up materials, who shall neglect to perform the same for 8 days, &c., shall be sent to the house of correction.

If any person shall receive any materials to be manufactured in a fictitious name, or shall deliver the some to any other person without the consent of the owner, &c., he shall be liable

be the same as is by this Act directed to be inflicted for purloining or embezzling.

[VIII.] A_nd whereas by the said Act of the twenty-second year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second it is enacted, that from and after the said twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and forty-nine, if any person who should be hired, retained or employed to prepare or work up any of the manufactures therein-before mentioned for any one master should neglect or refuse the performance thereof by procuring or permitting himself or herself to be subsequently retained or employed by any other master or person whatsoever, before he or she should have completed the work which he or she was first and originally so hired, retained or employed to perform, and which was first delivered to him or her, then and in every such case the person so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted by the oath or (being of the people called Quakers) affirmation of one or more credible witness or witnesses before one or more justice or justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place where the offence or offences should be committed, should be sent to the house of correction, there to be kept to bard labour for any time not exceeding one month: And whereas the said provision contained in the said recited clause is not found sufficient for the purpose intended, and it is apprehended that some other provision more proper may be made: Be it therefore further enacted, that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven the whole of the said last-recited clause shall be repealed; and that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, if any person being hired, retained or employed to prepare or work up any materials, whether mixed or unmixed, for any master or masters, shall wilfully neglect or refuse the performance thereof for eight days successively, or having taken in any materials, whether mixed or unmixed, for manufacture from one master, or two or more masters being co-partners, shall afterwards take in any materials, whether mixed or unmixed, for manufacture from any other master or masters, or shall procure or permit himself or herself to be employed or retained in any other occupation or employment whatsoever sooner than eight days before the completion of the work first taken, then in every such case such person being thereof lawfully convicted by the oath or (being of the people called Quakers) affirmation of one or more credible witness or witnesses before two or more justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place where the offence or offences shall be committed, shall be sent to the house of correction or other publick prison, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding three months nor less than one month.

[IX.] And whereas it frequently happens that persons receive the said materials in fictitious names in order to be manufactured, and that persons receive such materials in their own names in order to be manufactured by themselves, and afterwards deliver the same to others to be manufactured, without the knowledge or consent of the owners thereof, and that carriers or other persons employed to deliver materials to workmen to be prepared or manufactured do designedly deliver such materials to other persons than those intended by the owner of such materials: Be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said first day of July one

123

thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, if any person shall receive any of the aforesaid materials in a fictitious name in order to be manufactured, or if any person shall receive in his or her own name any of the said materials in order to be manufactured by himself or herself, and afterwards deliver the same or any part thereof to any other person to be manufactured (without the consent of the owner thereof), or if any carrier or other person employed to deliver any such materials to any workman to be prepared or wrought up shall designedly deliver the same to any other person than the person to whom such materials were ordered or intended to be delivered by the owner thereof, all and every person and persons offending in any of the cases aforesaid shall for every such offence be liable to prosecution in the same manner and to the same punishment as is by this Act directed in respect to persons taking in any of the said materials in order to work up, and afterwards wilfully neglecting or refusing the performance of their work for the space of time aforesaid.

[X.] And whereas it frequently happens that materials used in the manufactures before mentioned are found or known to be concealed in the possession of persons who have received the same, knowing them to be purloined or embezzled, or of persons known not to be entitled to dispose of the same: And whereas the discovery and conviction of the purloiners and embezzlers, buyers and receivers of such materials is full of difficulty from the close and clandestine manner in which the offence is committed, and there is still greater difficulty in proving whose property such materials are, and it would tend to the discouragement and suppression of such offences if the discovery and conviction of such offenders were rendered more easy: And whereas by the ' said recited Act of the twenty-second year of his late Majesty King George the Second, justices of the peace, after conviction of any offender for purloining or embezzling the said materials or for buying or receiving the same, are authorised to grant warrants for searching the houses and other places of the persons so convicted, but no such authority is given before conviction, nor in any other house or place except such as belongs to a person convicted: Be it therefore further enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for any two justices of the peace of any county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, upon complaint made to them upon oath by any one credible person, or (being of the people called Quakers) upon solemn affirmation, that there is cause to suspect that any such purloined or embezzled materials, whether mixed or unmixed, wrought or unwrought, are concealed in any dwelling-house, outhouse, yard, garden or other place or places, by virtue of a warrant under their hands and seals to cause every such dwelling-house, out-house, yard, garden or place to be searched in the day-time; and if any such materials suspected to be purloined or embezzled shall be found therein, to cause the same, and the person or persons in whose house, out-house, yard, garden or other place the same shall be found, to be brought before any two justices of the peace for the same county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place; and if the said person or persons shall not give an account to the satisfaction of such justices how he, she or they came by the same, then the said person or persons so offending shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished in manner herein-after mentioned, although no proof shall be given to whom such materials belong.

to the same punishment as persons neglecting to perform their work, &c.

[XII.] Provided always, and be it further enacted, that in either of the two cases last before mentioned, when any person or persons who shall be brought before any two justices of the peace shall request of such justices to appoint a reasonable time to produce the person or persons duly intitled to sell or dispose of the same of or from whom he, she or they bought or received the same, or some one or more credible witness or witnesses to prove the sale or delivery thereof, then and in such case it shall and may be lawful for the said justices, and they are hereby authorized and required to appoint such reasonable time as aforesaid, and to issue out a summons to the constable or other peace officer of the parish or place where such person or persons, or such witness or witnesses, shall respectively reside, requiring him, her or them to appear before two or more justices, at such time and place as shall be so appointed by such justices, in order to be examined and give evidence on oath or (being of the people called Quakers) solemn affirmation of the several matters aforesaid; but such person or persons, at the time of making such request, shall enter into a recognizance, with or -without surety or sureties, as such justices shall think proper, for his, her or their appearance before them, at the time so to be set, or for want of such recognizance as aforesaid shall be committed until the time that shall be set or appointed by the said justices for the appearance of such party or parties, witness or witnesses; and if at such appointed time such person or persons shall be convicted of any of the offences aforesaid, then and in such case he, she or they shall suffer such punishment as is herein-before directed to be inflicted on persons guilty of such offences.

[XIII.] And be it further enacted, that where any person or persons shall be convicted of a misdemeanor in either of the two cases last before mentioned, it shall and may be lawful for the justices before whom the conviction shall

be to cause the said materials so found or seized as aforesaid to be deposited in the hands of the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of the place where such materials shall be found or seized, or in any other convenient place, for any time not exceeding thirty days, and in the mean time to order the said churchwardens and overseers of the poor, or one of them, to insert an advertisement in some one or more of the publick newspapers usually published or circulated in or near such place, or otherwise to cause notice to be given by some publick crier, and by fixing on the church or chapel door notice describing such materials, and where the same are so deposited, to the end that persons having lost such materials, or any reputable person or persons in their behalf, may come and claim the same: And in case any person or persons can prove his, her or their property in the said materials upon oath, or (being of the people called Quakers) upon his, her or their solemn affirmation, to the satisfaction of any two justices of the peace for such county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, then such justices shall order restitution of such materials to the owner or owners thereof, after paying the reasonable charges of removing, depositing and giving publick notice of the same; but if before the end of the said thirty days no person or persons shall come and prove his, her or their property in such materials, nor any reputable person or persons on his, her or their behalf, then the said justices shall order and direct the same to be sold for the best price that can reasonably be had, and after deducting such charges as aforesaid, together with the charges of sale, one moiety of the money arising from such sale shall be given to the person or persons or either of them who shall apprehend or prosecute the offender or offenders guilty of either of the misdemeanors aforesaid, as the said justices shall appoint, and the other moiety thereof either to and amongst the poor of the parish, town, or place where the conviction shall be, or to such publick charity or charities as the justices convicting shall appoint.

[XIV.] And be it further enacted, that every person deemed and adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor in having in his or her possession any materials suspected to be purloined or embezzled, and not producing the party or parties being duly intitled to dispose of the same, of whom he or she bought or received the same, nor giving a satisfactory account how he or she came by the same, or of a misdemeanor in having, carrying or conveying of the said materials suspected to be purloined or embezzled, and not producing the party or parties being duly intitled to dispose of the same, of whom he or she bought or received the same, nor any credible witness to testify upon oath or (being of the people called Quakers) upon solemn affirmation the sale or delivery thereof, nor giving a satisfactory account how he or she came by the same (as the case shall be), shall for every such misdemeanor forfeit for the first offence the sum of twenty pounds, and for the second offence the sum of thirty pounds, and for every subsequent offence the sum of forty pounds; all which said respective forfeitures shall and may be levied by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of every such offender (rendering to him or her the overplus, after charges of the said distress and sale deducted), by warrant under the hands and seals of the justices before whom such offender shall be deemed and adjudged guilty; of which forfeiture one moiety shall be paid to the informer and the other moiety thereof to and amongst the poor of the parish, town or place where

aforesaid, the materials so found may be deposited in the hands of the churchwardens, &c.

such conviction shall be, or to such publick charity or charities as the justices convicting shall appoint; and if no sufficient distress shall be found whereon to levy the said respective forfeitures, then the said justices shall and may commit every such offender so respectively deemed and adjudged guilty as aforesaid to the common gaol or other prison or house of correction within his or their jurisdiction, without bail or mainprize, for the space of one month for the first offence, and for the second offence for the space of two months, and for every subsequent offence for the space of six months.

[XV.] And whereas it sometimes happens, by occasion of the very long detention of such materials as aforesaid delivered out to journeymen or other persons employed to work up the same, it cannot be known to the master or owners of such materials whether the same may have been purloined or embezzled, or whether the said materials are wholly or in part wrought or begun to be wrought, or in what state or condition such materials may be: For remedy whereof, be it further enacted, that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, it shall be lawful for the owner or owners of any such materials from time to time as occasion shall require to demand entrance, and enter at all seasonable hours in the day-time into the shops or outhouses of any person or persons employed by him or them to work up any of the said materials, or other place or places where the work shall be carried on, and there to inspect the state and condition of such materials; and in case of refusal by any stich person or persons so employed to permit such entrance or inspection, he, she or they so refusing shall forfeit and pay such sum of money, not exceeding forty shillings nor less than ten shillings, as the justices before whom he, she or they shall be convicted shall think proper, to be recovered and applied in the same manner as is by this Act directed for the misdemeanor of being in the possession of any such materials without being able to account satisfactorily for such possession.

[XVI.] And whereas the said recited Act of the twenty-second year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second contains no provision for the protection and recovery of the tools and implements with which any person or persons employed in preparing, working up or manufacturing such materials as aforesaid shall be entrusted for that purpose, nor any provision in respect to the drugs and ingredients used ini dying, preparing or manufacturing such of the said materials as axe usually dyed, prepared or manufactured: Be it therefore enacted, that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, every penalty or punishment directed by, or other provision contained in the said recited Act in respect to the said materials, so far as the said recited Act is not varied by this Act, and all the provisions in this Act contained in respect to the said materials, shall extend and be applicable to any tool or tools, and implement or implements, with which any person or persons shall be entrusted for making, working up or manufacturing the said materials, and also to any drug or drugs, ingredient or ingredients, with which any person or persons shall be entrusted for the purpose of dying, preparing or manufacturing such of the aforesaid materials as are usually dyed, prepared or manufactured, in the same manner as if the said tools and implements, drugs and ingredients, were particularly mentioned both in the said recited Act and in the preceding provisions of this Act.

[XVII.] And whereas journeymen dyers, servants and apprentices frequently abuse the trust reposed in them, by dying goods for their own profit, without the consent of their masters: Be it therefore enacted, that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, if any person hired, retained or employed as a journeyman dyer, or as a servant or apprentice, in the dying of any felt or hat, or any woollen, linen, fustian, cotton, leather, fur, flax, mohair or silk materials, whether the same shall be wrought or unwrought, or shall he mixed or unmixed with other of the said materials, shall, without the consent of the master, person or persons by whom such journeyman, servant or apprentice shall be hired, retained or employed, wilfully dye any of the said materials, whether wrought or unwrought, or mixed or unmixed with other of the said materials, or without such consent shall wilfully receive any such materials as aforesaid for the purpose of dying the same, whether the same shall be dyed or prepared for dying, he or she so guilty of either of the said offences shall for the first offence forfeit the sum of ten shillings, and for the second offence the sum of twenty shillings, and for every subsequent offence the sum of forty shillings; or if any person shall procure any such materials as aforesaid to be dyed by any person so hired, retained or employed as a journeyman, servant or apprentice, without the consent of his or her master or employer, or shall offer any such materials to any such journeyman, servant or apprentice for the purpose aforesaid, he or she so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted by the oath or (being of the people called Quakers) affirmation of one or more credible witness or witnesses, before two or more justices of the peace for the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place where the offence shall be committed, shall for the first offence forfeit the sum of five shillings, and for the second offence the sum of twenty shillings, and for every subsequent offence the sum of four pounds; and each of the said penalties shall be paid to the informer or informers; and in case of nonpayment on conviction, the person so convicted shall be committed, by the justices before whom the conviction shall be, to the common gaol or house of correction, to remain for any time not exceeding one month, as such justices shall order and direct.

[XIX] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful to and for any one justice of the peace of any county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, and he is hereby required, upon complaint to him made upon oath or (if the person complaining be of the people called Quakers) solemn affirmation of any offence committed against this Act within the same county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, to issue his warrant for apprehending and bringing before any two or more justices of the peace of the same county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place the person or persons charged with such offence; and the justices before whom such person or persons shall be brought are hereby authorised and required to hear and determine the matter of such complaint, and to proceed to judgement and conviction thereupon.

And whereas it is thought more proper to give a right of appealing in the case of other orders of any justice or justices of the peace to be made by force of an Act made in the twelfth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First (intituled An Act to prevent unlawful combinations of workmen employed in the woollen manufactures, and for better payment of their wages), and of the said Act, and also in the case of all orders to be made by any justices of the peace under this Act: Be it therefore further enacted, that if any person shall think himself or herself aggrieved by the order or judgement of any two justices before whom he or she shall have been convicted of any of the offences in the said Acts of the twelfth year of the reign of King George the First and the twenty-second year of the reign of King George the Second, or in this Act, such person may appeal,* and the said justices are hereby required to make known to such person, at the time of such conviction, his or her right to appeal, to the next general or general quarter sessions of the peace to be holden for the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place where such conviction shall have been made (such person, at the time of such conviction, giving to such justices notice in writing of his or her intention to appeal, and also entering into a recognizance at the time of such notice with sufficient sureties, conditioned to try such appeal and to abide the judgement of and pay such costs as shall be awarded by the justices at such sessions); but if the person giving such notice of appeal shall not at the time of giving such notice enter into such recognizance as aforesaid, then the justices to whom such notice of appeal shall have been given shall and may commit such person or persons to the house of correction or other publick prison of such county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, there to remain until the said next general or general quarter sessions of the peace to be holden in and for such place, unless such recognizance shall be sooner entered into; and the said justices before whom such conviction shall have been made, or any other two or more justices of the same county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place, are hereby empowered and required to take, and the justices at such sessions are hereby authorised and required, upon due proof made of such notice of appeal, either by the acknowledgment of the justices to whom the same shall have been given or otherwise, to hear and determine the matter of the said appeal, and to award such costs as to them shall appear just and reasonable to be paid by either party: And if upon the hearing of such appeal the judgement of the justices before whom the appellant shall have been convicted shall be affirmed, such appellant shall, within forty-eight hours next after the same shall be so affirmed, suffer such corporal punishment as shall have been directed to be inflicted upon him or her for the offence whereof he or she shall have been convicted, or shall immediately pay the sum which he or she shall have been adjudged to forfeit, together with such costs as the justices in the said sessions shall award to be paid by him or her for defraying the expences sustained by the defendant or defendants in such appeal; or in default of making such payments shall be committed to the common gaol or house of correction in the same manner and for the same

[XXI.] And whereas an Act passed in the twenty-third year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second (intituled An Act for the more effectually punishing of persons convicted of seducing artificers in the manufactures of Great Britain or Ireland out of the dominions of the crown of Great Britain, and to prevent the exportation of utensils made use of in the woollen and silk manufactures from Great Britain or Ireland into foreign parts, and for the more easy and speedy determination of appeals allowed in certain cases by an Act made in the last session of Parliament, relating to persons employed in the several manufactures therein mentioned) prescribes a form for conviction of the several offences mentioned in the said recited Act of the twenty-second of George the Second, but such form is not adapted to the said last-mentioned Act as altered by this Act, and it may be useful to have one general form for the said recited Act of the twenty-second of George the Second and this Act: Be it therefore further enacted, that in respect to all offences which from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven shall be committed against the said recited Act of the twenty-second of George the Second, so much of the said Act of the twenty-third of George the Second as prescribes a form of conviction for offences against the said Act of the twenty-second of George the Second shall be repealed, and that from and after the said first day of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven the justices before whom any offender shall be convicted of any offence either against the said Act of the twenty-second of George the Second, or varied by this Act, or against this Act, shall cause the conviction to be certified to the next general or general quarter session of the peace to be held in and for the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town or place where such conviction was made, to be filed with the records of such sessions; and such conviction shall and may be drawn up and written on parchment, and certified in the following form of words, as far as the name of the person and the nature of the case will admit of; (that is to say,)

An Act to amend such part of an Act made in the Forty-third Year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled " An Act for the Relief of the Poor," as relates to the binding of Parish Apprentices.

WHEREAS in and by an Act made in the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth (intituled An Act for the relief of the poor) it was enacted, that it should be lawful for the churchwardens and overseers therein mentioned, or the greater part of them, by the assent of any two justices of the peace, to bind the children of all such parents who shall not by the said churchwardens and overseers or the greater part of them be thought able to keep and maintain their children, to be apprentices, where they shall see convenient, till such man-child shall come to the age of four and twenty years, and such woman-child to the age of one and twenty years, or day of marriage: And whereas it has been found by experience that the said term respecting men-children is longer than is necessary, and that if such man-child was bound to be an apprentice only till he came to the age of one and twenty years all the benefits intended by the said Act would be preserved, the hardships brought on such parish apprentices by the length of their apprenticeship would be avoided, and the good harmony between master and apprentice would be better maintained: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the passing of this Act, when any man-child shall be bound to be an apprentice by virtue of and under the authority of the said Act made in the forty-third year of Queen Elizabeth, such child shall be bound to be an apprentice for no longer term than till such child shall come to the age of twenty-one years.

Preamble.

WHEUEAS the widows and children of the ministers of the Church, and of the heads, principals and masters in the universities of that part of Great Britain called Scotland, had often been left in indigent circumstances, without any provision for their subsistence or education: And whereas all the charitable designs that had been proposed for the relief of such widows and orphans had proved ineffectual, an Act was made in the seventeenth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George Act 17 Geo. 2. the Second, intituled " An Act for raising and establishing a fund for a provision for the [c. 11.] recited. " widows and children of the ministers of the Church of Scotland, and of the'heads, " principals and masters of the universities of Saint Andrews, Glasgow and Edinburgh," whereby it was enacted, that the said ministers, heads, principals and masters were to pay out of their respective stipends or salaries at their option some one of the annual rates following; that is to say, two pounds twelve shillings and sixpence, three pounds eighteen shillings and nine-pence, five pounds and five shillings, or six pounds eleven shillings and three-pence, of lawful money of Great Britain, to be applied for payment of liferent annuities to the respective widows of such ministers of the said Church, or heads, principals or masters in the universities aforesaid, amounting to ten pounds, fifteen pounds, twenty pounds, or twenty-five pounds of like money, in proportion to such of the aforesaid annual rates as they shall respectively have chosen; and also to the making provision respectively for the children of the said ministers, heads, principals and masters, amounting to the sum of one hundred pounds, one hundred and fifty pounds, two hundred pounds, or two hundred and fifty pounds of like money, and iu the like proportion: And it was further enacted, that the surplus of the aforesaid annual rates, and other sums payable by virtue of the aforesaid Act, were, after payment of the annual expence of management and of the annuities payable to widows and of the provisions payable ta children, to be lent out to the ministers of the Church of Scotland and (o the heads, principals and masters in the aforesaid universities, to the amount of thirty pounds of lawful money to each of them; and that all future surpasses were from time to time to be lent out upon proper security, until the capital The said Act therein mentioned should be made up and completed: And whereas the aforesaid Act amended by was explained and amended by another Act made in the twenty-second year of his Act 22 Geo. 2. ggjd Majesty's reign, in which Act the heads, principals and masters in the uuiversity [c. 21.] of Aberdeen were comprehended upon their own application and petition, and liberty

granted for raising the capital to fifty thousand pounds of lawful money of Great Britain, over and above the sums lent to ministers, heads, principals and masters as aforesaid, making together a stock or fund of eighty thousand pounds of like money: And whereas it hath been found from experience that the granting a loan of thirty

137

pounds to each of the aforesaid ministers, heads, principals and masters has in many instances proved hurtful to their families and to the fund, and that the interest of a larger stock or capital, over and above the aforesaid annual rates and other sums payable for support of the fund, will be necessary for payment of the annual expence when the widows shall have arrived at their maximum: Therefore, and for removing several inconveniencies and difficulties which have arisen in the execution of the aforesaid Acts, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the ministers and elders of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland holden in the month of May one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight, and the trustees in and by the aforesaid Acts appointed for executing the same, after due enquiry has been made into the sentiments of the ministers of the said Church, and of the heads, principals and masters in the said universities, liable in payment of one or other of the aforesaid annual rates, do most humbly beseech your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that every minister who was possessed of a benefice Ministers now in the Church of Scotland, and every person who was possessed of the office of head, in the Church, principal or master in any of the universities of Saint Andrews, Glasgow, Edinburgh ^or^"lue

[c. 19. s. 7.] as to evidence in certain criminal causes;

of law as formerly established, rather than by the summary remedy of appeal to the circuit courts, whereby one branch of business in these circuit courts is greatly abridged, and thereby the continuance of the judges at each circuit town for the space of six days is become unnecessary: And whereas the judges continuing at any circuit town for a longer time than may be necessary for dispatching and finishing the business brought before them is attended with many inconveniencies to the publick, and an unnecessary expence to the judges, jury and whole members of court, as well as the sheriffs and inferior magistrates, who by law are obliged to attend the judges while they continue at the circuit towns: For remedy whereof, may it please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that it shall and may be lawful for the Court of Justiciary, and the said court is hereby authorised and required, at the time of settling and appointing the spring and autumn circuits, that is to say, between the first and twentieth days of March and first and twentieth days of August in each year, by an act or minute to be recorded in the books of adjournal, to declare and determine how long the judge or judges shall continue and remain in each circuit town or place of the respective districts, at the expiration of which time so to be limited and declared the justice-ayre at such town or place shall be concluded and ended, the jury, sheriffs and other magistrates discharged from their attendance, and the judge or judges not obliged to continue longer in such town or place, any thing in the aforesaid Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

II. Provided always, that if any trial or matter, civil or criminal, shall happen to be begun or entered upon and not concluded and determined before elapsing of the time so to be limited and declared for the judge or judges continuing in each circuit town or place, it shall nevertheless be proceeded in, and the judge or judges and jury shall not be at liberty to depart or leave the said town or place till the same is concluded and determined; and provided also, that the judge or judges of the circuit courts shall continue, and the sheriffs and other officers shall attend them, by the space of three whole days at the least at each town or place where the circuit shall be held, but that the jury shall be discharged from their attendance as soon as the business may admit

Lord one thousand seven hundred and forty-eight it shall and may be lawful for the said Court of Justiciary and the said respective circuit courts to proceed in, try and determine all causes and prosecutions before them for any crime or crimes not inferring the punishment of death or demembration, whereupon the verdict of an assize or jury is to pass, upon examining and hearing the evidence of the witness or witnesses adduced or examined in any such cause or prosecution viva voce, without reducing into writing the testimony of any such witness or witnesses, and that the practice of taking down and reducing into writing the testimony of witnesses in such cases be and the same is thereby abrogated and abolished: And whereas the alteration introduced in the trial of the lesser crimes by the above Act has been found by experience to be attended with important and salutary consequences: And whereas the taking down and reducing into writing the evidence given in the trial of crimes which may infer the punishment of death or demembration, as now practised in the Court of Justiciary and circuit courts, has been found by long experience to be attended with great inconveniencies, by prolonging trials to such a length as has been found dangerous to the health of the judges, council and jury, whereby the best jurymen are often deterred from attending such service, and those who do attend, after being exhausted with the fatigue of such long trials, are little able to discharge their duty in reconsidering the whole evidence as taken down at such length in writing in order to form their verdict: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for the said Court of Justiciary and the said respective circuit courts to proceed in, try and determine all causes and prosecutions before them for any crime or crimes inferring the punishment of death or of demembration, in the same manner as is now practised in prosecutions for lesser crimes, by the verdict of an assize or jury, upon examining and hearing the evidence of the witness or witnesses adduced or examined in any such cause or prosecution viva voce, without reducing into writing the testimony of any such witness or witnesses.

IV. Provided always, that if 'in the trial of any of the crimes which may infer the punishment of death or demembration it shall appear to the judges more expedient to take down and reduce into writing the testimony of all or any number of the witnesses according to the present practice, it shall be lawful for them to proceed in that manner, any thing in this present Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

Y. Provided also, that in all such trials and prosecutions, whether the evidence be reduced into writing or be taken from the witnesses viva voce -without reducing the same into writing, the council on both sides and the pannel or prisoner may interrogate the witnesses upon all pertinent and legal questions, and immediately before the assize or jury shall be inclosed the evidence shall be summed up by the judge or one of the judges before whom such trial shall be had.

CHAPTER XX.

An Act for altering and amending an Act of the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, intituled " An Act for appointing Wardens and " Assay Masters for assaying wrought Plate in the Towns of Sheffield " and Birmingham," so far as relates to the said Town of Sheffield.

WHEREAS an Act of Parliament was made in the thirteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled " An Act for appointing wardens " and assay masters for assaying wrought plate in the towns of Sheffield and " Birmingham," whereby the assayer of wrought plate appointed or to be appointed in pursuance thereof within the said town of Sheffield is authorised and impowered to demand and take of and from every person who should bring to the assay office belonging to the company of guardians incorporated by the said Act for the said town of Sheffield any piece or parcel of wrought plate to be assayed, tried and marked, such prices, sums of money or rewards as the assayer shall think fit, not exceeding the sum of one shilling for every pound troy, and so proportionably for every greater or less quantity of plate assayed and marked: And whereas the said prices, sums of money or rewards allowed to be taken as aforesaid are inadequate to the trouble attending the assaying and marking of small pieces of plate, and insufficient to defray the necessary expences of the assay office established in the said town of Sheffield, and it is necessary that greater prices, sums of money or rewards should be allowed to be taken for assaying and marking small pieces of plate: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that it shall be lawful for the assayer of wrought plate appointed or to be appointed by virtue of the said Act within the said town of Sheffield to ask, demand, take and receive of and from all and every person and persons who shall from time to time bring to the assay office within the said town of Sheffield any small pieces of wrought plate to be assayed, tried and marked according to the directions of the said recited Act, such prices, sums of money or rewards as the company of guardians of the said assay office shall think fit, and shall from time to time at any of their meetings ascertain and order to be taken and received,

A.D. 1784.

24 George III. Sess. 2. c. 20.

195

so as such prices, sums of money or rewards do not exceed the rate of sixpence for the assaying, trying and marking any one dozen of such small pieces of wrought plate, such dozen not exceeding in weight six ounces troy, and that the prices, sums of money or rewards allowed to be taken by the said recited or this present Act shall be paid and applied in and towards the support of the said assay office and towards payment of any debt or debts already or hereafter to be incurred on account thereof, and of the expences of obtaining and passing this present Act, in such manner as the said company of guardians shall order and direct, any thing in the said recited Act to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.

II. And whereas it is by the said recited Act enacted, that if any working silversmith or dealer in wrought plate or any worker or dealer in any other metal plated or covered with silver shall strike or cause to be struck any letter or letters upon any vessel or other thing made of metal plated or covered with silver or upon any metal vessel or other thing made to look like silver, such person or persons so offending shall be subject to the penalty therein mentioned, and doubts have arisen, whether a manufacturer of goods plated with silver can or may strike his name* upon such goods without incurring the said penalty, and by reason of such doubts the manufacturers of goods plated with silver have been deterred from striking their names upon plated goods, whereby a proper distinction betwixt plated goods of the different manufacturers is prevented, and all emulation in that branch of business is destroyed, to the certain and manifest prejudice of the said manufactory: For obviating such doubts, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall be lawful for any manufacturer of goods plated with Manufacturers silver within the said town of Sheffield, or within one hundred miles thereof,

to strike or cause to be struck upon any metal vessel or thing plated or names, together covered with silver his or her surname, or in case of any partnership the name ^egood^witk! or firm of such partnership, and also some mark, figure or device to be struck on* incurring at the end of such surname or other name or firm, such mark, figure or Jj, Act*^m device not being the same or in imitation of any mark made use of by any i3 Geo.s. c.52. assay office established by law for assaying of wrought plate, without being subject to any penalty or forfeiture for so doing, any thing in the said Act to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.

III. Provided nevertheless, that every such surname or name or firm as Names to be aforesaid shall be in plain and legible characters, and struck with one punch characters, and only, and every such mark, figure or device shall, before the same is made marks to be use of be submitted to the examination of the said company of guardians of

the said Sheffield assay office, and be approved of by them at some of their publick meetings, and registered in a book to be kept for that purpose, for which registry there shall be lawfully demanded and taken from any manufacturer of plated goods on whose account such registry shall be made the sum of two shillings and sixpence, and no more.

IV. And be it further enacted and declared, that in case any manufacturer Mumfacturen or manufacturers of plated goods within the said town of Sheffield, or within

one hundred miles thereof, shall at any time hereafter strike any name, mark, teredorbeiong-figure or device upon his plated,goods which shall not have been previously ^bjecuo^ registered at the said assay office for the said town of Sheffield, or which shall penalty, have been previously registered at the said office by any other manufacturer

should be sold, a scire facias should be awarded out of her Majesty's Court of Exchequer unto the sheriff of the county where any such lands lie, to garnish the same heir to show cause why the same lands, tenements and hereditaments should not be put to sale for satisfaction of the same debts or farms in the said Act mentioned, according to the tenor thereof; whereupon if the heir should not within a convenient time, upon a garnishment or two nichils returned, show and prove unto the said court that the executors or administrators of such accountant or debtor have sufficient which ought to answer or be liable for the same debt or farm, then, after ten months next after such two nichils or garnishment returned, the same lands, tenements or hereditaments should be sold by her Majesty, her heirs or successors, and the money thereof coming disposed according to the said former recited Act; and after various other enacting clauses there was a proviso to prevent sale of the lands, tenements or hereditaments of any heir during the time of his or her nonage: And whereas by an Act made in the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the said recited explanatory Act of the twenty-seventh year of Queen Elizabeth was repealed and a new exposition was made of the said recited statute of the thirteenth of Elizabeth with various new provisions, but the said Act of the thirty-ninth year of Elizabeth being only temporary and having expired early in the reign of James the First, the said explanatory Act of the twenty-seventh year of Elizabeth became revived and is now in force: And whereas it may tend greatly to facilitate and expedite the payment of debts to the crown where the real estates of its accountants or debtors or of then* sureties are seized into the King's hands under writs of extent if a sufficient part of such estates was to be sold unto the provisions of the said recited Acts of the thirteenth and twenty-seventh years of Queen Elizabeth, but the said Acts have not been lately put in use, and inconvenience is likely to arise if the mode of sale therein directed should be pursued: Be it therefore declared and enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that it shall and may be lawful to and for his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, and the same court is hereby authorised on the application of his Majesty's attorney general in a summary way by motion to the same court, to order that the right, title, estate and interest of any debtor to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, and the right, title, estate and interest of the heirs and assigns of such debtor in any lands, tenements or hereditaments which have been or shall hereafter be extended under and by virtue of any such writ of extent or diem clausit extremum as aforesaid, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to satisfy the debt for which the same shall have been so extended, shall be sold in such manner as the said court shall direct, and that when a purchaser or purchasers shall be found the conveyance of kthe lands, tenements or hereditaments so decreed to be sold shall be made to the purchaser or purchasers by his Majesty's remem* brancer in the said Court of Exchequer or his deputy, under the direction of the said court, by a deed of bargain and sale to be inrolled in the same court; and that from and after the making of such conveyance and the inrollment thereof as aforesaid the bargainee or bargainees in such conveyance, and his or their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, shall have, hold and

enjoy the lands, tenements and hereditaments therein comprized for his and

their own respective use and benefit, not only against the extent of the crown,

but also against such debtor of the crown or the surety or sureties for such

debtor, and all persons claiming under such debtor or the surety or sureties,

unless by a title paramount to and available in law against such extent as

aforesaid; and all monies which shall become payable from any such purchaser Application of

or purchasers as aforesaid shall be paid, accounted for and applied towards moniesT

discharge of the debt due to the crown, and of all costs and expences which

shall be incurred by the crown in enforcing the payment of such debt in

such manner as the said Court of Exchequer shall from time to time order

and appoint; and if after payment of the whole debt to the crown and of The surplus, if

all costs and expences incurred in enforcing the payment thereof there shall of deb/'

be any surplus of the monies arising from any such sale, the said surplus and costs, to be

shall accordingly be paid to such person or persons under the order and 8

direction of the said Court of Exchequer, upon motion or petition to the said

court, to be made upon such notice to the crown and to be supported by

such affidavits or other proofs as to the said court shall from time to time

seem just and reasonable.

II. And whereas from the want of the deeds and writings relative to the Court of Extitle of such lands, tenements and hereditaments as the said Court of an "order Exchequer may decree to be sold under this Act difficulties may arise in the for theproduc-execution hereof: Be it therefore further enacted, that it shall be lawful for title'deeds, the said Court of Exchequer from time to time to make such order touching the production, delivery and custody of such title deeds and writings as aforesaid in the same manner as if a decree had been made by the said court for a sale of the lands of a crown debtor in execution of a trust created for payment of debts by such crown debtor himself.

II. And whereas by the said recited Act it was also enacted, that in case any person or persons whatsoever should at any time or times after the first day of December one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, during the continuance of the duties by the said Act imposed upon wrought plate or manufactures of gold and silver, export by way of merchandize for any foreign parts any plate of gold or silver, wrought or manufactured in this kingdom, which by the said Act is charged or chargeable with the respective duties of eight shillings per ounce and sixpence per ounce, and the same should appear to have been made and marked as aforesaid after the first day of December one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, and the duty thereby directed should have been paid thereon, and should give sufficient security before the shipping thereof for exportation that the particular quantities of such plate or manufactures of gold and silver intended to be exported as aforesaid, and every part thereof, should not be relanded or brought again into Great Britain, and should make proof upon oath that the same gold or silver plate or manufactures were actually made and marked as aforesaid after the said first day of December one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, and should also produce or deliver to such customer or collector a certificate under the hand of the person to whom such wrought plate or manufactures of gold and silver were consigned certifying that the same had been received, and mentioning the weight and particular species of plate so consigned and received, the name of the person consigning the same, the name of the vessel, and tho name of the captain commanding such vessel, and the port of Great Britain from which the said vessel was cleared, and the port to which such vessel was bound, and should also where the drawback should amount to five pounds and upwards authenticate such certificate by notarial act in writing, and where the same could not be done by a notarial act then the same should be authenticated under the hand and seal of the chief magistrate of the city, town or place where such wrought plate or manufacture of gold and silver should be received, that then the said customer or collector should give to the exporter thereof a debenture expressing the true kinds and quantities of such plate and manufactures of gold or silver so exported or shipped to be exported, and the exportation or shipping thereof being certified by the searcher upon the said debenture, the collector or receiver of the said duty on plate, upon the said debenture so certified being produced to him, should forthwith pay a drawback or allowance after the rate of eight shillings for every ounce troy on gold, and sixpence for every ounce troy on silver plate or manufacture, out of the money in his hands, in the manner in the said Act particularly mentioned and set forth: And whereas the great delay in with-holding the drawback, in cases where such plate or manufacture of gold and silver is wanted to be exported to the East and West Indies and to other distant parts, until the certificate directed in the said recited danse can be procured from the persons to whom such wrought plate is consigned, tends greatly to impede the exportation of gold and silver manufactured plate to foreign parts, and is very injurious to the manufacturers thereof: And whereas by the said recited Act it was also further enacted, that all wrought gold and silver plate which should be intended to be exported from this kingdom into any foreign parts should before the same was shipped be brought to the assay office, and should there be stamped with the figure of a Britannia, in order to denote that such plate was intended for exportation, and to be allowed the drawback thereon: And whereas the striking the Britannia mark on many articles of wrought gold and silver plate in their finished state can in no way be practised without doing material damage to such wrought plate: Be it therefore enacted, that from and after the twenty-fourth day of July one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five the said two last recited clauses in the said Act contained and each of them shall be and the same are hereby respectively repealed. {Rep., Stat.

V. And, the better to prevent the fraudulent relanding of any plate in this kingdom, after the drawback has been paid and allowed for the same, it is hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all securities and bonds required to be taken as aforesaid shall continue and remain in force until every such exporter of any wrought plate or manufactures of gold and silver shall produce and deliver to such customer or collector the bill of lading thereof, and which shall have at the foot the receipt of the master of the vessel on board of which the said plate or manufactures were shipped, and also a receipt or certificate on the back of such bill of lading, under the hand of the person to whom such wrought plate or manufactures of gold and silver were consigned, certifying or acknowledging that the same have been

An Act to amend and render more effectual an Act made in the Fifteenth Year of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled " An Act " to prevent the counterfeiting of Gold and Silver Lace, and for settling " and adjusting the Proportions 'of fine Silver and Silk, and for the " better making of Gold and Silver Thread."

WHEREAS by an Act made in the fifteenth year of the reign of his late " ' Majesty King George the Second (intituled An Act to prevent the counterfeiting of gold and silver lace, and for settling and adjusting the proportions of fine silver and silk, and for the better making of gold and silver thread) it is (amongst other things) enacted, that from and after the first day of July one thousand seven hundred and forty-two all copper, brass and every other metal inferior to silver shall be spun upon thread, yam or inkle only, and not spun, mixed, wove, wrought or set upon silk, upon pain that each and every person offending therein shall forfeit and pay the sum of five shillings for each and every ounce so spun, mixed, wove, wrought or set upon silk: And whereas, notwithstanding the said recited Act, great frauds have been committed by copper or other base metal being woven or mixed with silk and worked up in imitation of gold lace, and it hath also been a practice for persons to gild and silver copper, brass or other base metal, and to spin or weave the same upon silk, thread, yam or inkle, and to work up the same in imitation of and to mix the same with gold and silver lace, fringe, cord, embroidery, tambour work and buttons, which have been so exactly counterfeited that the publick have been greatly imposed upon thereby, which tends to the discouragement as well of the manufacture as of the exportation thereof, and to the use and wear thereof at home, to the great diminution of the bullion of this kingdom, inasmuch as whatever is used in gilding or silvering copper is never recovered, and also in diminution of his Majesty's revenue: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the passing of this Act all copper, brass and every other metal inferior' to silver shall be spun upon thread, yam or inkle only, and not spun, mixed, woven, wrought or set upon silk; and that no person or persons whomsoever shall sell or offer or expose to sale or export any copper, brass or other metal inferior to silver which

c. 30., and

An Act for the further Regulation of Parish Apprentices.

"TXTHERE AS by an Act passed in the forty-third year of the reign of Preamble.

* Queen Elizabeth, intituled " An Act for the relief of the poor," it is 43 Eli*, c. 2. (amongst other things) enacted, that it shall be lawful for the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of any parish or the greater part of them, by the assent of two justices of the peace, to bind any children, whose parents they shall judge to be not able to keep and maintain such children, to be apprentices where they shall see convenient, till such man child should come to the age of twenty-four years and such woman child to the age of twenty-one years or the time of her marriage, the same to be as effectual to all purposes as if such child were of full age and by indenture of covenant bound him or herself: And whereas by an Act made in the eighth and ninth years of the reign of King William, intituled " An Act for supplying some defects 8 & 9 Will. 3. " in the laws for the relief of the poor of this kingdom," after reciting that, there being doubts whether the persons to whom such children were to be bound under and by virtue of the said statute of the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth were compellable to receive such children as apprentices, that law had failed of its execution, it was therefore enacted, that where any pqor children should be appointed to be bound apprentices pursuant to the said Act of Queen Elizabeth, the persons to whom they are so appointed to be bound apprentices shall receive and provide for them according to the indenture signed and confirmed by the two justices of the peace, and also execute the other part of the said indentures, under the penalty in case of refusal of the forfeiture of ten pounds for every such offence, to be levied of the goods of the offender in the manner mentioned in the said Act: And whereas by an Act passed in the eighteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled "An " Act to amend such part of an Act made in the forty-third year of the reign " of Queen Elizabeth, intituled 'An Act for the relief of the poor,' as relates to

324-

32 George III. c. 57.

A.D. 1792.

From July 1, 1792, covenants for maintenance of parish apprentices, "with, whom no more than 5L shall be given, to continue in force no longer than three months after the death of the master, &c.

" the binding of parish apprentices," it was enacted, that when any man child should be bound to be an apprentice by virtue of the said Act made in the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, such child shall be bound to be an apprentice for no longer term than till he shall come to the age of twenty-one years: And whereas in such indentures of apprenticeship it hath been usual to insert several agreements and covenants to be done and performed by the several parties thereto; (that is to say,) an agreement on the part of the apprentice that he will faithfully serve his master during the term of such apprenticeship, and also several covenants on the part of the master, for himself, his executors and administrators, that he the said master will teach or cause to be taught such apprentice in the business of husbandry, or in the craft, mystery or occupation which such master then useth, as the case may be, and that such master shall also during the term of such apprenticeship find and allow unto such apprentice sufficient meat, drink, apparel, lodging and all other things needful for an apprentice during such term: And whereas in the event of the death of the master during the term of such apprenticeship the agreement for service on the part of the apprentice is at an end, but the covenant for maintenance on the part of the master still continues in force as far as the master's assets will extend, or doubts have arisen with respect thereto, and in consequence thereof such apprentices do frequently on the death of their master leave their master's house, and after living in idleness return again and become a burden on their master's effects, and so from time to time, as they think proper, which is attended with great inconvenience and hardship to the family and personal representatives of such master, and is at the same time an inducement to such apprentice to continue in a disorderly and idle course of life: And whereas the several powers given to justices of the peace for the better ordering of parish apprentices by the several Acts of Parliament made for that purpose do cease and determine on the death of the master, for which a remedy ought to be provided: And whereas several other regulations are necessary to be made respecting parish apprentices: Be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the first day of July one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, in case of the death of any master or mistress of any parish apprentice during the term of such apprenticeship, upon the binding out of which apprentice no larger sum than five pounds has been or shall be paid, such covenant as is before mentioned for the maintenance of such apprentice, inserted in the indenture of apprenticeship by which such apprentice shall have been or shall be bound, shall not continue and be in force for and during any longer time than for three calendar months next after the death of such master or mistress, and that during such three calendar months such apprentice shall continue to live with and serve as an apprentice the executors and administrators of such master or mistress, some or one of them, or such person or persons as such executors or administrators, some or one of them, shall appoint; and the master or mistress whom such apprentice shall accordingly serve during the said three calendar months, and also such apprentice, shall during that time be subject and liable to all the laws which are or shall be in force

325

for the better government and regulation of masters and parish apprentices: And that in all such parish indentures of apprenticeship as aforesaid which shall be made from and after the first day of July one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two there shall be annexed to the covenant in such indentures to be entered into on the part of the master or mistress of such apprentice for such maintenance as aforesaid a proviso declaring that such covenant shall not be made to continue and be in force for any longer time than for three calendar months next after the death of such master or mistress, in case such master or mistress shall die during the term of such apprenticeship, which proviso may be in the form or to the effect mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed marked with the letter A .; and in case such proviso shall happen to be omitted in any such indenture the covenant therein contained on the part of the master for the maintenance of the apprentice shall be deemed and taken to continue and be in force for no longer time than for three calendar months next after the death of such master or mistress, in case such master or mistress shall die during the term of such apprenticeship, any thing in any such covenant to the contrary notwithstanding.

II. And whereas it is just and reasonable that such apprentice as aforesaid, in case of his master's death during his apprenticeship, should be obliged during the term of his apprenticeship to make some satisfaction by his labour to the family or representatives of his deceased master for the advantages he has received from his apprenticeship in his childhood, when his services could not be equal to the expences of his maintenance: Be it enacted, that within such three calendar months after the death of such master or mistress it shall and may be lawful for any two justices of the peace of the county, city, town, riding, division or place where such master or mistress shall have died, on application made to them by the widow of such master or by the husband of such mistress, or by any son or daughter, brother or sister, or by any executor or executrix, administrator or administratrix, of such master or mistress, by indorsement on any such indenture of apprenticeship or the counterpart thereof, or by any other instrument in writing (which indorsement or instrument may be in the forms or to the effect mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed marked with the letters B. and C.), to order and direct that such apprentice shall serve as an apprentice any one of such persons so making such application as aforesaid (such person having lived with and having been part of the family of such master or mistress at the time of his or her death) as the said justices 'shall in their discretion think fit, for and during the residue of the term mentioned in such indenture of apprenticeship, and the person obtaining such order shall declare his acceptance of such apprentice by subscribing his or her name to such order; and that from and after such order shall be made, the executors and administrators, and the personal assets, estate and effects of the master or mistress so dying as aforesaid, shall be released and discharged of and from any promise or covenant whatsoever contained in any such indenture of apprenticeship, on the part of such master or mistress, his or her executors or administrators, to be done and performed, and the person obtaining the same shall be and be deemed and taken to be the master or mistress of such apprentice in like manner as if such apprentice had been originally bound to such master

Proviso to that effect to be annexed to covenant but if omitted the covenant to continue no longer in force.

Within three months after the death of a master, two justices may order apprentices to serve the residue of their terms with persons of the description herein specified, on application, &c.

or mistress; and that such last-mentioned master or mistress, his or her executors and administrators, each and every of them, shall be held and bound by the several promises and covenants contained in any such indenture of apprenticeship on the part of the master or mistress therein named, his or her executors or administrators, to be done and performed, in like manner as if such master or mistress obtaining such order as aforesaid had duly executed the counterpart of such indenture; and that such master or mistress and apprentice shall be subject and liable to the several penalties, provisions and regulations which shall then be in force for the better government and good order of masters and parish apprentices; and that all justices of the peace shall have the like powers and authority with respect thereto as they shall then have by any Act or Acts of Parliament relating to parish apprentices.

III. And be it further enacted, that all and singular the regulations and provisions herein-before made and directed to take place on the death of the original master or mistress shall be deemed and taken to relate to the like event of the death of any such subsequent master or mistress, and to their several relations and representatives before enumerated, from time to time, as often as the case shall happen, during the continuance of the term mentioned in any such indenture of apprenticeship.

IV. And be it further enacted, that in case no such application shall be made as aforesaid within three calendar months next after the death of such master or mistress, or in case such two justices to whom any such application as aforesaid shall have been made shall not think fit that such apprenticeship should be continued, then the said apprenticeship shall be determined, and the indenture of apprenticeship and covenants therein contained shall be at an end in like manner as they would have been at the expiration of the term therein mentioned.

V. Provided always, and be it enacted, that nothing herein-before contained shall extend or be construed to extend to any parish apprentice but to such only as shall be living with and shall make part of the family, or shall be in the actual employment of such original master or mistress, or of any subsequent master or mistress appointed under and by virtue of the several provisions of this Act, at the time of the death of any such masters or mistresses respectively.

VI. And whereas much difficulty and delay must necessarily happen in bringing an action upon the covenant for maintenance before mentioned contained in any such indenture of parish apprenticeship: Be it ehacted, that in case any such original master or mistress as aforesaid, or any master or mistress appointed under or by virtue of this Act, shall during the term of any such parish apprenticeship as aforesaid, or if the executors or administrators of such masters or mistresses, any or either of them, having assets, shall during such three calendar months as aforesaid refuse or neglect to maintain and provide for any such apprentice according to the terms of such covenant, it shall and may be lawful for any two justices of the peace of the county, city, town, riding, division or place in which the parish or place shall lie to which such apprentice shall belong, on complaint of such apprentice or of the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of such palish or place.

32 George III. c. 57.

VII. And whereas it frequently happens that persons are compellable, under and by virtue of the said Act of the ninth and tenth years of King William, to take a greater number of parish apprentices than it is convenient for them to maintain or employ in their own families, and they are therefore forced to place out or assign over such apprentices to other persons, and it is proper that such assignment should be legally made under the inspection and controul of the magistrates, as well for the benefit of the apprentice as that the original master may be discharged from his covenants in respect of such apprentice; and it is fit that the person to whom such assignment shall be made, and also the apprentice, should be made subject to the ordinary jurisdiction of justices of the peace with respect to masters and parish apprentices: Be it enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for any master or mistress of any such parish apprentice as aforesaid, by indorsement on the indenture of apprenticeship, or by other instrument in writing, by and with the consent of two justices of the peace of the county, city, town, riding, division or place where such master or mistress shall dwell, testified by such justices under their hands, to assign such apprentice to any person who is willing to take such apprentice for the residue of the term mentioned in such indenture of apprenticeship: Provided always, that such person to whom such apprentice is intended to be assigned shall at the same time, by indorsement on the counterpart of such indenture, or by writing under his or her hand, stating the said indenture of apprenticeship and the indorsement and consent aforesaid, declare his or her acceptance of such apprentice and acknowledge himself, herself, his or her executors and administrators, to be bound by the agreements and covenants mentioned in the said indenture on the part of the master or mistress of such apprentice to be done and performed, which indorsement or instrument may be in the forms or to the effect mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed marked with the letters D. and E .; and in such case such apprentice shall be deemed and taken to be the apprentice of such subsequent master or mistress to whom such assignment shall be made to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and so from time to time as often as it shall be necessary or convenient for any such subsequent master or mistress to part with any such apprentice; and all justices of the peace shall have the like power and authority in the several cases last mentioned with respect as well to the subsequent master or mistress, masters or mistresses, as to the apprentice, as such justices shall then have by any law for the better regulation of parish apprentices.

VIII. And whereas no express provision has been made for the discharging of any such parish apprentice from a master or mistress who is become insolvent or is so far reduced in his or her circumstances as to be unable to employ or maintain such apprentice: Be it enacted, that it shall and

Master may assign over apprentice with the consent of two justices, &c.

XI. And whereas by an Act passed in the twentieth year of the reign of Kong George the Second, intituled " An Act for the better adjusting and more " easy recovery of the wages of certain servants, and for the better regulation " of such servants and of certain apprentices/' it is enacted, that it shall and may be lawful to and for any two or more justices, upon any complaint or application by any apprentice put out by the parish touching or concerning any misusage, refusal of necessary provisions, cruelty or other ill treatment of or towards such apprentice by his or her master or mistress, and due proof thereof, to discharge such apprentice from his or her apprenticeship: And whereas instances of such ill treatment frequently occur, and it is fit that the expectation of such discharge should not operate as an inducement to such ill treatment: Be it enacted, that in every case where any parish apprentice whatsoever shall be discharged from his apprenticeship by two justices under and by virtue of the said last-mentioned Act, it shall and may be lawful for such two justices to order such master or mistress to deliver up to such apprentice his or her clothes and wearing apparel, and also to pay to such churchwardens or overseers of the poor of the parish or place to which such apprentice shall belong, some or one of them, a sum not exceeding ten pounds, to be applied by them, some or one of them, under the order of such justices, for the again placing and binding out such apprentice so discharged as aforesaid, or otherwise for his or her benefit, as to such justices shall seem meet, and also to pay a sum not exceeding five pounds in case such master or mistress shall refuse to deliver up such clothes and wearing apparel; and in case such master or mistress shall refuse to pay the sum so ordered by the said justices to be paid as aforesaid, or either of them, or any part thereof, it shall and may be lawful for such two justices, by warrant under their hands and seals, to levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such master or mistress, together with the reasonable expences of such distress; and also that it shall and may be lawful for such two justices, if they shall so think fit, to compel such churchwardens and overseers of the poor, some or one of them, to enter into a recognizance for the effectual prosecution by indictment of such master or mistress for such.ill treatment of any such

XII. And whereas it is not expedient that such master or mistress should be again entrusted with the care of another parish apprentice: Be it enacted, that in every case where any parish apprentice shall have been so discharged from any master or mistress as aforesaid under and by virtue of the said last mentioned Act, and such master and mistress shall have been convicted of such offence in consequence of such prosecution by indictment as aforesaid, or shall have been found guilty thereof in any action brought at the suit of the party injured, it shall not be lawful for the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of any parish or place, or the major part of them, to bind

CHAPTER CXXII.

An Act to enable his Majesty, under certain Regulations, to erect independent Burghs of Barony in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, and for removing certain Difficulties as to the granting of Leases in Towns and Villages on the Fishing Coasts of that Kingdom.

[26th June 1796.]

WHEREAS doubts have arisen whether by an Act passed in the * twentieth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for taking away and abolishing the heritable jurisdictions in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, the prerogative of his Majesty to erect free and independent burghs of barony in that part of Great Britain called Scotland was taken away or abolished: And whereas the erection of such independent burghs of barony may be very beneficial for encouraging the erection of villages, which are particularly necessary upon the sea coasts of Scotland, in those places where the fishings are carried on, and which are generally at a great distance from the ordinary courts of law: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that it shall and may be lawful for his Majesty, his heirs and successors, to erect such independent burghs of barony in such parts of the sea coasts of Scotland where the fisheries are or shall be carried on, in the usual manner practised before the passing of the said Act of the twentieth of his late Majesty, and that it shall and may be lawful for all persons who are enabled by an Act passed in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled " An Act for incorporating " certain persons by the name and stile of ' The British Society for extending " ' the Fisheries and improving the Sea Coast of this Kingdom,' and to enable " them when incorporated to subscribe a joint stock, and therewith to " purchase lands and build thereon free towns, villages and fishing stations " in the highlands and islands in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, " and for other purposes," and who have agreed or shall hereafter agree to sell or feu lands to the said British Society for the purpose of erecting

His Majesty may erect independent burghs of barony in certain parts of Scotland, as practised previous to recited Act; and persons selling lands to the society incorporated by 26 Geo. 3. c. 106. may resign them to the barons of Exchequer in Scotland for erecting them into such burghs, &c.

villages and of encouraging the said fisheries, to resign the same into the hands of the said barons of Exchequer in Scotland for a new charter thereof, and for erecting the same into independent burghs of barony, with powers to the inhabitants, or to such descriptions of them as may be described in such charter, to elect a baron baillie or baillies or other magistrate or magistrates annually, in the same manner as such charters were usually made and granted before the passing of the said Act of the twentieth year of his late Majesty, and with such powers and jurisdiction, civil and criminal, to the said magistrate or magistrates as are reserved by the said Act to the magistrates of independent burghs of barony then existing; and it shall be lawful for such persons, after obtaining such charter and infeftment thereon, to grant in feu to the said society such lands, reserving such feu duty as shall be agreed upon, any thing contained in the said Act of the twentieth of his late Majesty to the contrary notwithstanding.

II. And be it enacted, that the magistrate or magistrates so elected annually shall within the limits of the said respective burghs of barony have and exercise all the other powers which now belong or which shall hereafter belong to any of his Majesty's justices of the peace in that part of Great Britain called Scotland by virtue of their respective offices, without the qualification in respect to property usually required in the case of other justices of the peace: Provided always, that the justices of the peace of the respective counties within which the said villages lie shall have a concurrent jurisdiction within such villages with such magistrate or magistrates respectively: Provided also, that before any report shall be made to his Majesty in consequence of any reference to the Court of Exchequer in Scotland relating to the granting of such charters or any of them, due notice shall be given to all such persons as in the opinion of such court may be affected by the granting the same, in such manner as the said court shall direct, that they may be heard against the granting such charters respectively, if they shall so think proper.

III. And whereas, for promoting the purposes of the said Act, the said British Society have purchased lands for building villages in several places in the remote parts of Scotland, and have agreed to grant leases renewable for ever to such persons as are inclined to settle there and to build houses, with a view of carrying on the said fisheries: And whereas many of the settlers have not been taught to write, and cannot sign and execute legal and effectual counterparts of such leases otherwise than according to the formalities required by the law of Scotland in the case of persons who cannot write, which are that two notaries publick and four witnesses should be present when such persons do affix their mark to any deed or obligatory writing and should attest the same, and that from the great distance of such places from the residence of any notaries publick great expence and delays have arisen and must arise in signing such leases, which has retarded and must retard the progress of such villages: Be it therefore enacted, that from and after the passing of this Act it shall and may be lawful for such settlers in .any of the villages erected or to be erected on any lands purchased by the British Society for the purposes aforesaid to sign with their respective marks if they cannot write, in the presence of the resident minister of the nearest church to such settlement and of two elders of such church, who shall attest

35 George III. c. 122, 125.

391

the same, or in the presence of the sheriff substitute, or of any justice of peace of the respective counties, and of two such elders, who shall in like manner attest the same, instead of two notaries and four witnesses; and that all leases so signed by a mark by the said settlers and attested in manner aforesaid shall be as binding and effectual in law as if the same had been signed in the presence of two notaries and four witnesses; and that no objection shall lie against the validity of such leases on account of their being renewable for ever, any law or usage of Scotland to the contrary notwithstanding.

[18th December 1795.]

WHEREAS several Acts of Parliament have of late years been made and *' passed for the better relief and employment of the poor in particular incorporated hundreds, towns and districts within that part of Great Britain called England: And whereas certain persons described and appointed by the said several Acts are thereby empowered to assess the several parishes, hamlets and places, chargeable to the poors rate within the said several hundreds, towns or districts respectively, in such sums of money as they shall think necessary for defraying the expences of supporting and maintaining the poor within their respective hundreds, towns and districts, and for other the purposes of the said Acts, but such sums of money for which such assessments are to be made are by the said several Acts of Parliament limited so as that they may not exceed a certain sum in any one year, which sum was calculated upon an average of the amount of the poora rates in each parish respectively for a certain number of years previous to the passing of the respective incorporating Acts: And whereas by reason of the late very great increase of the price of com and other necessary articles of life the amount of the rates and assessments so limited by the said several Acts of Parliament are become insufficient for the necessary relief and maintenance of the poor, who have also of late greatly increased in number: And whereas in many incorporated hundreds, towns and districts, the expence of maintaining the poor since the first day of January one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five has exceeded the whole amount of the rates wliich could be raised in the present year within those hundreds, towns and districts, under their respective incorporating Acts, whereby considerable debts have on that account been incurred by the guardians of the poor of those hundreds, towns and districts; and it is therefore become necessary and expedient that the powers of the several persons to. whom is committed by the said several Acts of Parliament the duty of appointing the sums to be assessed on the several parishes, hamlets and places, within their respective hundreds, towns and districts, should be enlarged: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and

be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the passing of this Act it shall and may be lawful for the directors and acting guardians of the poor within any hundred, town or district, in that part of Great Britain called England, incorporated by any Act of Parliament for the relief or maintenance and employment of the poor, or for any other persons, by whatsoever name they are called or described, to whom is given by any such incorporating Act the power of appointing the sum or sums to be assessed on the several parishes, hamlets or places, within their respective hundreds, towns 'or districts, for the maintenance of the poor, and other the purposes of such Act, at any of their annual, quarterly or other general meetings, whenever the average price of wheat at the corn market in Mark Lane, London, for the quarter immediately preceding such annual, quarterly or other general meeting, shall have exceeded the average price of wheat at the same market during those years from which the average amount of the poors rates was taken upon the passing of the several incorporating Acts respectively, to assess the several parishes, hamlets and places, within their respective hundreds, towns or districts, which now are or usually have been charged to the poors rates, in such respective sums of money as the said directors and acting guardians or such other persons as aforesaid shall think necessary for defraying the expences attending the support and maintenance of the poor for the current quarter, and for paying the interest of the nloney borrowed and due by virtue of the said respective Acts, and of any debts which may have been incurred since the first day of January one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five in the maintenance of the poor, and for other the purposes of the said Acts, notwithstanding such sums of money so to be assessed should exceed the amount of the assessments limited by such respective Acts of Parliament to be assessed on the respective parishes, hamlets and places, within such incorporated hundreds, towns or districts, in any one year: Provided always, that the sums to be assessed and the assessments to be made by virtue of this Act in each respective incorporated hundred, town or district, shall be assessed, made, collected and paid in the same manner, and subject to the same restrictions, regulations, limitations and powers of appeal, and with the like powers and remedies for compelling payment thereof, as the suras to be assessed and the assessments to be made by virtue of the several incorporating Acts are by those respective Acts directed to be assessed, collected and made within the several hundreds, towns and districts, respectively incorporated by those Acts: Provided also, that the sums to be assessed by virtue of this Act upon any parish, hamlet or place, shall be in the same rates and proportions as the assessments which have hitherto been made and levied by virtue of the said Act or Acts incorporating the several hundreds, towns or districts, in which such parishes, hamlets or places, are respectively situated:......................

Directors and acting guardians of the poor incorporated by Acts of Parliament may in certain cases make such assessments as may be necessary for the support and maintenance of the poor, &c., notwithstanding they may exceed the assessments limited by the respective Acts.

Assessments by virtue of this Act to be made, Ac. as those under the incorporating Acts.

An ACT for the better Administration of Justice at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay; and for preventing British Subjects from being concerned in Loans to the Native Princes in India. [20th July 1797.]

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the thirteenth year of the reign of his * " present Majesty, intituled " An Act for establishing certain regulations " for the better management of the affairs of the East India Company, as " well in India as in Europe," it was enacted, that it should be lawful for his Majesty, by letters patent under the great seal of Great Britain, to erect and establish a supreme court of judicature at Fort William in Bengal, to consist of a chief justice and three other justices, being barristers of England or Ireland of not less than five years standing, to be named from time to time by his Majesty, his heirs and successors: And whereas by the said Act and by divers other Acts of Parliament certain jurisdictions, powers and authorities were given to the said court to be exercised in the manner therein directed: And whereas it may be expedient that the number of judges should be reduced: Be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that immediately after the death, resignation or removal of any of the puisne judges of the said Supreme Court, that the office of one of the said puisne judges shall be and the same is hereby suppressed, and from and immediately after such death, resignation or removal, the said Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice and two other judges only; and all powers, jurisdictions and authorities whatsoever shall, from and after such period as aforesaid, be enjoyed and exercised by the said chief justice and other judges, in as full and ample a manner as the same might have been held, enjoyed and, exercised by the said Supreme Court under the authority of the said herein-before recited Act or any other Act or Acts of Parliament, or under the charter of justice granted by his Majesty under the authority of the same.

II. And whereas his Majesty has by law no power to direct the application of any part of the revenues of the territorial acquisitions in India as a provision for a chief justice or other judge of the said Supreme Court, who, from infirmity or other causes approved of by his Majesty, may return to Europe: And whereas it is expedient that such power, to a limited extent, be vested in his Majesty, his heirs and successors: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that, from and after the death, resignation dr removal of one of the judges of the said Supreme Court, and the suppression of the said office in the manner herein-before directed, that it shall and may be lawful for his Majesty, his heirs and successors, by warrant under his royal sign manual, to authorize and direct the payment of a competent yearly sum out of the revenues arising from the territorial acquisitions in India, to be applied for the use and behoof of any chief justice or other judge who from age, infirmity or other cause to be approved of by his Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall return to Europe.

III. Provided always, that it shall not be lawful for his Majesty, his heirs or successors, to authorize the payment of any larger sum for the use and

behoof of any chief justice so returning as aforesaid than the sum of two tjce, °°rrQore thousand pounds per annum, or of any other judge than the sum of one ann. to^any * thousand five hundred pounds per annum;............................ other judge.

IV. And whereas by the charter of justice granted by his Majesty under the authority of the herein-before recited Act passed in the thirteenth year of his present Majesty's reign the said Supreme Court of Judicature was directed and required to reduce or cause to be reduced to writing the depositions of witnesses in civil causes, and was directed to require the same to be subscribed by such witnesses with their name or other mark, and to file the same of record: And whereas by the said charter of justice it was also directed that no appeal should be allowed from the said Supreme Court of Judicature unless the value of the matters in dispute exceed the sum of one thousand pagodas: And whereas the requiring the depositions of witnesses to be reduced into writing and filed of record is productive of much expence and delay in small causes where the value of the matter in dispute does not exceed one thousand pagodas, and which for that reason cannot be made the

subject of appeal: Be it therefore enacted, that from and after the passing of The Supreme this Act it shall be in the discretion of the said Supreme Court, in all cases ^matteMn *when the value of the matter in dispute does not exceed one thousand pagodas, dispute does either to direct the deposition of witnesses to be reduced into writing, and filed "$ooXpagodas, of record, or not, as the said court shall think fit in the particular case, any may direct thing in the said charter of justice contained to the contrary notwithstanding. be*ffled of*10

V. And whereas by the said herein-before recited Act it was enacted, that record, or not, his Majesty might, by charter or letters patent, establish a Supreme Court of cretkm!8" Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, in the manner and with the powers in

the said Act mentioned; and it was also enacted, that the Supreme Court so to be erected should have power to appoint clerks and other ministerial officers, with such reasonable salaries as should be approved of by the governor general and council: And whereas his Majesty did issue his royal letters patent for erecting a Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, and among other things power was given to the said Supreme Court from time to time, as occasion should require, to appoint such clerks and ministers as should be necessary for the administration of justice, and the execution of the authorities granted to the court, which said officers and clerks were to receive such reasonable salaries as the said Supreme Court should appoint for each office and place respectively, and as the governor general and council should approve:

And whereas the said Supreme Court did appoint certain clerks and ministers with salaries, which were approved of by the governor general and council:

And whereas doubts have arisen whether the said salaries so appointed and approved of as aforesaid can be reduced or altered, or any of the said offices abolished or suppressed, without the authority of Parliament: And whereas the salaries paid by the East India Company to the clerks and ministers of the Supreme Court amount to a large sum, and yet nevertheless the said clerks and ministers have and do receive fees for all business done by them in the said court: And whereas it may be expedient that the said salaries should be reviewed, and that power should be given to alter the same if necessary:

Be it therefore enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for the court of The court of directors of the United Company of Merchants trading to India to direct the chief justice of the said Supreme Court to issue a precept or order directed to chief justice to VOL. III. F F

VI. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every clerk, officer, and minister of the said Supreme Court shall pay due obedience to the said order or precept, and make a true return to the same within twenty days next after the date of the same; and if any such officer, minister or clerk shall be guilty of making a false return, or shall not set forth in the same the fall amount of the salary, fees, perquisites and emoluments which he shall have received for the last three years, and each or any part of the same daring which he shall have been in office, then and in such case such officer shall, upon being duly convicted thereof, forfeit his said office, and be fbr ever incapable of bolding any office in the said Supreme Court, or in the service of the said united company.

VIL And be it further enacted, that the chief justice and other judges of the said Supreme Court shall, as soon as they conveniently can after the receipt of the said returns, take the same into their consideration, and report to the governor general in council, under their hands and seals, which of the said offices are in their opinion proper to be continued, and what is the proper salary to be allowed to each of the same, and whether any retrenchment can with propriety be made therein, with their reasons for the same; and in case the said chief justice and the other judges, or any of them, shall not agree respecting the said report, then such of the said judges as do disBent from the opinion of the majority shall also report, under his or their hands and seals, his or their opinion, with the reasons thereof; and in case the governor general in council do agree with the majority of the said Supreme Court concerning the extent of the said retrenchment, if any can be made therein, the said governor general in council shall and they are hereby empowered to alter, abridge or abolish all or any of the said offices and salaries which to them shall so seem proper to be altered or abridged or abolished, at such time and times and in such manner as they shall think fit, subject nevertheless to such orders and directions as they shall receive from the court of directors concerning the same; but in case the said governor general in council shall disagree with the said report from the majority of the said court or any part thereof, then such ports of the said report as are the subjects of difference between the said governor general in council and the said Supreme Court shall be suspended, and shall not be carried into execution, but the same shall be transmitted home for the ultimate decision of the court of directors respecting the same, who shall give such orders respecting the same as they shall think fit: Provided always, that from and after the passing of this Act, and until the said report shall be made and considered as is herein-before directed, if any vacancy shall occur in any of the offices or places under the said Supreme Court which are herein directed to be reviewed, the same shall be filled up by the judges of the said Supreme

Court provisionally only, and a person or persons shall be by them appointed to do the duty of the said office until the said report shall be made, and such office or offices shall be liable to be reduced or the salaries altered, if necessary, in the same manner as if they were actually vacant at the time of making such report.

VIII. And whereas certain regulations for the better administration of justice among the native inhabitants and others, being within the provinces of Bengal, Bahar and Orissa, have been from time to time framed by the governor general in council in Bengal, and among other regulations it has been established and declared as essential to the future prosperity of the British territories in Bengal that all regulations passed by government affecting the rights, properties or persons of the subjects should be formed into a regular code, and printed, with translations, in the country languages, and that the grounds of every regulation be prefixed to it, and that the courts of justice within the provinces be bound to regulate their decisions by the rules and ordinances which such regulations may contain, whereby the native inhabitants may be made acquainted with the privileges and immunities granted to them by the British government, and the mode of obtaining speedy redress for any infringement of the same: And whereas it is essential that so wise and salutary a provision should be strictly observed, and that it should not be in the power of the governor general in council to

neglect or to dispense with the same: Be it therefore enacted, that all regu- Regulations of lations which shall be issued and framed by the governor general in council at Fort William in Bengal affecting the rights, persons or property of the council, which natives, or of any other individuals who may be amenable to the provincial tives or others courts of justice, shall be registered in the judicial department, and formed .

shall annually transmit to the court of directors of the East India Company ten copies of such regulations as may be passed in each year, and the same number to the board of commissioners for the affairs of India.

IX. And whereas his late Majesty King George the Second did, by his Recital of letters patent bearing date at Westminster the eighth day of January in the twenty-sixth year of his reign, grant unto the United Company of Merchants the Second, trading to the East Indies his royal charter, thereby, amongst other things, constituting and establishing courts of civil, criminal and ecclesiastical jurisdiction at the said united company's settlements at Madras Patnam and Bombay in the island of Bombay and Fort William in Bengal: And whereas

the said charter, in so far as it respects the administration of justice at Fort William in Bengal, has been altered and changed by an Act passed in the thirteenth year of his present Majesty's reign, intituled " An Act for esta-" blishing certain regulations for the better management of the affairs of the " East India Company as well in India as in Europe": And whereas the said charter does not sufficiently provide for the due administration of justice in such manner as the state and condition of the company's settlements at Madras Patnam and Bombay do and must require: Be it therefore enacted,

Act of the Parliament of Scotland, 1701.

11 Geo. 1.

[c. 26. s. 11.]

Magistrates and judges in Scotland may extend the bail to be given in cases of criminal informations to 1,200/. for a nobleman, 600/. for a landed gentle* man, 300/. for any other gentleman, burgess or householder, and 60/. for an inferior person.

CHAPTER XLIX.

An Act to extend the Bail to be given in cases of Criminal Information in that part of Great Britain called Scotland. [13th June 1799.]

WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland made in the year one " * thousand seven hundred and one, intituled " An Act for preventing " wrongous imprisonment, and against undue delays in trials," the sums for which bail was ordered to be taken in criminal informations were not to exceed six thousand merks for a nobleman, three thousand merks for a landed gentleman, one thousand merks for any other gentleman and burgess, and three hundred merks for any other inferior person, all money of Scotland: And whereas by an Act made in the eleventh year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First, intituled " An Act for more effectual disarming " the Highlands in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and for the " better securing the peace and quiet of that part of the kingdom," reciting that it was found by experience that the sums for which bail is to be taken on any criminal information in pursuance of the said Act of the Parliament of Scotland were too small and disproportioned to the danger of the criminals escaping from the punishment appointed by law, it was enacted, that from and after the first day of June one thousand seven hundred and twenty-five it might and should be lawful to and for all and every magistrate, judge and court of judicature within Scotland, who by the said Act above recited were in case of criminal informations and accusations directed to limit the bail by them to be taken to the several and respective sums above-mentioned, to extend the bail to be given in the said several and respective cases to double the sums provided by the aforesaid Act, if he or they upon the circumstances of the case should think fit: And whereas it is again found by experience that the sums to which bail was extended by the said last recited Act in criminal informations and accusations, however adequate they may have been at this last period to the general state of the country and to the circumstances of individuals, do no longer bear any suitable relation thereto, and have become insufficient for compelling persons accused of crimes to stand their trials, and tend to render ineffectual and nugatory the most salutary laws, to bring into contempt the authority of the magistrate, and to afford a temptation and facility to the commission of crimes: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the passing of this Act it shall and may be lawful to and for all and every magistrate, judge and court of judicature within that part of Great Britain called Scotland, who by the said last recited Act were in cases of criminal informations and accusations directed to limit the bail by them to be taken to double the sums provided by the aforesaid Act of the Parliament of Scotland, to extend the bail to be given in the said several and respective cases, if he or they upon the circumstances of the case shall think fit, to the several and respective sums following; videlicet, to one thousand two hundred pounds sterling for a nobleman, six hundred pounds sterling for a landed gentleman, three hundred pounds sterling for any other gentleman, burgess or householder, and to sixty pounds sterling for any inferior person.

515

II. And "whereas several instances have lately occurred of disaffected persons concerned in societies of a criminal nature, when any of their associates have been committed to prison, subscribing the sums necessary for bailing such persons, in order that, by forfeiture of the bail bonds, they may evade a trial

and escape from justice: Be it therefore enacted, that in all cases where any person shall in future be imprisoned on a charge of being guilty of the crime of sedition, it shall and may be lawful for the judges of the Court of Justiciary, or any one of them, on an application for that purpose in the name of his Majesty's advocate, to extend the bail respectively herein directed to be taken, beyond the sums above specified, to such amount as, under all the circumstances of the case, the court, or any judge thereof, shall consider sufficient for ensuring the attendance or the appearance of the person accused on the day of trial [Rep., 6 Geo. 4. c. 47. s. 5.J: Provided always, that nothing

herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to deprive such person of the other benefits of the Acts above-mentioned, and particularly of his forcing on the day of trial, as specially directed by the Act of the Parliament of Scotland first above recited.

CHAPTER LV.

An Act for encouraging the Improvement of Lands subject to the Servitude of Thirlage in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland.

[13th June 1799.]

WHEREAS it is found by experience that the servitude of thirlage and right of mill services incident thereto in that part of Great Britain called Scotland are very unfavourable to the general .improvement of the country, by checking the industry of the occupiers of the ground, and by occasioning troublesome and expensive litigation, and that it is highly expedient that it should be allowed to persons subject to such servitude to compensate or to commute the same by a fixed annual payment in lieu and satisfaction of the said right of thirlage, and of all services, prestations and restrictions thereto incident or pertaining, and in some cases to make an entire and complete purchase of the same for a fair and adequate price: Therefore be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the passing of this Act it shall and may be lawful for the proprietor or proprietors of any lands or tenements thirled or astricted to any mill in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, or to the proprietor of any mill to which the lands or tenements of any other person or persons are thirled or astricted, who shall be desirous to have such thirlage or astriction changed or commuted into such annual payment, to apply to his Majesty's sheriff or steward depute of the county or stewartry in which such lands or tenements and mills are situated, or to his substitute, by a petition, setting forth such his or their desire, and specifying the lands and tenements so thirled which he or they is or are desirous should be freed from such thirlage, and the mill or mills to which such lands or tenements are so thirled, and also the nature of the thirlage, the several species of corn or grain over which it is extended, the quantity of multure paid for grinding every sort of grain, the services dependant on the right, and the total amount of the multures

XII. And it is hereby further enacted, that such proceeding may take place and such exemption be purchased in manner aforesaid notwithstanding the mill or mills, to which such burgh, town or village is thirled, be held by the proprietor or proprietors thereof under a deed or deeds of entail; provided that the price paid for the same, in virtue of the determination of the jury and decreet of the sheriff hereby directed, shall be settled and secured in like manner as is directed in the case of superiorities sold to the vassals of entailed estates by an Act made in the twentieth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled " An Act for taking away " the tenure of ward holding in Scotland, and for converting the same into " blanch and feu holdings, and for regulating the casualty of non-entry in " certain cases, and for taking away the casualties of single and life rent " escheats incurred there by horning and denunciation for civil causes, and " for giving to heirs and successors there a summary process against superiors, " and for discharging the attendance of vassals at head courts there, and " for ascertaining the service of tenants there, and for allowing heirs of " tailzie there to sell lands to the crown for erecting buildings and making " settlements in the Highlands."

XIII. And whereas it may happen that a mill and some of the lands thirled to it may be within different counties or stewartries: Be it enacted, that in such case the application shall be made to the sheriff or stewart of the county or stewartry in which the mill is situated, before whom the parties concerned who live without his jurisdiction may be cited by virtue of letters of supplement in common form.

XIV. Provided always, and it is hereby expressly enacted and declared, that nothing herein-before contained shall apply to the case where a permanent annual payment, either in money or grain, is already fixed or established under the name of dry multure in lieu of the servitude of thirlage; but reserving nevertheless to either party, as well the proprietor of the dominant as of the survient tenement, to apply in manner herein-before directed for commutating or compensating, by such fixed annual payment as herein-before mentioned, all mill services and other prestations and restrictions, if any such are exigible, over and above the sum of money or grain payable in name of dry multure as aforesaid.

CHAPTER XLL

An Act for explaining and amending several Acts made in the Thirty-second Year of King Henry the Eighth, and the First, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Years of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, so far as respects Leases granted by Archbishops, Bishops, Masters and Fellows of Colleges, Deans and Chapters of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, Masters and Guardians of Hospitals, and others having any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Living or Promotion. [16th May 1800.]

WHEREAS doubts have arisen whether archbishops, bishops, masters and fellows of colleges, deans and chapters of cathedral and collegiate churches, masters and guardians of hospitals, and others having any spiritual or ecclesiastical living or promotion, who are by several Acts passed in the reigns of their late Majesties King Henry the Eighth and Queen Elizabeth restrained from granting any leases of their estates whereon the accustomed yearly rent is not reserved, can lawfully grant separate leases of parts of lands or tenements which have been usually demised by one lease and under one rent, reserving on the several parts so demised less than the rent anciently reserved on the demise of the whole, though the aggregate amount of the rents so reserved on such separate demises should be equal to or exceed the amount of the annual accustomed rent for the whole: And whereas many such separate leases have been granted, and great inconvenience may arise to persons claiming under such leases, if such leases should not be deemed valid and effectual in case the amount of the rent anciently reserved on demises of the whole shall appear to have been reserved on the separate demises of the different parts; and the power of dividing tenements anciently so demised in one parcel at one rent may in many cases tend to improve the value of the estates belonging to such ecclesiastical persons and bodies respectively, aa well as to the benefit of their lessees and the publick: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that in all cases where any honours, castles, manors.

amount of such balance, or any part thereof upon any account so prepared for declaration or stated to them as aforesaid, distinct and apart from the said charge for interest; which said charge for interest they shall and may nevertheless in such case proceed afterwards to allow or disallow, in the whole or in part, as they shall think just and reasonable.

V. And be it further enacted, that after any extraordinary account shall have been stated to the lords commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury, and they shall have granted their warrant to prepare the same for declaration, the said commissioners for auditing the publick accounts shall proceed to compute interest, after the rate of five pounds per centum per annum, upon the amount of the said balance so stated by them as aforesaid, or so much thereof as shall have been allowed by the said lords commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury, and shall then remain due, and also upon the amount of the said charge for interest so stated as aforesaid, or upon so much thereof as shall have been allowed by th'e said lords commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury, such interest to be computed from the time when the said account was so stated, until the fifth day of January or the fifth day of July (as the case may be) next preceding the time when the said account of balance or interest (as the case may be) shall be presented for declaration; and the amount of such further interest for the said intermediate period of time shall bo added to the amount of the said balance and charge for interest respectively, which shall have been allowed by the said lords commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury, and shall therewith form the total sum with which the said accountant shall be charged as due to his Majesty on the said accounts of balance or interest, when the same shall be respectively presented for declaration.

After warrant granted to prepare any extraordinary account for declaration, the commissioners shall compute intermediate interest from the time of statipg the account to Jan. 5, or July 5, preceding the declaration,which shall be atj^ed to the balance and interest allowed by the Treasury.

No surety to be charged with interest till called upon to answer for default of the principal.

XI. And whereas it is just and reasonable that interest should be allowed to publick accountants for monies advanced by them for the publick service, and remaining due to them upon the balance of their accounts, not being accounts current: Be it therefore enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for the lords commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury, and they are hereby required, to allow and direct interest to be paid, after the rate of five pounds per centum per annum, upon every sum of money amounting to five hundred pounds and upwards which hath already been or hereafter shall be so ascertained or declared as aforesaid to be due upon the balance of such accounts from the publick to any person or persons whatever; such interest, in respect of such sums as have been already so ascertained or declared as aforesaid, to commence at and be computed from the passing of this Act, and in respect of such sums as shall hereafter be so ascertained or declared as aforesaid, to commence at and be computed from the time of the complete delivery of such accounts into the office for auditing the publick accounts; which said interest shall in every case continue to grow due and be payable in respect of the said principal sums of money, until the said principal sums and every part thereof shall be fully satisfied and discharged.

XII. And whereas it is expedient to provide more effectually for compelling the payment of balances which are or may become due from publick accountants: Be it therefore further enacted, that from and after the passing of this Act the commissioners of the customs and excise in England and Scotland respectively, and the commissioners for stamps and for the affairs

VIII. And whereas by the law of England the Queen consort, wife of the King, is capable of taking, granting or disposing of property as if she were a feme sole, but doubts may arise how far this capacity of granting or disposing of property extends, and especially whether during the life of the King her husband it includes the power of devising and bequeathing by last will and testament: And whereas his Majesty is desirous that her Majesty Queen Charlotte, his Majesty's royal consort, during his Majesty's life should have full and complete power, as well by her last will and testament as by deed, to grant, alien and dispose of any manors, messuages, lands, tenements, rents, tythes and hereditaments, which have been purchased by or in trust for or otherwise vested in her Majesty, or which shall hereafter be purchased by or in trust for or shall be otherwise vested in or in trust for her Majesty, under and by virtue of any deed, gift, will or otherwise, except as herein-after is mentioned, and of any goods and chattels, whether real or personal, and personal estate of what kind soever belonging to her Majesty, in the same manner as her Majesty might dispose thereof if she were sole and unmarried, and it may be convenient that the like power should be secured to every Queen consort of this realm for the time being: Now therefore be it further enacted, that it shall be lawful for her Majesty at any time or times during the joint lives Her Majesty of their Majesties, by deed under her hand and seal, to be executed in the fo^UveTof

IX. And be it further enacted, that it shall be lawful for any Queen for the time being of this realm, being the consort of his Majesty or any of his successors, in like manner, at any time or times during the joint lives of the King and such Queen consort for the time being, by deed under her hand and seal, or by her last will and testament in writing, to be respectively executed, signed, published and attested as aforesaid, to grant, convey, alien, disposed, give or devise any manors, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments, which shall be purchased by or in trust for her, or which shall come to or devolve upon or vest in her or any person or persons in trust for her, for any estate of inheritance or freehold or any copyhold or customary estate, under and by virtue of any deed, gift, will or otherwise, for all or any part of such estate, right and interest as she or such person or persons in trust for her shall have in any such manors, messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments, and also by her last will and testament in writing to give and bequeath all such her chattels, whether real or personal, and personal estate whatsoever, to any person or persons and for any intents and purposes she shall think fit, as fully and effectually in all respects as if she were sole and unmarried: Provided always, that nothing in this Act contained shall extend to enable her Majesty or any Queen consort of this realm to make any grant, conveyance or disposition of any palace or capital mansion house, gardens, lands or hereditaments, belonging to his Majesty or any of his successors in right of the crown, which now are or hereafter shall be vested in her Majesty or in any such Queen consort for her life, as and for her jointure or otherwise, under any letters patent of his Majesty or any of his successors or by Act of Parliament, or to make any grant, conveyance or disposition, which her Majesty and such Queen consort could not make, if sole and unmarried.

X. And whereas it is his Majesty's most gracious desire that all such personal estate and effects as his Majesty shall be possessed of or entitled to at the time of his demise, and over which he shall have the full and absolute power of disposition by his last will and testament, should be subject and liable to the payment of all such debts of his Majesty as shall during his

lifetime be properly payable out of his privy purse: And whereas it is reasonable that all such personal estate and effects as any of his Majesty's successors, kings or queens of this realm, shall be possessed or entitled to in like manner should also be subject and liable to the like charge; and it is expedient to fix and regulate what personal estate and effects of his Majesty and his successors are subject to such testamentary disposition, and in what form such disposition shall be made: Now therefore be it further enacted and declared, Monies for the that all such personal estate of his Majesty and his successors respectively, as no^appro* or

shall consist of monies which may be issued or applied for the use of his or their plated to any

whereto his Majesty or any of his successors shall be possessed or entitled at liable to all

the time of his and their respective demises, subject to such testamentary out of Aeprivy

disposition as aforesaid, shall be liable to the payment of all such debts as Pur8e-

shall be properly payable out of his or their privy purse; and that, subject

thereto, the same personal estate and effects of his Majesty and his successors

respectively, or so much thereof respectively as shall not be given or

on the demise of his Majesty and his successors respectively, as the same

would have gone if this Act had not been made.

WHEREAS persons charged with high treason, murder or felony, may

have been or may be of unsound mind at the time of committing the offence wherewith they may have been or shall be charged, and by reason of such insanity may have been or may be found not guilty of such offence, and it may be dangerous to permit persons so acquitted to go at large: Be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that in all cases where it shall be given in evidence upon the trial of any person charged with treason, murder or felony, that such person was insane at the time of the commission of such offence, and such person shall be acquitted, the jury shall be required to find specially whether such person was insane at the time of the commission of such offence, and to declare whether such person was acquitted by them on account of such insanity; and if they shall find that such person was insane at the time of the committing such offence, the court before whom such trial shall be had shall order such person to be kept in strict custody, in such place and in such manner as to the court shall seem fit, until his Majesty's pleasure shall be known; and it shall thereupon be lawful for his Majesty to give such order for the safe custody of such person during his pleasure, in such place and in such manner as to liis Majesty shall seem fit; and in all cases where any person before the passing of this Act has been acquitted of any such offences on the ground of insanity at the time of the commission thereof, and has been detained in custody as a dangerous person by order of the court before whom such person has been tried, and still remains in custody, it shall be lawful for his Majesty to give the like order for the safe custody of such person during his pleasure as his Majesty is hereby enabled to give in the cases of persons who shall hereafter be acquitted on the ground of insanity.

II. And be it further enacted, that if any person indicted for any offence shall be insane, and shall upon arraignment be found so to be by a jury lawfully impannelled for that purpose, so that such person cannot be tried upon such indictment, or if upon the trial of any person so indicted such person shall appear to the jury charged with such indictment to be insane, it shall be lawful for the court before whom any such person shall be brought to be arraigned or tried as aforesaid to direct such finding to be recorded, and thereupon to order such person to be kept in strict custody until his Majesty's pleasure shall be known; and if any person charged with any offence shall be brought before any court to be discharged for want of prosecution, and such person shall appear to be insane, it shall be lawful for such court to order a jury to be impannelled to try the sanity of such person; and if the jury so impannelled shall find such person to be insane, it shall be lawful for such court to order such person to be kept in strict custody, in such place and in such manner as to such court shall seem fit, until his Majesty's pleasure shall be known; and in all cases of insanity so found it shall be lawful for his Majesty to give such order for the safe custody of such

A.D, 1799-1800. 39 & 40 George III. c. 94. 599

person so found to be insane, during his pleasure, in such place and in such manner as to his Majesty shall seem fit.


IV. And whereas insane persons have at different times endeavoured to gain admittance to his Majesty's presence by intrusion on his Majesty's palaces and places of residence and otherwise, and his Majesty's person may be endangered by reason of the insanity of such persons: Be it therefore enacted, that if any person who shall appear to be insane shall endeavour to gain admittance to his Majesty's presence by intrusion on any of his Majesty's palaces or places of residence or otherwise, so that there may be reason to apprehend that his Majesty's person may be endangered, it shall be lawful for his Majesty's privy council or one of his Majesty's principal secretaries of state to cause such person to be brought before them or him; and if upon examination it shall appear that there is reason to apprehend such person to be insane, and that the person of his Majesty may be endangered by reason of the insanity of such person, it shall be lawful for his Majesty's privy council or one of his Majesty's principal secretaries of state to order such person to be kept in safe custody in such place and in such manner as according to circumstances shall be ascertained; and for such purpose it shall be lawful for the lord chancellor, lord keeper or lords commissioners for the custody of the great seal of Great Britain to award a commission under the said great seal, directed to certain commissioners to be therein named, to enquire into the sanity of such person, and whether the person of his Majesty may be endangered by reason of the insanity of such person, and for such purpose to direct the sheriff of the county where such person shall be to summon a jury to try the sanity of such person, and whether his Majesty's person may be endangered by reason of the insanity of such person, in the same manner as juries are summoned to try the sanity of persons on a commission in the nature of a writ de lunatico inquirendo; and if upon the inquisition so taken it shall be found that such person is so far insane that the person of his Majesty may be endangered by reason of the insanity of such person, it shall be lawful for the lord chancellor, lord keeper or lords commissioners for the custody of the great seal for the time being to take order for the safe custody of such person, so long as there shall be reason to apprehend that the person of his Majesty may be endangered by reason of the insanity of such person; and if it shall afterwards appear that such person shall have recovered the use of his or her reason, so that there shall be no longer any reason to apprehend any danger to his Majesty's person from the insanity of such person, it shall be lawful for the lord chancellor, lord keeper or lords commissioners for the custody of the great seal for the time being to enquire into the fact by such means as to him or them shall seem proper; and if it shall appear to his or their satisfaction that such person has so far recovered the use of his or her reason that there is no ground for apprehending any danger to his Majesty's person from the insanity of such person, it shall be lawful for the said lord chancellor, lord keeper and lords commissioners respectively to direct such person to be discharged from custody, either absolutely or conditionally, or under restrictions, as to him or them shall seem meet.

The privy council or one of the secretaries of state may cause persons appearing to be insane and endeavouring to gain admittance to his Majesty to be kept in custody till the insanity of such persons be inquired into in the manner herein directed, &c.

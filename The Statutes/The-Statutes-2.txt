THE STATUTES (revised) 1

APPENDIX 732

INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND VOLUME.

The present volume contains the Statutes and parts of Statutes in force from the 1st year of William and Mary, A.D. 1688, to the 10th of George the Third, A.D. 1770. It shows the effect of repeals to the session of 1870 (33 & 34 Vict.) inclusive.

This portion of the work is based on the edition of the Record Commission, known as The Statutes of the Realm, so far as that edition extends, namely to the end of the reign of Anne. The Statutes subsequent to that date are printed from the Queen's Printers' folio copies, the numbering of chapters and sections and the marginal notes (subject to some corrections) having been supplied, when wanting in those copies, from Ruffhead's Edition. The matters so supplied are enclosed in brackets.

In dealing with the enactments comprised in this volume, the same general rules and arrangements have been pursued as are described in the Introduction to the first volume.

The principle of the edition is to print all Acts and parts of Acts, except those of a local, personal, or private nature, not actually repealed: but to this rule the Editor has been authorised to make a partial exception, by omitting certain enactments which have been virtually repealed by the effect of subsequent legislation, and which have been proposed for actual repeal by Bills introduced into Parliament, with a view to the expurgation of the Statute Law, in the present Session. These enactments are described in the third column of the Chronological Table prefixed to this volume as "Virtually repealed." (But see Appendix.)

In the case of Acts passed subsequently to the Union with Scotland, which either wholly or in part have been repealed as to England, hbt are considered to be still in force as to Scotland, notes are appended, indicating the extent of the repeal.

A division of the labour of expurgating and editing the Statutes having been found necessary to accelerate the completion of the work, the expurgation has been continued by Mr. A. J. Wood, and the duty of editing the present and subsequent volumes has been assigned to Mr. G. K. Rickards, who has been assisted in the preparation of this volume by Mr. P. Vernon Smith and Mr. W. L. Selfe, of the Chancery Bar.

And excessive baile hath beene required of persons committed in criminall cases to elude the benefitt of the lawes made for the liberty of the subjects.

And excessive fines have beene imposed.

And illegall and cruell punishments inflicted.

And severall grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgement against the persons upon whome the same were to be levyed.

All which are utterly and directly contrary to the knowne lawes and statutes and freedome of this realme.

And whereas the said late King James the Second haveing abdicated the government and the throne being thereby vacant his [Hignesse *] the Prince of Orange (whome it hath pleased Almighty God to make the glorious instrument of delivering this kingdome from popery and arbitrary power) did (by the advice of the lords spirituall and temporall and diverse principall persons of the commons) cause letters to be written to the lords spirituall and temporall being protestants and other letters to the severall countyes cityes universities burroughs and cinque ports for the choosing of such persons to represent them as were of right to be sent to Parlyament to meete and sitt at Westminster upon the two and twentyeth day of January in this yeare one thousand six hundred eighty and eight in order to such an establishment as that their religion lawes and liberties might not againe be in danger of " being subverted, upon which letters elections haveing beene accordingly made.

And thereupon the said lords spirituall and temporall and commons pursuant to their respective letters and elections being now assembled in a full and free representative of this nation takeing into their most serious consideration the best meanes for attaining the ends aforesaid doe in the first place (as their auncestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating. and asserting their auntient rights and liberties, declare

That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regall authority without consent of Parlyament is illegall.

That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regall authoritie as it hath beene assumed and exercised of late is illegall.

That the commission for erecting the late court of commissioners for eccle-siasticall causes and all other commissions and courts of like nature are illegall and pernicious.

That election of members of Parlyament ought to be free.

That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before conviction are illegall and void.

And that for redresse of all grievances and for the amending strengthening and preserveing of the lawes Parly aments ought to be held frequently.

And they doe claime demand and insist upon all and singular the premises as their undoubted rights and liberties and that tooe declarations judgements doeings or proceedings to the prejudice of the people in any of the said premisses ought in any wise to be drawne hereafter into consequence or example. To which demand of their rights they are particularly encouraged by the declaration of his Highnesse the Prince of Orange as being the onely meanes for obtaining a full redresse and remedy therein. Haveing therefore an intire confidence that his said Highnesse the Prince of Orange will perfect the deliverance soe farr advanced by him and will still preserve them from the violation of their rights which they have here asserted and from all other attempts upon their religion rights and liberties. The said lords spirituall and temporall and common^ assembled at Westminster doe resolve that William and Mary Prince and Princesse of Orange be and be declared King and Queene of England France and Ireland and the dominions thereunto belonging to hold the crowne and royall dignity of the said kingdomes and dominions to them the said prince and princesse dureing their lives and the life of the survivour of them And that the sole and full exercise of the regall power be onely in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said prince and princesse dureing their joynt lives and after their deceases the said crowne and royall dignitie of the said kingdoms and dominions to be to the heires of the body of the said princesse and for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke and the heires of her body and for default of such issue to the heires of the body of the said Prince of Orange.

Upon which their said Majestyes did accept the crowne and royall dignitie of the kingdoms of England France and Ireland and the dominions thereunto belonging according to the resolution and desire of the said lords and commons contained in the said declaration.

# iid person or persons shall have liberty to appeal to the next general quarter

sessions of the peace to be held for the said county riding or division city or towne corporate who upon full hearing of the said appeal shall have full power Order final, finally to determine the same.

And be it further enacted that if any person be removed by virtue of this Churc^en Act from one county riding city towne corporate or liberty to another by to receive a warrant under the hand? and seals of two justices of the peace the church-wardens or overseers of the poor of the said parish or towne to which the two justices of said person shall be so removed are hereby required to receive the said person * and if he or they shall refuse so to do he or they so refuseing or neglecting (upon proof thereof by two credible witnesses upon oath before any justice of the peace of the county riding city or towne corporate to which the said person shall be [soe1] removed) shall forfeit for each offence the sum of five Penalty £5. pound? to the use of the poor of the parish or town from which the said person was removed to be levied by distresse and sale of the offender or Distress, offenders good? by warrant under the hand and seale of any justice of the peace of the county riding city or town-corporate to which such person was removed to the constable of the parish or towne where such offender or offenders dwell which warrant the said justice is hereby impowered and required to make the overplus if any be to be returned to the owner or owners and forWant of such sufficient distresse then the said justice shall committ the Want of dia-said offender or offenders to the common goal of the said county riding city or towne corporate or liberty there to remain without bail or mainprize for imprisonment, the space of forty days.

augmented by the said governors, and no new or different valuation thereof shall be returned to the said governors by virtue of this present Act.

[III.] And whereas by her late Majesties letters patent under her great seal, bearing date the third day of November, in the third year of her reign, incorporating the governors of the bounty of Queen Anne for the augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy, the said governors were authorized to consider, consult, advise, agree upon, draw up, prepare, and propose in writing* to her said Majesty, her heirs and successors, such proper and necessary rules, methods, directions, orders, and constitutions as the said governors, or 'any seven or more of them, with such quorum as is therein directed, should in their discretions judge most convenient to be observed for and towards the better rule and government of the said corporation and the members thereof, and the receiving, accounting for, and managing all and every the revenues thereby granted or mentioned to be granted, and all arrears thereof, and also for and concerning the distributing, paying, and disposing of the same, and all other gifts and benevolences that should or might be given or bequeathed to the said corporation for the charitable ends in the said letters patent mentioned, for the augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy aforesaid; and such rules, methods, orders, directions, and constitutions as should be so proposed, and should be approved, altered, or amended by her said late Majesty, her heirs or successors, and such as should be made by her said Majesty, her heirs and successors, and so signified and declared by her, her heirs or successors, under her or their great seal, her said late Majesty thereby willed should be the rules, methods, directions, orders, and constitutions by which the governors of the bounty of Queen Anne for the augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy, and their successors, should receive, manage, govern, apply, and dispose her said late Majesties royal bounty, and other gifts and benevolences which should or might after that time be given or bequeathed to the said corporation (where the donors thereof should not particularly direct the application thereof) to and for the increase of the maintenance of such parsons, vicars, curates, and ministers officiating in any church or chapel within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, where the liturgy and rites of the Church of England, as then by law established, were and should be used and observed, for whom a maintenance was not then sufficiently provided: And whereas, pursuant to the said letters patent of incorporation, the said governors'did agree upon, prepare, and propose to her said late Majesty certain rules and constitutions for the better rule and government of the said corporation, and her said late Majesty, by letters patent under her great seal, bearing date the fifth day of March, in the twelfth year of her reign, did establish the said rules and constitutions, reserving to her self, her heirs and successors, power from time to time, under her or their great seal, to alter the same, and to give and make in like manner such other rules and constitutions, according to the true intention of the said letters patent of incorporation, as to her said Majesty, her heirs or successors, should seem meet: And whereas a more expeditious and easie method of making and altering the rules and constitutions for the better rule and government of the said corporation may tend to the advancement of the said charity: Be it enacted and declared by the authority aforesaid, that all such

roles, methods, orders, directions, and constitutions as shall from time to time be by the said governors agreed upon, prepared, and proposed to his Majesty,* his heirs and successors, according to the true intention of the said letters patent of incorporation, and by his Majesty, his heirs and successors, approved under his or their sign manual, shall be as good, valid, and effectual rules, methods, directions, orders, and constitutions for the purposes aforesaid, as if the same were made or established under the great seal of his Majesty, his heirs or successors.

[IV.] And whereas her said late Majesties royal bounty to the poor clergy was intended to extend, not only to parsons and vicars who come in by presentation or collation, institution and induction, but likewise to such ministers who come in by donation or are only stipendiary preachers or curates officiating in any church or chapel where the liturgy and rites of the Church of England, as now by law established, are and shall be used and observed, most of which are not corporations, nor have a legal succession, and therefore are incapable of taking a grant or conveyance of such perpetual augmentation as is agreeable to her said late Majesties gracious intentions, and in many places it would be in the power of the impropriator, donor, parson, or vicar to withdraw the allowance now or heretofore paid to the curate or minister serving the cure, or in case of a chapelry, the incumbent of the mother church might refuse to employ a curate or permit a minister duly nominated or licensed to officiate in such augmented ohapel, and might officiate there himself and take the benefit of the augmentation though his living be above the value of those which are intended to be first augmented, and the maintenance of the curate or minister, would thus be sunk instead of being augmented: Be it therefore enacted by the authority [A11 aug_ aforesaid, that all such churches, curacies, or chapels which shall at any time mented hereafter be augmented by the governors of the bounty of Queen Anne for shaiTb^pe^ the augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy, shall be and are bene-hereby declared and established to be, from the time of such augmentations, perpetual cures and benefices, and the ministers duly nominated and licensed and mj. thereunto, and their successors respectively, shall be and be esteemed in law, bodies politick and corporate, and shall have perpetual succession by such politick, name and names as in the grant of such augmentation shall be mentioned, and shall have a legal capacity and are hereby enabled to take in perpetuity and shall be to them and their successors, all such lands, tenements, tythes, and heredita-ments as shall be granted unto or purchased for them respectively by the said such lands, &c. governors of the bounty of Queen Anne for the augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy, or other persons contributing with the said governors as benefactors, any law or statute to the contrary notwithstanding; and that the impropriators or patrons of any augmented churches or donative^ for the time being, and their heirs, and the rectors and vicars of the mother segmented churches whereto any such augmented curacy or chapel doth appertain, and ^therec^ their successors, shall be and are hereby utterly excluded from having or tow, &c. of receiving, directly or indirectly, any profit \>r benefit by such augmentation, and shall from time to time and at all times from and after such augmenta- excluded from tion, pay and allow to the ministers officiating in any such augmented church au1^. and chapel respectively, such annual and other pensions, salaries, and allow- the

ances which by antient custom, or otherwise, of right, and not of bounty, usual pensions,

&c. to the ministers officiating.]

[No rectors, &c. &c. of mother-churches to be discharged from cure of souls.]

[Augmented cures remaining void six months shall lapse to the bishop, &c.]

[If persons intitled to nominate suffer a lapse, but nominate before advantage taken, such nomination shall be good.}

ought to be by them respectively paid and allowed, and which they might by due course of law before the making of this Act have been compelled to pay or allow to the respective ministers officiating there, and such other yearly sum or allowance as shall be agreed upon (if any shall be) between the said governors and such patron or impropriator, upon making the augmentation, and the same are and shall be hereby perfectly vested in the ministers officiating in such augmented church or chapel respectively, and their respective successors.

[V.ft] Provided always, that no such rector or vicar of such mother church, or any other ecclesiastical person or persons, having oure of souls within the parish or place where such augmented church or chapel shall be situate, or his or their successors, shall hereby be divested or discharged from the same; but the cure of souls, with all other parochial rights and duties (such augments!-tion and allowances to the augmented church or chapel as aforesaid only excepted) shall hereafter be and remain in the same state, plight, and manner as before the making of this Act, and as if this Act had not been made.

[VI.] And for continuing the succession in such augmented cures hereby made perpetual cures and benefices, and that the same may be duly and constantly served, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in case such augmented cures be suffered to remain void by the space of six months, without any nomination within that time of a fit person to serve the same (by the person or persons having the right of nomination thereunto to the bishop or other ordinary within that time) to be licensed for that purpose, the same shall lapse to the bishop or other ordinary, and from him to the metropolitan, and from the metropolitan to the Crown, according to the course of law used in cases of presentative livings and benefices, and the right of nomination to such augmented cure may be granted or recovered, and the incumbency thereof may and shall cease and be determined, in like maimer and by the like methods as the presentation to or incumbency in any vicarage presentative may now be respectively granted, recovered, or determined.

[VII.] Provided always, that in case the person or persons entitled to nominate in such augmented cure shall suffer lapse to incur, but shall nominate before any advantage taken thereof by the ordinary, metropolitan, or Crown respectively, that such nomination shall be as effectual as if made within six months, although so much time be before elapsed, as that the title of lapse be vested in the Crown.

[VIII.] And in as much as by the said rules established by her said late Majesty under her great seal, for the management of the aforesaid royal bounty, her said late Majesty was pleased to manifest her gracious intentions to invite private contributions towards augmenting the maintenance of the poor clergy, by ordering, amongst other things, that to encourage benefactions from others, and thereby the sooner to complete the good that was intended by her said late Majesties bounty, the said governors may give the sum of two hundred pounds (which is the stated sum allowed to each cure which shall be augmented) to cures not exceeding thirty five pounds per

annum, where any person or persons will give the same or greater sum or value in lands or tythes; and in as much as the right of presentation or nomination to small livings is of inconsiderable value, and yet it may be a great inducement to such benefactions if the benefactors may have some right of presentation or nomination to the cure which himself contributes to augment: Be it therefore further enacted, that all agreements with such benefactor and benefactors, with the consent and approbation of the said governors, touching the patronage or right of presentation or nomination to any such augmented cure, made or to be made for the benefit of such benefactor and benefactors, his, her, or their heirs or successors, by the Kings most excellent Majesty, his heirs and-successors, under his and their sign manual, or by any bodies politick or corporate, or by any person or persons being of the full age of twenty one years, having an estate of inheritance either in fee-simple or fee-tail, in their own right or in the right of their churches or wives, or joyntly with their wives, made before coverture or after, or having an estate for life, or for years determinable upon his and their own life and lives, with remainder in fee-simple or fee-tail to any issue of his or their own bodies in such patronage or right of presentation or nomination, in possession, reversion, or remainder, shall be respectively good and effectual in the law against his Majesty, his heirs and successors, or against' all and every such bodies politick and corporate, or against the persons so agreeing, their wives, heirs, and successors respectively, and every of them, and against all and every their issue, and against every other person and person^ claiming in remainder and reversion after such estate tail as aforesaid, according to the form of such agreement; and the advowson, patronage, and right of presentation and nomination to such augmented churches and chapels shall be vested in such benefactors, their heirs and successors, as against his Majesty, his heirs and successors, or the said bodies politick and corporate, and their successors, or the said respective persons as aforesaid, as fully and in like manner and form as if the same had been granted by his said Majesty, his heirs or successors, under his and their great seal, and as if such bodies politick or corporate had been free from any restraint, and as if such other persons so agreeing had been sole seized in his and their own right of such advowson, patronage, right of presentation, and nomination in fee-simple, and had granted the same to such benefactors, their heirs and successors respectively, according to such agreements.

[IX.] And be it further enacted, that the agreements of guardians for and on behalf of infants or idiots under their guardianship, shall be as good and effectual to all intents and purposes, as if the said infants or idiots had been of full age and of sound mind, and had themselves entred into such agreements. {Rep., 11 Geo. 4. & 1 Will. 4. c. 65. *.25. |

[X.] Provided always, that in case of any such agreement as aforesaid by any parson or vicar, the same shall be with the consent and approbation of his patron and ordinary.

[XI.] Provided also, that in case of any such agreement as aforesaid made by any person seized in right of hia wife, the wife shall be a party to the agreement and seal and execute the same.

[XII.] And in as much as such benefactors are to be considered, in some degree, as founders and patrons of churches, be it further enacted, that such

said governors to refuse such augmentation, and to apply the money arising from the late Queens said bounty, which ought to have been imployed therein for augmenting some other cure according to the rules then in force.

[XVII.] And whereas the before mentioned Acts of Parliament of the fifth and sixth years of the reign of her said late Majesty, were for the diocese of Chichester not executed in due time, and in many dioceses not with that exact certainty of the yearly values and distinction of medieties in the certificates, as regularly ought to have been; and some small prebends in cathedral churches were, by reason of their being dignities, omitted in some certificates, although they have the cure of souls thereto annext, and are therefore livings with cure of souls within the words and meaning of the said Acts: For supplying the defects in the execution of the said former Acts of Parliament, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the certificate for the diocese of Chichester, dated the twenty fourth day of December one thousand seven hundred and eight, which was received in the Court of Exchequer at Westminster, and is now remaining there, shall be as effectual, to all intents and purposes, as if the same had been sealed and returned into the said Court of Exchequer within the times limited by the said respective Acts of Parliament in that behalf made; and also that all and eveiy the churches, vicarages, and livings, in and-by the said certificate or in and by the certificates made and returned in due time, or any of them, certified to be under fifty pounds per annum, and each mediety therein, shall be entitled to and have the benefit of the said respective discharges by the said several Acts of Parliament, as fully, to all intents and purposes, as if the precise yearly value had been expressed and the medieties distinguished in such certificate and certificates: And further, that it shall and maybe lawful to and for the said governors of the bounty of Queen Anne for the augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy, under their common seal, to be affixt at a court of the said governors, and under the hands of the governors then present, to certifie into the Court of Exchequer the names of such prebends in cathedral churches, under the yearly value of fifty pounds, the prebendaries whereof have the immediate cure of souls of the respective parishes whereof such prebends are denominated, although the same were not named in any former certificate; and such certificate and certificates of the said governors, being returned into the'said Court of Exchequer, shall be as effectual to all intents and purposes of the said two before mentioned Acts of Parliament, as if the prebends therein named had been duly certified within the times in the said Acts limited, and by the persons and in the manner therein directed.

[XVTII.] And whereas notwithstanding the utmost diligence of the bishops to inform themselves of, and certifie into his Majesties Court of Exchequer, all the livings in their respective' dioceses under the clear improved yearly value of fifty pounds, in pursuance of the said Acts, the several livings within the respective dioceses hereafter nampd, though supposed to be under the value of fifty pounds per annum, have either not been certified, or if certi fieri, the certificates of them have been lost, or not duly entred, or by some other mistakes it has so happened that the said livings have not yet bad the benefit designed them by the said Acts: Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for the bishoj* of the sai/J dioceses, at

[CHAPTER XXXVIII.]

An Act for enlarging the Time of Continuance of Parliaments, appointed by an Act made in the Sixth Year of the Reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled An Act for the frequent meeting and calling of Parliaments.

WHEREAS in and by an Act of Parliament made in the sixth year of the reign of their late Majesties King William and Queeh Mary (of ever blessed memory) intituled, "An Act for the frequent meeting and calling of Parliaments," it was, among other things, enacted, that from thenceforth no Parliament whatsoever, that should at any time thenafter be called, assembled, or held, should have any continuance longer than for three years only, at the farthest, to be accounted from the day on which by the writ of summons the said Parliament should be appointed to meet: And whereas it has been found by experience that the said clause hath proved very grievous and burthensom, by occasioning much greater and more continued expences in order to elections of members to serve in Parliament, and more violent and lasting heats and animosities among the subjects of this realm, than were ever known before the said clause was enacted; and the said provision, if it should continue, may probably at this juncture, when a restless and popish faction are designing and endeavouring to renew the rebellion within this kingdom, and an invasion from abroad, be destructive to the peace and security of the government: Be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that this present Parliament, and all Parliaments that shall at any time hereafter be called, assembled, or held, shall and may respectively have continuance for seven years, and no longer, to be accounted from the day on which by the writ of summons this VOL.

[V.] And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no sheriff or undersheriff shall be attached or taken into custody by any officer of the Court of Exchequer, or other person whatsoever, for not being apposed upon any writ or process for not finishing his accompts in due time, Or for any contempt or neglect whatsoever relating to his accompt, but by writ under the seal of the said Court of Exchequer, or by warrant for that purpose to be signed by the lord chief baron, or one of the barons of the coif of the said Court of Exchequer for the time being, to be executed by the marshal of the said court, or his deputy; in which warrant the name of such sheriff or under-sheriff shall be particularly inserted, and his offence particularly specified and expressed.

An Act for the better regulating the Office of Sheriffs, and for ascertaining their Fees, and the Fees for suing out their Patents and passing their Accompts.


[III.] And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the ninth day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, all sheriffs who shall levy any debts, duties, or sums of money whatsoever, except post-fines, due or hereafter to become due to the Kings Majesty, his heirs or successors, by process to them directed upon the summons of the pipe or green wax, by levari facias out of the Court of Exchequer, shall from time to time, for their care, pains, and charges, and for their encouragement therein, have an allowance upon their accompts of twelve pence out of every twenty shillings, for any sum not exceeding one hundred pounds so by them levied or collected, and the sum of six pence only for every twenty shillings over and above the first one hundred pounds; and for all debts, duties, and sums of money, except post-fines, due or to become due to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, by process and fieri facias and extent, issuing out of any of the offices of the Court of Exchequer, the sum of one shilling and six pence out of every twenty shillings for any sum not exceeding one hundred pounds so by them levie4 or collected; and the sum of twelve pence only for every twenty shillings over and above the first one hundred pounds: Provided always such sheriff shall duly answer the same upon his accoinpt by the general sealing day of such term in which he ought to be dismissed the court, or in such time to which he shall have a day granted to finish his said accompts, by warrant signed by the lord chief baron or one of the barons of the coif of the said court for the time being, and not otherwise.


[V.] And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no sheriff or undersheriff shall be attached or taken into custody by any officer of the Court of Exchequer, or other person whatsoever, for not being apposed upon any writ or process for not finishing his accompts in due time, Or for any contempt or neglect whatsoever relating to his accompt, but by writ under the seal of the said Court of Exchequer, or by warrant for that purpose to be signed by the lord chief baron, or one of the barons of the coif of the said Court of Exchequer for the time being, to be executed by the marshal of the said court, or his deputy; in which warrant the name of such sheriff or under-sheriff shall be particularly inserted, and his offence particularly specified and expressed.

[VI.] And for preventing delays and unnecessary attendance of sheriffs in passing their accompts, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the first day of Michaelmas term, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, if any officer, clerk, or other person concerned in or about the passing of sheriffs accompts, shall wilfully retard or hinder any sheriff in the passing of his accompts, or by his wilful neglect or absence, or by other undue means or ways, prevent any sheriff from being apposed or cast out of court in due time, or after payment or tender of his or their due fees herein ascertained, shall refuse or neglect to inrol, make out.

[IX-.] And whereas it frequently happens that the process issuing out of the Court of Exchequer, for levying debts and duties due to the crown, may be in part executed by a sheriff before he be superseded, and afterwards in part by the subsequent sheriff, and no provision hath hitherto been made for settling and adjusting the distribution of the fees and poundage claimed and demanded by them in such cases: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that when and so often as any sheriff shall, by process out of the Court of Exchequer, seize or extend any goods, chattels, or personal estate, into the hands of his Majesty, his heirs or successors, for any debts or duties due to the crown, and shall die or be superseded before a writ of venditioni exponas be awarded to him for sale of the same, or before such sheriff hath made actual sale thereof, and a writ shall afterwards be awarded to a subsequent sheriff, who by virtue thereof shall make sale or disposition of such goods, chattels, and personal estate so seized or extended by such preceding sheriff as aforesaid, in such case the barons of the Court of Exchequer, if then sitting, and if not sitting, the said barons or any one of them being of the degree of the coif, shall order, settle, and apportion the fees or poundage due for such seizure and sale betwixt such preceding and subsequent sheriffs, in such manner and proportions as to him or them shall seem meet with regard to the expence and trouble each Tespective sheriff hath had or shall have in the execution of the said process.

[X.] And whereas the office of under-sheriff, and other offices and places in the disposal, of the high-sheriff, have of late years been frequently sold and let to f arm, contrary to several statutes heretofore made for restraining sheriffs from such practices, and contrary to the oath and duty of a sheriff, whereby many and great inconveniences have happened to the subjects of this realm by the oppressions and exactions of under-sheriffs, bailiffs, and other officers

[Sheriff dying before his office is expired, his under-sheriff shall execute the same in the deceased sheriff's name, till a new sheriff sworn, and be answerable for the execution thereof as the deceased should hare been; and the security given by the undersheriff is to continue.]

[When a sheriff seizes goods, &c. for the Kings debts, and dies or is superseded before sale, and the subsequent sheriff makes sale, &c. the Exchequer may apportion the fees, &c. between the precedent and the subsequent sheriff.]

Tl/TAT it please your most excellent Majesty. Whereas in and by the sixth article of the treaty for the union of the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, (which treaty was ratified by Acts of Parliament passed in either kingdom, and particularly by an Act made in England in the fifth year [6 of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Anne, of blessed memory,) it was provided, that the customs and duties on import and export, settled in England when the union commenced, should, from and after the union, take place throughout the whole United Kingdom, excepting and reserving, as in the said article is particularly expressed; and in and by the seventh article of the said treaty it was provided, that all parts of the United Kingdom should for ever, from and after the union,- be liable to the same excises (excepting only that such beer or ale as are therein described should not, after the union, be liable, upon account of the then present excise upon exciseable liquors in England, to any higher imposition than two shillings sterling upon thirty four gallons English barrel, being twelve gallons the then present Scots measure); and it was by the article last mentioned provided, that the excise then settled in England upon all other liquors should, when the union commenced, take place throughout the whole United Kingdom; and in and by the fourteenth article of the said treaty of union it was provided, that Scotland should not be charged with any duties laid on by the Parliament of _ England before the said union (except such as were consented to in the said treaty), in regard it was agreed, that all necessary provision should be made by the then Parliament of Scotland for the publick charge and service of that kingdom, for the year one thousand seven hundred and seven; providing . nevertheless, that if the Parliament of England should think fit to lay any further impositions by way of customs, or such excises with which by virtue of the said treaty Scotland was to be charged equal with England, in such case Scotland should be liable to the same customs and excises, and have an equivalent to be settled by the Parliament of Great Britain: And whereas by the terms of the said treaty the subjects of Scotland, for preserving an equality of trade throughout the United Kingdom, would be liable to several customs and excises, then payable in England, which would be applicable towards payment of the debts of England contracted before the union, it was by the fifteenth article of the said treaty agreed, that Scotland should have an equivalent for what the subjects thereof should be so charged towards payment of the said debts of England in all particulars whatsoever, in manner therein expressed (viz.), that before the union of the said kingdoms the sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand and eighty-five pounds ten shillings should be granted to her said Majesty by the Parliament of England for the uses after mentioned, being the equivalent to be answered to Scotland for such parts of the said customs and excises upon all exciseable liquors with which that kingdom was [to be charged upon the union, as would be appli-

chattels for the,said arrears of rent, as he, she, or they might have, done by virtue of this or any former Act if such goods and chattels had been put in. any open field or place.

[VIII.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, it shall and may be lawful to and for every lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, or his, her, or their steward, bailiff, receiver, or other person or persons impowered by him her, or them, to take and seize, as a distress for arrears of rent, any cattle Or stock of their respective tenant or tenants feeding or depasturing upon any common, appendent or appurtenant, or any ways belonging to all or any. part of the premisses demised or holden; and also to take and seize all sorts of com and grass, hops, roots, fruits, pulse, or other product whatsoever which shall be growing on any part of the estates so demised or holden, as a distress for arrears of rent; and the same to cut, gather, make, cure, carry, and lay up, when ripe, in the barns or other proper place on the premisses so demised or holden; and in case there shall be no barn or proper place on the premisses so demised or holden, then in any other bam or proper place -wltfch such lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, shall hire or otherwise procure for that purpose, and as near as ifiay be to the premisses, and in convenient time to appraise, sell, or otherwise dispose of the same, towards satisfaction of the rent for which such distress shall have been taken, and of the charges of such distress, appraisement, and sale, in the same manner as other goods and chattels may be seized, distrained, and disposed of; and the appraisement thereof to be taken when cut, gathered, cured, and made, and not before.

[IX.] Provided always, that notice of the place where the goods and chattels so distrained shall be lodged or deposited shall, within the space of one week after the lodging or depositing thereof in such place, be given to such lessee or tenant, or left at the last place of his or her abode and that if after any distress for arrears of rent so taken, of corn, grass, hops, roots, fruits, pulse, or other product which shall be growing as aforesaid, and at any time before the same shall be ripe and cut, cured, or gathered, the tenant or lessee, his or her executors, administrators, or assigns, shall pay or cause to be paid to the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, for whom such distress shall be taken, or to the steward or other person usually imployed to receive the rents of such lessor or lessors, landlord or landlords, the whole rent which shall be the* in arrear, together with the full costs and charges of making such distress and which shall have been occasioned thereby, that then and upon such payment or lawful tender thereof actually made, whereby the end of such distress will be fully answered, the same, and every part thereof shall cease, and the corn, grass, hops, roots, fruits, pulse, or other product bo distrained, shall be delivered up to the lessee or tenant, his or her executors, administrators, or assigns, any thing herein before contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

[X.] And whereas great difficulties and inconveniences frequently arise to landlords and lessors and other persons taking distresses for rent, in removing the goods and chattels or stock distrained off the premisses, in cases where by law they may not be impounded and secured thereupon, and also to the tenants themselves many times, by the damage unavoidably done to such

11 .George II. c. 19.

411

goods and chattels or stock in the removal thereof: Be it enacted by the. Distresses may authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, it shall and may be lawful to premisses, and for any person or persons lawfully taking" any distress for any kind of rent, to impound or otherwise secure the distress so made, of what nature or kind soever it' may be, in such place or on such part of the premisses chargeable with the rent as shall be most fit and convenient for the impounding and secuVing such distress, and to appraise, sell, and dispose of the same upon the premisses in like manner and under the like directions and restraints to all intents and purposes as any person taking a distress for rent may now do off the premisses by virtue of an Act made in the second j7ear of the reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled " An Act for [2 w. & M. u enabling the sale of goods distrained for rent, in case the rent be not paid in c*

a reasonable time," or of one other Act made in the fourth year of his pre- s sent Majesty, intituled " An Act for the more effectual preventing frauds com- [4 Geo. 2.

" mitted by tenants, and for the more easy recovery of rents and renewal c' 28'

of leasesand that it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons whatsoever to come and go to and from such place or part of the said premisses where any distress for rent shall be impounded and secured as aforesaid, in order to view, appraise, and buy, and also in order to carry off or remove the same on account of the purchaser thereof, and that if any pound-breach or rescous shall be made of any goods and chattels, or stock distrained for rent and impounded or otherwise secured by virtue of this Act, the person or persons aggrieved thereby shall have the like remedy as in cases of pound-breach or rescous is given and provided by the said Statute.

[XI.] And whereas the possession of estates in lands, tenements, and hereditaments is rendered very precarious by the frequent and fraudulent practice of tenants in attorning to strangers who claim title to the estates of their respective landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, who by that means are turned out of possession of their respective estates and put to the difficulty and expence of recovering the possession thereof by actions or suits at law:

For remedy thereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and ^t^{t^nse^ts after the said twenty fourth day of June in the year of our Lord one thou- tenanted void, sand seven hundred and thirty eight, all and every such attornment and attornments of any tenant or tenants of any messuages, lands, tenements, or hereditaments within that part of Great Britain called England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and the possession of their respective landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, shall not be deemed or construed to be any wise changed, altered, or affected by any such attornment or attornments: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend to vacate Exceptions, or affect any attornment made pursuant to, and in consequence of some judgement at law, or decree or order of a court of equity, or made with the privity and consent of the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, or to any mortgagee after the mortgage is become forfeited.


[XIV.] And to obviate some difficulties that many times occur in the recovery of rents where the demises are not by deed, be it further enacted by how to the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of be recovered,

412

11 George II. c. 19.

A.D. 1737-8.

where the demises are not by deed.

Rents recoverable from under-tenants, where tenants for life die before the lease is expired.

Provision foi landlords, where tenan i desert the pi misses.

June it shall and may be lawful to and for the landlord or landlords, where the agreement is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satisfaction for the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, held or occupied by the defendant or defendants in an action on the case for the use and occupation of what was so held or enjoyed; and if in evidence on the trial of such action any parol demise, or any agreement (not being by deed) whereon a certain rent was reserved, shall appear, the plaintiff in such action shall not therefore be nonsuited, but may make use thereof as an evidence of the quantum of the damages to be recovered.

[XV.] And whereas where any lessor or landlord having only an estate for life in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments demised, happens to die before or on the day on which any rent is reserved or made payable, such rent or any part thereof is not by law recoverable by the executors or administrators of such lessor or landlord, nor is the person in reversion intitled thereto any other than for the use and occupation of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, from the death of the tenant for life; of which advantage hath been often taken by the under-tenants, who thereby avoid paying any thing for the same: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, where any tenant for life shall happen to die before or on the day on which any rent was reserved or made payable upon any demise or lease of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, which determined on the death of such tenant for life, that the executors or administrators of such tenant for life shall and may, in an action on the case, recover of and from such under-tenant or under-tenants of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, if such tenant for life die on the day on which - the same was made payable, the whole, or if before such day, then a proportion of such rent according to the time such tenant for life-lived of the last year or quarter of a year or other time in which the said rent was growing 'due as aforesaid, making all just allowances or a proportionable part thereof respectively.

[XVI.] And whereas landlords are often great sufferers by tenants running away in arrear, and not only suffering the demised premisses to lie uncultivated without any distress thereon, whereby their landlords or lessors might be satisfied for the rent-arrear, but also refusing to deliver up the possession iremisses, whereby the landlords are put to the expence and delay of recovering ejectment: Be it further ena/ator? by the authority* aforesaid, that from and after the^sald^frenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, if any tenant holding any lands, tenements, or hereditaments at a rack-rent, or where the rent reserved shall be full three fourths of the yearly value of the demised premisses, who shall be in arrear for one year's rent, shall desert the demised premisses and leave the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so as no sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of rent, it shall and may be lawful to and for two or more justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, or place (having no interest in the demised premisses), at the request of the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, or his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, to go upon and view the same, and to affix or cause to be affixed on the most notorious part of the premisses, notice in writing what day (at the distance -of fourteen day's at least) they will return to take a second view thereof; and if

AD. 1737-8.

11 George II. c. 19.

413

upon such second view the tenant, or some person on his or her behalf, shall not appear and pay the rent in arrear, or there shall not be sufficient distress upon the premisses, then the said justices may put the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, into the possession of the said demised premisses, and the lease thereof to such tenant, as to any demise therein contained only, shall from thenceforth become void.

[XVII.] Provided always, that such proceedings of the said justices shall be examinable into in a summary way by the next justice or justices of assize of the respective counties in which such lands or premisses lie; and if they lie in the city of London or county of Middlesex, by the judges of the courts of King's Bench or Common Pleas; and if in the counties palatine of Chester, Lancaster, or Durham, then before the judges thereof; and if in Wales, then before the courts of grand-sessions respectively, who are hereby respectively impowered to order restitution to be made to such tenant, together with his or her expences and costs, to be paid by the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, if they shall see cause for the same; .and in case they shall affirm the act of the said justices, to award costs not exceeding five pounds for the frivolous appeal.

[XVIII.] And whereas great inconveniences have happened and may happen to landlords whose tenants have power to determine their leases, by giving notice to quit the premisses by them holden, and yet refusing to deliver up the possession when the landlord hath agreed with another tenant for the same: Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, in case any tenant or tenants shall give notice of his, her, or their intention to quit the premisses by him, her, or them holden, at a time mentioned in such notice, and shall not accordingly deliver up the possession thereof at the time in such notice contained, that then the said tenant or tenants, his, her, or their executors or administrators, shall from thenceforward pay to the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, double the rent or sum which he, she, or they should otherwise have paid, to be levied, sued for, and recovered at the same times and in the same manner as the single rent or sum, before the giving such notice, could be levied, sued for, or recovered; and such double rent or sum shall continue to be paid during all the time such tenant or tenants shall continue in possession as aforesaid.

[XIX.] And whereas it hath sometimes happened that upon a distress made for rent justly due, the directions of the Statute made in the second year of the reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled " An Act for " enabling the sale of goods distrained for rent, in case the rent be not paid " in a reasonable time/' have not been strictly pursued, but through the mistake or inadvertency of the landlord or other person intitled to such rent, and distraining for the same, or of the bailiff or agent of such landlord or other person, some irregularity or tortious act hath been afterwards done in the disposition of the distress so seized or taken as aforesaid, for which irregularity or tortious act * the party distraining hath been deemed a trespasser ab initio, and in an action brought against him as such, the plaintiff hath been intitled to recover, and has actually recovered the full value of the rent for which such distress was taken: And whereas it is a very great hardship upon landlords and other persons intitled to rents, that a distress

gold was of the touch aforesaid, and if it was not, the same should fre fifffeited; and that all the good towns of England where goldsmiths were should be ordered by that Statute as well as those in London, and that one (for the rest) from each town should come to London to be ascertained of the touch; and if any person should offend against that Statute he should be punished by imprisonment, and ransom at the King's pleasure: And whereas by another Act of Parliament made in the second year of the reign of King Henry the Sixth, concerning the fineness of harness of silver, and the marks with which it should be marked, it was, amongst other things, ordained and established,

, that no goldsmith nor worker of silver within the city of London should sell any workmanship of silver unless it should be fine as sterling, except the same should need soder in the making, nor until the same should be touched with the touch of the leopard's head, if it might bear the same, and also with the workman's mark, on pain to forfeit double the value, and that the workman's mark should be made known to the wardens of the same craft: And whereas by another Act of Parliament made in the eighteenth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled " An Act for reformation of abuses in goldsmiths," it was enacted, that after the twentieth of April then next no goldsmith should work, sell, or exchange, or cause to be wrought, sold, or exchanged, any plate or goldsmiths ware of gold less in fineness than twenty-two carracts, nor with more than necessary soder, nor should make, sell, or exchange any plate or goldsmiths wares of silver less in fineness than eleven ounces two pennyweight, nor put to sale, exchange, or sell any plate or goldsmiths work of silver before he should have set his own mark thereto, if it might bear the same, upon pain to forfeit the value of the thing so sold or exchanged: And whereas by another Act of Parliament made in the twelfth year of the reign of his late Majesty King William the Third, intitued " An Act for appointing " wardens and assay masters for assaying wrought plate in the cities of York, " Exeter, Bristol, Chester, and Norwich/' it was, amongst other things, enacted, that the goldsmiths, silversmiths, and plate workers who then were or should be free of and inhabiting in any of those cities, and having served apprenticeships thereto, should be and were thereby respectively incorporated a company of and belonging to such city, and should be called and known by the name of The Company of Goldsmiths of such city respectively, and were thereby authorized to elect two% wardens yearly, and to elect an assayer in each of the said cities, and that it should be lawful for such assayer to detain eight grains from every pound troy of silver he should assay, and that such assayer should be paid towards his charge and trouble in tho assaying the plate of persons inhabiting any town or place where no assayer was or should be appointed a sum not exceeding sixpence in every pound troy; and the goldsmiths of the town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne have, by an Act passed in the first year of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Anne, been incorporated with the like powers: And whereas the wardens and commonalty of the mystery of goldsmiths of the city of London are and have been a guild or corporation time out of mind, with divers privileges confirmed and enlarged from time to time by several charters from his Majesty's royal predecessors, Kings and Queens of this realm, (amongst other things) for the searching, assaying, supervising, marking, and regulating wrought plate, in order to ascertain the standard thereof, for the good and safety of the public: And whereas his late Majesty

King Charles the Second, by his letters patent under his great seal of England, bearing date the fourth day of January, in the eighteenth year of his reign, reciting that the wardens of the said company, in punishing defaults in the said trade, had been at great charges and at the peril of their bodies as well as the loss of their goods, so that the wardens then late, on account of the menaces and assaults from the workers, could not put into execution the authorities given to them by former charters, and many frauds had been committed; therefore his said Majesty King Charles the Second, by his said letters patent empowered the wardens of the said company of goldsmiths of London and their successors to commit offenders to prison, and to set fines upon them, and to seize and break deceitful wares: And whereas the standards of the plate of this kingdom are both for the honour and riches of the realm, and so highly concern his Majesty's subjects, that the same ought to be most carefully observed, and all deceits therein to be prevented as much as possible; but notwithstanding the aforesaid several Acts of Parliament and charters, great frauds are daily committed in the manufacturing of gold and silver wares for want of sufficient power effectually to prevent the same:

Now, for remedying such abuses for the future, may it please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons, in' this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the twenty-eighth day of May one Fineness of thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, no goldsmith, silversmith, or other person whatsoever making, trading, or dealing in gold or silver wares within that part of Great Britain called England, shall work or make or cause or procure to be wrought or made any gold vessel, plate, or manufacture of gold whatsoever less in fineness than twenty-two carracts of fine gold in every pound weight troy; nor work or make or cause or procure to be wrought or made any silver vessel, plate, or manufacture of silver whatsoever less in fineness than eleven ounces two penny-weight of fine silver in every pound weight troy; nor sell, exchange, or expose to sale or export out of this kingdom any gold vessel, plate, or manufacture of gold whatsoever, made after the said twenty-eighth day of May one thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, less in fineness than twenty-two carracts of fine gold in every pound weight troy; nor sell, exchange, or expose to sale or export out of this kingdom any silver vessel, plate, or manufacture of silver whatsoever, made after the said twenty-eighth day of May one thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, less in fineness than eleven ounces two penny-weight of fine silver in every pound weight troy, upon pain that every such goldsmith, silversmith, or other person for every such offence shall forfeit and pay the sum of ten pounds, to be recovered and disused of as herein-after is mentioned, and for default of payment the offender shall be committed by the court in which judgment shall be given thereon to the house of correction for the county, city, or liberty where convicted, there to remain and be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding the space of six months, or until payment be made of the said forfeiture.

[XI.] And whereas it may be necessary to use a greater quantity of soder in or about one piece of wrought plate more than another, so that the same cannot be ascertained by any general rule, and there being great frauds daily committed by using too much soder in or about, or by putting the same upon wrought plate, and there cannot be any certain rule prescribed for the forwardness in the workmanship that every particular piece of plate, ought to be of before it shall be marked: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty-eighth day of May one thousand seven hundred and thirty nine, it shall and may be lawful to and for any warden or deputy warden of the said company of goldsmiths in London, or to and' for any warden or assayer of York, Exeter, Bristol, Chester, Norwich, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne (such warden, deputy warden, or assayer, being or having been a working goldsmith or silversmith) to adjudge, order, and determine what soder is necessary in or about every piece of plate which shall be brought or sent to the said assay offices to be assayed or marked, and how forward in the workmanship thereof the same ought to be, and whether all the pieces are put or affixed together or not, which are intended to be put or affixed together, on his or their seeing the same; and when such warden, deputy warden, wardens, or assayers, or any of them, shall adjudge any such piece or parcel of plate to be too much charged with soder, or not forward enough in the workmanship thereof, or the pieces not put or affixed together that (as he or they think) are intended to be put or affixed together, or that any such piece of plate is uncapable of being marked as aforesaid, he or they shall and may refuse to permit the same to be assayed or marked for any of the causes aforesaid.

[IV.] Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that where the goods and chattels so fraudulently carTied off or concealed shall not exceed the value of fifty pounds, it shall and may be lawful for the landlord or landlords from whose estate such goods or chattels were removed, his, her, or their bailiff, servant, or agent in his, her, or their behalf, to exhibit a complaint in writing against such offender or offenders before two or more justices

of the peace of the same county, riding, or division of such county, residing near the place whence such goods and chattels were removed, or near the place where the same were found, not being interested in the lands or tenements whence such goods were removed, who may summon the parties concerned, examine the fact, and all proper witnesses upon oath, or if any such witness be one of the people called Quakers, upon affirmation required by law, and in a summary way determine whether such person or persons be guilty of the offence with which he or they are charged; and to enquire in like manner of the value of the goods and chattels by him, her, or them respectively so fraudulently carried off or concealed as aforesaid; and, upon full proof of the offence, by order under their hands and seals, the said justices of peace may and shall adjudge the offender or offenders to pay double the value of the said goods and chattels to such landlord or landlords, his, her, or their bailiff, servant, or agent, at such time as the said justices shall appoint; and in case the offender or offenders having notice of such order shall refuse or neglect so to do, may and shall, by warrant under their hands and seals, levy the same by distress and sale of the gootjs and chattels of the offender or offenders; and for want of such distress, may commit the offender or offenders to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour, without Tmil or mainprize, for the space of six months, unless the money so ordered to be paid as aforesaid shall be sooner satisfied.

[V.] Provided also, that it shall and may be lawful for any person who thinks himself aggrieved by such order of the said two justices to appeal to the justices of peace at their next general or quarter-sessions to be held for the same county, riding, or division of Such county, who may and shall hear and determine such appeal, and give such costs to either party as they shall think reasonable, whose determination therein shall be final.

[VI.] Provided also, that where the party appealing shall enter into a recognizance with one or two sufficient surety or sureties in double the sum so ordered to be paid, with condition to appear at such general or quarter-sessions, the order of the said two justices shall not be executed against him in the mean time.

chattels for the;said arrears of rent, as he, she, or they might have, done by virtue of this ox any former Act if such goods and chattels had been putin any open field or place*

[VIII.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, it. shall and maybe lawful to and for every lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, or his, her, or their steward, bailiff, receiver, or other person or persons impowered by him her, or them, to take and seize, as a distress for arrears of rent, any cattle or stock of their respective tenant or tenants feeding or depasturing upon any common, appendent or appurtenant, or any ways belonging, to all or any part of the premisses demised or holden; and also to take and seize all sorts of com and grass, hops, roots, fruits, pulse, or other product whatsoever which shall be growing on any part of the estates so demised or holden, as a distress for arrears of rent; and the same to cut, gather, make, cure, carry, and lay up, when ripe, in the barns or other proper place on the premisses so demised or holden; and in case there shall be no barn or proper place on the premisses so demised or holden, then in any other bam or proper place which such lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, shall hire or otherwise procure for that purpose, and as near as rfiay be to the premisses, and in convenient time to appraise, sell, or otherwise dispose of the same, towards satisfaction of the rent for which such distress shall have been taken, and of the charges of such distress, appraisement, and sale, in the same manner as other goods and chattels may be seized, distrained, and disposed of; and the appraisement thereof to be taken when cut, gathered, cured, and made, and not before.

[IX.] Provided always, that notice of the place where the goods and chattels so distrained shall be lodged or deposited shall, within the space of one week after the lodging or depositing thereof in such place, be given -to such lessee or tenant, or left at the last place of his or her abode and that if after any distress for arrears of rent so taken, of corn, grass, hops, roots, fruits, pulse, or other product which shall be growing as aforesaid, and at any time before the same shall be ripe and cut, cured, or gathered, the tenant or lessee, his or her executors, administrators, or assigns, shall pay or cause to be paid to the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, for whom such distress shall be takes, or to the steward or other person usually imployed to receive the rents of such lessor or lessors, landlord or landlords, the whole rent which shall be then in arrear, together with the full costs and charges of making such distress and which shall have been occasioned thereby, that then and upon such payment or lawful tender thereof actually made, whereby the end of such distress will be fully answered, the same, and every part thereof shall cease, and the corn, grass, hops, roots, fruits, pulse, or other product so distrained, shall be delivered up to the lessee or tenant, his or her executory administrators, or assigns, any thing herein before contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

[X.] And whereas great difficulties and inconveniences frequently arise to landlords and lessors and other persons taking distresses for rent, in removing the goods and chattels or stock distrained off the premisses, in cases where by law they may not be impounded and secured thereupon, and also to the tenants themselves many times, by the damage unavoidably done to such

AJX lY37^a

11 George II c. 19.

411

goods and chattels or stock in the removal thereof: Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons lawfully taking' any distress for any kind of rent, to impound or otherwise secure the distress so made, of what nature or kind soever it' may be, in such place or on such part of the premisses changeable with the rent as shall be most fit and convenient for the impounding and securing such distress, and to appraise, sell, and dispose of the same upon the premisses in like manner and under the like directions and restraints to all intents and purposes as any person taking a distress for rent may now do off the premisses by virtue of an Act made in the second year of the reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled " An Act for " enabling the sale of goods distrained for rent, in case the rent be not paid in " a reasonable time/* or of one other Act made in the fourth year of his present Majesty, intituled " An Act for the more effectual preventing frauds com-" mitted by tenants, and for the more easy recovery of rents and renewal " of leasesand that it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons whatsoever to come and go to and from such place or part of the said premisses where any distress for rent shall be impounded and secured as aforesaid, in order to view, appraise, and buy, and also in order to carry off or remove the same on account of the purchaser thereof, and that if any pound-breach or rescous shall be made of any goods and chattels, or stock distrained for rent and impounded or otherwise secured by virtue of this Act, the person or persons aggrieved thereby shall have the like remedy as in cases of pound-breach or rescous is given and provided by the said Statute.

[XI.] And whereas the possession of estates in lands, tenements, and hereditaments is rendered very precarious by the frequent and fraudulent practice of tenants in attorning to strangers who claim title to the estates of their respective landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, who by that means are turned out of possession of their respective estates and put to the difficulty and expence of recovering the possession thereof by actions or suits at law: For remedy thereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, all and every such attornment and attornments of any tenant or tenants of any messuages, lands^teifiiwifcii^ qjj, hereditaments within' that part of Great Britain_called Erf^land, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upoirTweed, shall be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and the possession of their respective landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, shall not be deemed or construed to be any wise changed^ altered, or affected by any such attornment or attornments: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend to vacate or affect any attornment made pursuant to, and in consequence of some judgement at law, or decree or order of a court of equity, or made with the privity and consent of the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, or to any mortgagee after the mortgage is become forfeited.


[XIV.] And to obviate some difficulties that many times occur in the recovery of rents where the demises are not by deed, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of

Distresses may be secured, and sold on the premisses.

June it shall and may be lawful to and for the landlord or landlords, where the agreement is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satisfaction for the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, held or occupied by the defendant or defendants in an action on the case for the use and occupation of what was so held or enjoyed; and if in evidence on the trial of such action any parol demise, or any agreement (not being by deed) whereon a certain rent was reserved, shall appear, the plaintiff in such action shall not therefore be nonsuited, but may make use thereof as an evidence of the quantum of the damages to be recovered.

[XV.] And whereas where any lessor or landlord having only an estate for life in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments demised, happens to die before or on the day on which any rent is reserved or made payable, such rent or any part thereof is not by law recoverable by the executors or administrators of such lessor or landlord, nor is the person in reversion intitled thereto any other than for the use and occupation of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, from the death of the tenant for life; of which advantage hath been often taken by the under-tenants, who thereby avoid paying any thing for the same: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, where any tenant for life shall happen to die before or on the day on which any rent was reserved or made payable upon any demise or lease of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, which determined on the death of such tenant for life, that the executors or administrators of such tenant for life shall and may, in an action on the case, recover of and from such under-tenant or under-tenants of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, if such tenant for life die on the day on which the same was made payable, the whole, or if before such day, then a proportion of such rent according to the time such tenant for life-lived of the last year or quarter of a year or other time in which the said rent was growing due as aforesaid, making all just allowances or a proportionable part thereof respectively.

[XVI.] And whereas landlords are often great sufferers by tenants running away in arrear, and not only suffering the demised premisses to lie uncultivated without any distress thereon, whereby their landlords or lessors might be satisfied for the rent-arrear, but also refusing to deliver up the possession of .tfe e <riaffligad jremisses. whereby the landlords are put to the essence aa*1 delay of recovering in ejectment: Be it further .enaafadl 6y the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said^xfwenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, if any tenant holding any lands, tenements, or hereditaments at a rack-rent, or where the rent reserved shall be full three fourths of the yearly value of the demised premisses, who shall be in arrear for one year's rent, shall desert the demised premisses and leave the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so as no sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of rent, it shall and may be lawful to and for two or more justices of the peace of the county, riding, division, or place (having no interest in the demised premisses), at the request of the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, or his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, to go upon and view the same, and to affix or cause to be affixed on the most notorious part of the premisses, notice in writing what day (at the distance of fourteen days at least) they will return to take a second view thereof; and if

A.D. 1737-8.

11 George II c. 19.

413

upon such second view the tenant, or some person on his or her behalf, shall not appear and pay the rent in arrear, or there shall not be sufficient distress upon the premisses, then the said justices may put the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, into the possession of the said demised premisses, and the lease thereof to such tenant, as to any demise therein contained only, shall from thenceforth become void.

[XVII.] Provided always, that such proceedings of the said justices shall he examinable into in a summary way by the next justice or justices of assize of the respective counties in which such lands or premisses lie; and if they lie in the city of London or county of Middlesex, by the judges of the courts of King's Bench or Common Pleas; and if in the counties palatine of Chester, Lancaster, or Durham, then before the judges thereof; and if in Wales, then before the courts of grand-sessions respectively, who are hereby respectively impowered to order restitution to be made to such tenant, together with his . or her expences and costs, to be paid by the lessor or landlord, lessors or landlords, if they shall see cause for the same; ,and in case they shall affirm the act of the said justices, to award costs not exceeding five pounds for the frivolous appeal.

[XVIII.] And whereas great inconveniences have happened and may happen to landlords whose tenants have power to determine their leases, by giving notice to quit the premisses by them holden, and yet refusing to deliver up the possession when the landlord hath agreed with another tenant for the same: Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, in case any tenant or tenants shall give notice of his, her, or their intention to quit the premisses by him, her, or them holden, at a time mentioned in such notice, and shall not accordingly deliver up the possession thereof at the time in such notice contained, that then the said tenant or tenants, his, her, or their executors or administrators, shall from thenceforward pay to the landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, double the rent or sum which he, she, or they should otherwise have paid, to be levied, sued for, and recovered at the same times and in the same manner as the single rent or sum, before the giving such notice, could be levied, sued for, or recovered; and such double rent or sum shall continue to be paid during all the time such tenant or tenants shall continue in possession as aforesaid.

[XIX.] And whereas it hath sometimes happened that upon a distress made for rent justly due, the directions of the Statute made in the second year of the reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled " An Act for u enabling the sale of goods distrained for rent, in case the rent be not paid " in a reasonable time/' have not been strictly pursued, but through the mistake or inadvertency of the landlord or other person intitled to such rent, and distraining for the same, or of the bailiff or agent of such landlord or other person, some irregularity or tortious act hath been afterwards done in the disposition of the distress so seized or taken as aforesaid, for which irregularity or tortious act the party distraining hath been deemed a trespasser ab initio, and in an action brought against him as such, the plaintiff hath been intitled to recover, and has actually recovered the full value of the rent for which Buch distress was taken: And whereas it is a very great hardship upon landlords and other persons intitled to rents, that a distress

[XX.] Provided nevertheless, that no tenant or tenants, lessee or lessee^ shall recover in any action for any such unlawful act or irregularity as aforesaid, if tender of amends hath been made by the party or parties distraining, his, her, or their agent or agents, before such action brought.

[XXI.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, in all actions of trespass, or upon the case, to be brought against any person or persons intitled to rents or services of any kind, his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, or other person or persons, relating to any entry by virtue of this Act, or otherwise, upon the premisses chargeable with such rents or services, or to any distress, or seizure, sale, or disposal of any goods or chattels thereupon, it shall and may be lawful to and for the defendant or defendants in such actions to plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence, any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding; and in case the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action shall become nonsuit, discontinue his, her, or their action, or have judgement against him, her, or them, the defendant or defendants shall recover double costs of suit. {Rep., 5 & 6 Vict. c. 97. s. 2.J

[XXII.] And whereas great difficulties often arise in making avowries or conuzance upon distresses for rent, quit-rents, reliefs, heriots, and other services: Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, it shall and may be lawful to and for all defendants in replevin to avow or make conuzance generally, that the plaintiff in replevin, or other tenant of the lands and tenements whereon such distress was made, enjoyed the same under a grant or demise, at such a certain rent, during the time wherein the rent distrained for incurred, which rent was then and still remains due; or that the place where the distress was taken was parcel of $uch certain tenements held of such honor, lordship, or manor, for which tenements the rent, relief, heriot, or other service distrained for was, at the time of such distress, and still remains due, without further setting forth the grant, tenure, demise, or title of such landlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, owner or owners, of such manor, any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding 5 and if the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action shall become nonsuit, discontinue his, her, or their action, or have judgement given against him, her, or them, the defendant or defendant in such replevin shall recover double costs of suit.

that there shall be' erected, built, or otherwise provided, within every county of this realm of England and Wales, where there is not one house of correction already built, provided, or continued, one or more fit and convenient house or houses of correction, by the justices of the peace, or the more part of them, at their respective quarter-sessions; and that the master or governors of 'the said houses of correction shall have such sums of money yearly as shall be thought meet by the said justices, the same to be paid quarterly beforehand by the treasurers appointed by an Act made in the three and fortieth year of the late Queen Elizabeth, intituled " An Act for the relief of the poor/1 which said Act was to continue for seven years, and till the end of the next sessiv of Parliament, and was further continued by an Act passed in the third ye; of the reign of King Charles the First, intituled " An Act for the continuant " and repeal of divers statutes," unto the end of the first session of the ne? Parliament, and by an Act passed in the sixteenth year of the same rei/D, continued in force until repealed by some other Act of Parliament: And [43 Eliz. c. 2.] whereas by an Act passed in the forty-third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled " An Act for the relief of the poor," it is (amongst other things) enacted, that the justices of the peace of every county or place-corporate, or the more part of them, in their general sessions to be holden next after the feast of Easter, and so yearly, as often as they shall think meet, shall rate every parish to such a weekly sum of money as they shall think convenient, so as no parish be rated above the sum of sixpence nor under the sum of a halfpenny weekly to be paid, and so as the total sum of each taxation of the parishes in every county amount not to above the rate of two-pence for every parish within the said county; and it* is thereby likewise enacted, that the justices of the peace, at their general quarter-sessions to be holden at the time of such taxation, shall set down what competent sums of money shall be sent quarterly out of every county or place-corporate for the relief of the poor prisoners of the King's Bench and Marshalsea, and also of such hospitals and alms-houses as shall be in the said county, and what sums of money shall be sent to every one of the said hospitals and alms-houses, so as there be sent out of every county yearly twenty shillings at the least to each of the said prisons of the King's Bench and Marshalsea; which sums are rateably to be assessed upon every parish, and to be levied and collected as in [u Eliz. c. 5.] and by the said Act is directed: And whereas by an Act passed in the fourteenth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled " An Act how vagabonds " shall be punished and the poor relieved," it is enacted, that the justices of the peace of every county, or the more part of them, in their general quarter-sessions, shall rate every parish at such reasonable sums of money for the relief of prisoners as they shall think convenient, so as no parish be rated above sixpence or eight-pence weekly; and the churchwardens of every parish shall levy the same every Sunday, and once in every quarter pay the said sums to the high-constables or other head-officers; and the said high-constables and head-officers shall pay the money received of the said churchwardens to such person as shall be appointed by the said justices in sessions, to be by them distributed weekly for the relief of prisoners; so much of which said Act as relates to the taxing, levying, receiving, and employing of gaol money was revived and continued to the end of the then next session of Parliament by an Act passed in the first year of the reign of King James the

First, intituled " An Act for continuing and reviving of divers statutes, and for u repealing of some others," and was farther continued by an Act passed in the twenty-first year of the reign of the said King James, intituled " An Act " for continuing and reviving of divers statutes, and repeal of divers others," and was further continued to the end of the next session of Parliament by an Act passed in the third year of the reign of King Charles the First, intituled " An Act for the repeal and continuance of divers statutes," and by an Act passed in the sixteenth year of the same reign was continued in force until repealed by some other Act of Parliament: And whereas by an Act passed in the nineteenth year of the reign of King Charles the Second, intituled " An Act for relief of poor prisoners, and setting them on work," it is (among other things) enacted, that the justices of the peace at their general sessions, a*lhe major part of them, if they think fit, may provide a stock of materials getting poor prisoners on work, in such manner and by such ways as other (ounty charges are levied and raised, and provide and pay fit persons to oversee such work, and make such orders concerning the premisses as they from time to time shall think fit, provided that no parish be rated above sixpence by the week towards the premisses: And whereas an Act passed in the twelfth year of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Anne, for reducing the laws relating to rogues, sturdy beggars, and vagrants into one other Act of Parliament, and for the more effectual punishing such rogues, vagabonds, sturdy beggars, and vagrants, and sending them whither they ought to be sent, it is (amongst other things) enacted, that the justices of the peace at their quarter-sessions may from time to time, when need shall be, by such ways and. means as monies for county gaols or bridges may be raised, cause such sums of money to be raised within their respective precincts and jurisdictions, for the passing and conveying or maintaining of rogues and vagabonds, as shall be necessary for those purposes; which said several rates, when collected, are' to be paid, by virtue of the said several Acts, into the hands of treasurers or receivers to be appointed by the justices at their respective general or quarter-sessions of the peace, and to be accounted for as in and by the said several Acts are recited: And whereas it is apparent that the manner and methods prescribed by the said several respective Acts for collecting some of the said rates are impracticable, the sums charged on each parish in the respective divisions being so small that they do not by an equal pound-rate amount to more than a fractional part of a farthing in the pound on the several persons thereby rateable; and if possible to have been rated, the expence of assessing and collecting the same would have amounted to more than the sum rated: And whereas many and great doubts, difficulties, and inconveniences have arisen in making and collecting other of the said rates: Therefore, that the good ends and purposes of the said several statutes may be answered, and the several sums of money thereby intended to be raised may effectually be collected with as much ease and certainty and as little expence as can be to the parties obliged by the said laws to pay the same, be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the first day of September one thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, the justices of the peace in that part of Great Britain called England, within the respective

Assurance on private ships

[CHAPTER XXXVII.]

An Act to regulate Insurance on Ships belonging to the Subjects of Great Britain, and on Merchandizes or Effects laden thereon.

WHEREAS it hath been found by experience that the making assurances, . interest or no interest, or without further proof of interest than the policy, hath been productive of many pernicious practices, whereby great numbers of ships, with their cargoes, have either been fraudulently lost and destroyed, or taken by the enemy in time of war; and such assurances have encouraged the exportation of wooll, and the carrying on many other prohibited and clandestine trades, which by means of such assurances have been concealed, and the parties concerned secured from loss, as well to the diminution of the publick revenue as to the great detriment of fair traders, and by introducing a mischievous kind of gaming or wagering, under the pretence of assuring the risque on shipping, and fair trade, the institution and laudable design of making assurances hath been perverted, and that which was intended for the encouragement of trade and navigation has, in many instances, become hurtful of and destructive to the same: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the first day of August one thousand seven hundred and forty six, no assurance or assurances shall be made by any person or persons, bodies corporate or politick, on any ship or ships belonging to his Majesty, or any of his subjects, or on any goods, merchandizes, or effects laden or to be laden on board of any such ship or ships, interest or no interest, or without further proof of interest than the policy, or by way of gaining or wagering, or without benefit of salvage to the assurer; and that every such assurance shall be null and void to all intents and purposes.

[II.] Provided always, and \>e it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that assurance on private ships of war, fitted out by any of his Majesty's sub-

19 George II. c. 37.

jecfcs solely-to cruise against his Majesty's enemies, may be made by or for the owners thereof, interest or no interest, free of average, and without benefit the owners, of salvage to the assurer, any thing herein contained to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

[Ill] Provided also, and it is hereby enacted, that any merchandizes or Assurance on effects from any ports or places in Europe or America, in the possession of the s^tn Por-crowng of Spain or Portugal, may be assured in such way and .manner, as if ^gai. this Act had not been made.


[VI.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in all In all actions actions or suits brought or commenced after the said first day of August, by clwe wiAin6-the assured, upon any policy of assurance, the plaintiff in such action or suit, or his attorney or* agent, shall, within fifteen days after he or they shall be Mgvrea. required so to do in writing by the defendant, or his attorney or . agent, declare in writing 'what sum or sums he hath assured or caused to be assured in the whole, and what sums he hath borrowed at respondentia or bottom-ree, for the voyage, or any part of the voyage in question, in such suit or action.

[VII.] And whereas it is unreasonable that any person or persons, body or bodies corporate, subscribing, sealing, or otherwise executing any policy or policies of assurance, should be put to any costs, charges, or expences in a*ny suit or action at law to be brought on such policy or policies, in case such person or persons, body or bodies corporate, is or are ready and willing to pay such damages and costs as shall and may be really and bona fide due thereon, which at present they are liable to, and often forced unjustly to bear, for that in many cases upon such policies no money can be brought into court: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said first day of August, it shall and may be lawful for any person or persons, Persona sued body or bodies corporate, sued in any action or actions of debt, covenant, or ^Moraoce,8 °* any other action or actions on any policy or policies of assurance, to bring to bring the into court any sum or sums of money; and if any such plaintiff or plaintiffs ^m7 shall refuse to accept such sum or sums of money so brought into court as plaintiff not aforesaid, with costs to be taxed, in full discharge of such action or actions, accepting lt' and shall afterwards proceed to trial in such action or actions, and the jury "d iajy not shall not assess damages to such plaintiff or plaintiffs exceeding the sum or sums of money so brought into court, such plaintiff or plaintiffs in every such ma«e8» case and cases shall pay to such defendant or defendants in every such action to pay costa, and actions, costs to be taxed, any law, custom, or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

[XLI.] And whereas it hath been found by experience that the regulation concerning trials in the Court of Justiciary in Scotland, introduced by the fourth Act of the Parliament of Scotland, held in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-five, intituled " Act aneut the justice court," is unnecessary and inconvenient: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that so much of the said Act as directs, that after the debate of the relevancy is ended, the King's advocate or, advocates, or procurators for the pursuer and for the pannel respectively, shall give in to the clerk informations in writing to be recorded in the books of adjournal, to be read in open court at advising, be and is hereby repealed; and that in place thereof, and of the ancient use and custom observed in that court, of advocates or procurators dictating, and the

[III.] And in order to, ascertain the quantum of such non-entry duty, it is hereby enacted, that from and after the said twenty fifth day of March, in all services upon the brief of mortancestry of any heir or heirs, in such lands or heretages as aforesaid, the retour, over and above the setting forth the old and new extent of the lands in such manner as hath been heretofore practised, shall further set forth and express the valuation of such lands and heretages as aforesaid, and the proportion above-mentioned of kuch valuation, and no more, shall be the non-entry duty of such lands or hergftages, preceding the citation in the general declarator of non-entry.

20 George II. c. 50.

[V.] And in order to ascertain the quantum of the feu duty to be payable yearly after the said twenty fifth day of March, by the tenants of vassals of the said lands and heretages heretofore held ward to the superiors thereof, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for the Court of Session in Scotland, and they are hereby impowered and required to take into their consideration the difference in value to the vassals of the change of their holdings or tenures from ward to feu hereby enacted, and what constant annual rent or feu duty, payable to the superior, will be a reasonable satisfaction or recompence for that value or difference, and thereupon to make and publish an act of sederunt, which shall be in force, and observed by all the subjects in that part of the kingdom, unless or until the same shall be altered by a future Act of Parliament; and according to the rules prescribed in such act of sederunt, it shall and may be lawful for all and every the superiors and vassals or parties interested, to settle and adjust betwixt themselves the feu duties to be hereafter payable in place of the tenures hereby abolished or altered; and in case of difference arising, it shall and may be lawful for the said Court of Session, upon application made to them, by bill or petition, on behalf of or by any subject superior of such lands or heretages, or by the vassals or proprietors thereof, summarily to determine the quantum of the said annual feu duty, such as the court shall judge to be a reasonable and equitable recompence to the superior, for the change of the holding hereby enacted, after having heard both parties, or summoned the party called as defender, upon twenty-one days notice; and whatever annual payment the said Court of Session shall so modify shall be the feu duty payable for such lands and heretages as aforesaid, to the respective superiors thereof, and all and singular their heirs and successors, and that yearly at Whitsunday, from and after the said twenty fifth day of March, when the change of holding is hereby enacted to take place, in the same manner as if feu charters had been granted of that date to the respective vassals upon their resignation, containing such change of holding for payment of the annual feu duties so to be modified. [Rep., Stat. Law Rev. Act, 1867.]

[VI.].............................and such modification being made, shall be

inserted as the feu duty payable for such lands or heretages in the future renovations of the infeftments thereof, by the present vassals, their heirs, or successors.

[IX.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no tenure of any lands or heretages by ward holding shall hereafter be created by his Majesty, his heirs or successors, or by any other superior or proprietor of lands or other heretages in Scotland.

[X.] And whereas there are certain lands in Scotland held by the tenure of feu cum m&ritagio, or with clauses de non abenando sine consensu superiorum: It is also hereby enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in all time coming, from and after the said twenty fifth day of March, the casualty of marriage consequent upon such holding, and all such prohibitory clauses restraining the power of alienation, be taken away and discharged..............................

[XI.] And whereas the casualties of single and life-rent escheat, consequent upon the process competent by the law of Scotland for recovering payment of civil debts or performance of obligations, have by experience been found highly rigorous and liable to be abused: Be it therefore enacted by the autho-

rity aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fifth day of March, the casualties of single escheat, heretofore incurred by homing and denunciation of the debtor in any civil debt or obligation, and of life-rent escheat, heretofore incurred by such debtor so denounced, continuing for a year and day unrestored or unrelaxed, be and the same are hereby taken away and discharged for ever; and that from and after the said twenty fifth day of March no single escheat or life-rent escheat shall become forfeited or be consequent upon any such process as is before mentioned, any law, custom, or usage to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.

[XII.] And whereas the methods of procuring entry by heirs, or singular successors, or purchasers of lands in Scotland that are held of subject superiors, heretofore practised, are tedious and expensive: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fifth day of March, it shall and may be lawful and competent for any person who shall be duly served and retoured heir to any of his predecessors in any lands or heretages in Scotland, and to any person who shall purchase or acquire such lands or heretages from the former proprietor or vassal, who was duly vested and seised therein, and who shall obtain from such vendor, or former proprietor, a disposition or conveyance, containing a procuratory of resignation in favour of such purchaser or disp'onee, to apply to the ordinary on the bills in the Court of Session for the time being, praying a warrand for letters of horning to charge the superior, of whom such lands or heretages were respectively held, to receive or grant new infeftment to such heir or purchaser respectively; and upon production to the lord of session of a special retour of the petitioner or party so applying in any such lands or heretages, or upon production of a disposition or conveyance, bearing a procuratory of resignation in favour of such petitioner, it shall and may be lawful for the said lords of session, and they are hereby authorized and required to grant warrand for letters of homing, upon fifteen days, to charge the superior or superiors in the lands contained in such special retour, or procuratory of resignation, to receive or grant new infeftment to such heir, purchaser, or disponee respectively.

[XIV.] And whereas it hath been and may be found necessary for the publick service to erect buildings and make settlements in certain places in the highlands of Scotland, and in purchasing the land upon which such buildings are or may be erected and settlements made, a difficulty may arise by reason of the same being part of a tailzied estate: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for any person who is seised in or possessed of a tailzied estate in Scotland, to sell, dispone, or resign, ad perpetuam remanentiam, any part thereof, which his Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall think fit to purchase, for or making settlements within the same, any law, chart or deed to the contrary notwithstanding.

[XV.] Provided always, that the monies paid as the price of such land, being part of a tailzied estate, shall be laid out and settled to the same uses, and with the same limitations and restrictions, as such land was settled before such sale thereof as aforesaid, or applied for payment of the debts, if any such there be, of the maker of the intail, or other debts that are effectual burdens on the tailzied estate, not being contracted by such vendor himself; and for that purpose the said money shall be paid into the hands of such trustees, who shall for that purpose be appointed by his Majesty, his heirs or successors, by sign manual, and the vendors, which payments shall be good discharges to his Majesty, his heirs or successors, of and from such purchase-money; and such trustees, and the survivor and survivors of them, and the executors and administrators of such survivor, shall lay out the same in the purchase of other lands, and settle and procure to be settled the same, or applied for payment of debts on the same estate, in the manner herein before directed.

[XVII.] Provided always, that the monies paid as the price of such superiority or superiorities, being part of a tailzied estate, shall be laid out and settled to the same uses and with the same limitations and restrictions as such superiority was settled before the sale thereof as aforesaid, or applied for payment of the debts, if any such there be, of the maker of the intail, or other debts that are effectual burdens on the tailzied estate, not contracted by such vendor himself, and for that purpose the monies shall be paid into the hands of trustees who shall be appointed by the vendor of such superiority or superiorities and the purchaser or purchasers thereof respectively; and such trustees, and the survivor and survivors of them, and the executors and administrators of such survivor, shall lay out the monies arising from such sale in the purchase of other lands or heretages, and settle or procure the same to be settled as aforesaid, or such monies to be applied for payment of debts on the tailzied estate in the manner herein before directed.

[XVIII.] And whereas the ancient usage of the vassals of the King 'and other subject superiors being obliged to give suit and presence, or to appear at head courts at certain times of the year, has of a long time been useless, and therefore ought not to be continued: Be it therefore enacted by the authority" aforesaid, that from and after the said twenty fifth day of March no proprietor of lands in Scotland holding of the King or of any subject superior shall be obliged to attend, appear, and give suit and presence by himself or. his procurator at any head court, or be liable to any fine or penalty for default of attendance at such head court, any law, charter, contract, custom, or usage to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

WHEREAS the legal supputation of the year of our Lord in that part of Preamble.

" Great Britain called England, according to which the year beginneth on the twenty-fifth day of March, hath been found by experience to be attended with divers inconveniences, not only as it differs from the usage of neighbouring nations, but also from the legal method of computation in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and from the common usage throughout the whole kingdom, and thereby frequent mistakes are occar sioned in the dates of deeds and other writings, and disputes arise therefrom:

And whereas the calendar now in use throughout all his Majesty's British dominions, commonly called The Julian Calendar, hath been discovered to be erroneous, by means whereof the vernal or spring equinox, which at

the time of the general council of Nice in the year of our Lord three hundred and twenty-five happened on or about the twenty-first day of March, now happens on the ninth or tenth day of the same month; and the said error is still increasing, and if not remedied would in process of time occasion the several equinoxes and solstices to fall at very different times in the civil year from what they formerly did, which might tend to mislead persons ignorant of the said alteration: And whereas a method of correcting the calendar in such manner as that the equinoxes and solstices may for the future fall nearly on the' same nominal days on which the same happened at the time of the said general council hath been received and established, and is now generally practised by almost all other nations of Europe: And whereas it will be of general convenience to merchants and other persons corresponding with other nations and countries, and tend to prevent mistakes and disputes in or concerning the dates of letters and accounts, if the like correction be received and established in his Majesty's dominions: May t it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that in and throughout all his Majesty's dominions and countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, belonging or subject to the crown of Great Britain, the said supput&tion, according to which the year of our Lord beginneth on the twenty-fifth day of March, shall not be made use of from and after the last day of December one thousand seven hundred and fifty-one; and that the first day of January next following the said last day of December shall be reckoned, taken, deemed, and accounted to be the first of the year of oUr Lord one thousand seven hundred and fifty-two; and the first day of January which shall happen next after the said first day of January one thousand seven hundred and fifty-two shall be reckoned, taken, deemed, and accounted to be the first day of the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three; and so on from time to time, the first day of January in every year which shall happen in time to come shall be reckoned, taken, deemed, and accounted to be the first day of the year, and that each new year shall accordingly commence and begin to be reckoned from the first day of every such month of January next preceding the twenty-fifth day of March on which such year would according to the present supputation have begun or commenced; and that from and after the said first day of January one thousand seven hundred and fifly-two the several days of each month shall go on, and be reckoned and numbered in the same order, and the feast of Easter and other moveable feasts thereon depending shall be ascertained according to the same method, as they now are, until the seoond day of September in the said year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-two inclusive; and that the natural day next immediately following the said second day Of September shall be called, reckoned, and accounted to be the fourteenth day of September, omitting for that time only the eleven intermediate nominal days of the common calendar; and that the several natural days which shall follow and succeed next after the said fourteenth day of September shall be respectively called, reckoned, and numbered forwards in numerical order from the said fourteenth day of September, according to the order and succession of days now used in the

rpHIS table contains so much of the Calendar as is necessary for the determining of Easter; to find which, look for the golden number of the year in the first column of the table, against which, stands the day of the Paschal full moon; then look in the third column for the Sunday letter next after the day of the full moon; and the day of the month standing against that Sunday letter is Easter-day. If the full moon happens upon a Sunday, then (according to the first rule) the next Sunday after is Easter-day.

To find the golden number or prime, add one to the year of our Lord, and then diride by 1 9; the remainder, if anv, Is the golden number; but if nothing remainetn, then 19 is the golden number.

To find the Dominical or Sunday letter according to the Calendar until the year 1799 inclusive, add to the year of our Lord its . 9 fourth part, omitting fractions, and also1 1 the number 1; divide the sum by 7, and 2 if there is no remainder, then A is the 3 Sunday letter; but if any number re- 4 maineth, then the letter tUmding against 5 that number in the small annexed table 9 is tike Sunday letter.

For the next century, that is, from the year 1800 till the year 1899 inclusive, add to the current year only its fourth part, and then divide by 7, and proceed as in the last rule.

Note, That in all bissextile or leap-years, the letter found, as above, will be the Sunday letter from the intercalated day exclusive to the end of the year.

rpO make use of the preceding table, find the Sunday letter for the year in the uppermost line, and the golden number or prime in the column of golden numbers; and against the prime, in the same line under the Sunday letter, you have the day of the month on which Easter fhlleth that year. But note, that the name of the month is set on the left hand, or just with the figure, and followeth not as in other tables, by descent, but collateral.

Note, That in a * . bissextile or leap year, the number of Sundays after Epiphany

will be the same as if Easter-day had fallen one day later than it really does.

And for the same reason one day must in every leap year be added to the day of

the month given by the table for Septuagesima Sunday: And the like must be

done for the first day of Lent (commonly called Ash-Wednesday), unless the table gives some day in the month of March for it; for in that case the day given by the table is the right day.

Chester for the time being, have accordingly used to demand and take, and do continue to demand and take, mortuaries upon the death of every clergyman within the jurisdiction of the said archdeacon of Chester; and the said mortuaries consisting of several of the best goods of the deceased, do oftentimes amount to a very considerable part of his estate and effects, and the payment thereof doth very much lessen the small provision which ordinarily the clergy within the said archdeaconry are able to make for the support of their families, and tends greatly to the impoverishing the same:

And whereas the bishops of Chester, as archdeacons of Chester for the time being, are seized of the advowson, right of patronage, and presentation of, in, and to the rectory of the parish church of Waverton alias Wareton in the said diocese and archdeaconry of Chester, and the right reverend Edmund now lord bishop of Chester, at the instance and request and upon the proposal of the greatest part of the clergy within the said archdeaconry, hath consented that all the mortuaries or corsepresents due and payable upon the death of clergymen within the said archdeaconry shall for the future cease and be abolished, so as that in lieu thereof, and as a compensation for the same, the said rectory or parsonage of Waverton alias Wareton, with the appurtenances thereof, shall be annexed to the said archdeaconry of Chester, and held and enjoyed by the said bishop as archdeacon of Chester, and his successors for ever, subject nevertheless to such stipend and provision for a minister or curate of the said parish and parish church of Waverton alias Wareton, and his successors, as is herein after mentioned; and as the carrying such proposal and request into execution and effect would contribute greatly to the satisfaction, encouragement, and benefit of the clergy within the said archdeaconry: Therefore, for the answering, obtaining, and accomplishing the good ends and purposes afore-mentioned, be it enacted by the Bang's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that the aforesaid proviso or clause con- Upon the first tained and inserted in the said Act, and herein before set forth or recited, and all and every clause or proviso contained and inserted in the same Act, the liYing of so far as the same do respectively relate to the taking of any mortuary or ^tofthc corsepresent upon the death of any clergyman within the said archdeaconry mortuaries in of Chester, shall immediately, from and after such time as the said church or TOnr^Chies-living of Waverton alias Wareton in the diocese and archdeaconry of Chester, to cease; shall become void by the death, resignation, cession, or deprivation of John Prescot, clerk, the present incumbent, stand and be absolutely repealed, annulled, and void; and all and every custom or usage, customs or usages, of and for paying, demanding, or taking any mortuary or corsepresent, or any goods, chatties, effects, or things for or in the name of a mortuary or corsepresent, upon the death of any clergyman within the said archdeaconry of Chester, shall, from and after such first vacancy or avoidance of the said church or living of Waverton alias Wareton, be utterly void and totally abolished for ever; and no mortuary or corsepresent, or sum or sums of and com" money for or in lieu of, or in the name thereof, or in commutation for the bep^or0 same, shall be yielded, paid, answered, or satisfied, or be due or payable by or from any person or persons to any bishop of the said diocese of Chester, either as diocesian or archdeacon of Chester for the time being, or to any

WHEREAS the extending and improving of the British fishery is of great Pramble*

" importance to this kingdom, as it not only adds considerably to the national wealth, but is moreover a fruitful nursery of able seamen for the publick service: And whereas the same is greatly obstructed by certain restrictions, exactions, and regulations to which the fishers and curers of fish in North Britain are subject, either by custom or the laws now in force: And whereas it further appears, that it would be very advantageous to trade in general, as well as to the fishery, if the said exactions and restrictions were taken off, and such new regulations made as are more accommodated to the present circumstances of both: And whereas by an Act made in the third session of the first Parliament of the late Queen Anne in Scotland, intituled An Act for advancing and establishing the fishing trade in and about that Queen Anne kingdom, all her Majesty's subjects of that kingdom are authorized and to Scotland, impowered to take and cure herring and white fish, in all and sundry the seas, chanels, bays, firths, lochs, rivers, and so forth, of that her Majesty's

CHAPTER XLVIII.

An Act for regulating the Proceedings of certain Public Companies and Corporations carrying on Trade or Dealings with Joint Stocks, in respect to the declaring of Dividends; and for further regulating the Qualification of Members for voting in their respective General Courts.

WHEREAS by virtue of divers Acts of Parliament, and of royal charters Preamble.

* founded thereupon, certain public companies or corporations have been instituted for the purpose of carrying on particular trades or dealings with joint stocks; and the management of the affairs of such companies has been vested in their general courts, composed of the members at large of such companies respectively; in which general courts every member of each respective company, possessed of such share in the stock-of the company as in and by the said Acts of Parliament and charters is limited with regard to each of the said companies respectively, is qualified and entitled to give a vote or votes: And whereas of late years a most unfair and mischievous practice has been introduced of splitting large quantities of stock, and making separate and temporary conveyances of the parts thereof, for the purpose of multiplying or making occasional votes immediately before the time of declaring a dividend, of choosing directors, or of deciding any other important question; wliich practice is subversive of every principle upon which the establishment of such general courts is founded, and, if suffered to become general, would leave the permanent interest of such companies liable at all times to be sacrificed to the partial and interested views of a few, and those perhaps temporary proprietors:

Be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that Member* dis- from and after the first day of August one thousand seven hundred and sixty 5oting^°m seven, no member of any of the said public companies or corporations instituted general court for the purpose aforesaid shall be deemed qualified to vote or be admitted to 1

give any vote or votes in any general court of any such company, in respect stock in the of any stock transferred to him, her, or them, after the said first day of 6

August one thousand seven hundred and sixty seven, until he, she, or they

shall have been possessed of such stock six calendar months; unless such stock except in the shall have been acquired or shall have come by bequest, or by marriage, or

by succession to an intestate's estate, or by the custom of the city of London, mentioned,

or by any deed of settlement after the death of any person who shall have been entitled for life to the dividends of such stock.

[II.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the several and respective oaths and affirmations which are at present, either by virtue of any Act of Parliament or by any charter of any of the said companies, required to be administered to or taken by the members entitled to vote in the general courts of the said companies respectively, at or before giving their votes, shall, from and after the said first day of August one thousand seven hundred and sixty seven, be altered in such manner as to extend to and comprize the further qualification required by this Act, in respect of the continuance of the possession of such stock as aforesaid; and that the said oaths and affirmations so altered as aforesaid shall, from $nd after

Oaths and affirmations required to be taken by members Toting,

to be altered conformably to the qualification required by this Act,

710

7 George III. c. 48, 49.

and taken accordingly.

No declaration of a dividend to be made, bat at one of the half-yearly or quarterly general courts, at five months distance from the last preceding declaration; nor for more than the half year.

And no question for a proposed increase of dividend to be decided but by ballot taken three days after breaking up of the court.

Publick Act.

the said first day of August one thousand seven hundred and, sixty seven, be severally and respectively administered to and taken by the members "Of such companies, in the place of those heretofore required to be administered and taken.

[III.] And forasmuch as no part of the business transacted by the general courts of the said companies can be of more importance to the general and lasting interest of the companies themselves, or to the preservation of public credit, so closely connected with that interest, than what concerns the fixing from time to time of the dividends to be made out of the profits and produce of their joint stocks among the several proprietors having shares therein: And forasmuch as the provisons hitherto made have not been found sufficient to prevent many great and dangerous irregularities being practised in relation to the making of sudden and unwarrantable alterations in the rates of such dividends: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the tenth day of July one thousand seven hundred and sixty seven, no declaration of a dividend shall be made by any general court of any of the said companies, other than one of the half-yearly or quarterly general courts, at the distance of five calendar months at the least from the last preceding declaration of a dividend; and that no declaration of more than one half-yearly dividend shall be made by one general court; and that, no question upon any proposition for increasing the rate of the dividend shall be decided otherwise than by ballot, to be taken at the distance of three entire days at the least from the adjournment or breaking up of the general court in which such question shall have been proposed.

[IV.] And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that this Act shall be deemed and taken to be a publick Act, of which notice shall be judicially taken by all judges, justices, and other persons whatsoever, without specially pleading the same.

CHAPTER XLIX.

An Act for regulating certain Proceedings of the General Courts of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies.

[II.] Provided always, that every such lease for two lives shall contain a clause obliging the tenant or tenants to fence and inclose in a sufficient and lasting manner all the lands so leased within the space of thirty years, and two third parts thereof within the space of twenty years, and one third part thereof within the space of ten years, if the said lease shall continue for such respective terms; and that every such lease for any term of years exceeding nineteen years shall contain a clause obliging the tenant or tenants to fence and inclose in like manner all the lands so leased during the continuance of such term, and two third parts thereof before the expiration of two third parts of such term, and one third part thereof before the expiration of one third part of such term.

[IV.] And whereas the building of villages and houses upon entailed estates may in many cases be beneficial to the publick, and might often be undertaken and executed if heirs of entail were empowered to encourage the same by. granting long leases of lands for the purpose of building: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall be, and it is hereby declared to be in the power of every proprietor of an entailed estate to grant leases of land for the purpose of building for any number of years not exceeding ninety-nine years.

[V.] Provided always, that not more than five acres shall be granted to any one person, either in his own name or to any other person or persons in trust for him; and that every such lease shall contain a condition that the lease shall be void, and the same is hereby declared void, if one dwelling-house at least not under the value of ten pounds sterling, shall not be built within, the space of ten years from the date of the lease, for each one half acre of ground comprehended in the lease, and that the said houses shall be kept in good, tenantable, and sufficient repair; and that the lease shall be void whenever there shall be a less number of dwelling-houses than one of the value aforesaid to each one half acre of ground, kept in such repair as aforesaid, standing upon the ground so leased.

[IX.] And whereas it may be highly beneficial to the public if proprietors of entailed estates were encouraged to lay out money in inclosing, planting, or draining, or in erecting farmhouses, and offices or outbuildings for the same, upon their entailed lands and heritages: And whereas ^such proprietors may be induced and encouraged so to do, if they, their executors and assigns, were secured in recovering a reasonable satisfaction for the money expended in making such improvements from the succeeding heirs of entail: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every proprietor of an entailed estate who lays out money in inclosing, planting, or draining, or in erecting farm-houses, and offices or out-buildings for the same, for the improvement of his lands and heritages, shall be a creditor to the succeeding heirs of entail for three fourth parts of the money laid out in making the said improvements.

[X] Provided always, that the sum or sums of money laid out upon such improvements by any one heir of entail during his or her possession shall not in any case whatever be effectual to constitute a claim against the succeeding heir of entail for more than four years free rent of the said entailed estate, after deduction of all publick burdens, life-rents, and interests of debts which may affect the said estate as the same shall happen to be at the first term of Whitsunday after the death of the heir who expended the money claimed.

the court to award costs of suit to either party, as the justice of the case shall direct

[XXVI.] And whereas questions may arise concerning the amount of the sums laid out under the authority of this Act, at a great distance of time when the material witnesses may be dead: For remedy whereof, and for ascertaining in due time the amount of the sums so expended, be it therefore farther enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for every heir of entail, after he shall have laid out money upon the improvement of his entailed estate as aforesaid, and shall have completed the improvement of all or any particular part of such estate, to bring, if he shall think proper, an action of declarator before the Court of Session, or a process before the sheriff, in which he shall call the heir next intitled to succeed after the heirs of his own body, and shall in such suit produce proper evidence of the money laid out in such improvements; and the said next heir, or any other heir of entail, shall be intitled to produce proper evidence to set aside or diminish the said claim; and it shall and may be lawful for the said Court of Session, or for the said sheriff, to pronounce a decree for such part of the said sum as by the true intent and meaning of this Act is intended to become a charge against the succeeding heirs in the said entailed estate, which decree, if pronounced by the sheriff, shall become final, unless carried to the Court of Session by suspension within six months after the same shall have been pronounced, and if pronounced by the Court of Session, either in such process of declarator or suspension, shall be final if an appeal is not brought within twelve months.

[XXVII.] And whereas it frequently happens that there are not upon entailed estates mansion-houses and offices suitable to the estates, and fit for the accommodation of the heirs of entail, and that mansion-houses and offices upon entailed estates are sometimes destroyed by fire, or from other accidental causes, or become insufficient by length of time; and it being beneficial to the public to encourage heirs of entail in such cases to build houses and offices suitable to their estates, and fit for the accommodation of their families: Be it therefore enacted .by the authority aforesaid, that every heir of entail who lays out money in building a mansion-house or offices, or in repairing or adding to the mansion-house or offices upon his estate, shall be a creditor to the next succeeding heir of entail for three fourth parts of the money expended by him.

[XXVIII.] Provided always, that the sum or sums of money laid out by any one heir of entail in the building a mansion-house or offices, or in the repairing or adding to the mansion-houses or offices, shall not in any case whatever be effectual to constitute a claim against the succeeding heir of entail for more than two years rent of the said entailed estate, after deduction of all publick burdens, life rents, and interests of debts which may affect the said estate, as the same shall happen to be at the first term of Whitsunday after the death of the heir who expended the money claimed.

[XXIX.] Provided also, that the proprietor of the entailed estate who lays out the money shall previous thereto give notice in writing to the heir of entail next entitled to succeed to the said estate after the heirs of his own body, and record copies of the same, together with the accounts of the money expended and the vouchers thereof, in the sheriff or steward court books

[XXXII.] And whereas it may frequently happen that the inclosing of lands in Scotland may be retarded or prevented, or at least rendered inconvenient, by heirs of entail not having it in their power to exchange small parcels of the lands of their entailed estates for other lands convenient for the entailed estate and more conducive to the improvement of the country in general: For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for proprietors of entailed estates to excamb or make exchanges of land with all and every person or persons, for the conveniency and advantage of the said estates, and for the improvement of the countiy where such estates are situated, by inclosing or otherways.

[XXXm.] Provided, that not more than thirty acres of arable land, nor more than one hundred acres of lands consisting of hills or other grounds incapable or improper by their nature for culture by the plough, of such entailed estates, lying together in one place or plot, shall be given in exchange, and that an equivalent in land contiguous to the entailed estate with which the exchange is to be made shall be received in place of the land given in exchange Jftep., 31 & 32 Vict. c. 84. s. 14.J; and for ascertaining

and adjusting the value of the lands proposed to be exchanged, an application shall be made for that purpose by the proprietor of the entailed estate to the sheriff or steward of the county within which the entailed estate is situated, who thereupon shall appoint two or more skilful persons to inspect and adjust the value of the lands proposed to be excambed or exchanged; and upon such persons settling the marches of the lands proposed to be exchanged, and reporting upon oath that the exchange will be just and equal, the sheriff or steward may and is hereby required to authorize the exchange to be made by

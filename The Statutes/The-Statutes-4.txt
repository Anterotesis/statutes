commissioners may mortage the lands to them for reimbursement.

CLYL And whereas for the different rapes in the comities of Sussex and East Kent there are no peace officers who can act officially for such rapes:

And whereas the rapes in the said counties are the most convenient districts to be appointed as the subdivisions for the deputy lieutenants to execute the several purposes directed by this Act, and do contain within their boundaries several hundreds, to each of which there is a peace officer belonging: And whereas the boroughs and tythings over which there are headboroughs, tythingmen, or other peace officers are uncertain in their boundaries, and often include parts of various parishes, from which great inconveniences arise, both in ballotting for the men to be drawn by lot for the' service of the said militia, and also in the payment of the mopey directed to be paid by the parishes to those who may be allotted to serve: And whereas it would be more expedient that the ballotting for men to serve in the said militia for the counties of Sussex and Kent should be by the division of parishes, to which division there are no peace officers: Be it therefore enacted, that his Majesty's lieu- Churchwarden* tenant, or on his death or removal or in his absence, any three or more deputy in gomex and lieutenants of the comities of Sussex and Kent respectively, may and shall ma

issue oat his or their orders to the chief constable of the several hundreds in liable to serve, the rapes in the said counties where their subdivisions may have been or may he appointed, directing such chief constables to issue their precepts and orders to 4a thurchwardens or overseers of the poor of each parish within their respective bmdreds or other divisions, to return to the deputy lieutenants within their respective subdivisions, at the place and on the days by them directed, iair and true lists in writing of the names of all the men usually dwelling within their respective parishes, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, dtstinpriskwg their respective ranks and occupations, and in like manner in every respect and for such several purposes as are by this Act directed to be done and performed by the constables, tythingmen, headboroughs, or other officers of each parish, tything, or place, within their respective hundreds, or other divisions; and that the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the several parishes in the said counties to whom such precepts and orders shall be issued shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed the officers of such parish, and shall be invested with the same powers and authorities, and be liable to the same pains, penalties, and forfeitures, as the constable, ty thingman, head-borough, or other officer of any parish, tything, or place is invested with or subject and liable to by virtue of this Act

CLYIL And whereas it may happen through neglect or otherwise that in some county, riding, or place the .militia may not be raised according to the directions of this Act; and it is just and reasonable that all his Majesty's subjects should contribute equally towards the expence of raising and supporting a militia for the defence of the realm: Be it therefore further enacted, that Lieutenant*, s the lieutenant or any three deputy lieutenants of every county, riding, and place, where the militia shall be raised according to the directions of this Act, theoumbe^&c. shall on or before the twenty-fifth day of December in every year transmit a certificate to the clerk of the peace, containing an account of the names, of the pe«* number, and rank of the officers, and the number of non-commissioned officers, MtneLecttt, drummers, and private men of the militia of that year, and the time during which such militia hath been trained and exercised; and every such clerk of of the

the peace shall deliver such certificate to the justices of the peace at their ^rter

[26th June 1802.]

[30th June 1808.]

WHEREAS new court houses, gaols, and county infirmaries have been built or may hereafter be built in many counties in Ireland, and it is necessary to enable grand juries to dispose of the ground on which such old court houses, gaols, and county infirmaries stand, and of any buildings or materials thereon, and to grant a sufficient title thereto: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King1s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that in all cases where the grand jury of any county or county of a city or county of a town shall have procured ground to build or erect a new court house, gaol, or county infirmary, and that the same is completed and in use, and that such grand jury shall conceive it expedient to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the land occupied by or in any way appertaining to such old court house, gaol, or county infirmary, or any building thereon, in any county or county of a city or county of a town in Ireland, it shall and may be lawful for the grand jury at any assizes for any such county or any county of a city or county of a town in which such old court house, gaol, or county infirmary is situated, to appoint and nominate any number of persons not less than five as commissioners to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any such ground, or of any building or materials thereon; and such commissioners or any three of them so appointed shall have full power to sell by auction, to exchange, or otherwise dispose of any such ground, or any building thereon, or to dispose of separately or together of any

II And whereas in many cases there is much difficulty in making out a title to grounds that have been so occupied by such old court houses, gaols, and county infirmaries, although there has not appeared any claimant thereto for many years: Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all such ground or any buildings thereon that has been occupied as aforesaid for sixty years and upwards in a peaceable and quiet manner and without any claimant on record in any court of law, such peaceable and quiet possession for sixty years shall be considered as a good and valid title; and such commissioners so appointed as aforesaid or any three of them shall have, full power and authority to convey the interest, fee, and inheritance thereof in as large and as ample a manner as the same was held and enjoyed by the county; and such conveyance by deed, lease, or other instrument signed by such commissioners, or any three of them, and approved of by the grand jury as aforesaid, shall be deemed, taken, and considered as a good, sufficient, and valid title in law, said grand jury nevertheless being first satisfied as to the due payment of the purchase money to the treasurer as aforesaid, or as to any other valuable consideration that may have been agreed for thereto; and it shall and may be lawful for such grand jury to grant a presentment for all reasonable exjiences attending the disposal and conveyance of such ground and materials.

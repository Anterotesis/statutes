EDWARD MONTAGU, Esq^

MASTER IN CHANCERY,

AND ONE OF

HIS MAJESTY'S JUSTICES OF THE PEACE FOR THE COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX, &c. &c.

Dear Sir,

THE last Edition of this Work was honoured with the very respectable name of your Noble Relation, his Grace the late Duke of Montagu, whole character, it is needless to observe, was universally respected ; and whose departure was more particularly felt and regretted by those who had moll frequent opportunities of access, and consequently were best acquainted with his Grace's many amiable virtues: It was not lead sensibly felt arid regretted by that Society, over which he presided, with equal dignity and condescension: A Society, whole objecff, as you well know, Sir, is to give energy to endeavours of the Magistrate, for the supp'refbon. of Vice and Immorality. The efforts of this Society were encouraged in its infancy, and the attendance of its Members was rendered most agreeable, by the politeness of its President, and the affability with which they were uniformly received.

The loss of its fird illudrious President was in due time supplied by another Nobleman of distinguished character, whose integrity, in the highest department

ment of the Law, and of the British Senate, is too 1 well known, to need the testimony of any individual, :: muchlefs such a feeble fuflfrage as the present. His 1 Lordship's declining health unhappily deprived the ' SocrETY too soon of the honour and satisfaction of *1 his Valuable superintendence; which additional stroke -would have been more severely felt, if the same con- ki descension, and the same friendly assistance, were not -confidently expected from the R ight Rev. f Prelate, who now fills the President's Chair.

You, Sir, who have so kindly afforded your va- a luable support to the measures of this Society, when a your other manifold engagements would admit of your attendance, will rejoice to find, that its efforts -have not been ineffectual: But that, on the contrary, its exertions have been productive of much import- ant benefit to the Community. To these we may impute, under the sanction of several recent acts of Parliament, the establishment of a purer Magistracy. in the Metropolis and its vicinity: To these we may' ascribe a very considerable diminution of vexatious litigations j an almost entire suppression of idle and ".disorderiy ivjgrancy, and a far better regulation of : '* public'hqtrfes:

‘ these benefits, you, Sir, mull have been a wit-

. ijefs^ ^pt only in your attendance on our Sessions-;, .Coisrfyixut.'also in your private administration of justice within your populous district, in which you are well known to be diligently employed in reconciling differences; in informing the ignorant j in restraining the vicious j and in promoting the cause of Virtue anc Morality, to the utmost extent of your influence and authority.

The following (it is hoped, improved) Edition of this Work would not have solicited the honourable

f Bishop of London.

[ V ]

patronage of your name, if the Editor had not been, well aware, that candour is generally found to go hand in hand with superior information. The feve-rities of criticism are chiefly to be apprehended from those whose knowledge is superficial, and their di.fpo-fition envious : The Editor has nothing to fear from one, who will be as ready to make allowances for the imperfections in this Publication, as he is able to discover them.

May your health. Sir, and your ability to do good, in a variety of situations, long continue: And may your upright discharge of the duties of a Magistrate for many succeeding years, afford one, amidst a mul -titude of other testimonies, that the Magistracy of the county of Middlesex is, at leaf!, as disinterested and respectable as any other Commission of the Peace in the Kingdom.

I have the honour to be.

With the sincerest respect. Dear Sir,

Your moll obedient and faithful

humble servant and fellow-labourer.

The EDITOR

TO THE

READER.

THE high Estimation in which Dr. Burns Work, entitled, The Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, has long been

holden, encourages the Editor of the to hope,

that another JlfuBure raised, with a similar on so solid a foundation, though to a much less elevated height, will not be deemed unworthy of the public notice. It claims very little merit, but what is derived from a new arrangement of that useful “information, for which this country is so much indebted to the labours of the eminent Compiler already mentioned.

Its merit, if it has any, chiefly consists in pointing out more immediately to the eye of the Magistrate, who may be supposed to have many other engagements on his hands, that line of conduit, which, in almof every emergency, it is his duty to pursue. The authorities, as well from the common, as the fatute law, are indeed less numerous than in many other books of this kind ; yet it is hoped, that they

arc

i

[ viii ]

are sufficiently copious for direction how to proceed in every ordinary case which may occur. The lutes, as to every thing material, are faithfully recited : And though same technical not of the essence of the law,may, for brevity's fake, be omitted, the Editor flatters himself, that what remains will be abundantly sufficient to guard the son who consults them from any error in his decifon. Adjudged cases, for the confirmation of his judgment, may be found at large in many very judicious lections of this fort: The work of Lord Dudley and Ward, and T. Cunningham, Esq; entitled, “ The Law of a Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, &c.” is a most valuable c of information on

this subject. And the Magistrate will find it prudent to have such useful books of reference as that compilation, and also Dr. Burn's Just ice of the Peace, always at his hand. But with all these at his command, he nevertheless fiands in need of some more obvious direction, when he is wishing to dif-patch the business which presents itfelfi with expedition, safety, and satisfaction to himself and others.

It is well known, that several compilations of a fmilar nature with this have been heretofore offered to the public, under a great variety of titles and descriptions: And there is no doubty that the Magistrate has derived no inconfidtrable advantage from the

lights communicated to him by such publications And — valeant quantum valere poffint — is our sincere dejire: We by no means wish to raise the reputation of the following work, by depreciating the merits of any other. The reader is left at full liberty (and this liberty he certainly would take, whether we indulged him with it or not) to call to his assistance those produBions, which he thinks likely to direct, secure, and satisfy him in the discharge of his duty.

In the mean time, when a matter of doubt and difficulty is before him (and such he must expeti will sometimes occur) he will be happy to avail himself of that liberal sentiment of one of the mofl illufrious ornaments of this or any other nation : “ Where the Magistrate appears to have been misguided by an erroneous judgment, without any purpose of doing ill, GOD forbid (fays this venerable Personage*) that the courts of law should not give him credit for the purity of his intention, and put the mofl favourable conflruHion on his condutt, that the case can possibly admit ofr

This is, in fubfance, the declaration, which, com-ingfrom such respectable authority, has doubtless encouraged many to engage in the useful employment of a

Justice of the Peace, who would have been very cautious of expofng themselves to the

greeable consequence of a faux pas in interpreting

the laws. The indulgence here given, emboldens those who are disposed to aB, under the dire Elions of an honest intention, and a plain under funding, freely

to exercise their best judgment; no longer

five, that the want of form, or the of some

legal punBilio, may bring them within the reach of the censures of a superior court.

It is not, however, inf mated, that indifference or wilful negligence is at any fate excuseable in interpreting or enforcing a plain andpofitive the contrary, frequent occafons will offer,

wherein it is impossible to be too minutely precise; cause, in such cases, every advantage will afju/redly be taken of any want of accuracy, or of the smallest inattention to the letter of the law. As a proof of this, and to convince the Magistrate of the necessty of extreme carefulness in his duty, it may not be amiss to observe, that Dr. Burn enumerates not less than twenty instances, in which an Order of Removal has been, or is liable to be, quaffed, on account of some apparently infgnifi cant error in the mere matter of form. All, therefore, which is intended by the encouragement holdenforth, as above, is to remove from the mind of a well-meaning, but timorous Magistrate,

[ xi ]

( J

gifirate, the apprehension more, perhaps,

than censure, for an involuntary error in his dvM ; but no licence is hereby given him to trifle with the obvious directions of a statute, or to adopt a latitude of interpretation, which is neither safe nor warrantable*

It was certainly an instance of equal candour and wisdom to encourage, as much as possible, those fons to flep forward, who, though their rank and situation in life, as well as their liberal education, marked them as mofl proper for this office, had yet been found too generally averse from engaging in it* We will not allow ourselves to impute this ness to a mere love of dissipation, or a mere to business. We are willing to think, that there are veryfew individuals of the above description, in point of rank, fortune, and education, who would not feel great satisfaction in finding themselves materially serviceable to their country, in the discharge of an office so important to the suppression of vice, and to the advancement and security of the public welfare : We have seen, and now fee them, cheerfully foregoing the comforts of domefiic life, and readily withdrawing their attention from their private concerns, in order to devote their time, andfome their fortune and their health, to the arduous duties of a military life: Whence is it then that so few have been found

t xii ]

equally ready to dedicate some portion of their hours to the preservation of public and to the

maintenance of good order and decency among their neighbours ? It could only have arifenfrom the hension of some more than ordinary objlacles and impediments : They must surely have been deterred by the consideration,that, in order to attain to a competent knowledge of the duties of a a,

thorny path was tobepurfued; where no small share of difficulties would meet them by the way; and after all their labour, no inconsiderable danger of carrying would be incurredeven under the best in-

formation, which, 'till of late years, they were able to procure.

It has been our happier tot, to find these objeBionS in a great measure removed: We have seen whdt light has been thrown on the fiudy of the municipal and statute laws, by the ingenious, elegant, and learned Commentaries of that writer.

Sir William Blackstone : And we have good reason to hope, that the chair of Magijlracy will in f uture more easily be filled by perfims of consequence and respectability, well qualified for this useful department in society ; when we reflect, that the fiudy of the common law makes at this time a very considerallepart of academical education.

[ xiii 3

But if no such advantages as theft the

excellent work of Dr. Burn would alone be to remove the principal discouragement, which -merly deterred such, as were not inured to the habits of

close enquiry, and toilsome researches. Since that work has been so universally received, andfojufily admired and approved, the Justice of the Peace has been at a loss for necessary information in almost every

common case: And perhaps the only apology which can be offered for hazarding the following attempt, when a work, so deservedly esteemed, is in almost every , is this: That the four volumes of Dr. Burn, (though no Magistrate ought to be without them, as books of reference) comprise much more, than it is necessary for a Justice of the Peace to inveffgale, in the ordinary duties of his office: From these,

doubtedly,much satisfactory information may be derived on subjects of no inconsiderable importance, though not immediately conne with the duties of a Magistrate.

If the following compendium shall be found in any degree to facilitate the administration by more

obviously exhibiting all that is written in the law on every ordinary subjeB, the Editor flatters himself, he shall have rendered no inconsiderable service to his brethren in the commission; and will think his labours amply recompensed by their favourable acceptance of his befi endeavours,

TT may Teem an unnecessary trespass on the

Public, to offer to their notice this Third Edition of The Magistrate's Assistant; especially when another source has been recently opened upon the same subject, with such a body of information (as appears from the title of it) as must henceforth leave the erring Magistrate altogether without excuse.

The long and well-deserved reputation of Burn's Justice of the Peace, &c. has not, it seems, discouraged another able compiler from coming forward with a Work of equal magnitude, under the title of The Whole Law relative to the Duty and Office of a fujlice of the Peace, &c.; but neither the labours of this learned Editor, Mr. Williams, nor those of his pre-decessor, have induced us to alter our opinion, as delivered on the first appearance of this Work: Its utility as a Manual, or Book of immediate Reference, is still the same : It does not pretend to supersede the necefiity of occasional application to more voluminous publications j but it professes to conduct the upright and well-deligning Magistrate, by a short

and

[ xvi ]

and easy way, and with as little trouble, and as little waste of time as may be, to the point, at which he wilhes to arrive, viz. the Elucidation of the Truth, the Vindication of the Oppressed, the Restraint of the Disobedient, and a due Administration of Justice towards all.

If this point is secured in the following Work, its end will be sufficiently answered in all ordinary cases : And where Magistrates have curiosity to investigate, and leisure to pur-sue their enquiries farther, they will never want the means of useful and entertaining research, so long as the above-mentioned compilations, and all'o the.very judicious Publication, by Mr. Const, from the papers of Mr. Bott, on the Poor Laws, are within V, HO- Ir^rSlS.

Accessary.

Accessary.

Accessary is one that is concerned in the felony by commandment, aid, or receipt.

In high treason, there are no accessaries* either before or after; for all are principals. — In cases that are criminal, but not capital, such as petty larceny, trespass, &c. there are no accelfaries. — But as to felonies by act of parliament, those that counsel or command the offence, are accessaries before; and those that knowingly receive the offender, are accessaries after.

The buyer or receiver of stolen lead, iron, copper, brass; bell.metal, or folder, # knowing them to be stolen, may be convicted, although the principal hath not been convicted; and shall be transported for fourteen years.

Every person, who shall buy or receive any stolen jewel or jewels, or any stolen gold or silver plate, watch or watches, knowing the same to have been stolen, accompanied with a burglary actually committed in stealing the same, or to have been feloniously taken by a robbery on the highway, shall be triable, as well before conviction of the principal felon, whether he be in or out of custody, as after his conviction : and if such person, so buying or receiving, shall be convicted thereof, he shall be guilty of felony, and transported for 14 years.

jetts; so called, because it affrighteth and maketh men afraid.

From whence it seems clearly to follow, that there may be an assault, which will not amount to an affray.

Any one who fees others lighting, may lawfully part them, and also Itay them till the heat be over, and then deliver them to the constables to be carried before a justice, to find sureties for the peace.

A constable is bound at his peril to use his bell: endeavours to part an affray; and to demand the assistance of others, which if they refuse to give him, they are punishable with fine and imprisonment. — And he may either carry the offender before a justice, to find sureties for the peace, or he may imprison him of his own authority for a reasonable time, till the heat be over, and also afterwards detain him till he find such surety by obligation. — But a constable hath no power to arrest a man for an affray done out of his own view, without a warrant from a justice, unless a felony was done, or likely to be done; for it is the proper business of a constable to preserve the peace, and not to punish the breach of it.

A justice of the peace cannot without a warrant authorize the arrest of any person for an affray out of his own view ; yet he may make out his warrant to bring the offender before him, in order to compel him to find sureties for the peace.

All affrays in general are punishable by fine and imprisonment.

The day and place for granting licences shall be appointed by two or more justices for the division, by warrant under their hands and leals, at lead ten days before such meeting, directed to the high constables, requiring them to order their petty conlhbles, or other peace officers, to give notice to the several innkeepers and alehousekeepers within their respective confta-blewicks, of the day and place of such meeting.

The person licensed shall enter into a recognizance in iol. with two sureties in 5I. each, or one surety in iol. as well against theufing of unlawful games, as also for the using and maintenance of good order and rule, to be had and used within the same. If the person to be licensed does not appear, being necessarily hindered, two sureties must be bound for him or her in iol. each.

These three things are especially recommended to the juf tices'care: 1. That no alehousekeeper, upon the Lord's day, should receive, or suffer to remain, any persons whatsoever, as their guclls, in any of their houses or other places, to tipple, eat or drink; other than travellers, and such as come upon necessary business. 2. That they suffer no person whatsoever, resorting to their houses only to eat and drink, to remain there after the hour of nine in the evening in winter, and ten in summer. 3. That they suffer no person, resorting to their houses only to eat and drink, to remain tippling there above one hour, other than travellers.

The recognizance, with the condition thereof, fairly written or printed, shall forthwith, or, at the next sections at farthest, be sent or returned to the clerk of the peace, under the hands of the justices, to be by him entered or filed among the records.

Bail.

BAIL signifies the delivery of a man out of custody, upon the undertaking of one or more persons for him, that he shall appear at a day limited, to answer and be justified by the law. — The difference between bail and mainprise is, that mainpernors are only surety, but bail is a custody.

If a person be brought before a justice, if it appears that no felony is committed, he may discharge him ; but if a felony be committed, tho* it appears not that the party accused is guilty, yet he cannot discharge him, but must commit or bail him.

Jn case of homicide, the offender is not bailable.

If a person has dangerously wounded another, the justice ought to be very cautious how he takes bail, till the year and day be past.

No distinction seems here to be made respecting bail, between such homicide as is malicious, and that which happens by misadventure or in self-defence.

Any two justices (1 i£.) may of common right bail persons indicted at the sessions.

If a person be arrested for manjlaughter, or felony, or suspicion thereof being bailable by law, he shall not be let to bail or mainprise by any justices, but in open sessions, except it be by two justices at the lead (1 and the same to be present together at the time of the said bailment.

And the said justices, or one of them, being of the quorum, shall take the examination of the said prisoner, and information of them that bring him, and the same, or as much thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, shall be put in writing before they make the bailment: — Which examination, together with the bailment, the said justices shall certify at the next general gaol delivery to be holden within the limits of their commission.

And the said justices shall have power to bind all such by recognizance as do declare any thing material to prove the offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery to give evidence against the party on his trial. — And shall certify the same in like manner.

In London, Middlesex, and in other cities and towns corporate, justices may let prisoners to bail, as they might before this adfc; but when they do bail, they are to take and certify the bail and examination as is here directed.

By the declaration of rights, excessive bail ought not to be required.

To refuse bail, where the party ought to be bailed, is a misdemeanor punishable by indictment.

Admitting bail, where it ought not, is punishable by the judges of assize by fine ; or punishable as a negligent escape at common law.

Altho' the constable by his own authority, without any warrant of commitment, may carry offenders to gaol, yet, since the institution of the office of justices of the peace, it is better that they be carried before a justice, to be sent by him to gaol by warrant of commitment.

The warrant of commitment ought to set forth thecaufeefpe-cially ; that is to say, not for treason, or felony in general, but treason for counterfeiting the king's coin, or felony for settling the goods of such a one to such a value, and the like ; that the court may judge whether the offence is such, for which a prisoner ought to be admitted to bail.

Burglary.

BURGLARY is a felony at common law, in breaking and entering the mansion-house of another or outhouses, being parcel of the messuage, in the night, with intent to commit some felony within the same, whether the felonious intent be executed or not.

Every entrance intb thehouse by a trespasser, is not a breaking in this case. If the door of a mansion-house (land open, and the thief enter, this is not breaking. If the window of the house be open, and a thief with a hook or other engine draw-ethout some of the goods of the owner, this is no burglary; — but if the thief breaketh theglass of the window, and draweth out the goods, this is burglary.

Opening the casement, or breaking the glass window, picking open the lock of a door, or putting back the lock or the leaf of a window, or unlatching the door that is only latched, is burglary.

If any person shall enter into the mansion-house of another, by day or night, with breaking the same, with an intent to commit felony, or being in such house shall commit any felony, and shall in the night time break the said house to get out, he shall be guilty of burglary.

If divers come in the night to do a burglary, and one of them break and enter, the rest of them Handing to watch, at a distance, this is a burglary in all.

But if there is a custom for the parishioners to chafe both, that cullom shall continue.

A counsellor or attorney ought not to be chosen churchwarden ; and if he is, he may have a prohibition, by reafoa of his attendance on the courts at Westminster.

Apothecaries, who have served seven years, shall be exempted from the office of churchwarden.

Freemen of the corporation of surgeons in London are exempted.

Also dissenting teachers or preachers, in holy orders, or pretended holy orders.

All persons, who have prosecuted a felon toconviction, and the first assignee of the certificate thereof, are exempted.

Those that pay no church rates, shall have no vote in affairs relating to it, except it be the rettor or vicar.

It is most convenient, that every parish act there be entered in the parish-books of accounts, and every man's hand consenting to it be set thereto; for then it will be a certain rule for the churchwardens to go by.

The rates for the repair of the church shall be laid upon every occupier of lands in the parish, altho' such occupier live in another parish.

If any person find himself aggrieved at the inequality of the assessment, his appeal must be to the ecclesiastical judge.

If any refuse to pay the rates, being demanded by the churchwardens, they are to be sued for them in the ecclesiastical courts.

A quaker, refusing to pay church rates, may be sued, as other parishioners' in the ecclesiastical court; or he may be prosecuted before the justices of the peace, in the same manner as for his tithes.

The foil and freehold of the church is the parson's; the use of the body of the church, and the repair of it, common to the parishioners,. and the disposing of the feats the right of the ordinary.

Every churchwarden is an overseer of the poor, although every overseer of the poor is not a churchwarden.

Tons from criminal proceedings, in some capital cases before secular judges; which was the true original of the benefit of clergy. But this claim of exemption grew so burden some, that it was from time to time qualified and abridged by the civil power; and therefore, if they were indicted in cases cri- minal, but not capital, nor wherein they were to lose life or limb, there the privilege of clergy was not allowed ; and there-J fore not in indictments of trespass or petit larceny. Alio it was not allowed them in high treason.

If the statute enacts generally, that it shall be felony without benefit of clergy, or that he shall suffer as in case of felony, without benefit of clergy, this excludes it in all circumstances,-and to all intents.

When any person shall be convicted of any felony within the benefit of clergy, for which he shall be liable to be burned in the hand, the court may, if they think fit, instead thereof, impose upon the offender a moderate pecuniary fine ; or other- J wife, instead of such burning, in any of the cases aforesaid, except manslaughter, may order the offender to be once, or oftner, but not more than thrice, either publicly or privately whipped, such private whipping to be in the presence of not less than two persons, besides the offender and officer who in- 1 flicts the same; and in case of female offenders, in the presence t of females only. Provided, that this shall not extend to deprive the court of the power now vested in them, of detaining I such offender in prison for any time not exceeding one year, 1 or of committing him to the house of correction or other pub- 1 lie workhouse, to be kept to hard labour for any time not less than six months, nor exceeding two years.

A person admitted to his clergy, forfeits all his goods that i| he hath at the time of the conviction. But presently, upon his burning in the hand, he ought to be restored to the posses- fion of his lands, and from thenceforth to enjoy the profits thereof.

And itisholden, that after a man is admitted to his clergy, it is actionable to call him felon ; because his offence being pardoned by the statute, all the infamy, and other confluences of it, are discharged. ±

If any churchwarden oroverfeer of the poor, or person authorised by him, shall make any payments to the poor in any base or counterfeit money, one justice, on complaint, may summon the offender, and, on proof of the offence, by the oath of one witness, may adjudge him to forfeit not less than 10s. nor more than 20s. to be levied by distress, and to be applied to the use of the poor.

Any person to whom any silver or gold money shall be tendered, that he shall suspect to be counterfeit, may cut, break, or deface such piece ; and if it shall appear to be a counterfeit, the person tendering the same, shall bear the loss thereof; but if the same shall appear to be lawful money, the person that cut, broke, or defaced the same, shall receive the same at the value it was coined for. And if any question arise, whether the piece so cut be counterfeit, it shall be determined by the next justice of the peace, or chief magistrare in a corporation.

Persons taken for coining fatfe money, are not bailable by justices of the peace. But they must take the examinations and informations, and bind over the witnesses to the proper court, and commit the persons accused.

It is not necessary there should be two witnesses in cases of counterfeiting the coin, as it is in other high treasons; but persons may be convicted by one witness only.

2 Hew. 119. Cautions ref-pefting commitment.

PERSONS apprehended for offences which are not bailable, and also all persons who neglect to offer bail for offences, which are bailable, must be committed. Wheresoever a justice is impowered by any statute to bind a person over, or to cause him to do a certain thing, and such person being in his presence, shall refuse to be bound, or to do such thing, the justice may commit him to the gaol, to remain there till he shall comply.

If a prisoner be brought before a justice, expressly charged with felony upon oath, the justice cannot discharge him, but must bail or commit him. But if he be charged with fufpi-cion only of felony, yet if there be no felony at all proved to be committed, or if the fast charged as a felony be in truth no felony in point of law, the justice may discharge him. But if a man be killed by another, though it be by misadventure, or in self-defence, the justice ought not to discharge him, for he must undergo his trial for it; and therefore he must be committed, or at least bailed.

But commitment by the justices of the peace almost in all cases (except for the peace, good behaviour, felony, or higher offences), is but to retain the party till he hath made fine to the king ; and therefore, if he offer to pay it, or find sureties by recognizance to pay it, he ought not to be committed, but to be delivered presently.

All felons shall be committed to the common goal, and not el fe where.

But vagrants, and other criminals charged with small offences, may, for want of sureties, be committed either to the common gaol, or house of correction, as the justices, in their judgment, shall think proper. And they may commit other offenders to the flocks, or other custody, by particular statutes.

By this act, a power is given to any justice or justices of the peace, within his or their respective jurisdictions, to commit either to the common gaol, or to any house of correction, within his or their respective jurisdictions, as to such justice or justices shall seem most proper, vagrants, and other criminals* offen-' ders, and persons charged with or convicted of small offences, as by any law now in force, or hereafter to be made, he or they is or are, or shall be authorized to commit to the com-, jnon gaol.

If a person is apprehended, upon a warrant indorsed, in another county, for an offence not bailable, or if he shall not there find bail, he shall be carried back into the first county, and be committed (or if bailable, bailed) by the justices in such first county.

The commitment must be in writing, ei-ther in the name of the king, and only attested by the person who makes it, or it may be made by such person in his own name, expressing his office or authority, and must be directed to the goaler, Cv keeper of the prison.

It should contain the name-and surname of the party com- «H. H. 577. mined, if known ; and, if not known, it may be sufficient to describe the person by his age, stature, complexion, colour of his hair, and the like, and to add that he refuieth to tell his

name.

It is safe, but not necessary, to set forth, that the party is charged upon oath.

It ought to contain the cause, as for treason, or felony, or fufpltion thereof.

A warrant or mittimus to answer to such things as shall be objected against him, is utterly against law.

It ought to contain the certainty of the cause; if it be for felony, it ought to be for felony ; for the death of such an one, or for burglary in breaking the house of such an one,

If it is for felony, it mull be to detain him till he be thence delivered by law, or by order of law, or by due course of law.

A commitment grounded on am act of parliament, ought to be conformable to the method prescribed by it. The difference is, where a man is committed as a criminal, and where only for contumacy; in the first case, the commitment must be until discharged according to law; but in the latter, until he comply.

Where astatute appoints imprisonment, without limiting the time, the prisoner must remain at the discretion of the court.

It must be under seal; and without this, the commitment is Unlawful.

But this must not be intended of a commitment by the sessions, or other court of record; for there the record itself, or the memorial thereof, which may at any time be entered of record, is a sufficient warrant, without any warrant under seal.

It should also set forth the place at which it is made, that it may appear to be within the jurisdiction of the justice.

It must also have a certain date, of the year and day.

Every person who shall be committed to the common or usual gaol, by any justice of the peace, the said person having means or ability thereunto, shall bear his own reasonable charges, and the charges also of such as shall be appointed to guard him to such gaol: and if any such person shall refuse to defray the said charges, then such justice shall, by writing under his hand and seal, give warrant to the constable of the hundred, or constable of the township where such person shall be dwelling and inhabit, to fell such and so much of the goods and chattels of the said person so to be committed, as by the discretion of the said justice shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy and pay the charges of such his conveying and fending to the aid gaol; the app^aisement to be made by four of the honest inhabitants of the parish where such goods shall be ; the overplus to be delivered to the party.

But in Middlesex, the same shall be paid by the over seers of the poor of the parish where the person was apprehended.

By the habeas corpus aft, the charges of conveying an offender is limited not to exceed I2d. a mile.

If the gaoler shall refuse to receive a felou, or take any thing for receiving him, he shall be punished for the same, by the justices of gaol delivery.

But if a man be committed for felony, and the gaoler will not receive him, the constable mull bring him back to the town where he was taken ; and that town shall be charged with the, keeping of him, until the next gaol delivery.

The sheriff or gaoler shall certify the commitment to the: next gaol delivery.

A person legally committed for a crime, certainly appearing to have been done by some one or other, cannot be lawfully discharged by any one but the king, till he be acquitted on his trial, or have an ignoramus found by the grand jury, or none to prosecute him, on a proclamation for that purpose by the justices of gaol delivery.

Constable.

r

IN some places, at this day, there is both a tythingman and constable, where the tythingman is, as it were, a deputy to execute the office in the constable's absence ; but the constable may do whatever the tythingman may do, but not on the contrary, the tythingman not having an equal power with the constable.

The president, commons, and fellows of the faculty of physic in London, shall not be chosen constables.

Surgeons in London shall be freed and exempted from the office of constables.

Apothecaries in London, and within seven miles thereof, being free of the company of apothecaries, and also those in the country who have served a seven years apprenticeship, shall be exempted from the office of constable.

A sworn attorney, or other officer of the courts at Westminster, may have a writ of privilege of his discharge.

Every teacher or preacher in holy orders, or pretended holy orders, in a congregation tolerated by law, shall, from the time of his fnbscription and taking the oaths, be exempted from the office of constable.

The prosecutor of a felon to conviction, or person to whom he shall assign the certificate thereof, shall be discharged from the office of constable.

If any person, dissenting from the church of England, shall be chosen constable, and shall scruple to take upon him the office, in regard of the oaths, or any other matter required to be done in respect of such office, he may execute it by a sufficient deputy.

The law requires, that every constable be # idoneus homo> that if, apt and fit for the execution of the said office ; and he is consideredto be idoneus who hath, first, honesty to execute his office truly, without malice, affection, or partiality. Second-

ly, knowledge to understand what he ought to do. Thirdly, ability, as well in substance or estate, as in body, that so he may intend and execute his office diligently, and not through impotency of body, or want, neglect his duty. And if any shall be chosen constable, who is not thus'qualified, he may by law be discharged of his said office, and another fit man be appointed in his place. In which case, a summgns may be directed to several inhabitants of the parish to appear before the justice for him to make choice of one of them to take the oath, &c.

The petty constable ought to be chosen in the leet; and the high constable (properly so called) in the tom, which is the general leet of the whole hundred.

They are to be sworn and placed in their office by the lord or his steward, or by the sheriff respectively, as being judge of the court.

But now the usual manner is, that the high constables of hundreds be chosen either at the quarter sessions, or by the greater number of the justices of the division.

And every petty constable, being a principal peace officer, and it being necessary for the preservation of the peace, that every vill should be furnished with one; the justices of the peace have, ever tince the institution of their office, taken upon them, as conservators of the peace, not only to swear the petty constables, that have been chosen at a torn or leet, but also to nominate and swear those who have not been chosen at any such court, on the neglect of the sheriffs or lords to hold their court, or to take care that such officers are appointed in them. And this power of the justices of the peace having been confirmed by the uninterrupted usage of many ages, shall not now be disputed, but shall be presumed to be established upon sufficient authority.

Justices of the peace had power to nominate and swear constables, on the default of the torn or leet, before the statute of 13 14 C. 2. c. 12. If a constable shall die, or go out of the

parish, any two justices may make and swear a new one, 'till the lord shall hold a leet, or 'till the next quarter sessions, who shall approve of the officer so made and sworn, or appoint another; and if any officer shall continue above a year in his office, the justices in their quarter sessions may discharge him, and put in another, 'till the lord shall hold a court.

If constables, lawfully chosen, refuse to be sworn, a justice of the peace may bind them over to the assizes or sessions, there to be indicted.

High constables are to take the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, as other persons who qualify for offices ; but petty constables are exempted.

Every high and petty constable is, by the common law, conservator of the peace ; and therefore, if any man shall make an affray or break the peace, the constable may commit.

iim to the flocks or other fafecuflody for the present, and afterwards may carry him before a justice or to gaol, until he shall find surety for the peace.

But he cannot require surety of the peace, unless the offence be upon his own view; for he cannot take a man's oath, because he is not a judge of record.

The con liable is a proper officer to a justice of the peace, and bound to execute his warrants, and therefore it hath been resolved, that where a statute authorizes a justice of the peace to convidl a man of a crime, and to levy the penalty by warrant of distress, without saying to whom such warrant shall be directed, or by whom it shall be executed, the constable is the proper officer to serve such warrant, and indictable for difo-beying it.

No action shall be brought against any constable, or other person acting by his order, and in his aid, for any thing done in obedience to the warrant of a justice of the peace, until demand hath been made by the party, or his attorney, in writing, signed by the party demanding the same, of the perusal and copy of such warrant, and the same hath been refused or neglected for six days after such demand; and if such action I be brought jointly against the justice and constable, on proof of such warrant, the jury shall find for the constable ; and if the verdict be given against the justice, the plaintiff shall receive his colls against him, to be taxed in such manner by the proper officer, as to include such colls as the plaintiff is liable to pay to such defendant, for whom such verdict shall be found as aforesaid.

The constable ought not to return the warrant to the justice, but to keep it for his own junification ; but he mull certify to the justice what he hath done in the execution thereof.

The constable executing a justice's warrant, for levying a penalty, or other sum of money directed by an act of parliament, by distress, may deduCl his own reasonable charges of taking, keeping, and felling the goods distrained ; returning the overplus on demand, after such penalty or sum of money and charges are deducted. See Commitment.

Every constable, or other such officer, shall, every three months, and within fourteen days after he shall go out of his office, deliver to the overseers a just account in writing, fairly entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and signed by him, of all sums by him expended on account of the said parish, township, or place, in all cases not hitherto provided for by law, and alfoofall sums received by him on the account of the said parish, township, or place; and the overseers shall, within the next fourteen days after the account shall be so delivered, lay the same before the inhabitants, and, if approved by the majority of them, the overseers shall payout of the poor rate such fun* as shall appear to be due on the said account: But if the account, or any part thereof, shall be disallowed,

the overseers shall deliver back to the constable, or other officer, such book of accounts; who may then produce the said. book to a justice, giving reasonable notice thereof to the overseers ; which justice shall examine the same, and hear and determine any objection that shall be made to the account, and settle the sum which shall appear to him to be due, and enter the same in the account, and sign his name thereto; and the overseers shall pay th,e same accordingly. Provided, that if the overseer shall find that the parish, township, or place is aggrieved by any thing done or omitted by the said constable, or other officer, or by the justice, he may, giving reasonable notice to the said justice, constable, or other officer, appeal to the next general or quarter sessions. And the justices in sessions may, from time to time, laydown or alter such rules and regulations as to any costs or charges to be allowed to any person by virtue of this a &, as to them shall seem just; which rules and regulations having received the appro- : bation and signature of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding, and not otherwise, on all persons whatsoever.

The high constables shall, at the general or quarter sessions, if thereunto required, account for the general county rate by them received, on pain of being committed to gaol until they shall account; and all their accounts and vouchers shall, after having been passed at the said sessions, be deposited with the clerk of the peace, to be kept amongst the records, and inspec-ted by any justice without fee.

If there shall be cause to remove and put a high constable from his place, it shall be done by the greater part of the justices of that division, or at the sessions.

The justices of the peace have also used, for good cause, to displace all such constables as have been chosen and sworn by them.

Conviction.

WHERE afpecial power is given to a justice of the peace

by act of parliament, to convict an offender in a sum- . mary manner, without a trial by jury, it must appear that he I hath strictly pursued that power; otherwise the common law will break in upon him, and level all his proceedings. There- E fore he must proceed according to the course of common law in I trials by juries, and consider himself only as constituted in the ' place both of judge and jury. There must be an information or charge against a person ; then he must be summoned, or have L notice of such charge, and have an opportunity to make such : defence; and the evidence against him must be such as the common law approves, unless the statute specially directeth L otherwise then, if the person be found guilty, there must |

be a con vision, judgment, and execution, all according to the course of the common law, directed and influenced by the spe-eial authority given by statute; and, in the conclusion, there mull be a record of the whole proceeding, wherein the justice mull set forth the particular manner and circumstances ; so that, if he shall be called to account by any superior court, it may appear that he hath conformed to the law, and not exceeded the bounds prescribed to his jurisdiction.

TO buy or fell corn in the iheaf, before it is threlhed and 3 Infl. 197. measured, is against the common law of £ngland. f0,<i

The constable refusing, shall be committed by the justice, till he conform.

The inspector of the returns of corn shall demand of every 2i c. 3. e. 50. cornfactor, in the Corn-Exchange, in Mark-lane, a weekly Inspeaors. return of the several quantities of corn or grain by him bona jidt fold and delivered in such week, as also the name or names of the purchaser or purchasers thereof, which return shall be signed by each cornfactor delivering the same, and a transcript of such account shall be published in the London Gazette weekly ; which shall be deemed to have been the average prices, during each respective week, in Kent, Essex, and London.

CORONERS are ancient officers by the common law, so called because they deal principally with the pleas of the crown, and were of old time the principal conservators of the peace.

In ancient times, this office was of great estimation; for none could have it under the degree of a knight.

The coroner shall be chosen in the county court, by the commons of the same county.

And none but freeholders have a voice at such election.

When any person comes to an unnatural death, the town- ship shall give notice thereof to the coroner. Otherwise if the body be interred before he come, the township shall be amerced. - N

When notice is given to the coroner, he is to issue a precept to the constablea of the four, five, or fix next townships, to return a competent number of good and lawful men of their townships, to appear before him in such a place, and to make an inquisition touching the matter. Or he may fend his precept to the constable of the hundred.

These are to be at least twelve.

If a man break the pound, or the lock of it, or part of it, he greatly offendeth against the peace, and therefore hue and cry is to be levied against him, and the party who distrained may take the goods again, wheresoever he shall find them, and impound them again.

If any tenant at rack rent, or where the rent reserved shall be full three-fourths of the yearly value of the demised pre- Tenant desert-mises, who shall be in arrear for one year's rent, shall desert in8 the premises, two justices (having no interest in the premises) may, at the request of the landlord, go upon and view the same, and affix on the most notorious part of the premises, notice in writing, what day (at the distance of fourteen days at the lead) they will return to take a second view; and if on such second view, the tenant shall not appear and pay the rent, or there shall not be sufficient distress on the premises, then the justices may put the landlord into possession, and the lease as to such demise shall from thence be void. But the tenant may appeal to the next justice or justices of assize; who may award costs to either party. And the justices in this, and all other the like cases, ought to make a record of the whole proceedings, to be produced afterwards in case of an action brought against the landlord by such tenant.

In all cases where any justice of the peace is or shall be required or impowered by any act of parliament, to issue a warrant of distress, for the levying of any penalty inflicted, or any fora of money directed to be paid by such ad, it shall be lawful for the justice granting such warrant, therein to order and direct the goods and chattels so to be distrained, to be sold and disposed of within a certain time to be limited in such warrant, not less than four days, nor more than eight days, unless the penalty or sum of money for which such distress shall be made, together with the reasonable charges of taking and keeping such distress, be sooner paid.

Drunkenness.

ALL constables, churchwardens, aleconners, and fidefmen, shall be sworn to present the offence of drunkenness. Every person, who shall be drunk, and thereof shall becon-victed before one justice, or mayor, on view, confession, or oath of one witness, shall forfeit, for the first offence, 5s. to be paid within one week, to the churchwardens, for the use of the poor; and if he shall refuse, it shall be levied by distress; and if the offender be not able to pay the said sum of 5s. he shall be committed to the flocks, thereto remain for the space of fix hours.

And if any constable, or other inferior officer, do neglect the due correction of the offender, every person so offending shall forfeit 10s. to be paid to the churchwardens, for the use of the poor. And if any person, once convicted of drunkenness, shall after that be again convicted of the like offence, he shall be bounden with two sureties in a recognizance or obligation

If any alehouse-keeper shall be convicted of being drunk, he shall, besides the penalties above-mentioned, be utterly disabled to keep any such alehouse, for the space of three years next ensuing theconviction.

Drunkenness is no extenuation of a crime, except it be involuntary.

Escape.

AN escape is, where one that is arrested gaineth his liberty, before he is delivered by course of law.

Wherever a person is found guilty upon an indictment or presentment of a negligent escape of a criminal actually in his custody, he is punishable by fine and imprisonment, according to the quality of the offence.

If any person shall assist any prisoner to attempt his escape from any gaol, if such prisoner was then attainted or convicted of treason or felony (except petty larceny), or lawfully committed to, or detained in any gaol, for treason or felony (except petty larceny) expressed in the warrant of commitment, he shall be guilty of felony, and be transported for seven years; and if such prisoner was then convicted of, or detained in gaol for petty larceny, or any other crime not being treason or felony, expressed in the warrant of commitment, or was then in gaol for debt amounting to iool. he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and be liable to fine and imprisonment. And if any person shall convey, or cause to be conveyed, any disguise, instrument, or arms, to any prisoner in gaol, he shall be guilty of felony, and be transported for seven years, or be liable to fine and imprisonment. If any person shall assist a prisoner to attempt to escape from any constable or other person, who shall have lawful charge of him, he shall be guilty of felony, and be transported for seven years. All prosecutions on this act to be commenced within a year after the offence committed.

Estreat.

ESTREAT (extraSlum) is used for the true copy or note of some original writing or record, and especially of fines and amerciaments, imposed in the rolls of a court, to be levied by the bailiff or other officer.

In levying, the sheriff shall shew the estreats under the seal of the exchequer, to the party indebted, on pain of treble damages to the party, and fine to the king, on conviction before the justices of the peace, or other justices.

And the sheriff shall make no estreats to levy his own amerciaments, till two justices (1 QJ to be named at Michaelmas sessions by the custos rotulorum, or, in his absence, by the eldest in the commission, have inspected his books; and the said estreats shall be indented betwixt the said justices and sheriff, sealed with their seals, the one part to remain with the justices, and the other with the sheriff: and the persons who shall gather the said amerciaments, shall be sworn by the said justices, that they shall take no more than is forfeited, and contained in the said estreats.

Evidence.

An attainder, judgment, or conviction of treason, felony, perjury, or forgery on 5 EL and also judgment to Hand on the pillory, or to be whipped or branded, are good causes of exception against a witness, while they continue in force.

The compulsory means to bring in witnesses are of two kinds. 1. By process offubpcena, issued in the king's name, by the justices, or others, where the trial is to be. 2. (which is the more ordinary and more effectual means in criminal cases) the justices that take the examination of the person accused, and the information of the witnesses, may, at that time, or at any time after, and before the trial, bind over the witnesses to appear at the sessions; and in case o i their refusal, either to come, or to be bound over, may commit them for their contempt in such refusal.

When any poor person shall appear on recognizance in any court to give evidence, the court may order the treasurer to pay him such sum as they shall think reasonable, except in Middlesex, where the same shall be paid by the ovetfeers of the poor where the person was apprehended.

The justices in sessions, from time to time, may lay down or alter such rules and regulations concerning any costs or charges to be allowed to any person by virtue of this act, as to them shall seem just ; which rules and regulations, having received the approbation and (ignature of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding on all persons whatsoever.

If any person, upon whom a process out of any of the courts of record shall be served, to testify or depose concerning any matter depending therein, and having tendered unto him a reasonable sum for his costs and charges, do not appear according to the tenor of the process, having not a lawful and reasonable impediment, he shall forfeit 10I. and shall yield such further recompence to the party aggrieved, as to the judge of the court shall seem meet.

In criminal cases, if a witness hath been bound over, and do* not appear, he shall forfeit his recognizance.

He who affirms the matter in issue, whether plaintiff or defendant, ought to begin to give evidence.

The evidence both for and against a prisoner, ought to be upon oath.

But a quaker's affirmation, in all cases not being criminal, shall be allowed as evidence, without an oath ; but in criminal cases, his affirmation shall not be allowed.

It is no satisfaction for a witness to say, that he thinks or persuades himself; the judge ought to have more ground than thinking.

The court may indulge a prisoner in examining the witnesses apart, but he cannot demand it of right.

In cases of life, no evidence is to be given against a prisoner, but in his presence.

IF a felony is committed, and one is brought before a justice upon suspicion thereof, and the justice finds, upon examination, that the prisoner is not guilty, yet the justice shall not discharge him, but he must either be bailed or committed ; for it is not fit that a man once arrested and charged with felony, or suspicion thereof, should be delivered, upon any man's discretion, without farther trial.

In order to which bail or commitment, the examination and information of the parties must firftbe taken, according to the following statutes:

Two or more justices (1 Q.) or one of the said justices, before they bail a person apprehended for felony (if the offence is bailable) shall take his examination, and the information of them that bring him, of thefatt and circumstances thereof, and the same, or as much thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, shall put in writing ; which examination they shall certify (together with the bailment) at the next general gaol delivery, to be holden within the limits of their commission. — And they shall have power to bind by recognizance all such as do declare any thing material to prove the offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery; and shall certify such recognizance in like manner. And if they offend in any thing herein, they shall be fined by the justices of gaol delivery.

Where the person is not bailed, but committed, the justice or justices who commit him, shall, before such commitment, take the like examination and information, and shall put the same in writing within two days after the said examination, and shall in like manner bind over the witnesses, and certify the whole as above.

If, on some reasonable hindrance, the justice cannot, at the return of the warrant, take the examination, he may, by word of mouth, command the constable, or any other person, to detain

But the time of the detainer mud be no longer than is necessary.

The examination of the person accused ought not to be upon oath.

But if, upon his examination, he shall confess the matter, it shall not be amiss that he subscribe his name or mark to it.

Which examination being voluntary, and sworn by the justice or his clerk to be truly takeij, may be given in evidence against the party confessing, but not against others.

The statute of8 G. c. 18, brings the recognizance not only 8 G.e. 18. of the said forfeiture, but also of several others hereafter following, under the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace.

EXTORTION, in a large sense, signifies any oppression under colour of right; but in adrift sense, it dgnifies the taking of money by any officer, by colour of his office, either where none at all is due, or not so much is due, or where it is not yet due.

The justices of the peace are bound by their oath of office, to take nothing for their office of judice of the peace to be done, but of the king, and fees accudomed, and costs limited by datute.

And generally, no public officer shall take any other fees or rewards, for doing any thing relating to his office, than feme datute in force gives him, or than hath been anciently and accudomably taken ; and if he do otherwise, he is guilty of extortion. The fees in sessions, for traveling, trying, or discharging indictments, discharging recognizances, and the like, do vary according to the different customs in different places.

Misprision of Felony

IS the concealing of a felony which a man knows, but never consented to The punishment of which, in a common person, is fine and imprisonment; in an officer, as sheriff, &c. imprisonment for a year, and ransom at the king's pleasure.

If any person will save himself from the crime of misprision, he must discover the offence to a magistrate with all the speed that he can.

And if any person shall permit the same to be call or fired, from his house or other place theretp belonging, into any public street or road, or any other place, he shall forfeit 20s. in like manner. And if any person shall call or fire the same into any public street, house.

Forcible Entry and detainer.

The party grieved, if he will lose the benefit of his treble damages and costs, may be aided and have the assistance of the justices at the general sessions, by way of indictment on the statute of 8 H. 6.

In the caption of which indictment, it will be sufficient to say, justices afjtgned to keep the peace of our lord the king, without shewing that they have authority to hear and determine felonies and trespasses; for the statute enables all justices of the peace, as such, to take such indictment; and the tenement in which the force was made, must be described with convenient certainty; and must set forth that the defendant actually entered, and ousted the party grieved ; and continueth his possession at the time of finding the indictment.

But if a man's wife, children, or servants do continue in the house or upon the land, he is not ousted of his poflession.

Forcible Entry detainer.

For a more speedy remedy, the party grieved may complain to any one justice, or to a mayor, sheriff, or bailiff, within their liberties.

But although one justice alone may proceed in such cases, yet it may be adviseable for him, if the time for viewing the force will suffer it, to take to his assistance one or two more justices.

After complaint made to such justice, by the party grieved, of a forcible entry made into lands, tenements, or other possessions, or forcible holding thereof, he shall, within a convenient time, at the costs of the party grieved (without any examining or (landing upon the right or title of either party) take* sufficient power of the county, and go to the place where such force is made.

And if after such entry made, the justice shall find such force, he shall cause the offenders to be arrested.

And such justices ought to make a record of such force by them viewed; which record shall be a sufficient conviction of the offenders, and the parties shall not be allowed to traverse it: And this record, being made out of the sessions, by a particular justice, may be kept by him; or he may make it indented, and certify the one part into the king's bench, or leave it with the clerk of the peace, and the other part he may keep himself.

And the offenders, being arrested (as before is said), shall be put in the next gaol, there to abide convict by the record of the same justice, until they have made fine and ransom to the king.

The justice shall make his precept to the sheriff, commanding him, in the king's behalf, to cause to come before him, sufficient and indifferent persons, dwelling next about the lands so entered, to enquire of such entries; whereof every man shall have lands or tenements of 40s. a year, above re-prizes. And the sheriff shall return issues on every of them, at the day of the first precept returnable, 20s. and at the second day, 40s. and at the third, 100s. and at every day after, double. And the sheriff making default, shall, on conviction before the same justice, or before the judge of assize, forfeit 20I. half to the king, and half to him who shall sue, with costs; and moreover shall make fine and ransom to thq king.

And if such forcible entry or detainer be found before such justice, then the said justice shall cause to refeize the lands and tenements so entered or holden, and shall restore the party put out, to the full possession of the same.

No restitution upon an indictment of forcible entry, or holding with force, shall be made, if the person indicted have had

# All people of the country, as well thefhenffs as others, shall be attendant on the justices, to arrest the offender ; on pain of imprisonment and fine to the king.

the occupation, or been in quiet possession for three years together next before the indictment found, and his estate therein not determined; and if it is found against the party indicted, he shall pay such costs and damages as the judges or justices shall assess; to be recovered as costs and damages in judgment on other actions.

Such judges, justices, or justices of the peace, as may give restitution unto tenants of any estate of freehold, may give the like unto tenants for term of years, &c. of lands or tenements by them so holden, which shall be entered upon by force, or holden from them by force.

Although regularly the justices only who were present at the enquiry, and when the indictment was found, ought to award restitution, yet if the record be certified by the justice or justices into the king's bench, the justices of that court may award a writ of restitution to the sheriff, to restore possession to the party expelled. If a forcible entry or detainer shall be made by three persons or more, it is also a riot, and may be proceeded against as such, if no enquiry hath before been made of the force.

No lord of a manor shall make any person to be a game-I keeper with power to kill game, unless such person be qua-

Ilified by the laws of the realm so to do ; or unless such person be truly and properly a servant to the said lord.

The game-keeper (so authorized) may search for dogs and engines, and seize the same for the use of the lord, or destroy them.

But it hath been adjudged, that an authority from the lord of the manor is not of itself sufficient for this purpose, but that he ought to have a warrant from a justice of the peace, after information and oath of the offence first made.

Every person, not having lands and tenements, or some other ellate of inheritance, in his own or his wife's right of the clear yearly value of iool. per annum*, or for term of life, or not having lease or leases of 99 years, or for any longer

Iterm, of the clear yearly value of 1501. (other than the Ion and heir apparent of an esquire, or other person of higher degree, and the owners and keepers of forests, parks, chafes, or warrens, being flocked with deer or conies for their ne-ceiTary use, in respect of the said forells, parks, chafes, or warrens) is hereby declared to be a person by the laws of this realm, not allowed to have or keep for himself or any other person, any guns, bows, greyhounds, setting dogs, ferrets,

(nets, gins, snares, or other engines for the taking and killing of game.

If any person, not qualified by the laws of this realm so to do, shall keep or use any greyhounds or setting dogs, or any engines, to kill and destroy game, and shall be thereoff convicted on the oath of one credible witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit 5I. half to the informer, and half to the poor of the parish where the offence was committed, to be levied by distress and sale of the offender's goods; for want of distress, he shall be sent to the house of correction for three months for the first offence, and for every other offence four months. — And any justice, and lord within his manor, may take away such dogs, nets, or other engines, which shall be in the power or custody of any person not qualified.

The constable, authorized by a justice's warrant, shall enter into and search the houses, outhouses, or other places belonging to such houses of suspected persons not qualified. And if any hare, partridge, or other game, shall be found, the offender shall be carried before a justice; and if such person do not, in some convenient time, to be set by the justice, produce the party of whom he bought the same, or some other credible person, to depose upon oath such sale thereof, he shall be convicted by the said justice of such offences, and, upon such conviction, shall forfeit, for every hare, partridge, or other game, any sum not under 5s. and not exceeding 20s. half to

The act 24 G. 3.

Game-keepers are not allowed, by any certificate, to kill game out of the limits of the manor, for which the deputation was given ; and in case of any new appointment of a game-keeper, &c. duly registered, the former certificate shall be null and void ; and the person acting under the former one shall be liable to the penalties of this act.

Persons summoned as witnesses, and not appearing at the time and place appointed, shall forfeit iol. to be levied by distress, as above, if not paid.

N. B. A clause in this act tends to obviate any doubt which might arise from the mention c4f two different times of imprisonment of offenders not having sufficient goods to answer penalties in the ad 25 G. 3. c. 50. ; and fixes the time of imprisonment to three months, and no longer.

Persons aggrieved by such justice, may appeal to the next general quarter-sessions, whose determination shall be final.

[For the Form of Conviction, fee the end.]

The justice, where he shall see cause, may mitigate the penalties, reasonable costs in prosecuting the same being always allowed, over and above the mitigation, so as not to reduce the penalties to less than a moiety of the penalties incurred, over and above the said costs and charges.

How they shall be restrained and kept.

THE county gaol is the prison for malefa&ors; but prisoners for debt, where an action lies against the sheriff for their escaping, may be kept in what place* the sheriff pleases.

But, on emergent occasions, as in case of infectious diseases, the sheriff or gaoler, with the advice and consent of three or more justices (1 i£.) may, if they shall find it needful, provide other safe places (with the owner's consent) for the removal of sick or other persons out of the usual gaols.

The gaoler shall not put, keep, or lodge prisoners for debt and felons together in one room or chamber ; but they shall be put, kept, and lodged separate and apart from one another in dif-tinCl rooms, on pain of forfeiting his office, and treble damages to the party grieved.

The justices, in their several quarter-sessions, shall order the walls and cielings of the several wards, both of the debtors and felons, and also of any other rooms used by the prisoners in their respective gaols where felons are Usually confined, to be scraped and white-washed once in the year at lead ; and to be regularly washed and kept clean, and condantly supplied with fresh air by hand-ventilators, or otherwise; and shall order two rooms in each gaol, one for the men, and the other for the women, to be set apart for the sick prisoners, directing them to be removed into such rooms, as soon as they shall be seized with any disorder, and kept separate from those who shall be in health; and shall order a warm and cold bath, or commodious bathing tubs, to be provided in each gaol, and direct the prisoners to be walked in such warm or cold baths or bathing tubs, according to the condition in which they shall be at the time, before they are suffered to go out of the gaol upon any occasion whatsoever. And they shall order this act to be printed in large and legible characters upon a board, and

As long as any perton under sentence of transportation shall continue in the common gaol, the gaoler having custody of such offender, shall separate such convict, as far as conveniently may be, from every person in his custody,# except prisoners convicted of felony.

If the common gaol shall not be in a slate to afford the means of reparation according to the directions of the ad of 24 G. 3. r. 54, the said gaoler shall report the insufficiency of such county gaol to the grand jury, great sessions, or general gaol delivery, next after the passing of this act, and at every fub-sequent assize, great fession, or general gaol delivery, till such means of reparation shall be effected.

And whereas, by an act of 19 Car. 2. c. 4, it was enacted, That the justices of the peace, in their respective counties, at any of their general sessions, should provide a (lock of materials for thefetting poor prisoners on work, in such manner and by such ways as other county charges may be levied and raised, and should pay and provide lit persons to oversee and set such persons on work, and make such orders as shall by them be thought needful, and should bellow the profits arising by the labour of the prisoners set on work for their relief, provided that no parish be rated above sixpence by the week towards the premises: And whereas the provision of the said recited fla-tute is very fit to be executed with respect to such prisoners therein described, as shall be confined in the gaols, with an extension thereof to all other prisoners inclined to take the benefit thereof, and also an increase of the sum limited by the said act for defraying the expence of executing the same: Justices, by this act, may execute the recited provision in favour of all prisoners willing to work ; and for that purpose are hereby authorized, at a general or quarter-sessions of the peace for the said county, or at any adjournment thereof, to direct the payment of such sums of money out of the county rate for the said county, as they shall, from time to time, think fit, to be expended in executing the provision of the said last-mentioned act, according to the extension thereof hereby made.'

And whereas, by an act of 14 Eliz. c. 5, as also by the above-mentioned act of 32 G. 2, some provision is made for the relief of prisoners; but, notwithstanding the humane purposes thereof, the health of prisoners is frequently so affected, by want of necessary food, as to render them incapable of labour when released, justices in fession may order assistance out of the county rates to prisoners who cannot work, or who, being able, cannot procure employment sufficient to sustain themselves by their industry, or who may not be otherwise provided for by virtue of any law or statute, or of any custom, or order, such food and raiment as the said justices shall, from time to time, think necessary for the support of health, and such money shall accordingly be applied, in conformity to the directions to be given by the said justices,

# This exception, it were to be wifiied, might be done away, where the prison will admit of a more eft'eduai reparation.

It shall be lawful for the justices in sessions, from time to time, to license the erecting or having such mills and offices, or such magazines for keeping unlimited quantities of gunpowder in places, not being within London or Westminster, or any other limits particularly described, the person having first given fourteen days notice in writing of the intention to make such application, to an overseer of the poor or churchwarden of the parish or place wherein it is proposed to erett such new mill and offices or magazine, or of an adjoining parish, if the place be extra-parochial; which overseer or churchwarden shall cause such notice to be publicly read on the Sunday next ensuing, in the parish church after divine service. — And, if the justices in the said sessions shall refuse to grant such licence, the party aggrieved may apply to the said justices then present, for a special state of the case, in order that the said case and proceedings may be removed by certiorari into the court of king's-bench.

In aid of the common law, and to render the changing of highways less troublesome and expensive, power is given by this act, to the justices of the peace, to widen, divert, and change highways, as they shall judge most convenient.

Where it shall appear, upon the view of two justices, that any highway between the fences thereof is not of sufficient breadth, and may be conveniently widened and enlarged ; or that the same cannot be conveniently enlarged and made commodious for travellers, without diverting and turning the same; the said justices shall order such highway respectively to be widened and enlarged, or diverted and turned, in such manner as they shall think fit; so that the said highway, when enlarged and diverted, shall not exceed 30 feet in breadth ; and that neither of the said powers do extend to pull down any house or building, or to takeaway the ground of any garden, park, paddock, court, or yard.

And when any new highway shall be made as aforesaid, the old way shall be (lopped up, and the land and foil thereof shall be sold by the surveyor, with the approbation of the said justices, to some person whose lands adjoin thereto, if he shall be willing to purchase the same; if not, to some other person, for the full value thereof. But if such old road shall lead to any lands, house, or place, which cannot, in the opinion of such justices, respectively be accommodated with a convenient way* and passage from such new highway; in such case, the old highway shall only be fold, subject to the right of way and passage to such lands, house, or place respectively; and the money arising by the sale shall be applied towards the purchase of the land where such new highway shall be made. And on payment or tender of the money; and on a certificate signed by the said two justices, or by the chairman of the said court or quarter-sessions respectively, describing the lands so fold, . and expressing the sum so agreed for, and directing to whdm the same shall be paid ; and, on the purchaser's taking a receipt for such purchase-money from the person entitled to receive the same, by an indorsement on the back of such certificate, the foil of such old highway shall become veiled in such purchaser and his heirs.

And where there is not sufficient money in the hands of the surveyor, the said two justices, in case of agreement, or the said quarter-sessions, after such verdict as aforesaid, shall order an equal assessment to be made and levied upon all and every the occupiers of lands, tenements, woods, tithes, and hereditaments, in the parish, township, or place where such highways lies; and if not paid in ten days after demand, the same shall, by order of the said two justices or court of quarter-sessions respectively, be levied by the surveyor in the manner herein-after mentioned. Provided, that no such assessment to be made in any one year shall exceed 6d. in the pound of the yearly value of the lands, tenements, woods, tithes, and hereditaments so assessed.

When it shall appear, upon the view of two justices, that any public highway, not in the situation herein before def-cribed, or public bridle-way, or foot way, may be diverted, so as to make the same nearer or more commodious to the public, and the owner of the lands through which such new highway, bridle-way, or foot-way, is proposed to be made, shall consent thereto by writing under his hand and seal, it shall be lawful, by order of the justices at foine special sessions, to divert and turn, and to flop up such foot-way, and to divert, 'turn, flop up, and inclose, sell and dispose of such old highway or bridle-way, and to purchase the ground and foil for such new highway, bridle-way, or fbot-way, by such ways and means, and subject to such exceptions and conditions in all respects, as herein before mentioned with regard to highways to be widened or diverted. And it shall be lawful for any person injured or aggrieved by any such order or proceeding, or by the inclosure of any highway by virtue of an inqui-fition taken upon a writ of ad quod damnum, to appeal to the next general quarter-sessions, on giving ten days notice in writing to the surveyor and party interested in such inclosure, if there be time for that purpose; if not, then to the next sessions after. But no inclosure or iloppage of such old way shall be made, until the new way shall be compleated, and so certified by two justices upon view; which certificate shall be returned to the clerk of the peace, and by him inrolled amongst the records.

Provided, that no common land, lying between the fences of any old highway to be (lopped up or inclosed by virtue of this act, shall be inclosed. And where the same, not being common land, shall, upon a medium, exceed 30 feet in breadth, and not extend to 50 feet, the same shall not be (lopped up or inclosed, until satisfaction be made to the owner for so much as shall exceed the breadth of 30 feet; and if the parties cannot agree, the same shall be adju(led by the said justices, or the jury, if a jury be impanelled : And if it shall exceed 50 feet in breadth, or if the old road be through the open field or ground belonging to any particular person ; such person, and also the person or persons entitled to the land between the fences on the side of such highway, shall respectively hold and enjoy the land and foil of such old highway, and pay to the surveyor so much as shall be agreed on ; or if they cannot agree, then so much as shall be adjudged by the said justices or jury, if a jury be impanelled, to be adequate to the purchase, estimating such highway at 30 feet in breadth upon an average.

And the damage, if the parties interested shall not agree in adjulling the same, shall be adjudged by two indifferent persons^neto be named by the owner of the land, and the other by the said two justices ; and if the persons so to be nominated cannot agree therein, they shall chuse some third person to

Assessments, how to be made.

FOR reimbursing expences, upon application by the fur-veyorto the justices at a special sessions, and oath made of the sums he hath bona fide laid out, or which will be required for the purposes aforesaid ; the said justices, or two of them, shall by their warrant, cause an equal assessment to be made upon, all occupiers of lands, tenements, woods, tithes, and hereditaments ; to be made and collected by such person or persons, and allowed in such manner, as the said justices, by their order at such sessions, shall appoint; and to be levied as herein after directed.

HOMICIDE in law signifies the killing of a man by a man.

» (

Manflaughrer.

BY manfiaughter is to be underdood such killing of a man as happens either on a sudden quarrel, or in the commission of an unlawful ad, without any deliberate intention of doing any mischief at all.

There is this difference between murder and mandaughter; viz. that murder is upon malice forethought, and man-daughter upon a sudden occasion.

This offence is not bailable by the justices of the peace. Murder is, when a man of found memory, and of the age of discretion, unlawfully killeth any person under the king's peace, with malice forethought, either expressed by the party, or implied by law ; so as the party wounded or hurt die of the wound or hurt, within a year and a day.

The law so far abhors all duelling in cold blood, that not only the principal who actually kills the other, but also his seconds, are guilty of murder, whether they fought or not. And it is holden, that the seconds of the party dain are like-wife guilty as accessaries.

They that are present when any man is dain, and do not their bed endeavour to apprehend the murderer or mandayer, shall be fined and imprisoned.

Where any person shall be felonioudy dricken or poisoned in one county, and die in another county, the offender may be indicted in the county where the party dies, before the coroner, justices of the peace, or other justices.

By the rubrick in the book of common prayer, before the burial office, a person who hath laid violent hands upon himself, shall not have that office used at his interment*

N. B. No didindlion seems to be here made as to the date of mind in which the party put an end to his life; the prohibition in the rubrick, with respect to the burial service, is absolute.

FROM and after Sept. 29, 1784, every person who shall keep any horse, mare, or gelding, for riding, or for drawing any coach, chaise, &c. liable to pay duty under the management of the commissioners of excile, shall pay annually 10s. on pain of 20I. for neglecting to make entry thereof in ten days.

And for every horse, &c. previous to its being entered to run for any plate, or sum of money, the further sum of two guineas; on a penalty, for neglect, of 20I. to be paid to the clerk of the course, or other person authorized to make the entry.

No person shall be compelled to travel further than to the next market town to make entry, or give fresh notice, or to pay such duties as aforesaid, which mud be done within twenty days after the expiration of twelve calendar months, after giving the former notice.

Lids of persons liable to pay duties on windows, with the number of their windows, shall be delivered by the parish col-ledlorsof window duties to the distributors of damps, on a penalty, for neglect, of 5I.; the collectors to be paid 2s. for every hundred names, and so in proportion for any less number.

The head didributor shall demand the duty of any person whose name is contained in such lids, and who shall not have regidered any horse, &c. liable to the above duties.

This act shall not extend to the horses of soldiers, or non-commissioned officers in any of his Majesty's regiments of cavalry, nor of licensed dealers, kept for sale, and not for hire, nor to any horses, &c. let for travelling pod, or to hire for a day.

House of Correction.

BY the 7 J. c. 4, it was enabled, that before Michaelmas 161X, there should be built or provided within every county, one or more fit and convenient houses of correction ; which houses were to be purchased, conveyed, or allured unto such persons, as by the justices in sessions should be directed, upon trull, that the same should be employed for the keeping, correding, and setting to work rogues, vagabonds, or sturdy beggars, and other idle and disorderly persons.

On preferment of the grand jury, that there is no house of correction, and that it will be necessary to provide one or more; or that the houses of correction already provided are not sufficient or convenient, or want to be enlarged, the justices in sessions shall have power to build, or enlarge, one or more fit houses of correction, or to buy or hire such houses for that purpose, with convenient outlets thereto adjoining, as on examination of able and sufficient workmen, or others, shall appear to be necessary for that purpose: And if houses or lands are to be purchased, they shall be conveyed to such persons as the said justices in sessions shall direct, in trull, and for the uses and purposes aforesaid. And the justices in sessions shall appoint, at their-will and pleafyre, fit persons to be governors or mailers of such houses so to be provided; and shall appoint such sums yearly as they shall think meet, to be paid quarterly before-hand by the treasurer, the said mailer or governor giving sufficient security for the continuance and performance of the said service; which Turns shall be paid out of the general county-rate.

And the justices in sessions shall take care that the houses of correction (except those erected or maintained by particular founders) shall be duly fitted up, and supplied with imple^ ments, materials, and furniture, for keeping, relieving, employing, and correding all idle and disorderly persons, rogues, vagabonds, incorrigible rogues, and others, who shall be sent to, confined, or continued in the same; and shall make such orders and regulations as they shall think fit, for the better governing and regulating the said houses, and for employing, relieving, and punishing the persons therein, or for fending them to or from thence; which orders shall not be removed by any certiorari.

And whereas doubts may arise, where authority is given to any justice or justices, to commit offenders to the house of correction, for offences cognizable before them out of sessions, how long offenders may be there detained, and in what manner treated, where the time and manner of their punishment is not by law expressly limited; it is enacted, that where any offenders shall be committed as aforesaid, by virtue of any law in being or to be made, and the time and manner of their pu-nilhmentis not expressly limited, the said justice or justices shall commit such offenders to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour until the next general or quarter-sessions, or until discharged by due course of law : And two justices (of which the justice who committed him shall be one) may discharge the said offender before the sessions, if they fee cause; and if he shall not be so discharged, the said sessions may either discharge him, or continue him further, not exceeding three months.

And where any person liable by law to be committed to the house of correction, shall be apprehended within any liberty, city, or town corporate, whose inhabitants are contributors to the house of correction of the county, the justices of such liberty may commit such person to the house of correction of the county.

If the master shall not, at every quarter-sessions, yield a true account of all such persons as have been committed to his custody ; or if any person committed to his custody, shall be troublesome to the country, by going abroad; or otherwise shall escape away from the house of correction, before he shall be from thence lawfully delivered, then the said justices shall set such fines and penalties upon the said master or governor, as they shall think fit; and all fines and penalties shall be paid to the treasurer, and accounted for by him.

Two justices within the respective hundreds, divisions, or jurisdictions, where there shall be any house of correction, or any two justices appointed by the sessions, shall visit the same twice a year, or oftener, if need be, and report the state thereof to the next sessions. And if the governors thereof shall not set or keep the said idle and disorderly persons, rogues, vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues, to hard labour, andpunishand correct them according to the directions of their warrants of commitment, or shall otherwise misbehave themselves, the said justices in sessions shall fine them ; the fines to be paid to the treasurer, and accounted for by him as part of the county (lock.

it shall and may be lawful to and for any justice of the peace to commit such offender to the common gaol, for any space not exceeding six calendar months, nor less than one calendar month; every such penalty and forfeiture shall be paid to the treasurer of the county.

By this act, justices who have not, in pursuance of the former act of 22 G. 3. e. 6f., examined the (late of the houses of correction, may enforce the said act at the next or any subsequent quarter-sessions: And when the expences of building, rebuilding, or enlarging such houses shall exceed one half of the annual county rate (on an average of the lad five years), the justices in their (eflions may borrow, on the credit of the county rate, any sums, not less than 50I. nor more than 100I. each, by way of mortgage.

The whole conduct of this matter, relative to the borrowing and repayment of money, and also the purchase of lands, See. is on the same footing with the act respecting the gaols (except the clause which forbids any justice being concerned in any contract for rebuilding. See.) to which the reader may very conveniently be referred.

Any justice or justices of the peace authorized to convict any person or persons in a summary way, without a jury, may, after the passing of this act, or if he or they shall think fit, commit persons so convicted to the house of correction, instead of the common gaol.

BY an infant or minor, is meant any one who is under the age of twenty-one years.

An infant may be guilty of forcible entry, in respect of personal actual violence.

And the justices may fine him* therefore: But yet it shall be good discretion in the justices of the peace, to forbear the imprisonment of such infant.

No age is limited for the binding of parish apprentices ; but it seemeth they may be bound after the age of seven, when they cease to be nurse-children, and consequently may be taken from the mother. — See Apprentice.

Servants above the age of eighteen, embezzling their maf-ter's goods to the value of 40s. shall be punished as felons.

Where prose-or information, before the judges of assize, or justices of the cuted‘ peace in their general or quarter-sessions (having power to hear and determine the same), shall be prosecuted in the county where they were committed, and not elsewhere; and if the offence is not proved to have been committed in the same county, the defendant shall be found not guilty.

No informer shall compound or agree with the defendant, j$ but after answer made in court; nor after answer, but by the Informer com-order or consent of the court; on pain of being set on the pil- pounding, lory, in some market town next adjoining, in open market, for two hours, and of being disabled to be informer on any penal statute, and also of forfeiting 10I. half to the king, and half to the party grieved, to be recovered in any court of record, by action of debt or information.

BY many statutes, peculiar punishments are appointed for several offences, as pillory, (locks, imprisonment, and the like; and in all these cases, no room is left for the justices' discretion, for they ought to give judgment, and to inflict the punishment in all the circumstances thereof, as such statutes do direct.

Jurors.

THE justices, at Midsummer sessions, shall issue forth their warrants under the hands and seals of two or more of them, to the high constables, requiring them to issue forth their precept to the petty constables, thereby dirediftg and requiring them to make and return true lifts in writing, of the names and places of abode of all persons, within their respective con-

ftablewicks.

ftablewicks, with their titles and additions, between the ages of 21 and 70, qualified to serve on juries, by having, in their own name, or in trust for them, within the same county where the issue is to be tried, ten pounds by the year at lead, above reprizes, of freehold or copyhold lands, and tenements of ancient demesne, or in rents, in fee simple, fee tail, or for the life of themselves or some other person ; or, having in posses-(ion, in their own right, a leasehold estate of 20I. per annum, for 99 years or more.

The high-constable failing to issue this precept, shall for. feit 10I. on conviction at the assizes or sessions.

And if any petty constable shall wilfully omit any person who ought to be inserted, or insert any one who ought to be omitted, or shall take any reward for omitting or infening any person, he shall forfeit 20s. on conviction before one justice, on confession, or oath of one witness; half to the informer, and half to the poor of the parish or place for which the lift is returned ; if not paid in five days, to be levied by distress. — And such justice shall, in writing under his hand, certify the same to the next sessions; who shall diretft the clerk of the peace to insert or (trike out the name of such person so inserted or omitted wrongfully.

The petty constables, at Michaelmas sessions, shall deliver in the lifts in open court.

Or, instead of this, after they have compleated their lifts, it shall be sufficient if they subscribe the same in the presence of one justice, and at the same time attest the truth thereof upon oath to the best of their knowledge or belief: and then the said lifts, being first signed by the justice, and subscribed as aforesaid, shall be delivered by the said petty constables to the high constables, who shall deliver in the same at the said sessions, in open court, attesting at the same time, upon oath; the receipt of such lifts from the petty constables, and that no alteration hath been made therein since their receipt thereof.

The constable failing to make return, shall forfeit 5I. to the king, to be recovered by bill, plaint, or information.

Aiid if any person, not qualified, shall find his name mentioned in such lift, and the person required to make such lift, shall refuse to omit him, or think it doubtful whether he ought to be omitted, the justices, at the sessions to which the lifts shall be returned, on satisfaction from the oath of the party complaining, or other proof that he is not qualified, may order his name to be (truck out, or omitted to be entered in the book.

The justices shall then cause the iifts to be fairly entered in a book by the clerk of the peace, to be by him provided and kept for that purpose amongst the records of the sessions.

It seems that justices of the peace may not order a jury to be returned immediately, nor on the same day, for the trial of a prisoner arraigned before them, as justices of gaol delivery may, unless the crime amount to felony, or the party consent to be tried immediately.

And although the words of the writ be twelve, yet, by the ancient course, the sheriff mull return twenty-four, for the expedition of Justice; for, if twelve only should be returned, there would seldom a full jury appear; and, in this case, ufageand cullom makes the law.

Besides the challenges which may be taken by the plaintiff or defendant, it is enacted, that in cases where the king is party, the justices of assize, or of the peace in sections, may reform the panels of jurors, by putting to and taking out the names of the persons impanelled by their discretion ; and if the sheriff* do not return the panel so reformed, he shall forfeit 20I. half to the king, and half to him that shall sue.

By the law of England, a jury, after their evidence given upon the issue, ought to be kept together in some convenient place, without meat or drink, fire, or candle, and without speech with any, unless it be the bailiff, and with him only if they be agreed.

But, with the assent of the justices, they may both eat and drink; and if they cannot agree, the justices may, in such case, suffer the jury to have both meat and drink for a time, to fee whether they will agree. But if the case so happen, that the jury can in no wife agree, the justices (as it seemeth), in such case, may take such order in the matter, as shall seem to them, by their discretion, to (land with reason and conscience, by awarding a new inquest, or otherwise, as they shall think bell.

If a man assault or threaten a juror, for giving a verdict against him, he is highly punishable by fine and imprisoo-mqnt; and if he strikes him in the court, in the presence of the judge of assize, he shall lose his hand, and his goods, and profits of his lands during life, and suffer perpetual imprisonment.

In causes of nife frius, every person whose name shall be drawn, and who shall not appear, after being openly called three times, shall, on oath made of his having been lawfully summoned, forfeit not exceeding 5I. nor less than 40s. unless some reasonable cause of absence be proved, by oath or affidavit, to the satisfaction of the judge.

If the grand jury, at the assizes or sessions, will not find a bill, the court may impanel another inquest to enquire of their concealments, and thereupon set fines upon them. /

Justices of the Peace

ARE judges of record, appointed by the king, to be justices within certain limits, for the conservation of the peace, and for the execution of divers things comprehended within their commission, and within divers statutes committed to their charge.

And a record or memorial, made by a justice of the peace, of things done before him judicially in the execution of his office, shall be of such credit, that it shall not be gainsaid.

In ancient times, such officers or ministers as were instituted, either for preservation of the peace of the county, or for execution of justice, were, by force of the king's writ in every several county, chosen in full or open court by the freeholders of that county.

Besides these conservators of the peace properly so called, there were and are other conservators of the peace by virtue of certain offices, viz. (1.) The lord chancellor, and every justice of the king's bench, throughout all the realm. (2.) Every court of record within its own precinct. (3.) Every justice of the peace. (4.) Every sheriff. (5.) Every coroner. And (6 ) every high and petty constable.

There were also other conservators of the peace by tenure ; who held lands of the king by this service; and other conservators of the peace by prescription.

The general duty of the conservators of the peace by the common law, is to employ their own, and to command the help of others, to arrest and pacify all such who, in their presence, and within their jurisdiction and limits, by word or deed, shall go about to break the peace. And if the conservators of the peace have committed or bound over any offenders, they are then to send to, or be present at, the next sessions of the peace, or gaol delivery, there to object against them.

Justices of the peace at this day are of three forts; 1. By act of parliament; as the bishop of Ely and his successors, and the archbifhqp of York, and bishop of Durham. 2. By charter,

Every justice of the peace, before he ad's, at the sessions of the county where he intends to ad, shall take and subscribe the oath following : I A.

being ^within the parish, tonxnship, or precincts of --, in the I

county of ----- , or in the federal counties of — — (as the case 1

may be.)

Which oath taken and subscribed, shall be kept by the clerk of the peace among the records of the sessions.

And if any person shall act as justice, without having taken \i and subscribed the said oath, or without being qualified as above, he shall, for every offence, forfeit iool. half to the poor of the parish in which he most usually resides, and half to l him who shall sue, with full costs. The prosecution to be in six months*

No sheriff shall exercise the office of a justice of the peace, during the time that he acts as sheriff.

Justices of the peace have jurisdiction of all inferior crimes within their commission, whether such crimes be mentioned in any statute concerning them or not; for all such crimes are either directly, or at Jeaft by consequence and judgment of \ law, against the peace.

*< YE shall (wear, that as justice of the peace in the county of M. in all articles in the king's commission to you directed, you shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich, after your cunning, wit, and power, and after the laws and customs of the realm, and statutes thereof made: And ye shall not be of counsel of any quarrel hanging before you : And that ye hold your sessions after the form of the statutes thereof made : And the issues, fines, and amerciaments that shall happen to be made, and all forfeitures which shall fall before you, ye shall cause to be made without any concealment (or embezzling), and truly fend them to the king's exchequer. Ye shall not let, for gift or other cause, but well and truly ye shall do your office of justice of the peace in that behalf: And you shall take nothing for your office of justice of the peace to be done, but of the king, and fees accustomed, and costs limited by statute. And ye shall not dirett, nor cause to be directed, any warrant (by you to be made) to the parties, but ye shall direct them to the bailiff of the said county, or other the king's officers or ministers, or other indifferent persons, to do execution thereof. So help you God.”

The justices, at Midsummer sessions 1753, shall settle a table of their clerk's fees ; which, being approved by the justices at the next succeeding sessions, with such alterations as the justices there shall think proper, shall be laid before the judges at the next assizes, who shall confirm the same with such alterations, additions, or abatements, as to them shall appear just and reasonable: And the sessions, from time to time, may make any other table of fees, and after the same shall have been approved by the next succeeding sessions, shall lay the same before the judges at the next assizes, who may ratify the same in like manner: And no table of fees shall be valid, until confirmed by the judges. And if, after three months from the time that such table shall be confirmed, any justice's clerk shall demand or take any other or greater fee than shall have been so confirmed, he shall forfeit zol. to him who shall sue in three months. The said table of fees shall be deposited with the clerk of the peace, who shall cause true copies thereof to be kept constantly in a conspicuous part of the room where the sessions are held, on pain of 10I.

In Middlesex, the like table shall be confirmed by the two lords chief justices, and the lord chief baron, or any two of them.

Regularly, justices of the peace ought not to execute their office, in their own case; but cause the offenders to be convened or carried before some other justice, or desire the aid of some other justice being prefenc. - \

Justices of the Peace.

If a justice exceed his authority, in granting a warrant, yet the officer mull execute it, and is indemnified for so doing; but if it be a case wherein he hath no jurisdiction, or in a matter whereof he hath no cognizafice, the officer ought not to execute such warrant; so that the officer is bound to take notice of the authority and jurisdiction of the justice.

If the officer, in six days after demand, shall grant to the party complaining a perusal and copy of the warrant, he shall not be liable to any action, but the justice only.

In summary convidlions, the party ought to be heard, and, for that purpose, ought to be summoned in fact; and if the justice proceed against a person without summoning him, it would be a misdemeanor in him, for which an information would lie.

In all cases where justices may hear and determine out of sessions (viz. on their own view, or confession, or oath of witnesses), the justices ought to make a record, in writing under their hands, of all the matters and proofs; which record, notwithstanding, in many cases they may keep by them. And if, upon such conviction, the offender is to be fined to the king, then the justices are to eflreat such fine, and to fend the estreat into the exchequer, whereby the barons of the exchequer may cause the said fine or forfeiture to be levied for the king's use.

Forasmuch as most of the business of a justice of the peace consisteth in the execution of divers statutes, which cannot be sufficiently abridged, but that they will come short of the fub-stance and body thereof, therefore it shall be safest for the justices to have an eye to the statutes at large, and thereby to take their further and better directions, for their whole proceedings.

A justice of the peace is strongly protedled by the law, in the just execution of his office.

Thus, in the first place, he is not to be slandered or abused.

In the next place, he is not punishable at the suit of the party, but only at the suit of the king, for what he doth as ' judge, in matters which he hath power by law to hear and determine without the concurrence of any other; but in cases wherein he proceeds ministerially, rather than judicially, if he act corruptly, he is liable to an action at the suit of the party, as well as to an information at the suit of the king.

In the next place, if any action shall be brought against a justice for any thing done by virtue of his office, he may plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence ; and if he recover, he shall have double costs.

No writ shall be sued out against, or copy of any process, at the suit of a subject, shall be served on any justice, for any thing done by him in the execution of his office, until notice in writing shall have been given to him, or left at his usual place of abode, by the attorney for the party, one month before the suing out, or serving the same; containing the cause of

of action, and indorsed with, his name and place of abode; for which he shall be entitled to a fee of 20s. and no more. — And the justice may, at any time, within one month after such notice, tender amends to the party complaining, or to his attorney; and if the same is not accepted, he may plead such tender in bar to the action, together with the plea of not guilty, and any other plea, with leave of the court; and if, upon i/rue joined, the jury shall find the amends tendered to have been sufficient, they shall give a verdict for the defendant.

If a justice will not, on complaint to him made, execute his office, or shall misbehave in his office, the party grieved may move the court of king's bench for an information, and afterwards may apply to the court of chancery to put him out of the commission.

Larceny

COMES from iatrociniumy latrociny ; and, by contraction, or rather abuse, larceny.

Grand larceny is a felonious and fraudulent taking, and carrying away, by any person, of the mere personal goods of another, above the value of I2d.

Ajuilice of the peace, before whom an offender shall be brought for petty larceny out of sessions, may not punish the said offender by his discretion, and so let him go; but mull have him committed or bailed, to the intent he may come to his trial, as in cases of other felonies: And if, upon his trial, the jury shall find the goods (lolen to exceed izd. in value, the offender shall have judgment to die for the fault.

All petty larceny is felony, and consequently requires the wordfetyniously in an indidfcment for it; yet it is certain, that it is not punishable with the loss of life or lands, but only with the forfeiture of goods, and whipping, transportation, or other corporal punishment.

If the goods are taken from a man's person, and if it is attended with putting him in fear, it is called robbery : if it is without putting him in fear, then it is called barely larceny from the person.

If it is done privily without his knowledge, by picking of pockets, or otherwise, it is excluded from the benefit of clergy by the 8 EL c. 4. (that is, if the thing (lolen be above the value of 12d.)

If it is done openly and avowedly before his face, it is within the benefit of clergy, except where it is committed in a dwelling-

If the substitute serves for any parish in another county, the monies advanced by the overseers of the parish where the family shall dwell, shall be repaid them out of the county dock, by the treasurer of that county, that, on producing a certificate of the order of the justice allowing such relief (which certificate the justice is hereby required to grant); such certificate, and an account of all monies so repaid, to be transmitted quarterly to the treasurer of the county in the militia whereof such substitute shall serve; which treasurer shall reimburse the same; and the account shall be laid before the justices at the general or quarter-sessions, for their allowance thereof: And the justices shall make anorder for the overseers of the poor of the parish for which such substitute shall serve, to make good the same to the treasurer of the county out of the poor rates; such payments to be allowed in their respective accounts.

In places having peculiar jurisdictions, and not contributing to the county, the accounts are to be made over to the treasurer, receiver, or other public officer.

Misdemeanour.

THIS word signifies a Crime : But the law hath made a distinction between crimes of a higher and lower nature; the former being denominated Felonies; the latter Mijde-meamours.

This lad is an act committed or omitted in violation of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it.

Crimes and misdemeanours are terms which are frequently joined together; which, though properly speaking, they are synonymous, are made to denote very different things; the word crimes extending to such offences as are of a deeper and more atrocious dye ; while (mailer faults, and omissions of less consequence, and the beginnings of greater offences not absolutely perpetrated, are comprised under the xpilder term of misdemeanours. These it is impossible to define or describe ; inasmuch as they are as various in their nature as human actions ; but they are fully set forth in the several codes of criminal j urifprudence.

THE justices of Northumberland and Cumberland may make order in sessions, for charging the respective counties, for securing the same against the moss-troopers (that is, thieves and robbers, who, after having committed offences in the borders, escape through the wastes and modes) ; so as Northumberland be not charged above 500I. nor Cumberland above 200I. a year. And they may appoint a commander, with 30 men in Northumberland, and 12 men in Cumberland, to search for, pursue, and apprehend offenders.

If any person against whom a warrant shall be issued by any justice in England, for any offence against the laws of England, shall escape or go into Scotland ; the sheriff, or steward depute, or substitute, or any justice of the county or place where such person shall be, may indorse his name on the said warrant, to apprehend the person against whom such warrant is s granted, and to convey him into the county or place in Eng- c

land (being adjacent to Scotland) in which the offence was committed, before a justice of such county or place, to be there dealt with according to law; in case the offence was committed in the county not next adjacent to Scotland, then to convey him into any county of England adjacent to Scotland, before a justice there; who shall proceed, with regard to such person, by indorsing the warrant, as by the 24 G. 2. c. 55, in like manner as if the person had been apprehended in the said county.

And if any person, against whom a warrant shall be issued by any justice of the peace of Scotland, shall escape or go into England, any justice of the county or place where such person shall be, may indorse his name on the said warrant; to apprehend the person against whom such warrant is granted, and to convey him into the county or place in Scotland (being adja~ cent to England) where the offence was committed, to be there dealt with according to law.

And the expence of removing prisoners as aforesaid, shall be repaid to the person defraying the same, by the treasurer of the county in England, or by the sheriff, or steward depute, or substitute, of the county in Scotland, in which the offence was committed ; the amount of such expence being previously ascertained upon oath before two justices of such county, and allowed and signed by them.

Nuisance.

A COMMON nuisance seems to be, an offence against the public, either by doing a thing which tends to the annoyance of all the kings subjects, or by neglecting to do a thing which the common good requires.

Annoyances to the prejudice of particular persons, are not punishable by a public prosecution as common nuisances, but are left to be redressed by the private actions of the parties aggrieved by them.

If it is a public nuisance, the law hath provided an apt remedy, by p/efentment or indictment at the suit of the king, in the behalf of all his subjects.

Oaths.

IN all cases, where any penalty is directed to be levied, or distress to be made, by any act of parliament now in force, or hereafter to be made, it shall be lawful for any justice or , justices, acting under the authority of such acts respectively, to administer an oath or oaths for the purpose of levying such penalties, or making such distreffc*.

^ Oaths.

The person accused shall not be examined upon oath; for by the common law, no man is obliged to accuse himrfelf: But 1 it seemeth convenient, in cases of felony especially, that the information, which the justices do take against the prisoner, 1 be upon oath ; otherwise, upon the trial of the prisoner, such information taken by the juAice shall not be read or delivered to the jury, nor given in evidence against the prisoner upon ? his trial. *

The information of the prosecutor or witnesses ought to be upon oath, although the statute doth not mention an oath; 1 which information upon oath, being sworn on the trial to be { truly taken by the justice or his clerk, may be given in evidence against the prisoner, if the witnesses be dead or not able 1 to travel.

Where one justice may puijifti bffenders upon accusation or proof generally, it seemeth that this must be by examination of witnesses; and though the statute doth not expressly set down that it shall be upon oath, yet it seemeth fit, that the justice do it upon oath: Yea, in all other cases, wheresoever ' any man is authorized to examine witnesses, such authority to examine shall be taken and construed to be in such manner as the law requires, which is only by oath.

Two justices may summon, by writing underhand and seal, any person whom they shall suspect to be dangerous or difaffe&ed to the government, to appear before them, at a certain day and time therein to be appointed, to take the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration : And if such person ne-glefls or refuses to appear, then on due proof made on oath of the summons having been served on such person, or left at his dwelling-house, or usual place of abode, with one of the family there, they shall certify the same to the next sessions, there to be recorded by the clerk of the peace. And if such person shall neglect or refuse to appear and take the oaths at the said sessions (the name of such person being publicly read at the first meeting of the said sessions), then such person shall be esteemed and adjudged a popish recusant convict ; and the same shall be thence certified by the clerk of the peace into the chancery or king's bench, to be there recorded.

Oaths, &c. in the Court of Session at Chester.

BY this act, the justices of the court of session for the county palatine of Chester/ may, by one or more commission or I commissions under the seal of the said county palatine, im-powpr persons to take affidavits in causes depending therein, j in like manner as the justices of his majesty's courts of king's ( beneph, &c. use to do ; and also the prothontary, or his officiating deputy, may take such affidavits. &c. which shall be filed a in the office of the prothontary of the said county, and shall be

of the same force and effect as affidavits taken in the said court now are: And all persons forswearing themselves, irr such affidavits, shall be liable to the same penalties as for false affidavits in open court.

No person appointed a commissioner as aforesaid, nor the said prothontary, or his deputy, shall take any affidavit within one mile of the castle of Chester, during the time of holding the session for the said county.

The justices of the said court may, by their commission, impower persons to take recognizances; and the fees to be paid commissions to take recognizances shall be as follows: (to wit) the sum of zs. for the fiat or warrant; 7s. 6d. for making out the commission, besides the king's duty and parchment; 4s, for the seal; 5s. for taking every such acknowledgment; and is. for the swearing the affidavit of the due taking thereof.

The justices of the said court may make rules for justifying bait by affidavits before the of; but the power of prothontary, or his deputy, to take recognizances, shall not be affected by this act.

If any person shall represent another in entering into special bail, he shall be adjudged a felon, and shall incur the pains, penalties, and forfeitures, of an act of 4 PF. & M* intituled, an act for taking special bails, &c.

Office.

NO persons shall be elected to any office of magistracy, place, or trust, relating to the government of cities, corporations, boroughs, cinque ports, and other port towns, who shall not have received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the rites of the church of England, within one year next before such election : And every person so placed or elected, shall take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, at the same time that the oath of office is taken ; which shall be administered by those, who, by charter or usage, administer the oath of office; and, in default of such, by two justices of the corporation, if there be any such ; or otherwise by two justices of the county; and, in default thereof, every such election and placing shall be void. Which said justices above-mentioned shall cause memorandums to be made of such oaths taken before them, and delivered once a year to the town clerk, or other register or clerk, who shall enter the same in their books.

But generally there is a clause of indemnification in some aft in almost every session of parliament, provided they qualify on or before a time in such act limited.

And in the court where he takes the oaths (as hereafter mentioned, which shall be within six months after his admission), he shall first: deliver a certificate of such his receiving the Sacrament, under the hands of the minister and churchwardens, and shall then make proof of the truth thereof by two witnesses on oath.

By the 31 G. 2. r. 22, altered and explained by the 32 G. 2, c. 33, there are certain duties laid upon offices and pensions; and so much of the salaries of such offices, as ariseth from perquisites, is directed to be under the management of the commissioners of the land tax.

By perquisites are meant such profits of offices and employments as arise from fees established by custom or authority, and payable either by the crown, or the subjects, in consideration of business done in the course of executing such offices and employments.

Where the profits of such offices shall arise from perquisites due and payable in the course of office, and not from salaries, fees, and wages paid by the crown, the same shall be under the management of the commissioners of the land tax, who shall ascertain, according to the valuation of such offices to the land tax, or otherwise according to the best of their judgment , the sum total of the perquisites arising from such office, diflind from the fialary, fees, and wages thereof.

PERJURY, by the common law, seemeth to be a wilful false oath, by one, who, being lawfully required to de-pose the truth in any judicial proceeding, (wears absolutelyf in a matter material to the point in question, whether he be believed or not.

Subornation of perjury, by the common law, seems to be an offence, in procuring a man to take a false oath, amounting to perjury, who actually taketh such oath.

As to subornation of perjury, by the statute, every person who shall unlawfully and corruptly procure any witness to commit any wilful and corrupt perjury, in any matter or cause depending in suit and variance, in chancery, or in any court of record ; or shall unlawfully and corruptly procure or suborn any witness, which shall be sworn to testify in perpetuam rei memcriam, shall forfeit 40I. half to the king, and half to the party grieved, who shall sue for the same. And if he has not lands or goods worth 40I. he shall be imprisoned half a year, and (land on the pillory one whole hour in some market town next adjoining to the place where the offence was committed, in open market there, or in the market-town itself where the offence was committed. And he shall be disabled to be a witness in any court of record.

And as to perjury, if any person, either by subornation or otherwise, shall wilfully and corruptly commit any wilful perjury, by his depoiition in any of the courts before-mentioned, . or

And he shall be for ever disabled to be a witness in any court of record.

SEEING the judgment to the pillory or tumbrel doth make the delinquent infamous, the justices of the peace should be well advised before they give judgment of any person to this punishment, unless they have good warrant for that judgment therein.

THE justices are not obliged ministerially to allow and sign a certificate. They have a discretion to allow ir, or not to allow it, if it be liable to objection. And if it is not a certificate within the act (which it is not, unless properly signed), it cannot conclude the parish.

A BASTARD child is prima facie settled when born : And this was the antient genuine settlement: But this rule admits of divers exceptions.

If a woman comes into a place by privity and collulion of the officers where (he belongs, and is there delivered of a baf-tard, such bastard gains no settlement, notwithstanding its birth.

If a woman big with child of a bastard, and settled in one parish, is persuaded to go into another, and there be delivered ; this fraud will make the parish chargeable where the mother was settled, though the child was not born there.

If a bastard is born under an order of removal, and before the mother can be sent to the place of settlement, being hindered by water or otherwise, such bastard shall not be settled where so born, but at the mother's settlement.

If the officers are carrying a woman by virtue of an order of removal, and lhe be delivered on the road in transetu, the bastard shall go with the mother where (he is going, by virtue of the order, notwithstanding the birth.

And if such woman shall be detained and conveyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which (he is delivered, if a bastard, shall not be settled in the place where so born, nor be sent thither by a vagrant pass; but the settlement of such woman shall be deemed the settlement of such child.

Of Legitimate Children.

THE father's settlement is the settlement of the children, when it can be found out; otherwise the birth of the child prtma facie is the settlement of the child, until there is another settlement found out. If they cannot find out the legal settlement of the father, the birth is the settlement of the child. The settlement by birth is only quousque they find the father's settlement; and if they never can find that, it is absolute upon them.

Of the Settlement of Children with their Parents.

THE birth of legitimate children doth not give them a settlement, except where the settlement of their father and mother is not known, and then only till it is known.

A child of seven years of age may be bound apprentice to a shipwright, fisherman, owner of a ship, or other person using the trade of the seas; and, by the vagrant ad of the 17 G. 2, a vagrant's child of that age may, by the justices, be put out an apprentice: and, as soon as he shall have resided and lodged in a parish for 40 days under the indenture, he will have thereby gained a settlement. So that the precise time when a person may have gained a settlement in his own right, is at the age of seven years and 40 days.

When a father gains a second settlement after the birth of his child, that settlement is immediately communicated to the child. And a child may be sent to the place of his father's settlement, without ever having been there before.

The place where a bastard is born is the place of his settlement, unless there is some trick to charge the parish ; but the place where legitimate children are born is not the place of their settlement; for let that be where it will, the children are settled where their parents are settled.

Though the place of the birth of a child, where the father hath no settlement, is the place of the settlement of the child, yet where the father hath gained a settlement, his children, though born in another parish, shall be looked on as settled at

If the father dies before the child is born, yet the child shall be settled where the father was settled before his death.

If a widow, by renting 10I. a year, gains a new settlement, her children are settled with her.

But if a woman marry again to a man settled in another parish, her children, by her former husband, must go with her for nurture, yet they are no part of her second husband's family; and therefore gain no settlement in the parish where the father-in-law is settled.

Those under seven years of age shall be kept at the chargeof the other parish, where their father, whilftliving, was settled; and to that parish they may be sent, after seven years old, as to the place of their lawful settlement.

The child's settlement follows that of its father, if the father's can be found; and no recourse shall be had to the mother's settlement, till that of the father can be traced no further.

Where a child is first known to be, that parish must provide for it, till they find another.

' Of Settlement by Apprenticeship.

ON complaint by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor, within 40 days after any person shall come to settle in any parish, on any tenement under iol. a year, two justices ( 1 ^.) may remove him to the place where he was last legally settled, either as a native, housholder, sojourner, apprentice, or servant, for the space of 40 days at the lead.

The said 40 days shall be reckoned, not from the time of his coming to inhabit, but from the time of his delivering notice in writing; and by 3. W, e. iv, not from the time of delivering such notice, but from the time of the publication of such notice in the church.

If any person shall be bound an apprentice by indenture, and inhabit in any town or parish, such binding and inhabitation shall be adjudged a good settlement, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published.

If any person, after June 24, 1713, shall be an apprentice bound by indenture to any person residing under a certificate, in any parish, and not afterwards having gained a legal settlement in such parish, such apprentice, by virtue of such apprenticeship, shall not gain any settlement in such parish.

No person who shall have been bound an apprentice, by any deed, writing, or contract, not indented, being first legally

An apprentice may gain a settlement, whilll his mailer, not Bum. renting iol. a year, gains none. In such case, the mailer Apprentice fet-being removed, may apply to the justices to compel the ap- Jailer not prentice to go with him.

not hire himieif.

Of Settlement by Service.

IF any unmarried person, not having child or children, shall be lawfully hired into any parish or town for one year, such service shall be adjudged and deemed a good settlement therein.

No such person so hired as aforesaid, shall be adjudged or deemed to have a good settlement in any such parish or town-ship, unless such person shall continue and abide in the same service during the space of one whole year.

If any person, after June 24, 1713, shall be a hired servant >cith any person who did come into, or shall reside in any pa-xilh, township, or place, by means or licence of a certificate, and not afterwards having gained a legal settlement in such parish, township, or place ; such servant shall not gain any settlement in such parish, township, or place, by reason of such hiring or service, but shall have his settlement as if he had not been an hired servant to such person.

If an unmarried man, who has a ^daughter married and settled elsewhere, hires himself for a year, and serves the year, he gains a settlement by the service, though not Itri&ly a single man.

If a man hired for a year marries, having served half a year, the marriage doth not hinder the service; if the man performs the service, he gains a settlement.

All hiring for a few days^ short of a year, for the purpose of avoiding a settlement, will be considered as fraudulent; and the service will be allowed to make a good settlement. Less than 40 days residence in any parish will not gain a settlement: But if the contract be for a year, and the service be performed (sup-pose at sea, or in dillant journies), the residence need not be 40 days successively ; it is sufficient if within the year he relides40 days in the whole.

# N. B. Though the case here alluded to is that of a daughter married and settled elsewhere, it should seem equally clear in the case of a Jon, or Ions, that have obtained a legal settlement elsewhere, previous to the father's obtaining a new settlement by the service of a year, under a legal hiring for a year.

THE 40 days continuance of a person in a parish, to make a settlement, shall be accounted from the time of his delivering notice in writing, of the house of his abode; and the number of his family, if he have any, to one of the churchwardens or overseers of the parish to which he shall remove.

Which said notice in writing, the said churchwarden or overseer shall read, or cause to be read, publicly, immediately after divine service, in the church or chapel, on the next Lord's Day, when there shall be divine service in the same. — And the said churchwarden or overseer shall register or cause to be registered, the said notice in writing, in the book kept for the poor's account.

And if any churchwarden or overseer shall refuse or neglect to read, or cause to be read, such notice in writing as aforesaid, he shall (on proof thereof by the oath of two witnesses before one justice) forfeit, for every offence, 40s. to the party grieved, by distress, by warrant directed to the constable of the parish or town where the offender dwells; and for want of sufficient distress, the said justice shall commit him to the common gaol for one month. And if any churchwarden or overseer shall refuse or neglect to register, or cause to be registered, such notice in writing, he shall, on the like conviction, forfeit 40s. to the use of the poor of the parish or town where the offender dwells, to be levied as aforesaid ; and for want of sufficient distress, then the said justice shall commit him as aforesaid, for the time aforesaid.

Of Settlement by paying Parish Rates.

FORTY days inhabitancy shall gain a settlement.

Such 40 days are to be reckoned from the delivering of notice in writing, and from the publication of such notice in the church.

But if any person, who shall come to inhabit in any town or parish, shall be charged with, and pay his fharc towards the public taxes or levies of the said town or parish, he shall be adjudged to have a legal settlement in the same, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published.

J.I But persons residing under a certificate, shall gain no settlement by being rated to and paying any such levies, taxes, or |k; assessments.

Payments for the repair of the church, the relief of the c poor, and the land-tax, have been adjudged sufficient to gain a a settlement: But no payment for the repair of the highways, or of the county-bridges, or of the duties on housesand windows, v shall make a good settlement.

If Where the tenant is *a(fe(Ted to, and pays the land-tax, l though it be afterwards allowed by the landlord, and deduced out of the rent, the tenant hereby gains a settlement; which is supposed to turn on the notice of inhabitancy, that arises from the party*s being assessed and paying the tax, which is Considered as tantamount to notice in writing.

Of Settlement by a Person's own Estate.

NO certificate person shall gain a settlement, but by taking a lease of a tenement of iol. a year, or executing an annual office.

But, where a person has an estate for life, or an estate of inheritance of his own, that gains him a settlement, though less than iol. a year; for he cannot be removed ; and if he cannot be removed, he certainly gains a settlement.

Where a man lives upon his own, it is a case of a very tender nature, and the law will not unsettle him : Persons to be removed under the datute of C. 2, are those that wander from place to place, and not those who live upon their own estate.

No person shall be deemed to acquire any settlement in any parish or place, by virtue of any purchase of any estate or intered in such parish or place, whereof the consideration for such purchase doth not amount to the sum of 30I. bona fide paid, for any longer or further time than such person shall inhabit in

A person may not be removed from his own, although not settled thereby, be the value ever so small, or let him come to it in what manner soever.

A certificate person shall gain a settlement by an effate of his own, notwithstanding the abovesaid statute of the 9 & 10 W.

If an estate descends to a certificate person, it gains him a settlement, because it is by operation of law, and not by an att of his own.

Having land in a parish will not make a settlement, but living in a parish where one has land, will gain a settlement without notice; for the act never meant to banish men from the enjoyment of their own lands.

Of Removals^

IT shall be lawful, upon complaint made by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of any parish, to any justice of the peace, within 40 days after any poor person comes to settle in any tenement under the yearly value of 10I. for any two justices of the peace (one whereof is of the quorum) of the division where any person that is likely to become chargeable to the parish shall come to inhabit, by their warrant to remove and convey such person to such parish where he was last legally settled, unless he give sufficient security for the discharge of the said parish, to be allowed by the said justices.

And if such person shall refuse to go, or shall not remain in such parish where he ought to be settled, but shall return of his own accord to the parish from whence he was removed, one justice may fend him to the house of correction, there to be punished as a vagabond.

All persons who shall unlawfully return to such parish or place from whence they have been legally removed by order of two justices, without bringing a certificate from the parish or place whereunto they belong, shall be deemed idle and disorderly persons; and one justice may commit them (being thereof convicted before him, by his own view, or by their own confession, or by the oath of one credible witness) to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one month.

And if the churchwardens and overseers of the parish to which he shall be removed, refuse to receive such person, and to provide work for him, as other inhabitants of the parish ; any justice of that division shall bind any such officer in whom there shall be default to the assizes or sessions, there to be in-didted for his contempt in that behalf.

If any pfcrfon be removed by virtue of this act by warrant of two justices, the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of the parish or town to which such person shall be removed, are required to receive the said person ; which, if he or they shallre-fuse to do, the person offending, on proof by the oath of two witness, before one judice of the place to which the person shall be removed, shall forfeit, for each offence, 5I. to the use of the poor of the parish or town from which such person was removed; to be levied by distress, by warrant to the constable of the parish or town where such offender dwells; and fur want of sufficient distress, the said justice shall commit the offender to the common gaol for ±0 days.

Though the complaint may be to one justice, yet theexa-mination ought to be by two, and those the same who sign the order of removal.

And, most undoubtedly, the justices ought to be both together at the hearing and determining; though the practice in many places is otherwise.

After an order and adjudication is made, that the same may appear upon record afterwards, in order to charge the parish, the most regular way for the justices to proceed, is to make a record of the complaint and adjudication, and upon that to make a warrant to the churchwardens and overseers, to convey the persons to the parish to which they ought to'be sent, and deliver in the record by their own hands into court the next feidons, to be kept there amongst the records.

If any person, who shall come into any parish or place, there to reside, shall deliver a certificate to one of the churchwardens or overseers there, such certificate shall oblige the parish or place granting the same, to receive and provide for the person mentioned in the said certificate, together with his family, as inhabitants of that parish, whenever they shall happen to be* come chargeable to, or be forced to a(k relief of, the parish, township, or place, to which such certificate was given; and then, and not before, it shall be lawful for any such person, and his children, though born in that parish, not having otherwise acquired a legal settlement there, to be removed, conveyed, and settled in the parish or place from whence such certificate was brought.

When any overseer or other person shall remove back any persons or their families, redding under a certificate, and becoming chargeable to the parish or place to which they shall belong, such overseer or other person shall be reimbursed such reasonable charges as they may have been put unto in maintaining and removing such persons, by the churchwardens or overseers of the place to which such persons are removed; the said charges being first ascertained and allowed of by one or more justices for the county or place to which such removal shall be made; which said charges so ascertained and allowed

shall* in case of arefufal of payment, be levied by distress and sale of the goods of the churchwardens and overseers of the place to which such certificate person is removed, by warrant of such justice or justices.

All persons who think themselves aggrieved by any such judgment of the said two justices, may appeal to the justices of the peace of the said county, at their next quarter-sessions, who shall do them justice according to the merits of their cause.

The appeal against any order of removalof any poor person, shall be had, prosecuted, and determined, at the general or quarter-sessions of the peace for the county, division, or riding, wherein the parish, township, or place, from whence such poor person shall be removed doth lie, and not elsewhere.

N. B. In case of an order of removal from a town corporate, the appeal mult be to the sessions of the county; and not ab eodem ad eunde?n> the same justices probably fitting who made the order.

No appeal from any order of removal shall be proceeded upon, unless reasonable notice be given by the churchwardens or overseers of the parish or place appealing, unto the churchwardens or overseers of the parish or place from which the removal shall be ; the reasonableness of which notice shall be determined by the justices at the quarter-sessions to which the appeal is made; and if it shall appear to them, that reasonable time of notice was not given, they shall adjourn the appeal to the next quarter-sessions, and then and there finally determine the same.

On all appeals to the sessions against the judgment or orders of any justices of the peace, the justices there shall cause defers of form to be rectified and amended, without any cost to the party, and after such amendment, shall proceed to hear the truth and merits of the cause.

And, for the more effectual preventing of vexatious removals and frivolous appeals, the justices in sessions, upon any appeal concerning the settlement of any poor person, or upon any proof before them there to be made, of notice of any such appeal to have been given by the proper officers to the churchwardens or overseers of any parish or place (though they did not afterwards prosecute such appeal), shall at the same sessions order to the party in whole behalf such appeal shall be determined, or to whom such notice did appear to have been given, such costs and charges in the law, as by the said justices in their discretion shall be thought most reasonable and just; to be paid by the churchwardens, overseers, or any other person, against whom such appeal shall be determined, or by the person that did give such notice; and if the person ordered to pay such costs, shall live out of the jurisdiction of the said court, any justice where such person shall inhabit, shall, onre-

If the justices shall, at their quarter-sessions, upon an appeal before them there had, concerning the settlement of any poor person, determine in favour of the appellant, that such poor person was unduly removed, they shall, at the same quarter-sessions, order and award to such appellant, so much money, as shall appear to the said justices to have been reasonably paid by the parish or other place on whole behalf such appeal was made, towards the relief of such poor person, between the time of such undue removal, and the determination of such appeal ; the said money so awarded to be recovered in the same manner as costs and charges upon an appeal are to be recovered by the statute just mentioned.

An order of two justices, if quashed at the sessions upon an appeal, for want of form only, is not conclusive between the two parishes.

It was moved for setting aside an order of sessions confirming an order of two justices upon appeal. But the court would hear nothing of the merits of the cause, the order of sessions being in that case final, unless there had been an error in form.

Of the Poor Rate, and other Helps towards their

Relief.

' \

THE churchwardens and overseers of the poor of every parish, or the greater part of them, shall raise weekly or otherwise (by taxation of every inhabitant, parson, vicar, and other, and of every occupier of lands, houses, tithes impropriate, propriations of tithes, coal mines, or saleable underwoods in the said parish) a convenient stock of flax, hemp, wool, thread, iron, and other ware and fluff, to set the poor to work, and also competent sums for the necessary relief of the lame, impotent, old, blind and such other among them being poor as are not able to work, and also for the putting out poor children apprentices.

Where there shall be any dispute in what parish or place improved wastes, and drained and improved marlh lands lie, and ought to be rated ; the occupiers of such lands, or houses built thereon, tithes arising therefrom, mines therein, and saleable underwoods, shall be rated to the relief of the poor, and to all other parish rates, within such parish and place

which

Poor. (Rate.)

vffiich lies nearest to such lands; and if, on application to the officers of such parish or place to have the same assessed, any dispute shall arise, the justices at the next sessions after such application made, and after notice given to the officers of the several parities and places adjoining to such lands, and to all others interested therein, may hear and determine the same on the appeal of any person interested, and may cause the same to be equally assessed, whose determination therein shall be final.

The churchwardens and overseers shall cause public notice to be given in the church, of every rate for relief of the poor, allowed by the justices, the next Sunday after such allowance ; and no rate shall be reputed sufficient to be collected, till after such notice given. And they shall permit any inhabitant to insped such rate at all seasonable times, paying is. and shall give copies on demand, being paid 6d. for every 24 names. — And if any churchwarden or overseer shall not permit any inhabitant to insped, or refuse to give copies as aforesaid, he shall forfeit 20I. to the party grieved.

If a person shall be aggrieved by any assessment, or shall have any material objection to any person's being put in or left out of such assessment, or to the sum charged on any person or persons therein ; he may, giving reasonable notice to the churchwardens or overseers, appeal to the next general or quarter-feffioijs for the county, riding, division, corporation, or franchise; but if reasonable notice be not given, then they shall adjourn the appeal to the next quarter-sessions after.

On all appeals from rates, the justices shall amend the same, without altering such rates, with respect to other persons mentioned in the same; but if, upon an appeal from the whole rate, it shall be found necessary to set afjde the same, then they shall order a new rate to be made. And the court may award cods to either party, as in cases of settlement by the 8 fcf 9 W.

True copies of the rates shall be entered in a book, by the churchwardens and overseers, within 14 days after all appeals from such rates are determined ; and they shall attest the same, by putting their names thereto; and they shall be delivered over from time to time, to the new churchwardens and overseers, as soon as they enter into their offices, to be preserved and produced at the sessions when any appeal is to be heard.

It shall be lawful as well for the present as subsequent churchwardens and overseers, or any of them, by warrant from any two such justices, one whereof is of the quorum, to levy the said sums, and all arrearages, of everyone that shall refuse to contribute according as they shall be assessed, by distress and Tale.

And if sufficient distress cannot be found within the county, on oath made thereof before a justice of any other county* the goods may be levied in another county or precinct.

Where persons shall come into, or occupy any premises, out of which any person assessed shall be removed, or which, at the time of making such rate was unoccupied ; every person so removing from, or coming into, or occupying the same, shall be liable to pay such rate, in proportion to the time that such person occupied the same respectively, under the like penalty of distress, as if such person so removing had not removed, or the person coming in or occupying had been originally assessed in such rate ; which proportion, in case of dispute, shall be ascertained by two justices.

If there has been any irregularity of proceeding in the parties distraining, and tender of amends hath been made by the said parties before an action is brought, no plaintiff shall recover in any action for such irregularity.

And if any person shall neglect to pay to such overseers, the succceding overseers shall levy the arrears, and shall reimburse their predecessors the same which are allowed to be due to them in their accounts.

If the justices perceive that the inhabitants of any parish are not able to levy among themselves sufficient sums for the purposes aforesaid, then the said two justices (1 Q) shall tax, rate, and aiTefs as aforesaid any other of other parishes, or out of any parish within the hundred, to pay such sums to the churchwardens and overseers or the said poor parish, as the justices shall think fit.

The father and grandfather, mother and grandmother, and children of every poor, old, blind, lame and impotent person, or other poor person not able to work, being of a sufficient ability, shall, at their own charges, relieve and maintain every such poor person, in that manner, and according to that rate, which, by the justices of that county where such sufficient persons dwell, in their sessions shall be assessed; on pain of 20s. a month; which penalty shall go to the use of the poor of the same parish, and be leried by some or one of the churchwardens or overseers, by warrant from two such justices ( 1 by distress; or in defect thereof, any two such justices may commit the offender to the common gaol, there to remain without bail or mainprize, till the said forfeitures shall be paid.

Where any wife, child, or children, shall be left by their husband or parents, it shall be lawful for the churchwardens or overseers, by warrant of two justices, to take and seize so much of the goods and chattels, and receive so much of the annual rents and profits of the lands and tenements of such husband, father, or mother, as such two justices shall order and direct, towards the discharge of the parish or place where such wife, child, or children are left, for the bringing up and providing for such wife, child, or children; which warrantor

And the said churchwardens and overseers shall be accountable to the justices at the quarter-sessions for all such money as they shall so receive.

All persons running away out of their parishes, and leaving their families upon the parish, shall be deemed and suffer as incorrigible rogues. See the article Vagrants.

By 17 G. 2. c. 5, these offenders are ranked in a less criminal class, and are to be punished only as rogues and vagabonds. See the said article Vagrants.

If a person doth but threaten to run away, and leave his wife and children upon the parish, he shall, on conviction, before one justice by confession, or oath of one witness, be committed to the house of correction, for any time not exceeding one month.

No justice shall order relief to any poor person, till oath be made before him, that the same person hath applied to the parishioners in vestry, or to two of the overseers, without being relieved, and till such justice hath summoned the two overseers to appear and shew cause why such relief should not be given.

If any churchwarden or overseer of the poor, or person authorized by him, shall make any payments to the poor in any base or counterfeit money, one justice, on complaint, may summon the offender, and on proof of the offence, by the oath of one witness, may adjudge him to forfeit not less than 10s. nor more than 20s. to be levied by distress, and to be applied, to the use of the poor.

Prison-Breaking.

i>i .t.ii 4 1 ?! »c# *.i n& rn -myjbc */?

THOSE who have broken prison are not bailable by justices of the peace ; and that for two reasons: I. Because it carries a preemption of guilt. And, 2. Because it is a fu-peradded offence to the farmer, for which they dood committed.

The party may be arraigned for prison-breaking, before he be convicted of the crime for which he was imprisoned; for that is not material whether he were guilty of such crime or not; for the words of the datute arc, for which he was taken and imprisoned.

The gaoler shall not be punished as a felon for the party's breach of prison, unless he voluntarily consented to it; but it seems to be a negligent escape in the gaoler, for which he may be punished by fine and imprisonment, because there wanted either that due drength in the gaol, or that due vigilance in the gaoler or his officers, that should have prevented it: And if gaolers might not be punished for this as a negligent escape, they would be careless either tofecure their prisoners, or to retake them that escape.

If a criminal, endeavouring to break the gaol, assault his gaoler, he may be lawfully killed by him in the affray.

Process.

T)Y the commission of the peace, the justices in sessions have il power to make and continue processes upon indictments, against the persons indicted, until they can be taken, surrender themselves, or be outlawed.

Indictments and presentments, taken in the sheriffs tourn, shall be delivered to the next sessions ; who may award process thereupon, in like form as if they had been taken before them-ielves.

The law, in several cases, in express words directs process to be made by justices out of sessions; and in other cases by necessary implication ; as where a datute doth give power to justices out of sessions to esquire, hear, and determine, there they may make process to cause the party to come and answer, otherwise they cannot proceed to hear and determine; and this

Wherever the king is a party to the suit (as he certainly is to all informations and indictments), the process ought to be executed by the sheriff himself, and not by the bailiff of any franchise.

If the party be in an house, if the doors be shut, and the sheriff (having given notice of his process) demand admittance, and the doors be not opened, he may break open the doors, and enter to take the offender.

It seemeth that any one justice may bail persons indicted at the sessions, for any offence under the degree of felony ; for that the Ilatutes relating specially to the power of justices in granting bail, do not in this case seem to takeaway the power, which one justice had before the making of the said statutes. f It is said, that the justices in sessions cannot issue a capias utlagatum, but must return the record of the outlawry into the king's bench, and there process of capias utlagatu?n shall issue.

If one be outlawed before the justices of the peace on an indictment of felony, they may award a capias utlagatum ; for they that have power to award process of outlawry, have also power to award a capias utlagatum, as incident to their authority and jurisdiction.

By the outlawry, all personal chattels are vested in the king by forfeitures; but real chattels, or freehold estates, are not vested in the king, till after inquisition found.

« If a man be indicted before justices of the peace, and thereupon outlawed, and is taken and committed to pTifon, the justices of gaol-delivery may award execution of this prisoner; for they are constituted to deliver the gaol.

Rape.

RAPE is when a man hath carnal knowledge of a woman, . - -

by force, and against her will. \ .08.

If any person shall unlawfully and carnally know, and abuse Rape defined: any woman child, under the age of ten years, whether with liBl. c.-7. her consent or against it, he shall be guilty of felony without L,m,ted aSc* benefit of clergy.

The offence of rape is no way mitigated, by /hewing that , jjaWm 10$. the woman at last yielded to the violence, if such her consent Consent through was forced by fear of death, or of duress.

It is not a sufficient excuse in the ravi/her, to prove that the woman is a common strumpet; for /he is still under the pro- Strumpet no tedlion of the law, and may not be forced: Nor is it any ex- ex^fe. cufe, that lhe consented after the fad.

The party ravished may give evidence on oath, and is in , jj % 5^ law a'competent witness; but the credibility of her testimony, injured party and how far /he is to be believed, mult be left to the jury, and may give e»i-is more or less credible, according to the circumstances of facts dcncc* that concur in that testimony.

For instance, if the witness be of good same ; if /he present- /</. ly discovered the offence, and made pursuit after the offender ; Circumstance* /hewed circumstances and signs of the injury, whereof many of confirmation.

are of that nature, that only women are the moll proper examiners and inspectors; if the place, wherein the fad was done, was remote from people, inhabitants, or passengers ; if the offender fled for it; these, and the like, are concurring evidences to give greater probability to her testimony, when proved by others as well as herself.

But, on the other side, if she concealed the injury for any considerable time, after she had opportunity to complain ; if the place, where the fad was supposed to be committed, were near to inhabitants or common passage of passengers, and she made no outcry when she was supposed to be done, when and where it is probable (he might be heard by others; or if a man prove himself to be in another place, or in other company, at the time she charges him with the fad ; or if she is wrong in the description of the place, or swears the fad to be done in a place where it was impossible the man could have access to hej' at that time, as if the room was locked up, and the key in the custody of another person ; these, and the like circumstances, carry ftiong preemption that her testimony is falseor feigned.

Upon the whole, rape, it is true, is a most detestable crime, and therefore ought severely and impartially to be punished with death ; but it mull be remembered, that it is an accusation easily to be made, and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, though never so innocent: Therefore, a wife jury will be cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, that they be not so much transported with indignation at the heinousness of the offence, as to be over hast-ily carried to the conviction of the person accused thereof, by the confident testimony, sometimes of malicious and false witnesses.

Recognizance.

Daft, e. 186. Defer!bed to be a bond of record

On what occasions taken.

RECOGNIZANCE is a bond of record, teflifying the recognizor to owe a certain sum of money to some other; and the acknowledgment of the same is to remain upon record ; and none can take it but only a judge or officer of record, &c.

Recognizances are taken from the reputed fathers of baf-tard children. See appendix. No. 12.

IJefides these, there are general recognizances.

Without sureties. No. 65.

With sureties, No, 66.

And

Recognizance.

375

And these recognizances, in Tome cases, the justices of the peace are enabled to take by the express words of certain statutes; but in other cases (as'Tor the peace, and good behaviour, and the like), it is rather in congruity, and by reason-abie intendment of law, than by any express authority given them, either by their commission, or by the statute law.

But wheresoever any statute giveth them power to take a bond of any man, or to bind over any man to appear at the assizes or sessions, or to take sureties for any matter or cause, they may take a recognizance. Yea, wheresoever they have authority given them to cause a man do a thing, there it seem-eth they have in congruity power given them to bind the party by recognizance to do it; and if the party shall refuse to be bound, the justice may fend him to gaol.

Every obligation and recognizance, taken by justices of the peace, mull be made to our lord the king; on pain of imprisonment of any person that shall take it otherwise.

When the parties are to enter into recognizance, call them by their names thus: — You A. B. acknowledge to owe to our

sovereign lord the king, the sum of , and you C. D.

acknowledge to owe to our sovereign lord the king, the sum

c of ; to be levied of your respective goods and chattels,

€ lands and tenements, for the use of our said lord the king,

his heirs and successors, if default shall be made in the condition following : — That is to say, if you the said A. B. shall

make default in appearing, Sec.9 But the parties need not sign it. And it is usual for the justices to mark at the foot of the examination, A. B. in 40I. to appear, &c. And from such short note make out a record afterwards.

Lord Coke fays, that a record is a memorial or remembrance in rolls of parchment, Sec. from whence it seemeth that a recognizance ought t(\ be ingrossed on parchment; but since there is no law which prohibits it to be engrossed on paper, it seemeth that if it shall be on paper only, and not on parchment, it is good in law.

And when it is made up, if the justice shall only subscribe his name, without his seal to it, this is well enough ; and that may be in either of these forts, acknowledged before me, J. P. or only to subscribe his name thus, J. P.

The justices shall certify their recognizances for keeping the peace, to the next sessions, that the party may be called ; and if he make default, the default shall be recorded, and the recognizance, with the record of the default, shall be sent and certified into the chancery, king's bench, or exchequer.

But in cases of felony, the recognizances are to be certified to the general gaol delivery.

IF any felon do rob, or take away any man's money or goods, and thereof be indicted and arraigned, and found guilty, or otherwise attainted, by reason of evidence given by the party robbed, or the owner of the money or goods, or by any other by their procurement; then the party robbed, or owner of the goods, shall be restored to such his money or goods: And as well the justices of gaol-delivery, as other justices before whom whom the felon shall be found guilty, or otherwise attainted, may award a writ of restitution, in like manner as if the felon were attainted on appeal.

Riot, rout, and unlawfnl assembly.

WHEN three persons or more shall assemble themselves together, with an intent mutually toaflift one another, again (I any who shall oppose them, in the execution of some enterprize of a private nature, with force or violence, against the peace, or to the manifest terror of the people, whether the act intended were of itself lawful or unlawful; if they only meet to such a purpose or intent, although they shall after depart of their own accord, without doing any thing, this is an unlawful assembly : If, after the (irft meeting, they shall move forward towards the execution of any such act, whether they put their intended purposes in execution or not; this, according to the general opinion, is a rout: — And if they execute such a thing in deed, then it is a riot.

The justices of the peace (or, as it hath been resolved, one justice) shall have power to restrain rioters, and to arrest and chastise them according to their offence; and cause them to be imprisoned and duly punished, according to the law and custom of the realm, and according to that which to them shall seem belt to do, by their discretion and good advisement.

But if the rioters are above the number of twelve, the offence is greatly enhanced, and the power of one justice very much enlarged, by the act commonly called the riot aft, which is required to be read at every quarter-sessions and leet. Every justice, sheriff, under-sheriff, and mayor, shall, on notice or knowledge of any unlawful, riotous, and tumultuous assembly of persons to the number of twelve or more, together with such help as he shall command, resort to the place; and with a loud voice command, or cause to be commanded, silence to be, while proclamation is making; and, after that, shall openly and with a loud voice make, or cause to be made, proclamation in these words, or like in effect:

And if any twelve or more of them shall continue together by the space of one hour after such proclamation made, they shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

If any rioters (although under the number of twelve, and whether any proclamation be made or not) shall unlawfully and with force demolish or pull down, or begin to demolish or pull down, any church or chapel, or any building for religious worship, certified and registered according to the act of toleration, or any dwelling-house, barn, liable, or other out-house, they shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy : And the hundred, city, or town, shall answer the damages thereof, as in cases of robbery.

If any riot, assembly, or rout of people, against: the law, be made, the justices, three, or two of them at the lead, and the sheriff, or under sheriff, shall come with the power of the county, if need be.

And the king's liege people being sufficient to travel, shall be assistant to them* upon reasonable warning, to ride with them in aid to refill such riots, routs, and assemblies, on pain of imprisonment, and to make fine and ransom to the king.

And the same justices and (herilf, or under sheriff, shall have power to record that which they shall find so done in their presence against the law: By which record the offenders shall be convicted in the same manner and form as is contained in the statutes of forcible entries.

And if the offenders be departed before the coming of the said justices, and sheriff or under sheriff, the same justices; three or two of them, shall diligently esquire within a month after such riot, assembly, or rout of people so made, and thereof shall hear and determine according to the law of the land.

And the said justices and other officers shall execute their offices aforesaid at the king's costs, in going and continuing in doing their said offices, by payment thereof to be made by the sheriff, by indentures betwixt the said sheriff and justices, and other officers aforesaid, whereof the sheriff, upon his account in the exchequer, may have due allowance.

The justices dwelling nighest in the county, where such riot, assembly, or rout shall be, together with the sheriff or under sheriff, shall do execution of the said statute of the 13 H. 4. every one, upon pain of iool. to the king.

If default be found in the two justices, sheriff, or under sheriff, then at the instance of the party grieved, a commission (hal,l be issued under the great seal, to enquire as well of the truth of the case for the complainant, as of such default.

Search-Warrant. 383

A justice cannot, upon a bare surmise, make a warrant to break any man's house, to search for a felon, or for stolen goods; for the justices being created by act of parliament, have no such authority granted to them by any act of parliament.

But in case of a complaint, and oath made, of goods stolen, and that the party suspeds that goods are in such a house, and shews the cause of his suspicion, the justice may grant a warrant (in the day time) to search in those suspected places mentioned in his warrant, and to attach the goods, and the party in whose custody they are found, and bring them before him, or some other justice, to give an account how he came by them, and farther to abide such order as to law shall appertain.

But in case of positive proof, it is right to execute the warrant in the night-time, left the offenders and goods also be gone before morning.

Such warrant ought to be directed to the constable, or other public officer, and not to any private person, though it is fit the party complaining should be present and assistant, because he knows his goods.

Whether the stolen goods are in a suspected house or not, the officer and his assistants in the day-time may enter, the doors being open, to make search, and isjuftifiable by the warrant.

As touching the goods brought before him, if it appear to the justice that they were not stolen, they are to be restored to the possessor; if it appear they were stolen, they are not to be delivered to the proprietor, but deposited in the hand of the sheriff or constable, to the end the party robbed may proceed, by indiding and conviding the offender, to have restitution.

As touching the party that had the custody of the goods, if 2 H y they were not stolen, then he is to be discharged ; if stolen. Receiver, how but not by him, but by another that fold or delivered them to dealt with, him, if it appear that he was ignorant that they were stolen, he may be discharged as an offender, and bound over to give evidence as a witness against him that fold them ; if it appear he knew they were stolen, he must be committed or bound over to answer the felony.

Although the purloined materials be worked up, or otherwise disposed of, so that it may be difficult to convict the offender, two justices as aforesaid, or the justices in sessions ref-pe&ively, on proof upon oath that such person hath purloined or embezzled, or received such materials, knowing them to be purloined or embezzled, may convict the offender, although no proof shall be given to whom such materials belong. All £ which provisions shall extend to all tools and implements; and also to all drugs or ingredients for dying, preparing, and manufacturing the same.

If any person shall wilfully damnify, spoil, or destroy, any work committed to his charge, he shall, on conviction as aforesaid, forfeit to the owner double value, by distress; for want of sufficient distress, the offender shall be committed to the house of correction, to be kept to hard labour, for ! any time not exceeding three months, or till satisfaction be ? made.

If any person hired or employed to work up materials for any mailer, shall neglect the performance thereof for eight days successively ; or having taken in any materials for manufacture from one mailer, shall afterwards take in any from ano-& ther mailer ; or suffer himself to be employed in any other occupation sooner than eight days before the completion of the work first taken ; he shall be sent to the house of correction or other public prison, to be kept to hard labour, not exceeding three months, nor less than one: And if any person shall receive any of the said materials in a fictitious name, in order to : be manufactured, or shall receive the same in his own name,

And if any person entrusted with any of the said materials, in order to work up the same, shall neglect, for the space of eight days after the work shall be finished, to return (if required by the owner) so much of the said materials as were not used, he shall suffer as for purloining or embezzling.

Two justices, on complaint upon oath, that there is cause to suspect, that any embezzled materials are concealed in any dwelling-house, or other place, may, by their warrant, cause the same to be searched in the day time ; and if any such materials shall be found, they may cause the same, and the person in whose possession they were found, to be brought before them, or any other two justices of the district; and if such person shall not give an account to the satisfaction of the justices how he came by the same, he shall be convicted, although no proof shall be given to whom the materials belong : And every peace officer, and watchman, during the time he is upon duty, may apprehend any person who may be reasonably suspected of carrying, after sun-setting and before sun-rising, any such materials, and the same, together with such person, may carry before two justices ; and if he shall not produce the party of whom he bought or received the same, or shall not give a satisfactory account how he came by the same, he shall be convicted in like manner, although no proof shall be given to whom such materials belong. Provided, that in either of these cases, if the person who shall be brought before the justices shall request them to appoint a reasonable time to produce the person of whom he bought or received the same, or a witness to prove the sale or delivery thereof, the justices may appoint such time, and issue a fumrnons to the constable where such person or witness shall reside, requiring him to appear and give evidence; but such person, at the time of his request, shall enter into recognizance, for his appearance at the time; or, for want of such recognizance, shall be committed until such time appointed.

And when a person shall be convicted in either of the cases aforegoing, the justices may cause the materials so found or seized to be deposited with the churchwardens or overseers, for any time not exceeding 30 days; and in the mean time shall order them to advertise the same in some newspaper usually circulated there, or otherwise to cause notice to be given by some public cryer, and by fixing such notice on the church or chapel door, that those who have loft such materials may come and claim the same: And if any person can prove them to be his, the justices shall order them to bereftored to the owner, he paying the charges of removing, depositing, and giving notice. But if before the end of 30 days no person shall prove his property, the justices shall order the same to be sold, and after deducting such charges as aforesaid, together with the

Any two such justices may dirett their precept under their telle to the lheriff, for the summons of the sessions, thereby commanding him to return a grand jury before them, or their fellow justices at a certain day and place, and to give notice to all stewardg, constables, and bailiff's of liberties, to be present and do their duties at such day and place, and to proclaim in proper places throughout his bailiwick, that such sessions will be holden at such day and place, and to attend there himself to do his duty.

And such precept should bear telle, or be dated fifteen days before the return.

The sheriff also shall cause a jury to appear at such days and places, as the said justices, or such two or more of them as aforesaid shall appoint.

1. The justices of the peace are compellable to appear at the sessions; for without their appearance, the sessions cannot be holden.

But a justice ought not to join in an order at sessions wherein himself is concerned, nor ought his name to be in the caption. An order was quashed for that reason.

2. Thecullos rotulorum ought to be there himself, or by his deputy, who is the clerk of the peace. — 3, The lheriff also, by himself or his deputy ; to receive the fines, to return jurors, to execute process, and what else to his office doth appertain. — 4. All coroners. — 5. The high constables, and all other officers to whom any warrant hath been directed, in order to make return thereof. — 6. All bailiffs of hundreds and liberties, as they are bound to give an account of all sessions-process. — 7. The gaoler, to bring thither his prisoners, and to receive such as may be committed. — 8. The keeper of the house of correction, to give in a calendar, and account of persons in his custody. — 9. All persons returned by the lheriff, by virtue of the aforesaid precept. And the jurors not appearing according to their summons, are punishable by loss of issues, which usually make part of the estreats of sessions. — 10. All persons returned by recognizance to answer, or to prosecute and give evidence.

All persons may freely attend at the sessions for the advancement of public justice, and for the service of the king. And they are invited thither by a certain freedom of access, and by proie&ion from common arrest.

No person shall act as solicitor, attorney, or agent, or sue out any process at any general or quarter-sessions, either with respect to matters of a criminal or civil nature, unless he is admitted and inrolled according to law, on pain of 50I. to him who shall sue in 12 months, with treble costs.

Where

Sessions.

4‘3

Where authority is given to two justices to do any act, the sessions may do it in all cases, except where appeal is directed to the sessions.

Justices may issue their warrants for apprehending persons charged with crimes within the cognizance of the sessions, and bind them over to appear there, although the offender be not yet indicted.

If jurisdiction be given to the sessions, to hear and determine, and doth not say by information, this shall be by in-distment, and not upon information.

The sessions is all as one day, and the justices may alter their judgments at any time whilst it continues.

It seemeth certain, that the sessions hath no authority to amerce any justice, for his non-attendance at the sessions, as the judges of assize may for the absence of any such justice at w the gaol delivery : Inter pares non eft potejias.

The sessions may proceed to outlawry in cases of indictments n found before them : But they cannot issue a capias utlagatu?n> but must return the record of the outlawry into the king's bench, and thence process of capias utlagatum shall issue.

The sessions cannot award an attachment for contempt in not complying with their orders; but the ordinary and proper method is by indictment. rlr The justices are not punishable for what they do in sessions:

iff Unless there be some manifest act of oppression, or wilful abuse

nr of power.

ii; The justices being met, the usual course is with three o-yes ji to proclaim the sessions, and then read the comraiflion of the

iff peace: Then the grand jury are called and sworn, and the

ii charge given to them.

it If there be any who are to take their oaths, in order to quail lify them for offices, this must be done between the hours of jit nine and twelve in the forenoon, and not otherwise. pr The king's proclamation against profaneness and immorality

is also to be read ; and likewise divers acts of parliament;

PI against popery, the riot aft, the black aft, the act about ale

je Vieafures, and about burying in woollen, are required to be

£ given in charge at the sessions ; the acts concerning jurors are (j to be read in Midsummer sessions yearly; and the statute against bribery and corruption in elections of members of parliament is to be read at every Easter sessions.

Then the recognizances may be called, especially such as are to prosecute and give evidence, that so bills may be drawn and prepared.

Upon appeals to be made to the sessions against judgments or orders, the justices shall cause any defect of form in such original judgments or orders, to be rectified and amended, and then shall proceed upon the merits.

Summons.

IN all legal proceedings, the person complained of ought to have notice of the charge laid against him, and to have an opportunity of being heard in his own defence. Consequently, where a person is accused before the justices, they ought to summon the party to appear, or ifi'ue their warrant to bring him before them. The manner of convening the parties is sometimes directed by the acts of parliament creating the ref-pedive offences; which therefore ought to be pursued accordingly, in other cases, where it is left discretionary in the justices.

SURETY for the peace is the acknowledging a recognizance jyajtt Ct T2g# or bond, to the king, taken by a competent judge of re- Surety&ip def-cord, for the keepingf the peace. And this surety of the «r»bed. peace every justice of the peace may take and command, i. pjwer of juflicd As a minister, commanded thereto by a higher authority. 2. torc<lulre lt#

As a judge, and by virtue of his office, derived from his commission.

By the eornmission of the peace, one or more justices have Who cortj ^ power to cause to come before them, all those who to any of hbie to give the king's people concerning their bodies, or the firing of their bond, houses, have used threats, to find sufficient security for the peace or their good behaviour towards the king and his people : And if they shall refuse to find such security, to cause them in the king's prisons to be safely kept, until they shall find such surety.

A wife may demand it against: her husband, threatening to Comytis, ng. beat her outrageously, and a husband also may have it against Wife againsthef his wife. Husband, &c.

An infant, under the age of 14. years, may demand this surety, and it shall be granted him.

It ought, upon a just cause of complaint, to be granted by any justice of the peace, against any perfort whatsoever, under the negree of nobility, being of fane memory, whether he be a magistrate or private person, and whether he be of full age, or under age. The faf'eft way of proceeding against a peer, is by complaint to the court of chancery or king's bench.

If the person to be bound be in the presence of the justice, he may be immediately committed, unless he offers sureties.

The justice may make the warrant under seal, to bring the be offered, party before himself or some other justice, or he may make it to 5Co‘ 59 bring the party before himself only ; for he that maketh the warrant for the most part, hath the best knowledge of the mat- f>m. other juf-ter, and therefore he is the fittest to do justice in the cafe# tice.

Surety for the Peace.

If one who fears that the surety of the peace will be demanded against him, find sureties before any justice of the same county, either before or after a warrant is issued against him, he may have a supersedeas from such justice, which shall discharge him from arrest from any other justice, at the suit of the same party, for whose security he has given such surety.

Where a person authorized by warrant of a justice of the peace, to compel a man who is (heltered in an house, to find sureties for the peace or good behaviour, is denied quietly to enter into it, he may justify breaking open the doors, in order to take him ; but he must first signify to those in the house the cause of his coining, and request them to give him admittance.

If the warrant specially direct that the party shall be brought before the justice who made it, the officer ought not to carry him before any other ; but if the warrant be general, to bring him before any justice of such place, the officer has the election to bring him before what justice he pleaseth, and may carry him to prison for refusing to find surety before such justice.

If the party is carried before another justice, and not before him who issued the warrant, such other justice must take the surety, and bind him by recognizance in all points as the form of the precept doth require.

If the officer arrest the party, and do not carry him before the justice to find sureties; or upon the refusal of the party, if the officer shall arrest him, and do not carry him to the gaol, in both these cases the officer is punishable by the justices for this neglect, by indictment and fine at their sessions. When the party cometh before the justice, he must offer sureties, or else the justice may commit him ; for the justice needeth not to demand surety of him.

If a man that was bound to keep the peace, hath broken his bond, the justices ought of discretion to bind him anew ; but not until he be thereof convicted by due course of law.

The recognizance, which the justice takes for the keeping of the peace, is rather of congruity, than by any express authority given either by the common law, or by statute.

The recognizance is forfeited, if the party make default of appearance, and the same default shall be recorded.

It may also be forfeited by any attual violence to the person of another, whether it be done by the party himself, or by others through his procurement.

The justices cannot, in any case, proceed against the party, for a forfeiture of his recognizance, either in respect of his not appearing, or breaking the peace; the recognizance itself, with the record of default of appearance, ought to be removed into some of the courts at Westminster.

but not usual. Caution to justice.

AM AN may be compelled to find sureties both for the good behaviour and for the peace; and yet the good behaviour includeth the peace; and he that is bound to the good behaviour, is therein also bound to the peace.

The surety* of the good behaviour is of great affinity with that of the peace, and is provided chiefly for the preservation of the peace; and is moil commonly granted either in the Granted in fef-o.pen sessions, or by two or three justices out of sessions. Yet, f10rlj or by two by the words of the commission, as also by the common opinion or more justices of the learned, one justice alone, out of sessions, may grant this surety of the good behaviour. But this is not usual, unless it be to prevent some great and sudden danger, especially against Out of sessions, a man that is of any good estate, carriage, or report. And it by one> shall be good discretion in the justices, that they do not grant it, but either upon sufficient cause seen to themselves, or upon the suitor complaint of others, and the same very honest and credible persons.

A man may be bound to his good behaviour for many causes 1 Haw. 32. of scandal, which give him a bad same, as being contrary to Causes of this good manners only ; as for consorting with women of bad same; furetyflup. or for speaking words of contempt of an inferior magistrate, as a justice of the peace, or mayor, though he be not then in the attual execution of his office ; or of an inferior officer of justice, as a constable, and such like, being in the actual execution of his office.

It seems the better opinion, that no one ought to be bound to the good behaviour, for any ra(h, quarrelsome, or unman- N*t for wor(Js nerly words, unless they either diredily tend to a breach of the only> un|eps of a peace, or to scandalize the government, by abusing those who dangertus are intrusted by it with the administration of justice, or to de- tenucncy. ter an officer from doing his duty.

The magistrate has a discretionary power to take such surety of all those whom he shall have just cause to suspect to be dan- Su"fje&e(j per. gerous, quarrelsome, or scandalous; as of those who sleep in fons, ice that the day, and go abroad in the night; and of such as keep luf- article, picious company ; and of such as are generally suspected to be robbers, common drunkards, and the liko ; and all other persons of evil same.

In general, whatsoever att or thing is of itself a milbeha-viour, is cause sufficient to bind such an offender to good behaviour.

Vagrants.

Two justices, in case any person apprehended upon a general privy Search, or by a special warrant, shall be charged before them with being a rogue and vagabond, or an idle or disorderly person, or with suspicion of felony (although no direCfc proof be then made thereof), may examine such person on oath, as to his Settlement and means of livelihood; and the substance of such examination shall be put in writing, and Signed by such person, and by the justices, and be transmitted to the next sessions to be hied ; and if such person shall not Shew that he has a lawful way of getting his livelihood, or shall not procure Some responsible house-keeper to his character, and give security, if required, for his future appearance at some other day to be fixed for that purpose, the justices may commit him to some prison or house of correction, for any time not exceeding six days; and in the mean time order the overseers of the poor to advertise in some public paper a description of his person, and any thing that shall be found on him, or in his custody, and which he shall be suspected not to have come honestly by, and the place of his commitment, and the time and place appointed for his re-examination ; and if no accusation shall be then laid against him, he shall be discharged, or otherwise dealt with according to law.

Where any rogues or vagabonds, apprehended by any constable, or Such other person as aforesaid, shall be brought before a justice, he shall inform himself by the examination upon oath of the person apprehended, or of any other person, of the condition and circumstances of the person so apprehended, and of the parish or place where he was last legally settled : — The substance of which shall be put into writing, and be Signed by the person or persons so examined; and the justice shall likewise sign the Same, and transmit it to the next sessions, there to be filed and kept on record.

And Such justice shall order Such person so apprehended, to be publicly whipt by the constable, petty constable, or Some other person, to be appointed by such constable, or petty constable, of the parish or place, where Such person was apprehended ; or shall order him to be Sent to the house of correction till the next Sessions, or for any less time, as Such justice shall think proper.

Where any offender against this act shall be committed to the house of correction till the next Sessions; and the justices at Such Sessions shall, on examination of the circumstances of the case, adjudge Such person a rogue or vagabond, or an incorrigible rogue; they may order Such rogue or vagabond to be detained in the house of correction to hard labour, for any further time not exceeding six months, and such incorrigible rogue for any further time not exceeding two years, nor less than six months; and during his confinement, to be whipped in such manner, and at such times and place, as they shall think fit; and such person may, if the sessions think conve-

And if such incorrigible rogue, so ordered by the sessions to be detained in the house of correction, shall break out or make his escape, or shall offend in like manner, he shall be guilty of felony, and be transported for seven years.

The justices in sessions may transport such rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars, as shall be duly convicted, and adjudged to be incorrigible.

If the child of any vagrant, above the age of seven years, shall be committed to the house of correction, the justices in sessions, if they fee convenient, at any time before such child be discharged, may order such child to be placed out as afer-vant or apprentice to any person within their jurisdiction, who is willing to take such child, till such child shall be of the age of 21 years, or for a less time; and if any offender, who was found wandering with such child, shall be again found with the same child which was so placed out, he shall be deemed an incorrigible rogue.

Where any vagrants have been committed to the house of correction till the next sessions, if on examination of such persons no place can be found, to which they may be conveyed by a pass, the sessions shall order them to be detained and employed in the house of correction, until they can provide for themselves, or until the justices in sessions can place them in some lawful calling, as servants, apprentices, soldiers, mariners, or otherwise.

After whipping or confinement, the justice may, if he 1 ' thinks convenient, by a pass, under hand and seal, cause the vagrant to be conveyed to the place of his last legal settlement; but if it cannot be found, then to the place of his birth ; or if he be under the age of 14 years, and have any father or mother living, then to the place of abode of such father or mother, there to be delivered to some churchwarden or overseer.

The justice shall make a duplicate of the pass and examination, and sign the same; and shall afterwards transmit the duplicate of the pass, annexed to the examination, to the next (eftions, there to be filed and kept on record ; and shall annex the duplicate of the examination to the pass, and fend it with the same; and the said pass, examination, and duplicate thereof, shall and may be read in any court of record as evidence.

And the justice, who shall make the pass, shall with the pass cause likewise to be delivered to the constable a note or certificate ascertaining how they are to be conveyed, by horse, cart, or on foot, and wha: allowance such constable is to have for conveying them.

And the constable, who shall receive such pass and certificate, shall convey the person according to the direction of the pass, the next direct way to the place where he is ordered to be sent, if it be in the same county, riding, division, corporation, orfranchise; if not, he shall deliver the said person to the constable of the first town, parish, or place, in the next county, riding, division, corporation, or franchise; in the direct way to the place whither he is to be conveyed, together with the pass and duplicate of the examination, taking his receipt for the same. And such constable shall, without delay, apply to some justice in the same county or division, who shall make the like certificate, and deliver it to such constable, who shall, with all speed, convey such person unto the first parish, town, or place to which he is to be conveyed. And so from one county or division to another, till they come to the place to which such person is sent. And the constable, who shall deliver such person to the churchwarden, or other person ordered to receive him, by such pass, shall at the same time deliver the said pass, with the duplicate of the examination, taking their receipt for the same.

The justices in sessions shall limit what rates and allowances, by the mile, or otherwise, shall be made, for conveying or maintaining rogues, vagabonds, or incorrigible rogues; and make such other orders for the more regular proceeding therein, as they shall think proper.

And if any petty constable shall bring to any high constable such certificate as aforesaid, together with a receipt or note from the constable to whom the person was delivered, the said high constable shall pay the rates ascertained by such certificate, taking the petty constable's receipt. And if the high constable shall refuse or neglect to pay the same on demand, it shall be lawful for one justice, by his warrant, to levy double the sum, by distress.

Where the high constable hath not money in his hand sufficient to answer the said expences, the treasurer shall pay the same to such petty constable, on his producing the certificate, and such other vouchers as aforesaid.

If a petty constable, or governor of any house of correction, shall counterfeit such certificate or receipt, or knowingly per mit any alteration to be made therein, he shall forfeit 50I. —

. And if he shall not convey, or cause to be conveyed, such vagrants, or not deliver them to the proper person ; or if any constable shall refuse to receive any such person, or to give such receipt, he shall forfeit 20I. by distress and sale, by warrant of the justices in sessions, where the ofFerice shall be committed ; half to the informer, and half to the treasurer, to be applied by him as part of the public flock ; returning the overplus upon demand, charges of distress being first satisfied.

But if the churchwarden or other person, who shall receive any person so sent, shall think the examination to be false, he may carry the person so sent before a justice, who, if he fee cause, may commit such person to the house of correction till the pext sections; and the justices there, if they fee cause, may deal with such person as an incorrigible rogue; but the person so sent shall not be removed from the place to which he is sent, but by order of two justices, in the same manner as other poor persons are removed to the place of their settlement.

Lunatic vagrants may be apprehended, and kept safely locked up in some secure place within the county, or precind, as two justices shall appoint; and all charges shall be paid by the parish, township, or place, to which such person belongs, by order of two justices, directed to the churchwardens and overseers for that purpose.

If any person shall knowingly permit any rogue, vagabond, or incorrigible rogue, to lodge or take (belter in his house, barn, or other out-house or building, and shall not apprehend and carry him before a justice, or give notice to the constable so to do, and shall be convicted thereof by confession, or oath of one witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit not exceeding 40s. nor less than 10s. half to the informer, and half to the poor, by distress and sale; and if any charge shall be brought on any parish or place, by^means of such offence, the same shall be answered to the said parish or place by such offender, and be levied by distress and faje of his goods as aforesaid; and if sufficient distress cannot be found, such offender shall be committed to the house of correction by the justice, for any time not exceeding one month.

Where any vagrant woman shall be delivered of a child or children, and become chargeable, the churchwardens or overseers may detain such woman in their custody until they can safely convey her to a justice, who shall examine her, and commit her to the house of correction until the next feflior.s 5 who may, if they fee convenient, order her to be publicly whipped, and detained in the house of correction for any further time not exceeding six months. And upon application by the churchwardens and overseers of the plac$ where (he was so delivered, the justices at such sections shall order the treasurer to pay them such a sum, as shall be adjudged a reasonable satisfaction for the charges such place has been put to on such woman's account. And if such woman shall be detained and conveyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which (he is delivered, if a bastard, shall not be settled in the place where so

And that it may appear that the overseers have done what Bum, Art. was incumbent upon them, in order to avoid such settlement. Vagrant. it is requisite for the justice (as he ought to do in all other cases Jult,ce wherein he afteth as judge) to make a record of the whole ° *X°~

proceedings before him ; which record (as it seemeth) will be 0 the proper evidence in such case, if the settlement shall afterwards be contested.

tf any constable, or other officer, shall be defective in his Id. duty, in any case for which no punishment is herein before Negligent con-particularly provided ; or if any person shall hinder the exe- ^ovr cution of this act, and shall be thereof convicted, on oath of puni c one witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit not exceeding 5I. nor under 10s. to the poor by distress; and, if sufficient distress cannot be found, shall be committed to the house of correction to be kept to hard labour, not exceeding two months.

To defray the expences of apprehending, conveying, and Id. maintaining rogues, vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues, and EspeacHof defraying all other expences necessary for the execution of this count* Prate«y aft, not herein before provided for, the justices in sessions may 1 cause such sums as shall be necessary, to be raised in the same manner as the general county rate.

Any person aggrieved by the act of any justice out of sessions, Id. in or concerning the execution of this act, may appeal to the Power of appeal* next general or quarter-sessions of the county, riding, liberty, or division, giving reasonable notice thereof; whose order thereupon shall be final.

This act, after a recital of 6 G. I. c. 19. empowers justices 17 G. 3. e. n. to commit those vagrants, and other persons charged with Vagrants to small offences, either to the common gaol, or to any house of ga°l <>r hou*« correction, within their respective jurisdictions, as to fuchjuf- corrc ,on* tices shall seem most proper, whom by any law now in force, or hereafter to be made, they are, or shall be authorized to commit to the common gaol.

This act requires that rogues or vagabonds ordered to be Vagrants con-conveyed by pafifes, agreeable to the 17 G. 2. c. 5, commonly fined forseven called the Vagrant Act, be publicly whipt or confined in a days, house of correction, until the next general or quarter-sessions, or for any such less time as the justice of the peace shall think proper; provided that such less time shall be at the least for the space of seven days, and that fijeh justice of the peace shall certify, in the pass by which such person shall be ordered to be conveyed, that such person has been actually publicly whipt, or confined in the house of correction for at least the space of seven days; No person shall be so whipt or imprisoned, and conveyed by a pass as a rogue or vagabond, who shall not have committed an act of vagrancy within the true

No ju (lice of the peace shall order any reward to be paid to any constable or other person for apprehending any rogue or vagabond, until such rogue or vagabond shall have been punished as hereby directed, and until the examination required by the aforesaid act be actually transmitted to the next general or quarter-sessions, there to be filed and kept on record.

No female vagabond shall be whipt in any case whatsoever. Any of his Majesty's judges at the assizes, and the justices, at the general or quarter-sessions, or any justice of the peace, is and are hereby impowered to order, whenever he or they shall think proper, any convict,' upon his discharge from pri-son? to be conveyed by pass under hand and seal, in manner and form directed by the act 17 G. 2. c. 5. and according to the provisions therein contained; and the judge, justices, or justice aforesaid, is or are also empowered to convey by pass any person who shall be acquitte'd at the assizes, or general or quarter-sessions, or discharged by proclamation or otherwise, who shall of himself or herself, or by any other person in his or her behalf, apply to the court whereat he or she has been acquitted or discharged, or to any justice of the peace, to be conveyed as aforesaid ; and the judge, justices, or justice aforesaid, shall certify in such pass that the person so conveyed was discharged from prison, or a person acquitted, or otherwise discharged, at the assizes or sessions, as the case may be; and such convict, or person acquitted or discharged, shall pay no fee whatever for such pass.

The present mode of conveying vagrants in the custody of a constable being frequently inefficient, from the misconducc and negligence of constables, the justices of the peace, at the general or quarter-sessions held for any county, riding, city, borough, town corporate, division, or liberty, or any adjournment thereof, shall be empowered to make an order that all rogues and vagabonds apprehended in their respective counties, ridings, cities, &c. and who are ordered to be conveyed by pass, shall be conveyed by the mailer of the house of correction or his servants, or by a constable, as such justices at thegeneialor quarter-sessions, or any adjournment thereof, shall think proper; and such justices shall also be empowered to make an order, if they think proper, that all constables to whom rogues or vagabonds brought from another county, riding, city, &c. are delivered, shall forthwith convey such rogues and vagabonds to the neared house of correction in their county, riding, city, &c. to be afterwards forwarded by the mailer of the house of correction, or his servants, as aforesaid, and according to the provisions of the said act of 17 G. 2. c. 5.

and jurisdictions; which rates, allowances, orders, rules, and directions, shall from time to time be observed and submitted to by all justices of the peace, condables, officers, and other persons within the said limits and jurisdictions respectively.

Soldiers and mariners, wandering and begging, are to be deemed vagabonds, within the meaning of the vagrant act.

If it shall be made appear to any two justices of the peace, that any poor person shall not use proper means to get employment, or, if he is able to work, by his neglect of work, or by spending his money in ale houses or places of bad repute, or in any other improper manner, shall not apply a proper proportion of the money earned by him towards the maintenance of his wife and family, by which wilful default or neglect they, or any of them, shall become chargeable to their parish or township, he shall be considered as an idle and disorderly person, and be subject to such punishment, and in such manner, a9 is directed for idle and disorderly persons by the aforesaid act, 17 G. 2. c. 5.

Warrant.

IF a justice fee a felony or other breach of the peace committed in his presence, he may, in his own person, apprehend the felon ; and so he may by word command any person to apprehend him, and such command is a good warrant without writing; but if the same be done in his absence, then he mud issue his warrant in writing.

There seems to be no doubt, but that a warrant may be law-fully granted by any justice, for treason, felony, or praemunire, or any other offence against the peace: Also it seems clear, that wherever a statute gives to any one justice a jurisdiction over any offence, or a power to require any person to do a certain thing ordained by such statute, it by implication gives a power to every such justice to make out a warrant to bring before him any person accused of such offence, or compellable to do the thing ordained by such statute; for it cannot but be intended, that a statute giving a person jurisdiction over an offence, doth mean also to give him the power incident to all courts of compelling the parry to come before him.

But in cases where the king is no party, or where no corporal punishment is appointed, as in cases for servants* wages, and the like, it seemeth that a summons is the more proper process ; and for default of appearance, the justice may proceed ; and so indeed oftentimes it is directed by special statutes.

It is convenient, though not always necessary, that the party who demands the warrant be first examined on oath, touching

the whole matter whereupon the warrant is demanded, and that examination put in writing.

Or at least it is safe to bind him over to give evidence ; left afterwards when the offender shall be apprehended, or shall surrender himself, the party that procured the warrant be gone.

A justice hath power to issue a warrant to apprehend a person suspected of felony. For the justices are judges of the reasonableness of the suspicion, and when they have examined the party acculing, touching the reasons of his suspicion, if they find the causes of suspicion to be reasonable, it is now become the j uHices* suspicion as well as his.

Yet insomuch as justices claim this power rather by connivance, than any express warrant of law, and ftnce the undue execution of it may prove so highly prejudicial to the reputation as well as the liberty of the party, a justice cannot well be too tender in his proceedings of this kind, and seems to be punishable not only at the suit of the king, but also of the party grieved, if he grant any such warrant, without such probable cause as might induce a candid and impartial man to suspect the party to be guilty.

It is safe, but perhaps not necessary, in the body of the warrant to shew the place where it was made 5 yet it seems necessary to set forth the county, in the margin at least, if it be not set forth in the body.

It may be directed to the sheriff, bailiff, constable, or to any indifferent person by name who is no officer ; for the justice may authorize any one to be his officer, whom he pleases to make such; yet it is most adviseable to direct it to the constable of the precinct wherein it is to be executed, for that no other constable, and a fortion no private person is compellable to serve it.

In the case of an act of parliament, if the act directeth that a justice shall grant a warrant, and doth not say to whom it shall be directed, by consequence of law it must be directed to the constable, and it cannot be directed to the sheriff, unless such power is given in the act.

The warrant, especially if it be for the peace or good behaviour, or the like, where sureties are to be found or required, ought to contain the special cause and matter whereupon it is granted, to the intent the party upon whom it is to be served may provide his sureties, and take them with him to the justice to be bound for him ; but if the warrant be for treason, murder, or felony, or other capital offence, the warrant of the justice may be to bring the party before him, to make answer to such things or matters generally, as shall be objected against him on the king's behalf.

The warrant may issue to bring the party before the justice who granted the warrant speciallyt and then the officer is bound to bring him before the same justice; but if the warrant

be

be to bring him before any justice, then it is in the ele£lion of 2

the officer to bring him before what justice of the county he or

EDWARD MONTAGU, Esq,

MASTER IN CHANCERY,

AND ONE OF

HIS MAJESTY'S JUSTICES OF THE PEACE FOR THE COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX, Ac.

Dear Sir,

---

THE last Edition of this Work was honoured with the very respectable name of yoift* Noble Relation^ii^Oracc the late Duke of Montagu, whole character, it is needless to observe, was universally respected $ and whole departure was more particularly felt and regretted by those who had most frequent opportunities of access, and consequently were best acquainted with his Grace's many amiable virtues: It was not least sensibly felt and regretted by that Society, over which he presided, with equal dignity andcondefcension: A Society, whole object, as you well know. Sir, is to give energy to the endeavours of the Magistrate, for the suppression of Vice and Immorality. The efforts of this Society were encouraged in its infancy, and the attendance of its Members was rendered most agreeable, by the politeness of its President, and the affability with which they were uniformly received.

The loss of its first illustrious President was in due time supplied by another Nobleman of distinguished *character, whose integrity, in the highest department

Earl Bathurst.

[ >v ]

of the Law, and of the British Senate, is too well known, to need the testimony of any individual, much less such a feeble suffrage as the prefen t. His Lordship's declining health unhappily deprived the Society too soon of the honour and satisfaction of his valuable superintendence; which additional stroke would have been more severely felt, if the same con-defeension, and the same friendly assistance, were not . confidently expected from the R ight Rev. f Prelate, who now fills the President's Chair,

You, Sir, who have so kindly afforded your valuable support to the measures of this Society, when your other manifold engagements would admit of your attendance, will rejoice to find, that its efforts have not been ineffectual: But that, oh the contrary, its exertions have been productive of much important benefit to the Community. To these we may impute, under the sanction of several recent acts of Parliament, the establishment of a purer Magistracy in the Metropolis and its vicinity: To these we may aferibe a very considerable diminution of vexatious litigations $ an almpft entire suppression of idle and disorderly vagrancy, and a far better regulation of public houses.

Of these benefits, you. Sir, must have been a witness, not only in your attendance on our Sessions-Court, but also in your private administration of justice within your populous district, in which you are well known to be diligently employed in reconciling differences ; in informing the ignorant; in restraining the vicious; and in promoting the cause of Virtue and Morality, to the utmost extent of your influence and authority.

The following (it is hoped, improved) Edition of this Work would not have solicited the honourable

patronage

+ Bishop of London.

[ V ]

patronage of your name, if the Editor had not been well aware, that candour is generally found to go hand in hand with superior information. The feve-rities of criticism are chiefly to be apprehended from those whole knowledge is superficial, and their disposition envious ; The Editor has nothing to fear from I one, who will be as ready to make allowances for the imperfections in this Publication, as he is able to discover them.

May your health. Sir, and yoiir ability to do good, in a variety of situations, long continue: And may your upright discharge of the duties of a Magistrate for many succeeding years, afford one, amidst a mul titude of other testimonies, that the Magistracy of the county of Middlesex is, at least, as disinterested and respectable as any other Commission of the Peace in the Kingdom.

I have the honour to be.

With the sincerest respect,

Dear Sir,

Your most obedient and faithful humble servant and fellow-labourer.

The EDITOR.

TO THE

READER.

THE high Estimation in which Dr. Burns Work, entitled, The Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, has long been

holden encourages the Editor of the following Jheets to that another Jlrufturc raised, with a similar on so solid a foundation, though to a much less elevated height, will not be deemed unworthy of the public notice. It claims very Uttk merit, but what is derived from a new arrangement of that ufefvl information, for which this country is so much indebted to the labours of the eminent Compiler already mentioned.

Its merit, if it has any, chiefly confjls in -ing out more immediately to the eye of the Magis-trate, who may be supposed to have many other engagements on his hands, that line of conduS, which, in alrnojl every emergency, it is his duty topvrfuc. The authorities, as well from the common, as the statute law, are indeed less numerous than in many other books of this kinds yet it is hoped, that they

are

[ viii ]

are fiefficientlyto proceed

in every ordinary case which may occur. The Jla-tutes, as to every thing are faithfully recited: And though not of the ejfence of the for fake, be

omitted, the Editor falters that what

mains will be abundantly sufficient to guard the

son who consults them from any error in his.

Adjudged cases, for the confirmation of his judgment, may be found at large in ?nanv very judicious collections of this fort: The work of Lord Dudley and Ward, and T. Cunningham, entitled, “ The Law'of a Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, &c."is a mofi valuable of information on

this subjeB. And the Magistrate will find it prudent to have jack useful books of reference as that compilation, and Dr. Burn's Justice of the Peace, always at his hand. But with all these at his command, he nevertheless Jlands in need of some more obvious direction, when he is wishing to dif-patch the business which presents itself, with

tion,safety, and satisfaction to himself and.

It is well kno7uri, that several compilations of a similar nature with this have been heretofore offered to the public, under a great variety of titles and descriptions: And there is no doubt, that the Magis-trate has derived no incorsiderable advantage from the

C 1

lights communicated to by publications $

> Andr~*n&tvnt quantum valere poffint — is our

sincere dcjirc: We by no means to raise the -putation of the following work, depreciating the

merits of any other. The reader is left at full li-

berty (and this liberty he certainly would whether we indulged him with it or not) to call to his affijlance those productions, which he thinks mofl likely to direEt, secure, and faiisfy him in the aharge of his duty.

In the mean time, when a matter of doubt and difficulty is before him (and such he expe8 will

sometimes occur)he mil be happy to avail himself of that liberal sentiment of one of the mofl ornaments of this or any other nation: “ Where the Magistrate appears to have been misguided by an erroneous judgment, without any purpose of doing ill, GOD forbid {fays this venerable Personage*) that the courts of law Jkouli not give him credit for the purity of his intention, and put the mofl favourable conflruHion on his condu3, that the case can pojfibly admit of”

This is, in Jubflance, the declaration, which, com-ingfrom fuchreJpeSable authority, has doubtless encouraged many to engage in the ufefvl employment of a

The late Lord Chief Jufliee of the King's Bench.

Justice of the Peace, who would otherwifi have been very cautious of exposing themselves to the greeable consequence of a faux pas interpreting the laws. The indulgence here , emboldens

those who are disposed to act, under the directions of an honest intention, and a plain under Handing, freely

to exercise their best judgment; no longer apprehen-Jive, that the want of formor the omission of same legalpunEliliOy may bring them within the reach of the censures of a superior cou.

It is not, however, insinuated, that indifference or wilful negligence is at any rate excvfeable in interpreting or enforcing a plain On

the contrary, frequent occasio will offer

wherein it is impossible to be too minutely precise; M-cause, in such cases, every advantage will.

taken of any want of accuracyor of the fmaUeJl inattention to the letter of the As a proof of

this, and to convince the Magistrate of the necessity of extreme carefulness in his duty, it may not be amiss to observe, that Dr. Bum enumerates not less than twenty instances, in which an Order of Removal has been, or is liable to be, quashed, on account of some apparently infgnificant error in the mere

ter of form. All, thereforewhich is intended by the encouragement holden forth, as above, is to remove from the mind of a well-meaning, but timorous

gistrate,

[ xi ]

gifirate, the apprehtnsion of more, perhaps,

than censure, for an involuntary error in his -duB ; but no licence is hereby given him to trifle with the obvious directions of a , or to adopt a latitude of interpretation, which is neither safe nor rantablei

It iuas certainly an instance of equal candour and wisdom to encourage, as much as fons to flip forward, who, though their rank and Jituation in life, as well as their liberal education, marked them as most proper for this office, had yet been found too generally averse from engaging in it. We will not allow ourfehes to impute this -

ness to a mere love of dissipation, or a mere dislike to buflness. We are willing to think, that there are very few individuals of the above description, in point of rank, fortune, and education, who would not feci great satisfaction in finding themselves materially

serviceable to their country, in the discharge of an office fio important to the suppression of vice, and to the advancement and security of the public welfare: We have seen, and now fee them, cheerfully foregoing the comforts of domefiic life, and readily withdrawing their attention from their private concerns, in order to devote their time, andfome their fortune and their health, to the arduous duties of a military life: Whence is it then that so few have been found b 2 equally

t ]

equally ready to dedicate some portion of their hours to the preservation of public and to the maintenance of good order and decency among their neighbours ? It could only have arisen from

henjion of some more than ordinary objlacks and imp* diments: They must surely have been deterred by the consideration, that, in order to attain to a competent

knowledge of the duties of a Magistrate* a tedious* thorny path was to bepurfuei; where no small share of difficulties -wouldmeet them by the way; and after all their labour* no inconsiderdble danger of mif carrying would be incurred* even under the left information* which,' till of late years* they were able to procure-

It has been oaf happier lot* to find these objections in a great measure removed: We have fern what tight has been thrown on the fluiy of the municipal and statute laws* by the , , and

learned Commentaries of that aceomplished Sir William Blacrstone : And we have good reasontohope, that the chair of future more easily be filled by persons of conference and respe&ability* well qualified for this ufefvl department in society; whcnwethat the Jtudy of the common law makes at this time a very -Jiderabkpart of academical education.

But

[ 3

But if no such advantages as theft subsisted, the

excellent work of Dr. Burn would alone be sufficient to remove the principal discou, which -tncrfy deterred such, as were not inured to the habits of close enquiry, and toilfme refearSince that work

has been so universally received, and fojvftly admired

and approved, the Justice of the Peace has seldom

been at a loss for necessary information in almost every common case: And perhaps the only apology which can be offered for hazarding the following , when

a work, so deservedly esteemed, is in almost every hand,

is this: That the four volumes of Dr. Burn,

(ithough no Magistrate ought to be without them, as books of reference) comprise more, than it is necessary for a Justice of the Peace to,

the ordinary duties of his office: From these, undoubtedly, much satisfactory information may be derived on subjects of no inconfderable,

though not immediately connected with the duties of a Magistrate.

If the following compendiumshall be found in any degree to facilitate the administration of justice,by more

obvieufly exhibiting all that is written in the law on every ordinary subject, the Editor flatters himself he shall have rendered no inconfderable feroice to his brethren in the commission; and will think his labours amply recmpenfed by their favourable acceptance of his befl endeavours.

IT may seem an unnecessary trespass on the Public, to offer to their notice this Third Edition of The Magistrate's Assistant; especially when another source has been recently opened upon the same subject, with such a body of information, (as appears from the title of it) as must henceforth leave the erring Magistrate altogether without excuse.

The long and well-deserved reputation of ' "Burris Justice of the P,&c. has not, it seems, discouraged another able compiler from coming forward with a Work of equal magnitude, under the title of The Whole Law relative to the Duty and Office of a Justice of the , &c. but neither the labours of this learned Editor, Mr. Williams, nor those of his pre-decessor, have induced us to alter our opinion, as delivered on the lirft appearance of this Work: Its utility as a Manual, or Book of immediate Reference, is still the same: It does not pretend to supersede the necessity of occasional application to more voluminous publications ; but it professes to conduct the upright and well-designing Magistrate, by a short

C *v» J

and cafy way, and with as little trouble, and as little waste of time as may be, to the point, at which he wiflies to arrive, viz. the Elucidation of the Truth, the Vindication of the Oppressed, the Restraint of the DUobedient, and a due Administration of Justice towards all.

If this point is secured in the following Work, its end will be fuSficiently answered in all ordinary cases: And where Magistrates have curiosity to investigate, and leisure to pur-sue their enquiries farther, they will never want the means of useful and entertaining research, so Jong as the above-mentioned compilations, and also the very judicious Publication, by Mr. Const, from the papers of Mr. Box t, on tho Poor Laws, are within their reach.

Any witness neglecting or refusing to appear upon summons at the time and place appointed, without a reasonable excuse to be allowed by such justice, or appearing and refusing to be examined on oath and give evidence, shall forfeit 20s.

And if any person shall think himself aggrieved by the con-▼i&ion of such justice, he may appeal to the next quarter sessions; on left they are held within six days; in which case he may appeal to the following sessions, after giving security to the satisfaction of the justice, for the payment of the penalty, costs, and expences of such conviction.

If any person shall fell or deliver any beer or ale, to any person that fttall then fell beer or ale as a common tipler or ale-housekeeper, (except it be for the use of his houshold only) the same person not having licence to fell ale or beer; he shall, forfeit for every barrel 6s. 8d. and so proportion ably for other quantities; half to the poor, and half to him that shall foe in sessions, by action of debt, information, indictment, or prefen tment.

No licence shall be granted to any person to keep a common inn or alehouse, but at a general meeting of the justices acting f in the division where the said person dwells, to be holden for that purpose, on the first day of September yearly, or within twenty days after, and not at any other time. — -This shall not alter the power or the time of granting licences, in cities and towns corporate.

The day and place for granting licences shall be appointed by two or more justices for the division, by warrant under their bands and seals, at lead ten days before such meeting, directed to the high constables, requiring them to order their petty con (tables, or other peace officers, to give notice to the several innkeepers and alehousekeepers within their respective confta-blewicks, of the day and place of such meeting.

The person licensed shall enter into a recognizance in 10I. with two sureties in 5I. each, or one surety in 10I. as well against theufing of unlawful games, as also for the using and maintenance of good order and rule, to be had and used within the same.

These three things are especially recommended to the juf tices'care: 1. That no alehousekeeper, upon the Lord's day, should receive, or suffer to remain, any persons whatsoever, as their gueits, in any of their houses or other places, to tipple, eat or drink ; other than travellers, and such as come upon necessary business. 2.

The recognizance, with the condition thereof, fairly written or printed, shall forthwith, or, at the next sessions at farthest, be font or returned to the clerk of the peace, under the hands of the justices, to be by him entered or filed among the records.

The justices shall have power, in their quarter-sessions, to esquire of all such persons as shall be admitted and allowed to keep any alehouse or tiplinghouse, and that be so bound by recognizance, if they have done any ail whereby they hsve forfeited the same recognizance, and they shall, upon such presentment or information, award process against every such person so presented or complained of before them, to shew why he should not forfeit his recognizance; and shall have power to hear and determine the same, by all such ways and means, ac by their discretion shall be thought good.

The justices of the peace may deliver or fend into the king bench, indictments found before them, or recognizances of the peace taken before them, or force recorded by them, without any certiorari.

A certiorari lies in all judicial proceedings, in which a writ of error does not lie ; and it is a consequence of all irfferior jurisdictions erected by act of parliament to have their proceedings returnable in the king's bench.

And therefore a certiorari lies to justices of the peace, even in such cases which they are impowered by statute finally to hear and determine.

If a certiorari for the removal of an indictment before justices of the peace be not delivered, before the jury be (won!

_______ for the trial of it, the justices may proceed.

A return was in paper (and not upon parchment); and for that reason was held by the court not good.

Upon a certiorari to remove an indictment of a riot, or forcible entry, or the like, the return must have these words, at

Saving to the party grieved such remedy, by attion or otherwise, for the goods so obtained, as he might have had by the common law. And two justices (i J^.) may call and convene, by process or otherwise, to the assize or sessions, any person suspected, and commit or bail him to the next assizes or sessions.

All persons obtaining goods, money, or merchandize, by false pretences, shall be deemed offenders against the law, and the public peace; and the court, before whom any such offender shall be tried, shall, on conviction, order them to be put in the pillory, or publickly whipped, or to be transported, as soon as conveniently may be, for seven years. — And if the party, charged as being the offender, shall be committed to prison, or admitted to bail, to answer the matters complained of at the next sessions or affixes, the justice shall bind over the prosecutor to appear and prosecute such offender with effcCl; and if such goods, so fraudulently obtained, appear to such justice to exceed the value of 20!. the recognizance shall be in not less than double the value of the goods.

A counsellor or attorney ought not to be chosen churchwarden ; and if he is, he may have a prohibition, by reason of his attendance on the courts at Wedminster.

Apothecaries, who have served seven years, shall be exempted from the office of churchwarden.

Freemen of the corporation of surgeons in London are exempted.

Alio dissenting teachers or preachers, in holy orders, or pretended holy orders.

All persons, who have prosecuted a felon toconviction, and the fird assignee of the certificate thereof, are exempted.

No private man, personally serving for himself in the militia, during the time of such service, shall be liable to serve as churchwarden.

A person chosen churchwarden, refusing to take his office, and oath, may be excommunicated for the refusal; and no prohibition will lie.

The rates mud be made with the content of the major part of the pariffiioners, housekeepers, or occupiers of land. — In order to which, public notice of a vedry ought to be given the Sunday before, either in the church after divine service is ended, or elfeat the church-door as the pariffiioners come out.

Those that pay no church rates, shall have no votain affairs relating to it, except it be the reftor or vicar.

It is most convenient, that every parish aft there be entered in the parish-books of accounts, and every man's hand consenting to it be set thereto; for then it will be a certain rule for the churchwardens to go by.

The rates for the repair of the church shall be laid upon every occupier of lands in the parish, altho* such occupier live in another parish.

If any person find himself aggrieved at the inequality of the assessment, his appeal mud be to the eccleiiadical judge.

If any refuse to pay the rates, being demanded by the churchwardens, they are to be sued for them in theecclefiadical courts.

A quaker, refusing to pay church rates, may be sued, as bther pariffiionerj* in the ecclesiastical court; or he maybe prosecuted before the justices of the peace, in the same manner as for his tithes.

The foil and freehold of the church is the parson's; the use of the body of the church, and the repair of it, common to the pariffiioners, and the disposing of the feats the right of the ordinary.

font frotn criminal proceedings, in some capital cases before secular judges; which was the true original of the benefit of clergy. But this claim of exemption grew so burden some, that it was from time to time qualified and abridged by the civil power; and therefore, if they were indicted in cases criminal, but not capital, nor wherein they were to lose life or limb, there the privilege of clergy was not allowed ; and therefore not in indictments of trespass or petit larceny. Also it was not allowed them in high treason.

If the statute enads generally, that it shall be felony with* out benefit of clergy, or that he shall suffer as in case of felony, without benefit of clergy, this excludes it in all circumstances, and to all intents.

When any person shall be convicted of any felony within the benefit of clergy, for which he shall be liable to be burned in the hand, the court may, if they think fit, instead thereof, impose upon the offender a moderate pecuniary fine ; or other-wile, instead of such burning, in any of the cases^ aforesaid, except man (laughter, may order the offender to be once, or oftner, but not more than thrice, either publicly or privately whipped, such private whipping to be in the presence of not less than two persons, besides the offender and officer who in-flids the same; and in case of female offenders, in the presence of females only. Provided, that this shall not extend to deprive the court of the power now vetted in them, of detaining such offender in prison for any time not exceeding one year, or of committing him to the house of correction or other public workhouse, to be kept to hard labour for any'time not less than six months, nor exceeding two years.

A person admitted to his clergy, forfeits all his goods that he hath at the time of the conviction. But presently, upon his burning in the hand, he ought to be rettored to the posses-fion of his lands, and from thenceforth to enjoy the profits thereof.

And it is holden, that after a man is admitted to his clergy, it is adionable to call him felon; because his offence being pardoned by the statute, all the infamy, and other confcquen-ces of it, are discharged.

The warden of the company of goldsmiths, with two of the court of assistants within the bills, and two justices elsewhere, may enter into the house, room, or work (hop of any person suspected, and, with the help of a constable, may break open any door, box, &c. to search for bullion suspected to be concealed ; and if found, they shall feizethe same, and the person in whose possession it shall be found: And the said wardens, assistants, and constables, shall carry him before the next justice, which one justice within the bills, and the said two justices elsewhere, may examine him ; and if he shall not prove, by the oath of himself, or of a credible witness, that it is lawful silver, and was not before melting current coin, nor clippings thereof, he shall be committed 5 and if on his trial he shall not prove the same by one witness, he shall be imprison-ed six months.

If any churchwarden oroverfeer of the poor, or person author i fed by him, shall make any payments to the poor in any bafeor counterfeit money, one justice, on complaint, may sum--fnon the offender, and, on proof of the offence, by the oath of one witness, may adjudge him to forfeit not less than 10s. nor more than 20s. to be levied by distress, and to be applied to the use of the poor.

Any person to whom any ftlver or gold money shall be tendered, that he shall suspect to be counterfeit, may cut, break, or deface such piece; and if it shall appear to be a counterfeit, the person tendering the same, shall bear the loss thereof; bot if the same shall appear to be lawful money, the person that cut, broke, or defaced the same, shall receive the same at the value it was coined for. And if any question arise, whether the piece so cut be counterfeit, it shall be determined by the next justice of the peace, or chief magistrate in a corporation w

Persons taken for coining false money, are not bailable by justices of the peace. But they must take the examinations and informations, and bind over the witnesses to the proper court, and commit the persons accused.

It is not necessary there should be two witnesses in cases of counterfeiting the coin, as it is in other high treasons ; but persons may be convicted by one witness only.

2 listy. 119. Cautions ref-pecting commitment.

PERSONS apprehended for offences which are not bailable, and also all persons who neglect to offer bail for offences, which are bailable, must be committed. Whercsoever a justice is impowered by any statute to bind a person over, or to cause him to do a-certain thing, and such person being in his presence, shall refuse to be bound, or to do such thing, the justice may commit him to the gaol, to remain there till he shall comply.

If a prisoner be brought before a justice, expressly charged with felony upon oath, the justice cannot discharge him, but must bail or commit him. But if he be charged with fafpi-cion only of felony, yet if there be no felony at all proved to be committed, or if thefaft charged as a felony be in truth no felony in point of law, the justice may discharge him. But if a man be killed by another, though it be by misadventure, or in self-defence, the justice ought not to discharge him, for he must undergo his trial for it; and therefore he must be committed, or at least bailed.

But commitment by the justices of the peace almost in all cases (except for the peace, good behaviour, felony, or higher offences), is but to retain the party till he hath made fine to the king; and therefore, if he offer to pay it, or find sureties by recognizance to pay it, he ought not to be committed, but to be delivered presently.

All felons shall be committed to the common goal, and not elsewhere.

But vagrants, and other criminals charged with small offences, may, for want of sureties,. be committed either to the common gaol, or house of correction, as the justices, in their judgment, shall think proper. And they may commit other offenders to the flocks, or other custody, by particular statntes.

By this act, a power is given to any justice or justices of the peace, within his or their respective jurisdictions, to commit either to the common gaol, or to any house of correction, within his or their respective jurisdictions, as to such justice or justices shall seem most proper, vagrants, and other criminals, offenders, and persons charged with or convicted of small offences, as by any law now in force, or hereafter to be made, he or they is or are, or shall be authorized to commit to the common gaol.

If a person is apprehended, upon a warrant indorsed, in another county, for an offence not bailable, or if he shall not there find bail, he shall be carried back into the first county, and be committed (or if bailable, bailed) by the justices in such first county.

The commitment must be in writing, either in the name of the king, and only attelled by the person who makes it, or it may be made by such person in his own name, expressing his office or authority, and must be directed to the goaler, or keeper of the prifoft.

Commitment.

69

It should contain the name and surname of the party com- *& If. 577. mitted, if known ; and, if not known, it may be sufficient to describe the person by his age, stature, complexion, colour of his hair, and the like, and to add that he rcfuleth to tell his

name.

It is safe, but not necessary, to let forth, that the party is charged upon oath.

It ought to contain the cause, as for treason, or felony, or suspicion thereof.

A warrant or mittimus to answer to such things as shall be objected against him, is utterly against law.

It ought to contain the certainty of the cau(e; if it be for felony, it ought to be for felony ; death of such

or for burglary in breaking the hou of such an

If it is for felony, it must be to detain him till he be thence delivered by law, or by order of law, or by due course of law.

A commitment grounded on aa act of parliament, ought to be conformable to the method prescribed by it. The difference is, where a man is committed as a criminal, and where only for contumacy; in the first case, the commitment mull be until discharged according tolaw; but in the latter, until he comply.

Where astatute appoints imprisonment, without limiting the time, the prisoner must remain at the discretion of the court.

It must be under seal; and without this, the commitment is unlawful.

But this must not be intended of a commitment by the sessions, or other court of record 5 for there the record itself, or the memorial thereof, which may at any time be entered of record, is a sufficient warrant, without any warrant under seal.

It should also set forth the place at which it is made, that it may appear to be within the jurisdiction of the justice.

It must also have a certain date, of the year and day.

Every person who shall be committed to the common or usual gaol, by any justice of the peace, the said person having means or ability thereunto, shall bear his own reasonable charges, and the charges also of such as shall be appointed to guard him to such gaol: and if any such person shall refuse to defray the said charges, then such justice shall, by writing on. oer his hand and seal, give warrant to the constable of the hundred, or cooftable of the township where such person shall be dwelling and inhabit, to fell such and so much of the goods and chattels of the said person so to be committed, as by the discretion of the said justice shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy and pay the charges of such his conveying and fending to the .aid gaol; the appraisement to be made by four of the honed inhabitants of the parish where such goods shall be ; the overplus to be delivered to the party.

of those who convey him, is committed to gaol, or to the house of correction, by warrant from ajudice, then on application, by the condable or other officer who conveyed him, to any justice for such county or place, such justice shall, upon oath, examine into and ascertain the reasonable expences, and shall, without fee, by his warrant, order the treasurer to pay the same. But in Middlesex, the same shall be paid by the over* leers of the poor of the parish where the person was apprehended.

By the habeas corpus a ft, the charges of conveying an offender is limited not to exceed 12d. a mile.

If the gaoler shall refuse to receive a felon, or take anything for receiving him, he shall be punished for the same, by the justices of gaol delivery.

But if a man be committed for felony, and the gaoler will not receive him, the constable mud bring him back to the town where he was takeo ; and that town shall be charged with the keeping of him, until the next gaol delivery.

The sheriff or gaoler shall certify the commitment to the next gaol delivery.

A person legally committed for a crime, certainly appearing to have been done by someone or other, cannot be lawfully discharged by any one but the king, till he be acquitted 00 his trial, or have an ignoramus found Dy the grand jury, or none to prosecute him, on a proclamation for that purpose by the justices of gaol delivery.

Common Prayer.

WHERE an incumbent resides upon his living, and keeps a curate, the incumbent himself (not having lawful impediment to be allowed by thebishop) shall at lead, once a month, openly and publicly read the common prayer, and (if there be occasion) administer the sacraments, and other rites of the church, on pain of 5I. to the poor, on conviction by confession, or oath of two witnedes, before two justices; and, in default of payment in ten days, the same to be levied by the churchwardens or overseers, by didrefs and sale, by warrant of such justices.

Confession.

IT seems that the confession of the defendant taken upon an examination before justices of the peace, or in difeourse with private person*, may be given in evidence against the party confcfling, but not againdothers.

Conspiracy.

Conspiracy.

BY the common law, all confederates whatsoever, wrong* fully to prejudice a third person, are highly criminal. And by statute, conspirators are they, that do confederate or bind themselves by oath, covenant, or other alliance, that every of them shall aid and bear the other falsly and maliciously to indict, or cause to indict, falsly to move or maintain pleas.

It is clear, that those who are convicted of conspiracy at the suit of the oarty, shall have judgment of fine and imprisonment, and to render the plaintiff his damages.

Constable.

IN some places, at this day, there is both a tythingman and constable, where the tythingman is, as it were, a deputy to execute the office in the constable's absence; but the constable may do whatever the tythingman may do, but not on the contrary, the tythingman not having an equal power with the constable.

The president, commons, and fellows of the faculty of physic in London, shall not be chosen constables.

Surgeons in London shall be freed and exempted from the office of constables.

Apothecaries in London, and within ftven miles thereof, being free of the company of apothecaries,'and also those in the country who have served a seven years apprenticeflup, shall be exempted from the office of constable.

A sworn attorney, or other officer of the courts at Westminster, may have a writ of privilege of his discharge.

Every teacher or preacher in holy orders, or pretended holy orders, in a congregation tolerated by law, shall, from the time of his subscription and taking the oaths, be exempted from the office of constable.

The prosecutor of a felon to con vision, or person to whom he (half affiign the certificate thereof, shall be discharged from the office of constable.

If any person, dissenting from the church of England, shall be chosen constable, and shall scruple to take upon him the office, in regard of the oaths, or any other matter required to be done in respect of such office, he may execute it by a sufficient deputy.

The jaw requires, that every constable be that

is, apt and fit for the execution of the said office ; and he is considered to be idoneus who hath, first, honesty to execute his office truly, without malice, afte&ion, or partiality. Second*

!y, knowledge to understand what he ought to do. Thirdly, ability, as well in substance or estate, as in body, that so he may intend and execute his office diligently, and not through impotency of body, or want, neglect his duty. And ifauy Hull be chosen constable, who is not thus qualified, he may by law be discharged of his said office, and another lit man be appointed in his place. In which case, a summons may be directed to several inhabitants of the parish to appear before the justice for him to make choice of one of them to take the oath, &c.

The petty constable ought to be chosen in the leet; and the high constable (properly so called) in the torn, which is the general leet of the whole hundred.

They are to be sworn and placed in their office by the lord or his steward,orby the lhcrift' respectively, as being judge of the court.

But now the usual manner is, that the high constables of hundreds be chosen either at the quarter sessions, or by the greater number of the ju dices of the division.

And every petty constable, being a principal peace officer, and it being necessary fur the preservation of the peace, that every vill should be furniftied with one; the justices of the peace have, ever tince the institution of their office, taken upon them, as conservators of the peace, not only to swear the petty constables, that have been chosen at a torn or leet, but also to nominate and swear those who have not been chosen at any such court, on the neglect of the ftieiuffs or lords to hold their court, or to take care that such officers are appointed in them. And this power of the justices of the peace having been confirmed by the uninterrupted usage of many ages, shall not now be disputed, but shall be presumed to be established upon sufficient authority.

Justices of the peace had power to nominate and swear constables, on the default of the torn or leet, before the statute of 13 & 14 C. 2,c. 12. If a constable shall die, or go out of the parish, any two justices may make and swear a new one, 'till the lord shall hold a leet, or 'till the next quarter sessions, who shall approve of the officer so made and sworn, or appoint another; and if any officer shall continue above a year in his office, the justices in their quarter sessions may discharge him, and put in another, 'till the lord shall hold a court*

If constables, lawfully chosen, refuse to be sworn, a just ice of the peace may bind them over to the assizes or sessions, there to be indicted.

High constables are to take the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, as other persons who qualify for offices; but petty constables are exempted.

Every high and petty constable is, by the common law, conserva for of the peace; and therefore, if any man shall make an affray or break the peace, the constable may commit

him

Constable.

him to the (locks or other fafecustody for the present, and afterwards may carry him before a justice or to gaol, an til he shall find surety for the peace.

But he cannot require surety of the peace, unless the offence be upon his own view; for he canoot take a man's oath, because he is not a judge of record.

The constable is a proper officer to a justice of the peace, and bound to execute his warrants, and therefore it hath been resolved, that where a statute authorizes a justice of the peace to convict a man of a crime, and to levy the penalty by warrant of distress, without saying to whom such warrant shall be directed, or by whom it shall be executed, the constable is the proper officer to serve such warrant, and indictable for difo-beying it.

No action shall be brought against any constable, or other person acting by his order, and in his aid, for any thing done in obedience to the warrant of a justice of the peace, until demand hath been made by the party, or his attorney, in writing, iigned by the party demanding the same, of the perusal and copy of such warrant, and the same hath been refused or neglected for six days after such demand; and if such action be brought jointly against the justice and constable, on proof of such warrant, the jury shall find for the constable ; and if the verdict be given against the justice, the plaintiff shall receive his costs against him, to be taxed in such manner by the proper officer, as to include such costs as the plaintiff is liable to pay to such defendant, for whom such verdict shall be found as aforesaid.

The constable ought not to return the warrant to the justice, but to keep it for his own justification ; but he mult certify to the justice what he hath done in the execution thereof.

The constable executing a justice's warrant, for levying a penalty, or other sum of money directed by an act of parliament, by distress, may deduct his own reasonable charges of taking, keeping, and felling the goods distrained; returning the overplus on demand, after such penalty or sum of money and charges are deducted. See.

Every constable, or other such officer, shall, every three months, and within fourteen days after he shall go out of his office, deliver to the overseers a just account in writing, fairly entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and signed by him, of all sums by him expended on account of the faiaparish, township, or place, in all cases not hitherto provided for by law, and also of all sums received by him on the account of the said parish, township, or place; and the overseers shall, - with* in the next fourteen days after the account shall be so delivered, lay the same before the inhabitants, and, if approved by the majority of them, the overseers shall pay out of the poor rate such sum as shall appear to be doe on the said account: But if the account, or any part thereof, shall be disallowed,

Provided, that if the overseer shall find that the pariQi, township, or place is aggrieved by any thing done or omitted byt the said constable, or other officer, or by the justice, he may, giving reasonable notice to the said justice, constable, or other officer, appeal to the next general or quarter sessions.

Justice* cate with respect to , convictions.

WHERE a special power is given to a justice of the peace by act of parliament, to coovid an offender in a sum* mary manner, without a trial by jury, it must appear that he hath strictly pursued that power; otherwise the common law will break in upon him, and level all his proceedings. There* fore he must proceed according to the course of common law ia trials by juries, and consider himself only as constituted in the place both of judge and jury. There must be an information or charge against a person ; then he must be summoned, or have notice of such charge, and have an opportunity to make such defence; and the evidence against him must be such as the common law approves, unless the statute specially dirodeth otherwise then, if the person be found guilty, there must be

be a conviction, judgment, and execution, all according to the course of the common Taw, directed and influenced by the special authority given by statute; and, in the conclusion, there must be a record of the whole proceeding, wherein the justice must set forth the particular manner and circumstances; so that, if he shall be called to account by any superior court, it may appear that he hath conformed to the law, and not ex* ceeded the bounds prescribed to his jurisdiction.

Coroner.

CORONERS are ancient officers by the common law, so called because they deal principally with the pleas of the crown, and were of old time the principal conservators of the peace.

In ancient times, this office was of great estimation; for none could have it under the degree of a knight.

The coroner shall be chosen in the county court, by the commons of the same county.

And none but freeholders have a voice at such elettion. When any person comes to an unnatural death, the town-ship shall give notice thereof to the coroner. Otherwise if the body be interred before he come, the township shall be amerced.

When notice is given to the coroner, he is to issue a precept to the constables of the four, five, or fix next townships, to return'a competent number of good and lawful men of their townships, to appear before him in such a place, and to make an inquisition touching the matter. Or he may fend his pre. cept to the constable of the hundred.

These are to be at least twelve.

bat the justices of the peace shall esquire thereof.

For every inquisition (not taken upon view of a body dy- ing in gaol), he shall have 20s. and also for every mile he shall be compelled to travel from his usual place of abode to A take such inquisition; to be paid by order of the justices in iefiions, out of the county rates. And for every inquisition taken on view of a body dying in prison, he shall be paid so much, not exceeding 20s. as the justices in sessions shall allow, to be paid in like manner.

WHERE any complaint shall be made before a justice, 18 3.*. 19.

and a warrant or summons shall issue in consequence Just'*e to de-thereof, it shall be lawful for such justice, who shall have heard tcrnM0€ coAj* and determined the matter of the complaint, to award such costs to be paid by either party, and in such manner and form as to him shall seem meet, to the party injured: and if the person so ordered by the justice shall not forthwith pay, or give security for the same, to the satisfaction of the justice, it shall be levied by distrefsf: and if goods and chattels of such person cannot be found, the justice shall commit him to the house of correction for the place where such person shall reside, to be kept to hard labour not exceeding one month, nor less than ten days, or until such sum, together with the expences attending the commitment, be first paid. Provided, that where the penalty shall amount to or exceed the sum of 5I. the said cefts shall be deducted by the justice, according to his direction, out of the penalty, so that the said deduction shall not exceed one fifth part of the penalty. And the justices in sessions, from time to time, may lay down or alter such rules and regulations concerning costs or charges to be allowed to any Regulated «c person by virtue of this act, as to them shall seem justj which (tffioa*. rules and regulations, having received the approbation and fig-nature of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding, apd not otherwise, on all persons whatsoever.

A DISTRESS is the taking of a personal chattel out of the possession of the wrong doer, into the custody of the party injured, to procure a satisfaction for wrong committed.

Distress for rent mull be, for rent in arrear. It must not be after tender of payment.

If any distress and Tale shall be made, for rent in arrear and due, when none is in truth due, the owner shall recover double value, with full costs.

If any tenant shall fraudulently convey off the premises his goods or chattels, to prevent the landlord from distraining, such landlord, or any person by him lawfully impowered, may, in thirty days next after such conveying away, seize the same wherever they shall be found, and dispose of them in such manner, as if they had been distrained on the premises. And every person To offending, shall forfeit to the landlord double the value of such goods, to be recovered in any court of record at West min fter. But if the goods shall not exceed the value of $ol. the landlord or his agent may exhibit a complaint in writing before two justices of the peace of the same county or division, redding near the place where such goods and chattels were removed, or near the place where the same were found, not being interested in the lands or tenements whence such goods were removed ; who may summon the parties concerned, examine the fatt, and all proper witnesses upon oath, and, in a summary way, determine whether such person or persons be guilty of the offence, with which he or they are charged, and to enquire in like manner of the value of such goods and chattels; and, upon full proof of the offence, by order under their hands and Teals, the Taid justices shall adjudge the offender or offenders to pay double the value of the said goods and chattels 5 and if the offender or offenders, having notice of such order, shall refuse or neglect so to do, they shall, by their warrant, levy the same by distress; and, for want of such distress, may commit the offender or offenders

to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour, without bail or mainprize, for the space of six months, unless the money so ordered to be paid as aforesaid, shall be sooner satisfied. Persons aggrieved by order of such justices, may appeal to the next general or quarter-sessions.

If a man break the pound, or the lock of it, or part of it, he greatly offendeth against the peace, and therefore hue and cry is to be levied against him, and the party who distrained may take the goods again, wherel'oever he shall find them, and impound them again.

If any tenant at rack rent, or where the rent referred shall be full three-fourths of the yearly value of the demised premises, who shall be in arrear for one year's rent, shall desert the premises, two justices (having no ioterest in the premises) may, at the request of the landlord, go upon and view the same, and affix on the moll notorious part of the premises, notice in writing, what day (at the distance of fourteen days at the lead) they will return to take a second view; and if on such second view, the tenant shall not appear and pay the rent, or there shall not be sufficient distress on the premises, then the justices may put the landlord into possession, and the lease as to such demile shall from thence be void. But the tenant may appeal to the next justice or justices of assize; who may award costs to either party. And the justices in this, and all other the like cases, ought to make a record of the whole proceedings, to be produced afterwards in case of an action brought against the landlord by such tenant.

In all cases where any justice of the peace is or shall be required or impowered by any act of parliament, to issue a warrant of distress, for the levying of any penalty infiifted, or any sum of money directed to be paid by such act, it shall be lawful for the justice granting such warrant, therein to order and direct the goods and chattels so to be distrained, to be sold and disposed of within a certain time to be limited in such warrant, notlefs than four days, nor more than eight days, unless the penalty or sum of money for which such distress shall be made, together with the reasonable charges of taking and keeping such distress, be sooner paid. And the officer may dednft all reasonable charges out of the money arising by such sale; and the overplus (S any) shall be returned on demand to the owner of the goods so distrained.

Estreat.

ESTREAT (txtrafium) is nfed for the true copy or note of

some original writing or record, and especially of fines and amerciaments, imposed in the rolls of a court, to be levied by the bailiff or other officer.

In levying, the sheriff shall shew the estreats under the seal of the exchequer, to the party indebted, on pain of treble damages to the party, and fine to the king, on conviction before the j offices of the peace, or other justices.

And the sheriff shall make no estreats to levy his own amerciaments, till two justices (1 QJ to be named at Michaelmas sessions by the custot rotxlerum, or, in his absence, by the eldest in the commission, have inspected his books; and the said estreats shall be indented betwixt the said justices and sheriff, iealed with their seals, the one part to remain with the justices, and the other with the sheriff: and the persons who shall gather the said amerciaments, shall be sworn by the said justices, that they shall take no more than is forfeited* and contained in the said estreats.

Evidence.

BEFORE a justice of the peace, in divers cases, one witness is sufficient to convict an offender, the same being directed by special ffatotes.

But in case of high treason, no person shall be attainted, but upon the oaths of two witnesses.

Devries of lands shall be attested by three witntfies at the least.

The confession of the defendant, whether taken on an examination before justices of the peace, or in difeourse with private persons, hath always been allowed to.be given in evidence again!! the party confessing, bat not against others.

An

Evidence

Aq attainder, judgment, or conviction of treason, felony, perjury, or forgery on 5 EL and also judgment tp (land on the pillory, or to be whipped or branded, are good causes of exception against a witness, while they continue in force.

The compulsory means to bring in witnesses are of two kinds. 1. By process offubparna, issued in the king's name, by the justices, or others, where the trial is to be. 2. (which is the more ordinary and more effectual means in criminal cases) the justices that take the examination of the person accused, and the information of the witnesses, may, at that time, or at any time after, and before the trial, bind over the witnesses to appear at thefessions; and in case o f their refusal, either to come, or to be bound over, may commit them for their contempt in such refusal.

When any poor person shall appear on recognizance in any court to give evidence, the court may order the treasurer to pay him such sum as they shall think reasonable, except in Middlesex, where the same shall be paid by the overseers of the poor where the person was apprehended.

The justices m fefTtons, from time to time, may lay down or alter such rules and regulations concerning any cods or charges to be allowed to any person by virtue of this act, as to them shall Teem joft; which rules and regulations, having received'the approbation and signature of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding on all persons whatsoever.

If any person, upon whom a process out of any of the courts of record shall be served, to testify or depose concerning any matter depending therein, and having tendered unto him a reasonable sum for his cods and charges, do not appear according to the tenor of the process, having not a lawful and reasonable impediment, he shall forfeit 10I. and shall yield such further recompence to the party aggrieved, as to the judge of the court shall seem meet.

In criminal cases, if a witness hath been bound over, and do not appear, he shall forfeit his recognizance.

He who affirms the matter in issue, whether plaintiff or defendant, ought to begin to give evidence.

The evidence both for ana against a prisoner, ought to be upon oath.

But a quaker's affirmation, in all cases not being criminal, shall be allowed as evidence, without an oath ; but in criminal cases, his affirmation shall not be allowed.

It is no satisfaction for a witness to say, that he thinks or persuades himself; the judge ought to have more ground than thinking.

The court may indulge a prisoner in examining the witnesses apart, but he cannot demand it of right.

In cases of life, no evidence is 10 be given against a prisoner, but in his presence.

Examination.

IF a felony is committed, and one is brought before a just ice upon suspicion thereof, and the justice finds, upon examination, that the prisoner is not guilty, yet the justice shall not discharge him, but he mult either be bailed or committed ; for it is not fit that a man once arrested and charged with felony, orfufpicion thereof, should be delivered, upon any man's discretion, without farther trial.

In order to which bail or commitment, the examination and information of the parties mult first be taken, according to the following statutes:

Two or more justices (1 Q.) or one of the said justices, before they bail a person apprehended for felony (if the offence is bailable) shall take his examination, and the information of them that bring him, of the fa& and circumstances thereof, and the same, or as much thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, shall put in writing ; which examination they shall certify (together with the bailment) at the next general gaol delivery, to be holden within the limits of their commission. — -» And they shall have power to bind by recognizance all such as do declare any thing material to prove the_offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery; and shall certify such recognizance in like manner. And if they offend in any thing herein, they shall be fined by the justices of gaol delivery.

Where the person is not bailed, but committed, the justice or justices who commit him, shall, before such commitment, take the like examination and information, and shall pot the same in writing within two days after the said examination, and shall in like manner bind over the witnesses, and certify the whole as above.

If, on some reasonable hindrance, the justice cannot, at the return of the warrant, take the examination, he may, by word of mouth, command the constable, or any other person, to detain

The examination of the person accused ought not to be upon oath.

But if, upon his examination, he shall confess the matter, it shall not be amiss that he subscribe his name or mark to it.

Excise and Customs.

ALL officers, who shall have any employment in or about the customs, shall, at their admission, if it is within the ports of London, take an oath of office before two of; and elsewhere, before two justices of the peace : and every person not taking such oath, shall forfeit his office. And the persons authorised to administer the oath, shall certify the taking thereof to the next sessions.

If any carman, porter, waterman, or other person, shall affi# in the taking up, landing, shipping off, or carrying away any goods without a warrant and presence of au officer of the customs, such person being apprehended by the warrant of any justice of the peace, and the same being proved by the oath of two witnesses, the said offender, for the first offence, shall, by the justice, be committed to gaol, until he be discharged by the lord treasurer, chancellor, under-treasurer, or barons of the exchequer; and, for the second offence, he may, by any justice of the peace as aforesaid, be committed to the next gaol, there to remain for two months without bail, or until he shall pay to the sheriff 5I. for the king's use, or until he shall be discharged by the court of exchequer, as aforesaid. The statute of8 G. r. 18, brings the recognizance not only of the said forfeiture, but also of several others hereafter following, under the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace. All seizures may, in a summary wiy, be determined by two justices of the peace refidingnear the place where the seizure is made;

' who shall summon the party accused, and, on appearance or default, proceed to hear and give judgment, and issue warrants for sale of such as shall be by them condemned ; whose judgment shall not be liable to any appeal or certiorari.

In trials of seizures, the justices shall proceed to the merits of the cause, without enquiring into the form or manner of seizure.

The justices of the peace are bound by their oatk of office, to take nothing for their office of judice of the peace to be done, bnt of the king, and fees accudomed, and costs limit* ed by datute.

And generally, no public officer shall take any other fees or rewards, for doing any thing relating to his office, than some datute in force gives him, or than hath been anciently and aecudomably taken ; and if he do otherwise, he is guilty of extortion. The fees in sessions, for t raver ling, trying, or discharging indictments, discharging recognizances, and the like, do vary according to the different customs in different places.

The course and whole procedure of trying an offender, is treated of under the title SeJ/iom,

Concerning Gamekeepers.

ALL lords of manors, or other royalties, not tmder the degree of an esquire, may, by writing under their hands and seals, authorize one or more game-keeper or game-keepers, within their respective manors or royalties ; and may impower him thereby, upon their o ymmanors, to kill hare, pheasant, partridge, or any other game.

NO

Game.

No lord of a manor shall make any person to be a game* keeper with power to kill game, unless such person be qua-lified by the laws of the realm so to do ; or unless such person be truly and properly a servant to the said lord.

The game-keeper (so authorized) may search dogs and engines, and seize the same for the use of the lord, or destroy them.

But it hath been adjudged, that an authority from the lord of the manor is not of itself sufficient for this purpose, but that he ought to hare a warrant from a justice of the peace, after information and oath of the o/Fence first made.

Every person, not having lands and tenements, or iome other ellate of inheritance, in his own or his wife's right of the clear yearly value of iool. per annum*, or for term of life, or nor having lease or leases of 99 years, or for any longer term, of the clear yearly value of 1501.

If any person, not qualified by the laws of this realm so to do, shall keep or use any greyhounds or setting dogs, or any engines, to kill and destroy game, and shall be thereoff convicted on the oath of one credible witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit cl. half to the informer, and half to the poor of the parish where the offence was committed, to be levied by distress and sale of the offender's goods; for want of distress, he shall be sent to the house of correction for three months for the first offence, and for every other offence four months. — And any justice, and lord within his manor, may take away such dogs, nets, or other engines, which shall be in the power or custody of any person not qualified.

The constable, authorized by a juRice's warrant, shall enter into and search the houses, outhouses, or other places belonging to such houses of suspeCled persons not qualified. And if any hare, partridge, or other game, shall be found, the offender shall be carried before a just ice; and if such person do not, in some convenient time, to be set by the justice, produce the party of whom he bought the same, or some other credible person, to depose upon oath such sale thereof, he shall be convicted by the said justice of such offences, and, upon such conviction, shall forfeit, for every hare, partridge, or other 'game, any sum not under 5s. and not exceeding 20s. half to

The act 24 G. 3. Sejf. 2. c.43, being repealed, it was enacted, by 25 G. 3. c. 50, that from and after July 1,1785, every person delivering into the office of the clerk of the peace, or his deputy, for the county where he shall reside, an account of his name and place of abode, shall be annually entitled to a certificate thereon, paying two guineas for the same; and every deputation of a game-keeper shall be registered with the clerk of the peace, and a certificate shall annually be taken out, chargeable with a stamp of 10s. 6d. Every person, reading in cities and towns that are counties of themselves, and have no clerks of the peace, may apply to the office of the clerk of the peace of any county, riding, or place adjoining to such city or town, for the purpose of receiving such certificate.

Correct lifts of certificates are' annually to oe transmitted to the /lamp-office by the several clerks of the peace, under a penalty of 20I. which lifts may be inspected by any person on paying is. and no more; and those lifts shall once or more in a year be inserted by the Commissioners of stamp-duties in the newspapers of each county, or such other public newspaper as they shall think proper.

Any person, who, after July 1, 1785, shall shoot at or kill any game, without a certificate as is above-mentioned, shall forfeit 20I.

Any person having obtained such certificate, and producing it, may require the certificate of any person using any dog, Whomey d«-gun, or net, for destroying game, to be produced ; and the per- mind |C*

The times of killing game are limited as by former acts, *5 <7.3* 50.

notwithstanding such certificates; nor shall this act give to Cer.t-fc*t*s* 00 any person any right to take or destroy game, unless such per- *ua ,fic*uon son shall be duly qualified so to do, by the laws now in being; but he shall be liable to the same penalties in any of the said laws, as if this act had not been made.

Game*keepets are not allowed, by any certificate, to kill l4 V Ief* ' game out of the limits of the manor, for which the deputation cwue-keeper was given; and in case of any new appointment of a game- limited. P keeper. Sec.duly registered, the former certificate shall be null and void; and the person acting under the former one shall be liable to the penalties of this act.

Penalties for offences against this act may be faed for and recovered in any of his Majesty's courts by action of debt, bill. Penalties, whets plaint, or information. recovered.

Any justice of the county, where the penalty doth not ex- id.] ceed 20I. may summon the parties before him, and bear and determine the matter in a summary way, and, by the oath of Just»<e*»eoa-one or more credible witness or witnesses, may give judgment, and levy the penalties by distress, to be sold, if not redeemed within six days, and the overplus, if any, to be rendered to the owner; or, in default of distress, the offender may be committed for six months (in another part of the ad, three , or

till the penalties shall be paid. Perfiras summoned as witnef-ies, and not appearing at the time and place appointed, shall forfeit 10I. to be levied by distress, as above, if not paid*

Homicide.

HOMICIDE in law Signifies the killing of a man by a man.

Manflaudirer.

O *

BY manslaughter is to be understood such killing of a man as happens either on a sudden quarrel, or in the commission of an unlawful ad, without any deliberate intention of doing any mischief at all.

There is this difference between murder and manslaughter; viz. that murder is upon malice forethought, and man* daughter upon a sudden occasion.

This offence is not bailable by the ju dices of the peace.

Murder is, when a man of found memory, and of the age of discretion, unlawfully killeth any person under the king's peace, with malice forethought, either expressed by the party, or implied by law ; so as the party wounded or hurt die of the wound or hurt, within a year and a day.

The law so far abhors all duelling in cold blood, that not only the principal who actually kills the other, but also his seconds, are guilty of murder, whether they fought or not. And it is holden, that the seconds of the party flam are like-wife guilty as accessaries.

They that are present when any man is (lain, and do not their best endeavour to apprehend the murderer or man flayer, shall be fined and imprisoned.

Where any person shall be feloniously stricken orpoifoned in one county, and die in another county, the offender may be indicted in the county where the party dies, before the coroner, justices of the peace, or other justices.

By the rubrick in the book of common prayer, before the burial office, a person who hath laid violent hands upon himself, shall not have that office used at his interment.

N. JB. No distinction Seems to be here made as to the date of mind in which the party put an end to his life; the prohibition in the rubrick, with respect to the borial service, is absolute.

House of Correction.

BT the 7 y. c. 4, it was enacted, that before Michaelmas 1611, there should be built or provided within every county, one or more fit and convenient houses of correction; which houses were to be purchased, conveyed, or allured unto such persons, as by the justices in sessions should be directed, upon trull, that the same should be employed for the keeping, correcting, and letting to work rogues, vagabonds, or iturdy beggar*, and other idle and disorderly persons.

On presentment of the grand jury, that there is no house of correction, and that it will beneceflary to provide one or more; or that the houses of correction already provided are not sufficient or convenient, or want to be enlarged, the justices in sessions shall have power to build, or enlarge, one or more fit houses of correction, or to buy or hire such houses for that purpose, with convenient outlets thereto adjoining, as on examination of able and sufficient workmen, or others, Hull appear to be necessary for that purpose: And if houses or lands are to be purchased, they shall be conveyed to such persons as the said justices in sessions shall direct, in trust, and for the uses and purposes aforesaid. And the justices in sessions shall appoint, at their will and pleasure, fit persons to be governors or mailers of such houses so to be provided$ and shall appoint such sums yearly as they shall think meet, to be paid quarterly before-hand by the treasurer, the said mailer or governor giving sufficient security for the continuance and performance of the said service; which sums shall be paid oat of the general county, rate.

And the justices in sessions shall take care that the houses of correction (except those erected or maintained by particular founders) shall be duly fitted up, and supplied with imple merits, materials, and furniture, for keeping, relieving, employing, and correcting all idle and disorderly persons, rogues, vagabonds, incorrigible rogues, and others, who shall be sent to, confined, or continued in the same ; and shall make such orders and regulations as they shall think fit, for the better governing and regulating the said houses, and for employing, relieving, and punishing the persons therein, or for fending them to or from thence; which orders shall not be removed by any certiorari.

And whereas doubts may arise, where authority is given to any justice or justices, to commit offenders to the house of correction, for offences cognizable before them out of sessions, how long offenders may be there detained, and in what manner treated, where the time and manner of their punishment is not by law expressly limited; it is enabled, that where any offenders shall be committed as aforesaid, by virtue of any law in being or to be made, and the time and manner of their pu-niftiment is not expressly limited, the said justice or justices shall commit such offenders to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour until the next general or quarter-fef-lions, or until discharged by due course of law: And two justices (of which the justice who committed him shall be one) may discharge the said offender before the sessions, if they fee cause ; and if he shall not be so discharged, the said sessions may either discharge him, or continue him further, not exceeding three months.

And where any person liable by law to be committed to the house of correction, shall be apprehended within any liberty, city, or town corporate, whose inhabitants are contributors to the house of correction of the county, the justices of such liberty may commit such person to the house of correction of the county.

If the master shall not, at every quarter-sessions, yield a true account of all such persons as have been committed to his custody; or if any person committed to his custody, shall be troublesome to the country, by going abroad; or otherwise shall escape away from the house of correction, before he shall be from thence lawfully delivered, then the said justices shall set such fines and penalties upon the said master or governor, as they shall think fit; and all fines and penalties shall be paid to the treasurer, and accounted for by him.

Two justices within the respective hundreds, divisions, or jurisdictions, where there shall be any house of correction, or any two justices appointed by the sessions, shall visit the same twice a year, or oftener, if need be, and report the state thereof to the next sessions. And if the governors thereof shall not set or keep the said idle and disorderly persons, rogues, vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues, to hard labour, and punish and correct them according to the directions of their warrants of commitment, or shall otherwise misbehave themselves, the said justices in sessions shall fine them ; the fines to be paid to the treasurer, and accounted for by him as part of the county flock.

it shall and may be lawful to and for any just ice of the peace to commit such offender to the common gaol, for any space not exceeding six calendar months, nor less than one calendar month; every such penalty and forfeiture shall be paid to the treasurer of the county.

By this act, justices who have not, in pursuance of the former act of 22 G. 3. c. 6j., examined the state of the houses of correction, may enforce the said act at the next or any subse-quest quarter-fe (lions: And when the expences of building, rebuilding, or enlarging such houses shall exceed one half of the annual county rate (on an average of the lad five years), the justices in their (eflions may borrow, on the credit of the county rate, any sums, not less than 50I. nor more than tool, each, by way of mortgage.

The whole conduct of this matter, relative to the borrowing and repayment of money, and also the purchase of lands. is on the same footing with the act respecting the gaols (except the clause which forbids any justice being concerned in any contract for rebuilding, &c.) to which the reader may very conveniently be referred.

Any justice or justices of the peace authorized to convict any person or persons in a summary way, without a jury, may, after the passing of this act, or if he or they shall think fit, commit persons so convicted to the house of correction, in Head of the common gaol.

Hue and Cry.

FOR levying hue and cry, although it is a good course to have the warrant of a justice of the peace, when time will permit, in order to prevent causeless hue and cry ; yet, by the frame of the statnees, it is by no means necessary, nor is it always convenient; for the felon may escape before the warrant be obtained, and hue and cry was part of the law, before justices of the peace were first instituted.

And they which levy not hue and cry, or pursue not upon hue and cry, may be indicted, fined, and imprisoned.

WRITS of execution, which shall be sued out against the inhabitants of any hundred, on any judgment obtained by virtue of any act of parliament, shall, by the sheriff on receipt thereof, be produced to two justices (1 ^.) in or near the hundred; the same being first proved on oath before the said justices; and the attorney's bill taxed.

Indemnity Act.

THIS aft is to indemnify such persons as have omitted to qualify themselves for offices and employments; and to indemnify justices of the peace, or others, who have omitted to register or deliver in their qualifications within the time limited by law, and for giving further time for those purposes; and to indemnify members and officers, in cities, corporations, and borough towns, whose admissions have been omitted to be stamped according to law, or, having been stamped, have been loll or mislaid, and to allow them time to provide admissions duly stamped; to give further time to such persons as have omitted to make and file affidavits of the execution of indentures of clerks to attornies and (olicitors; and to indemnify deputy lieutenants and officers of the militia, who have ne-glefted to transmit descriptions of their qualifications to the clerks of the peace, within the time limited by law; and to give further time for that purpose.

All such persons as have omitted to qualify themselves agreeably to .sundry acts, before the passing of this act; and who shall, on or before December 25, 1790, qualify themselves, shall be indemnified against all forfeitures, incurred, or to be incurred, for or by reason of any such neglect or ad-mi ffion.

But this act is not to indemnify any person, against whom final judgment shall have been given, for any penalty incurred by having neglected to qualify himself within the time limited by law; nor to exempt justices acting without legal qualification.

Persons producing appointments and admissions before December 25, 1790, shall be confirmed, and qualified to act as

This act is not to extend to rellore persons to any office avoided by judgment, and legally filled up and enjoyed by other persons.

Persons, who shall cause affidavits to be filed before Michaelmas term, 1790, are indemnified and discharged from penalties.

By 26 G. 3, e, 107, every deputy lieutenant, and every officer then holding a commission as colonel, lieutenant colonel, I major, or captain in the militia, and not having transmitted a specific description of his qualification for holding such commission to the clerk of the peace, was required, within six months after the id day of July 1786, to transmit such description to the clerk of the peace, on pain of being rendered incapable of acting as a deputy lieutenant, or of serving as an officer in the militia again, in case he should omit so to do; but whereas divers persons have, through ignorance of the law, absence, or some unavoidable accident, neglected to 1 transmit such description of their qualification as aforesaid, within the time limited by the said act, all such deputy lieutenants and officers, who shall, on or before the 1 ill day of ( September, 1790, deliver in their qualifications, in the manner directed by the said act, are hereby indemnified from and against all penalties, forfeitures, incapacities, and disabilities, incurred by reason of such omission or neglect.

Persons prosecuted, and hereby meant to be indemnified, r may plead the general issue.

Indictment.

THERE can be no doubt, but that all capital crimes whatsoever, and also all kinds of inferior crimes of a public nature, as misprisions, contempts, disturbances of the peace, oppressions, and all other misdemeanors whatsoever of a public evil example against the common law, may be indicted ; But no injuries of a private nature, unless they some way concern the king.

BY an infant or minor, is meant any one who is under.the age of twenty.one years.

An infant may be guilty of forcible entry, in respect of personal actual violence.

And the justices may fine him, therefore: But yet it shall be good discretion in the justices of the peace, to forbear the imprisonment of such infant.

No age is limited for the binding of parish apprentices; but it feemcth they may be bound after the age of seven, when they cease to be nurse.children, and consequently may be taken from the mother. — See Apprentice.

Information.

INFORMATIONS are of two kinds; 1. Such as are merely at the suit of the king ; and, 2. Such as are partly at the suit of the king, and partly at the suit of the party \ — which are commonly called informations , from those

words in the information when the proceedings were in Latin, qui tarn pro domino rege quam pro feipfo* Cfr.

All offences against any penal statute, for which any common informer may ground a popular action, bill, plaint, suit, or information, before the judges of assize, or justices of the peace in their general or quarter-sessions (having powerto hear and determine the same), shall be prosecuted in the county where they were committed, and not elsewhere; and if the offence is not proved' to have been committed in the same county, the defendant shall be found not guilty.

No informer shall compound or agree with the defendant, but after answer made in court; nor after answer, but by the order or consent of the court; on pain of being set on the pillory, in some market town next adjoining, in open market, for two hours, and of being disabled to be informer on any penal ftktute, and also of forfeiting 10I. half to the king, and half to the party grieved, to be recovered in any court of record, by action of debt or information. And the justices of assize, and the justices of the peace in sections, may hear and determine all offences against this act.

Judgment.

BY many Gatutes, peculiar punishments are appointed for several offences, as pillory, Gocks, imprisonraent, and the like; and in all these cases, no room is left for the justices' discretion, for they ought to give judgment, and to inffift the pani(hroent in all the circumGaaces thereof, as fitch fU-tutes do direct.

Jurors.

THE juGices, at Midsummer sessions, shall issue forth their warrants, under the hands and seals of two or more of them, to the high conGables, requiring them to issue forth their precept to the petty conGables, thereby directing and requiring them to make and return true HGs in writing, of the names and places of abode of all persons, within their respective con-

Gablewicks,

Jurors*

ft able wicks, with their titles and additions, between the ages of 21 and 70, qualified to serve on juries, by having, in their own name, or in trust for them, within the same county where the issue is to be tried, ten pounds by the year at least, above reprizes, of freehold or copyhold lands, and tenements of ancient demesne, or in rents, in fee iimple, fee tail, or for the life of themselves or some other person ; or, having in poflef-Jion, in their own right, a leasehold estate of 20I. per annum, for 99 years or more.

The high-constable failing to issue this precept, shall forfeit 1 oh on conviction at the assizes or sessions.

And if any petty constable shall wilfully omit any person who ought to be inserted, or insert any one who ought to be omitted, or shall take any reward for omitting or inserting any person, he shall forfeit 203. on copviClion before one justice, on confession, or oath of one witness; half to the informer, and half to the poor of the parish or place for which the lift is returned; if not paid in five days, to be levied by distress.-^-And such justice shall, in writing under his hand, certify the same to the n#xt sessions; who shall direct the clerk of thd peace to insert or (trike out the name of such person so ih-ferted or omitted wrongfully.

The petty con (tables, at Michaelmas sessions, shall deli vet in the lifts in open court.

Or, instead of this, after they have com pleated their lifts, it shall be sufficient if they subscribe the same in the presence of one justice, and at the same time attest the truth thereof upon oath to the belt of their knowledge or belief: and theri the said lifts, being first signed by the justice, and subscribed as aforesaid, shall be delivered by the said petty con (tables to the high con (tables, who shall deliver in the same at the said sessions, in open court, attesting at the same time, upon oath, the receipt of such lifts from the petty constables, and that no alteration hath been made therein (ince their receipt thereof.

The constable failing to make return, shall forfeit 5I. to the king, to be recovered by bill, plaint, or information.

And if any person, not qualified, shall find his name mentioned in such lift, and the person required to make such lift, shall refuse to omit him, or think it doubtful whether he ought to be omitted, the justices, at the sessions to which the lifts shall be returned, on satisfaction from the oath of th party complaining, or other proof that he is not qualified, may order his name to be (truck out, or omitted to be entered in the book.

It seems that justices of the peace may not order a jury to be returned immediately, nor on the same day, for the trial of a prisoner arraigned before them, as justices of gaol delivery may, unless the crime amount to felony, or the party consent to be tried immediately.

And although the words of the writ be twelve, yet, by the ancient course, the sheriff mull return for the ex-

pedition of justice; for, if twelve only should be returned, there would seldom a full jury appear; and, in this case, usage and custom makes the law.

fiefides the challenges which may be taken by the plaintiff or defendant, it is enabled, that in cases where the king is party, the justices of assize, or of the peace in sessions, may reform the panels of jurors, by putting to and taking out the names of the persons impanelled by their discretion ; and if the sheriff do not return the panel so reformed, he shall forfeit 20I. half to the king, and half to him that shall sue.

By the law of England, a jury, after their evidence given upon the issue, ought to be kept together in some convenient place, without meat or drink, fire, or candle, and without speech with any, unless it be the bailiff, and with him only if they be agreed.

But, with the assent of the justices, they may both eat and drink; and if they cannot agree, the justices may, in such case* suffer the jury to have both meat and drink for a time, to fee whether they will agree. But if the case so happen, that the jury can in no wife agree, the justices (as it seemeth), in such case, may take such order in the matter, as shall seem to them, by their discretion, to (land with reason and conscience, by awarding a new inquelt, or otherwise, as they shall think belt.

If a man assault or threaten a juror, for giving a verdict against him, he is highly punishable by fine and imprisonment 5 and if he strikes him in the court, in the presence of the judge of assize, he shall lose his hand, and his goods, and profits of his lands during life, and suffer perpetual imprisonment.

In causes of nififrius, every person whose name shall be drawn, and who shall not appear, after being openly called three times, shall, on oath made of his having been lawfully summoned, forfeit not exceeding 5}. nor less than 40s. unless some reasonable cause of absence be proved, by oath or affidavit, to the satisfaction of the judge.

If the grand jury, at the assizes or sessions, will not find a bill, the court may impanel another inquest to esquire of their concealments, and thereupon set fines upon them.

If a jury give a verdict against all reason, convicting or ac- a 309, quitting a person indicted of felony, what shall be done? If llo\ . the jury convict a man, against or without evidence, and against the direction of the court, the court may reprieve him before judgment, and acquaint the king, and certify for his pardon: If the jury acquit him in like manner, the court may fend them back again (and so in the former case) to consider better of it, before they record the verdict; but if they are Must be re-peremptory in it, and (land to their verdict, the court must corded, fake their verdict and record it.

Justices of the Peace

ARE judges of record, appointed by the king, tobejuf- c, s.

In ancient times, such officers or ministers as were institut- % Ufi. 558. ed, either for preservation of the peace of the county, or for execution of justice, were, by force of the king's writ in every How formerly several county, chosen in full or open court by the freeholders chosen. of that county.

Besides these conserva tors of the peace properly so called, 33.

there were and are other conservators of the peace by virtue of certain offices, viz. (1.) The lord chancellor, and every justice of the king's bench, throughout all the realm. (2.) Every court of record within its own precinct. (3.) Every justice of the peace. (4.) Every sheriff. (5.) Every coroner. And (6.) every high and petty constable.

There were also other conservators of the peace by tenftre; Id. who held lands of the king by this service; and other confer- tenure and vators of the peace by prescription. *7 P^fenp1101^

The general duty of the conservators of the peace by the . c. i. common law, is to employ their own, and to command the Their duty, help of others, to arreil and pacify all such who, in their presence, and within their jurisdiction and limits, by wora or deed, shall go about to break the peace.

The Justice of the Peace, his Oath of Office.

€t YE shall (wear, that as justice of the peace in the county of M. in all articles in the king's coromiffton to you directed, you shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich, after your cunning, wit, and power, and after the laws and customs of the realm, and statutes thereof made: And ye shall not be of counsel of any quarrel hanging before you : And that ye hold your sessions after the form of the statutes thereof made: And the issues, fines, and amerciaments that shall happen to be made, and all forfeitures which shall fall before you, ye shall cause to be made without any concealment (or embezzling), and truly fend them to the king's exchequer. Ye shall not let, for gift or other cause, but well and truly ye shall do your office of justice of the peace in that behalf: And you shall take nothing for your office of justice of the peace to be done, but of the king, and fees accustomed, and coils limited by statute. And ye shall not direct, nor cause to be directed, any warrant (by you to be made) to the parties, but ye shall di-re£t them to the bailiff of the said county, or other the king's officers or ministers, or other indifferent persons, to do execution thereof. So help you God.”

The justices, at Midsummer sessions 1753, shall settle a table jof their clerk's fees 5 which, being approved by the justices at the next succeeding sessions, with such alterations as the justices there shall think proper, shall be laid before the judges at the next assizes, who shall confirm the same with such alterations, additions, or abatements, as to them shall appear just and reasonable: And the sessions, from time to time, may make any other table of fees, and after the same shall have been approved by the next succeeding sessions, shall lay the same before the judges at the next assizes, who may ratify the same in like manner ; And no table of fees shall be valid, until confirmed by the judges. And if, after three months from the time that such table shall be confirmed, any justice's clerk shall demand or take any other or greater fee than shall have been so confirmed, he shall forfeit 20I. to him who shall sue in three months. The said table of fees shall be deposited with the clerk of the peace, who shall cause true copies thereof to be kept constantly in a conspicuous part of the room where the sessions are held, on pain of 10I.

In Middlesex, the like table shall be confirmed by the two lords chief justices, and the lord chief baron, or any two of them.

Regularly, justices of the peace ought not to execute their office, in their own case; but cause the offenders to be convened or carried before some other justice, or desire the aid of some other justice being present.

If a justice exceed his authority, in granting a warrant* yet the officer mull execute it, and is indemnified for so doing; but if it be a case wherein he hath no jurisdiction, or in a matter whereof he hath no cognizance, the officer ought not to execute such warrant; so that the officer is bound to take notice of the authority and jurisdiction of the justice.

If the officer, in six days after demand, shall grant to the party complaining a perusal and copy of the warrant* he shall not be liable to any action, but the justice only.

In summary convictions, the party ought to be heard* and for that purpose, ought to be summoned in fact; and if the justice proceed against a person without fumrooning him* it would be a misdemeanor in him* for which an information would lie.

In all cases where justices may hear and determine out of sections (viz. on their own view, or confession, or oath of witnesses), the justices ought to make a record, in writing under their hands, of all the matters and proofs; which record* notwithstanding, in many cases they may keep by them. And if, upon such con vision, the offender is to be fined to the king, then the justices are to estreat such fine, and to fend the estreat into the exchequer, whereby the barons of the exchequer may cause the said fine or forfeiture to be levied for the king's use.

Forasmuch as most of the business of a justice of the peace consisteth in the execution of divers statutes* which cannot be sufficiently abridged, but that they will come short of the fub-stance and body thereof, therefore it shall be safest for the justices to have an eye to the statutes at large* and thereby to take their further and better directions* for their whole proceedings. *

A justice of the peace is strongly protected by the law* in the just execution of his office.

Thus, in the first place, he is not to be slandered or abused.

In the next place, he is not punishable at the suit of the party, but only at the iuit of the king, for what he doth as jadge, in matters which he hath power by law to hear and determine without the concurrence of any other; but in cases wherein he proceeds ministerially, rather than judicially* if he act corruptly, he is liable to an action at the suit of the party* as well as to an information at the suit of the king.

In the next place, if any action shall be brought against a justice for any thing done by virtue of his office, he may plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence ; and if he recover, he shall have double costs.

No writ shall be sued out against* or copy of any process* at the suit of a subject, shall be served on any justice, for any thing done by him in the execution of his office, until notice in writing shall have been given to him, or left at his ofual place of abode, by the attorney for the party, one month before the filing out* or serving the same; containing the cause of

of action, and indorsed with his name and place of abode; 2- for which he shall be entitled to a fee of 20s. and no more. — And the justice may, at any time, within one month after jc such notice, tender amends to the party complaining, or to ”T his attorney; and if the same is not accepted, he may plead

as such tender in bar to the action, together with the plea of not

guilty, and any other plea, with leave of the court; and if, si upon issue joined, the jury shall find the amends tendered to

Ik have been sufficient, they shall give a verdict for the defend-

ant.

x If a justice will not, on complaint to him made, execute his S' office, or shall mlfbehave in his office, the party grieved may \\t move the court of king's bench for an information, and after-

:js wards may apply to the court of chancery to pat him out of the commission.

Larceny

COMES from lairocinium, lairociny ; and, by contradion, or rather abuse, larceny.

Grand larceny is a felonious and fraudulent taking, and ,lt carrying away, by any person, of the mere personal goods of & another, above the value of I2d.

P Ajuflice of the peace, before whom an offender shall be brought for petty larceny out of sessions, may not punish the f! said offender by his discretion, and so let him go; but mud 3f have him committed or bailed, to the intent he may come to his trial, as in cases of other felonies: And if, upon his trial, 1 the jury shall And the goods (tolen to exceed i2d. in value, the ( offender shall have judgment to die for the fault.

' All petty larceny is felony, and consequently requires the wordfekniously in an indictment for it; yet it is certain, that it is not punishable with the loss of life or lands, but only with i the forfeiture of goods, and whipping, transportation, or other corporal punishment.

' If the goods are taken from a man's person, and if it is at- tended with putting him in fear, it is called robbery: if it is 1 without putting him in fear, then it is called barely larceny from the person.

! If it is done privily without his knowledge, by picking of 1 pockets, or otherwise, it is excluded from the benefit of clergy 1 by the 8 ELc. 4. (that is, if the thing stolen be above the va- lueofi2d.)

If it is done openly and avowedly before his face, it is within the benefit of clergy, except where it is committed in a dwel*

THTS word signifies a Crime : But the law hath made s distinction between crimes of a higher and lower nature; the former being denominated ; the latter Mydt-

Vic an ours.

This lad is an act committed or omitted in violation of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it.

Crimes and mifde mean ours are terms which are frequently joined together; which, though properly speaking, they are synonymous, are made to denote very different things; the word crimes extending to such offences as are of a deeper and more atrocious dye; while smaller faults, and omissions of left consequence, and the beginnings of greater offences not absolutely perpetrated, are compnfed under the milder term of misdemeanours* These it is impossible to define or describe; inasmuch as they are as various in their nature as human actions ; but they are fully set forth in the several codes of criminal j urifprudence.

Northern Borders,

£ Nuisance.

A COMMON nuisance seems to be, an offence against the public, either by doing a thing which tends to the annoyance of all the kings subjects, or by neglecting to do a thing which the common good requires.

Annoyances to the prejudice of particular persons, are not $ punishable by a public prosecution as common nuisances, but s are left to be redressed by the private actions of the parties ag-i grieved by them.

,4 If it is a public nuisance, the law hath provided an apt re- medy, by presentment or indictment at the suit of the king, in the behalf of all his subjects.

Oaths.

;J? XN all cases, where any penalty is directed to be levied, or % X distress to be made, by any act of parliament now in force, v or hereafter to be made, it shall be lawful for any justice or j, justices, acting under the authority of such acts respectively, to administer an oath or oaths for the purpose of levying such ? penalties, or making such distresses.

Certain general Rules concerning Certificates.

A Parish cannot so compelled to grant a Certificate.

A Certificate is not binding, unless signed by the Justices. j"

THE justices are not obliged ministerially to allow and sign ,. a certificate. They have a discretion to allow it, or not to allow it, if it be liable to objection. And if it is not a certificate within the ad (which it is not, unless properly signed), it cannot conclude the parish*

A Certificate extends

Of Settlement by Birth.

Of Bastards.

A BASTARD child is primafacie settled when bora: And this was the antient genuine settlement: But this rule admits of divers exceptions.

If a woman comes into a place by privity and collusion of the officers where (he belongs, and is there delivered of a baf-tard, such bastard gains no settlement, notwithstanding its birth.

If a woman big with child of a bastard, and settled in one parish, is persuaded to go into another, and there be delivered ; this fraud will make the pariftt chargeable where the mother was settled, though the child was not born there.

If a bastard is born under an order of removal, and before the mother can be sent to the place of settlement, being hindered by water or otherwift, such bastard shall not be settled where so born, but at the mother's settlement*

If the officers are carrying a woman by virtue of an order of removal, and (he be delivered on the road in the baf-

tard shall go with the mother where (he is going, by virtue of the order, notwithstanding the birth*

Where any woman, wandering and begging, shall be delivered of a child in any parish or place to which (he doth not belong, and thereby shall become chargeable to the same, the churchwardens or overseers may detain her till they can safely convey her to a justice of the peace. And if such woman shall be detained and conveyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which (he is delivered, if a bastard, shall not be settled in the place where so born, nor be sent thither by a vagrant pass; but the settlement of such woman shall be deemed the settlement of such child.

A child born in the house of correction, shall be sent to the place of its mother's settlement*

If a woman come into a parish by certificate, and be there delivered of a bastard, that child shall not be included in the certificate as part of the family,but shall be settled where born.

Of Legitimate Children.

THE father's settlement is the settlement of the children, when it can be found out; otherwise the birth of they child prima facie is the settlement of the child, until there is another settlement found out. If they cannot find out the legal settlement of the father, the birth is the settlement of the child. The settlement by birth is only quousque they find the father's settlement; and if they never can find that, it is absolute up* on them.

Fofrj, *65. . Father's settlement that child, if know*.

Of the Settlement of Children with their Parents.

THE birth of legitimate children doth not give them a settlement, except where the settlement of their father and mother is not known, and then only till it is known.

A child of seven years of age may be bound apprentice to a Shipwright, fisherman, owner of a ship, or other person using the trade of the Teas ; and, by the vagrant act of the 17 2,

a vagrant's child of that age may, by the justices, be put out an apprentice: and, as soon as he shall have resided and lodged in a parish for 40 days under the indenture, he will have thereby gained a settlement. So that the precise time when a person may have gained a settlement in his own right, is at the age of seven years and 40 days.

When a father gains a second settlement after the birth of s-r. 580. his child, that settlement is immediately communicated to the Child goes r« child. And a child may be sent to the place of his father's Settlement, without ever having been there before. cct C,nent*

The place where a bastard is born is the place of his settle- 3 Salk, ment, unless there is some trick to charge the parish ; but the lj-fj«ence.n place where legitimate children are born is not the place of felt:e'.ncu:. their settlement; for let that be where it will, the children are settled where their parents are settled.

Though the place of the birth of a child, where the father Str. 5S0. hath no settlement, is the place of the settlement of the child, Removjb'e . yet where the father hath gained a settlement, his children, s i;t< e-though born in another parish, shall be looked on as settled at n *

If the father dies before the child is born, yet the child shall be settled where the father was settled before his death.

If a widow, by renting lol. a year, gains a new settlement, her children are settled with her.

But if a woman marry again to a man settled in another parish, her children, by her former husband, mull go with her for nurture, yet they are fto part of her second husband's family; and therefore gain no settlement in the parish where the father-in-law is settled.

Those under seven years of age shall be kept at the charge of the other parish, where their father, whilllliving, was settled ; and to that parish they may be sent, after seven years old, as to the place of their lawful settlement.

The child's settlement follows that of its father, if the father's can be found; and no recourse shall be had to the mother's settlement, till that of the father can be traced no further.

Where a child is first known to be, that parish mud provide for it, till they find another.

Of Settlement by Apprenticeship.

ON complaint by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor, within 40 days after any person shall come to settle in any parish, on any tenement under 10I. a year, two justices ( I ^.) 4

may remove him to the place where he was last legally settled, » either as a native, housholder, sojourner, apprentice, or fer- % vant, for the space of 40 days at the lead. I

The said 40 days shall be reckoned, not from the time of I his coming to inhabit, but from the time of his delivering no- 1 tice in writing; and by 3. IV. c. 11, not from the time of delivering such notice, but from the time of the publication of such notice in the church.

If any person shall be bound an apprentice by indenture, and inhabit in any town or parish, such binding and inhabitation shall be adjudged a good settlement, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published.

If any person, after June 24, 1713, shall be an apprentice bound by indenture to any person redding under a certificate, in any parish, and not afterwards having gained a legal settlement in such parish, such apprentice, by virtue of such apprenticcship, shall not gain any settlement in such parish.

No person who shall nave been bound an apprentice, by any deed, writing, or contract, not indented, being first legally

Poor. (Settlement by A 343

AoBiped, shall be liable to be removed from the place where he was jo bound and resident 40 days, by any order of removal, or order of sessions, by reason only of such writing not being in dented.

An apprentice may gain a settlement, whilA his maAer, not renting iol. a year, gains none. In such case, the maAer being removed, may apply to the juAices to compel the apprentice to go with him.

If the maAer runs away, the apprentice is not sufficiently /uijuris to hire himself, nor can he gain a settlement till his Indentures be legally cancelled.

Of Settlement by Service.

IF any unmarried person, not having child or children, shall be lawfully hired into any pariAt or town for one year, such service Aiall be adjudged and deemed a good settlement therein.

No such person fi> hired as aforesaid, shall be adjudged or deemed to have a good settlement in any such pariAi or town-ship, unless such person shall continue and abide in the same service during the space of one whole year.

If any person, after June 24, 1713, /hail be a hired servant with any person who did come in to,.or shall reside in any pa* rish, town ship, or place, by means or licence of a certificate, and not afterwards having gained a legal settlement in such parish, township, or place; such servant shall not gain any settlement in such parish, township, or place, by reason of such hiring or service, but shall have his settlement as if he had not been an hired servant to such person.

If an unmarried man, who has a "daughter married and settled elsewhere, hires himself for a year, and serves the year, he gains a settlement by the service, though not AridUy a man.

If a man hired for a year marries, having.served half a year, the marriage doth not ninder the service; if the man performs the service, he gains a settlement.

All hiring for a few days, Aiort of a year, for the purpose of avoiding a settlement, will be considered as fraudulent; and the service will be allowed to make a good settlement. Less than 40 days residence in any pariAi will not gain a settlement: But if the contract be for a year, and the service be performed (sup-pose at sea, or in diAant journies), the residence need not be 40 days fucceAively; it is sufficient if within the year he resides40 days in the whole.

N. B. Though the case here alluded to is that of a daughter married and settled elsewhere, it should leem equally clear in the cafo of a or font, that have obtained a legal settlement elfcwberc, previous to ths father's obtaining a new settlement by the service of a year, onder a legal huing fora year.

Of Settlement by continuing 40 Pays after Notice.

THE 40 days continuance of a person in a parish, to make a settlement, shall be accounted from the time of his delivering notice in writing, of the house of his abode, and the number of his family, if he have any, to one of the churchwardens or overseers of the parish to which he shall remove.

Which said notice in writing, the said churchwarden or overseer shall read, or cause to be read, publicly, immediately after divine service, in the church or chapel, on the next Lord's Day, when there shall be divine service in the same. — And the said churchwarden or overseer shall regiHer or cause to be registered, the said notice in writing, in the book kept for the poor's account.

And if any churchwarden or overseer shall refuse or neglect to read, or cause to be read, such notice in writing as aforesaid, he shall (on proof thereof by the oath of two witnesses before one justice) forfeit, for every offence, 40s. to the party grieved, by distress, by warrant directed to the constable of the parish or town where the offender dwells ; and for want of sufficientdif-tress, the said judice shall commit him to the common gaol for one month. And if any churchwarden or overseer shall refuse or neglect to register, or cause to be registered, such notice in writing, he shall, on the like conviction, forfeit 40s. to the use of the poor of the parish or town where the offender dwells, to be levied as aforesaid ; and for want of sufficient distress, then the said justice shall commit him as aforesaid, for the time aforesaid.

any parish, port-town, or other town, by delivering and publication of notice in writing, unless the same be after a difmif-lion out of the service.

When this notice given in writing has been omitted, the court has held all constructive notices to be no legal settle-inent, such as, attending the leet, amending the highways, and doing watch and ward.

Of Settlement by paying Parish Rates.

FORTY days inhabitancy shall gain a settlement.

Such 40 days are to be reckoned from the delivering of notice in writing, and from the publication of such notice in the church.

But if any person, who shall come to inhabit in any town or parish, shall be charged with, and pay his share towards the public taxes or levies of the said town or parish, he shall be adjudged to have a legal settlement in the same, though no such notice in writing be delivered and publiftied.

But persons redding under a certificate, shall gain no settlement by being rated to and paying any such levies, taxes, or assessraents.

Payments for the repair of the church, the relief of the poor, and the land-tax, have been adjudged sufficient to gain a settlement: But no payment for the repair of the highways, or of the county-bridges, or of the duties on housesand windows, shall make a good settlement.

Where the tenant is #a(re(Ted to, and pays the land-tax, though it be afterwards allowed by the landlord, and deduced out of the rent, the tenant hereby gains a settlement; which is supposed to turn on the notice of inhabitancy, that arises from the party's being assessed and paying the tax, which is considered as tantamount to notice in writing.

Of Settlement by serving a Parish Office.

IF any person, who shall come to inhabit in any town or parish, shall for himself, and on his own account, execute any public and annual office or charge in the said town or parish, during one whole year, he shall be adjudged to have a legal

In many instances, the landl is ajftjfid by name, though the tenant pays the Jand.tax, in confidence that it will t>c a lowed him : In which case, the notoriety of such a person's inhabitancy is loll ; and it should seem that there is no ground on which to establish a legal settlement. Thu decision, however, has of late been overruled ; and the tenant, though he has been af-frfTed and paid the tax, has not been allowed to have giii.ed a legal settlement the.tbjf.

No person, who shall come into any parish by certificate, shall be adjudged by any alt whatsoever, to have procured a legal settlement in such parish, unless he shall really and side take a lease of a tenement of the yearly value of 10I. or shall execute some annual office in such parish, being legally placed in such office.

To serve the office of constable as deputy to another, doth not gain a settlement, though it be served a year; for, by the words of the ad, he mud serve the office for on his

own account,

He mull also be legally placed in his office, by taking the oaths which belong to it. It mull appear to the court, how he came into his employment or office.

Of Settlement by renting iol. a Year.

THE ad (9 13 10 W, c. 11.) doth not require a person

renting a tenement of iol. a year, to occupy it ; it is enough if he rents it, and resides 40 days in the parish. The ground the ad goes upon, is a per Ton's having credit sufficient to hire a tenement of that value.

If the tenement is under lol.a year, the jaltices, upon complaint within 40 days, have power to remove the person coming thither to reside; if it Is not under iol. a year, the)' have no power to remove him ; and continuing upon the same on-removable for 40 days, he thereby gains a settlement.

Of Settlement by a Person's own Estate.

NO certificate person shall gain a settlement, but by taking a lease of a tenement of iol. a year, or executing an annual

office.

But, where a person has an estate for life, or an estate of inheritance of his own, that gains him a settlement, though less than iol. a year; for he cannot be removed 5 and if he cannot be removed, he certainly gains a settlement.

Where a man lives upon his own, it is a case of a very tender nature, and the law will not nnfettle him : Persons to be removed under the statute of C. 2, are rhofe that wander from place to place, and not those who live upon their own estate.

No person shall be deemed to acquire any settlement in any parish or place, by virtue of any purchase of any estate or interest in such parish or place, whereof the consideration for such purchase doth not amount to the sum of 30I. side paid, for any longer or further time than such person shall inhabit in

such

Poor. (Settlement by Estate.)

such estate, and shall be then liable to be removed to such parish or place where he was lad legally settled before the said purchase and inhabitancy therein.

A person may not be removed from his own, although not settled thereby, be the value ever so small, or let him come to it in what manner soever.

A certificate person shall gain a settlement by an estate of his own, notwith (landing the abovesaid ilatute of the 9 10 W.

If an estate descends to a certificate person, it gains him \ settlement, because it is by operation of law, and not by an act of his own.

Having land in a parish will not make a settlement, but living in a parish where one has land, will gain a settlement without notice; for the act never meant to bani(h men from the enjoyment of their own lands.

Of Removals.

IT shall be lawful, upon complaint made by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of any parish, to any justice of the peace, within 40 days after any poor person comes to settle in any tenement under the yearly value of 10I. for any two justices of the peace (one whereof is of the quorum) of the division where any person that is likely to become chargeable to the parish shall come to inhabit, by their warrant to remove and convey such person to such parish where he was last legally settled, unless lie give sufficient security for the discharge of the said parish, to be allowed by the said justices.

And if such person shall refuse to go, or shall not remain in such parish where he ought to be settled, but shall return of his own accord to the parish from whence he was removed, one justice may fend him to the house of correction, there to be pu-fiished as a vagabond.

All persons who shall unlawfully return to such parish or place from whence they have been legally removed by order of two justices, without bringing a certificate from the parish or place whereunto they belong, shall be deemed idle and disorderly persons ; and one justice may commit them (being thereof convicted before him, by his own view, or by their own con-session, or by the oath of one credible witness) to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one month.

And if the churchwardens and overseers of the parish to which he shall be removed, refuse to receive such person, and to provide work for him, as other inhabitants of the parish ; any justice of that division shall bind any such officer in whom there shall be default to the assizes or sessions, there to be in-disted for his contempt in that behalf.

Though the complaint may be to one justice, yet the examination ought to be by two, and those the same who sign the order of removal.

And, most undoubtedly,the justices ought to be both together at the hearing and determining; though the practice in many places is otherwise.

After an order and adjudication is made, that the same may appear upon record afterwards, in order to charge the pariftt, the most regular way for the justices to proceed, is to make a record of the complaint and adjudication, and upon that to make a warrant to the churchwardens and overseers, to convey the persons to the parish to which they ought to be (ent, and deliver in the record by their own hands into court the next sessions, to be kept there amongst the records.

If any person, who shall come into any parish or place, there to reside, shall deliver a certificate to one of the churchwardens or overseers there, such certificate shall oblige the parish or place granting the same, to receive and provide for the person mentioned in the said certificate, together with his family, as inhabitants of that parish, whenever they shall happen to become chargeable to, or be forced to alk relief of, the parish, township, or place, to which such certificate was given ; and then, and not before, it shall be lawful for any such person, and his children, though born in that parish, not having otherwise acquired a legal settlement there, to be removed, conveyed, and settled in the parish or place from whence such certificate was brought.

When any overseer or other person shall remove back any persons or their families, redding under a certificate, and becoming chargeable to the parish or place to which they shall belong, such overseer or other person shall be reixnbursed such reasonable charges as they may have been put unto in maintaining and removing such persons, by the churchwardens or overseers of the place to which such persons arc removed; the said charges being first ascertained and allowed of by one or more justices for the county or place to which such removal shall be made; which said charges so ascertained and allowed

Poor. ( R.)

shall, in case of a refusal of payment, be levied by distress and sale of the goods of the churchwardens and overseers of the place to which such certificate person is removed, by warrant of such judice or justices.

All persons who think themselves aggrieved by any such judgment of the said two justices, may appeal to the justices of the peace of the said county, at their next quarter-sessions, who shall do them judice according to the merits of their cause.

The appeal against any order of removal of any poor person, shall be had, prosecuted, and determined, at the general or quarter-sessions of the peace for the county, division, or riding, wherein the parish, township, or place, from whence such poor person shall be removed doth lie, and not elsewhere.

N. B. In case of an order of removal from a town corporate, the appeal mull be to the sessions of the county; and not ab todem adcumdem, the same justices probably fitting who made the order.

No appeal from any order of removal shall be proceeded upon, unless reasonable notice be given by the churchwardens or overseers of the parish or place appealing, unto the church* wardens or overseers of the parish or place from which the removal shall be ; the reasonableness of which notice shall be determined by the justices at the quarter-sessions to which the appeal is made; and if it shall appear to them, that reasonable time of notice was not given, they shall adjourn the appeal to the next quarter-sessions, and then and there finally determine the same.

On all appeals to the sessions against the judgment or orders of any justices of the peace, the justices there shall cause defeats of form to be rectified and amended, without any cod to the party, and after such amendment, shall proceed to hear the truth and merits of the cause.

And, for the more effectual preventing of vexatious removals and frivolous appeals, the justices in sessions, upon any appeal concerning the settlement of any poor person, or upon any proof before them there to be made, of notice of any such appeal to have been given b/ the proper officers to the churchwardens or overseers of any parish or place (though they did not afterwards prosecute such appeal), shall at the same sessions order to the party in whole behalf such appeal shall be determined, or to whom such notice did appear to have been given, such costs and charges in the law, as by the said justices in their discretion shall be thought most reasonable andjull; to be paid by the churchwardens, overfifers, or any other person, against whom such appeal shall be determined, or by the person that did give such notice; and if the person ordered to pay such costs, shall live out of the jurisdiction of the said court, any judice where such person shall inhabit, shall, on re-

If the justices shall, at their quarter-sessions, upon an appeal before them there had, concerning the settlement of any poor person, determine in favour of the appellant, that such poor person was unduly removed, they shall, at the same quarcer-sessions, order arid award to such appellant, so much money, as shall appear to the said justices to have been reasonably paid by the parish or other place on whose behalf such appeal was made, towards the relief of such poor person, between the time of such undue removal, and the determination of such appeal; the said money so awarded to be recovered in the same manner as cods and charges upon an appeal are to be recovered by the statute just mentioned.

An order of two justices, if quashed at the sessions upon an appeal, for want of form only, is not conclusive between the two parishes.

It was moved for setting aside an order of sessions confirming an order of two justices upon appeal. But the court would hear nothing of the merits of the cause, the order of sessions being in that case final, unless there had been an error in form.

Prison-Breaking.

THOSE who have broken prison are not bailable by justices of the peace ; and that for two reasons: 1. Because it carries a preemption of guilt. And, 2. Because it is a fu-peradded offence to the former, (or which they Hood committed.

The party may be arraigned for prison-breaking, before he be convicted of the crime for which he was imprisoned 5 for that is not material whether he were guilty of such crime or not; for the words of the statute are, which fu taken and imprisoned.

The gaoler shall not be punished as a feloh for the party's breach of prison, unless he voluntarily consented to it; but it seems to be a negligent escape in the gaoler, for which he may be punished by fine and imprisonment, because there wanted either that due strength in the gaol, or that due vigilance in the gaoler or his officers, that should have prevented it: And if gaolers might not be punished for this as a negligent escape, they would be careless either xo fee ure their prisoners, or to retake them that escape.

If a criminal, endeavouring to break the gaol, assault his gaoler, he may be lawfully killed by him in the affray.

The law, in several cases, in express words directs process to be made by justices out of sessions; and in other cases by necessary implication ; as where a statute doth give power to justices out of sessions to esquire, hear, and determine, there they may make process to cause the party to come and answer, otherwise they cannot proceed to hear and determine; and this

may be either before or after preferment or indictment, as the levcra! statutes do require: Before presentment or indi&meot, it is called a warrant; after presentment or indictment, it is pronerlv called process.

Wherever the king is a party to the Suit (as he certainly u to all informations and indictments), the process ought to be executed by the sheriff himself, and not by the bailiff of any franc hife.

If tht party be in an honfe, if the doors be (hot, and the sheriff (having given notice of his process) demand admit, tance, and the door? be not opened, he may break open the doors, and enter to take the offender.

It seemeth that any one justice may bail persons indiftedat the sessions, for any offence under the degree of felony; for that the iHtutes relating specially to the power of justices in granting bail, do not in this case seem to takeaway the power, which one justice had before the‘making of the said statutes.

It is laid, that the justices in sessions cannot issuea atlagatum, but must return the record of the outlawry into the king's bench, and there process of tafias shall

issue.

If one be outlawed before the justices of the peace on an in- , didment of felony, they may award a capias ; for

they that have power to award process of outlawry, hare also power to award a capias utlagatum,as incident to their authority and jurisdiction.

By the outlawry, all personal chattels are vested in the ki«g 'N by forfeitures; but real chattels, or freehold estates, are not f vested in the king, till after inquisition found. I

If a man be indicted before justices of the peace, and there* . upon outlawed, and is taken and committed to prison, thejof* tices of gaol-delivery may award execution of this prisoner; for they are con Hi tu ted to deliver the gaol.

are of that nature, that only women are the most proper examiners and inspedors; if the place, wherein the fad was done, was remote from people, inhabitants, or passengers; if the offender fled for it; these, and the like, are concurring evidences to give greater probability to her testimony, when proved by others as well as herself.

But, on the other side, if (he concealed the injury for any considerable time, after (he had opportunity to complain; if the place, where the fad was supposed to be committed, were near to inhabitants or common passage of passengers, and (be made no outcry when (he was supposed to be done, when and where it is probable (he might be heard by others; or if a man prove himself to be in another place, or in other company, at the time (he charges him with the fad ; or if (he is wrong in the description of the place, or swears the fad to be done in a place where it was impossible the man could have accefstoher at that time, as if the room was locked up, and the key in the custody of another perfoo ; these, and the like circomfUoces, , carry strong preemption that her testimony is falseor feigned.

Upon the whole, rape, it is true, is a most detestable crime, and therefore ought (everely and impartially to be punished with death ; but it must be remembered, that it is an accusation easily to be made, and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, though never so innocent: Therefore, a wife jury will be cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, that they be not so much transported with in-dignation at the heinousness of the offence, as to be over haft-ily carried to the conviction of the person accused thereof, by 1 the confident testimony, sometimes of malicious and false wit- I nesses.

Recognizance.

RECOGNIZANCE is a bond of record, testifying the recognizor to owe a certain sum of money to some other; and the acknowledgment of the same is to remain upon record; and none can take it but only a judge or officer of record, &c.

Recognizance.

'L And these recognizances, in some cases, the justices of the . peace are enabled to take by the express words of certain fta- tutes ; but in other cases (as for the peace, and good beha-rr viour, and the like), it is rather in congruity, and by reason- able intendment of law, than by any express authority given them, either by their commission, or by the statute law.

But wheresoever any statute giveth them power to take a ;,j: bond of any man, or to bind over any man to appear at the aftizes or sessions, or to take sureties for any matter or cause,

they may take a recognizance. Yea, wheresoever they have *2 authority giveri them to cause a man do a thing, there it seem-

cth they have in congruity power given them to bind the party by recognizance to do it; and if the party shall refuse to be bound, the justice may fend him to gaol.

w Every obligation and recognizance, taken by justices of the -i* peace, must be made to our lord the king; on pain of im-x prisonment of any person that shall take it otherwise.

When the parties are to enter into recognizance, call them ijt by their names thus: — You A. B. acknowledge to owe to our it 9 sovereign lord the king, the sum of . , and you C. D.

y; acknowledge to owe to our sovereign lord the king, the sum I*; of ; to be levied of your respective goods and chattels, fj 9 lands and tenements, for the use of our said lord the king, !<.« 9 his heirs and successors, if default shall be made in the con-edition following: — That is to say, if you the said A. B. shall if 9 make default in appearing, &c.' But the parties need not ,t: sign it. And it is usual for the justices to mark at the foot of the examination, A. B. in 40I. to appear, &c. And from such short note make out a record afterwards.

Lord Coke fays, that a record is a memorial or remembrance in rolls of parchment, &c. from whence it seemeth that a recognizance ought to be ingrossed on parchment; but since there is no law which prohibits it to be engrossed on paper, it seemeth that if it shall be on paper only, and not on parchment, it is good in law.

:fl And when it is made up, if the justice shall only subscribe ‘rj his name, without his seal to it, this is well enough ; and that ^ may be in either of these forts, acknowledged before me, J.

P. or only to subscribe his name thus, J. P.

'j The justices shall certify their recognizances for keeping the

peace, to the next sections, that the party may be called ; and if he make default, the default shall be recorded, and the re-cognizance, with the record of the default, shall be sent and certified into the chancery, king's bench, or exchequer.

K But in cases of felony, the recognizances are to be certified to the general gaol delivery.

IF any felon do rob, or take away any man's money or goods, and thereof be indicted and arraigned, and foond guilty, or otherwise attainted, by rcalon of evidence given by the party robbed, or the owner of the money or goods, or by any other by their procurement; then the party robbed, or owner of the goods, shall be restored to such his money or goods : And as well the justices of gaol-deliyery, as other justices before whoa whom the felon shall be found guilty, or otherwise attainted* may award a writ of relUtuiion, in like manner as if the felon were attainted on appeal.

Riot, rout, and unlawful assembly.

WHEN three persons or more shall assemble themselves together, with an intent mutually toaflift one another, against any who shall oppose them, in the execution of some enterprize of a private nature, with force or violence, against the peace, or to the manifest terror of the people, whether the ad intended were of itself lawful or unlawful ; if they' only meet to such a purpose or intent, although they shall after depart of their own accord, without doing any thing, this is an unlawful assembly : If, after the first meeting, they shall more forward towards the execution of any such ad, whether they put their intended purposes in execution or not; this, according to the general opinion, is a And if they execute

such a thing io deed, then it is a riot.

The justices of the peace (or, as it hath been resolved, one justice) shall have power to restrain rioters, and to arrest and chastise them according to their offence; and cause them to be imprisoned and duly punished, according to the law and custom of the realm, and according to that which to them shall seem best to do, by their discretion and good advisement.

Bat if the rioters are above the number of twelve, the offence is greatly enhanced, and the power of one justice very much enlarged, by the ad commonly called the riot ad, which is required to be read at every quarter-fe (Sons and leet. Every justice, sheriff, under-sheriff, and mayor, shall, on notice or knowledge of any unlawfol, riotous, and tumultuous assembly of persons to the number of twelve or more, together with such help as he shall command, resort to the place; and with a loud voice command, or cause to be commanded, silence to be, while proclamation is making; and, after that, shall openly and with a loud voice make, or cause to be made, proclamation in these words, or like in effect:

Robbery.

ROBBERY is a felony by the common law, committed by ?

violent assault upon theperfonof another, by putting him in fear, and taking from his person his money, or other goods, of any value whatsoever.

If any person be indicted, or appealed, for killing any person attempting to rob, he shall be acquitted.

If any person, who shall travel upon the Lord's Day, shall be then robbed, the hundred shall not be liable: Nevertheless, they shall make hue and cry, on pain of forfeiting to the king as much as might have been recovered against the hundred, if the robbery had not been on the Lord's Day; except only or from church.

If there be so much day-light as that one may fee a man's face, so that, the robber may be known, though it be before the sun-rising, or after the sun-setting, the hundred shall an -fwer for it.

No person shall recover against the hundred, more than the value of 200]. unless the persons robbed shall at the time of the robbery be together in company, And be in number two at the lea(t, to attest the truth of his or their being so robbed.

In order to make the hundred liable, the person robbed shall, with as much convenient speed as maybe, give notice thereof, unto some of the inhabitants near the place.

He shall also give notice, with as much convenient speed as may be, to a constable of the hundred, that is, the high constable, or to a constable of (ome place near; or leave notice in writing at his house, describing therein the felon, and the time and place of the robbery.

The party robbed shall also, within 20 days, cause notice to be given in the gazette, describing therein the felon, and the time and place of the robbery, and the goods and effects whereof he was robbed.

He shall also be examined on oath within twenty days next before the action brought, before a justice in or near the hundred, whether he knows any of the robbers ; and if he confesses that he does, he shall, before action brought, be bound over by the

Search-Warrant.

A JUSTICE cannot legally grant a blank warrant for the arrest of a single person, leaving it to the party to fill up, much less can he grant such a general warrant, as might have theeffect of a hundred blank warrants.

Search-Warrant.

A judice cannot, upon a bare farmife, make a warrant to break any man's house, to search for a felon, or for stolen goods; for the justices being created by act of parliament, have no such authority granted to them by any act of parliament.

But in case of a complaint, and oath made, of goods stolen, and that the party suspects that goods are in such a house, and fhevvs the cause of his suspicion, the judice may grant a warrant (in the day time) to learch in those suspected places mentioned in his warrant, and to attach the goods, and the party in whose cutlody they are found, and bring them before him, or some other judice, to give an account how he came by them, and farther to abide such order as to law shall appertain.

But in case of pofttive proof, it is right to execute the warrant in the night-time, led the offenders and goods also be gone before morning.

Such warrant ought to be directed to thecondable, or other public officer, and not to any private person, though it is fit the party complaining IhOuld be present and affidant, because he knows his goods.

Whether the dolen goods are in a suspected house or not, the officer and his affidants in the day-time may enter, the doors being open, to make search, and isjudifiable by the wairant.

As touching the goods brought before him, if it appear to the judice that they were not dolen, they are to be restored to the possessor; if it appear they were dolen, they are not to be delivered to the proprietor, but deposited in the hand of the Iheriffor condable, to the end the party robbed may proceed, by indifting and convicting the offender, to have reditution.

As touching the party that had the custody of the goods, if they were not dolen, then he is to be discharged $ if dolen, but not by him, but by another that fold or delivered them to him, if ft appear that he was ignorant that they were dolen, he may be discharged as an offender, and bound over to give evidence as a witness against him that fold them ; if it appear he knew they were dolen, he mud be committed or bound over to answer the felony.

Servants.

TWO ju dices (or the chief officer of a town corporate, and two aldermen, or two discreet burgesses, if there be no aldermen) may appoint any woman of the age of 12 years, and under 40, and unmarried, and out of service, to serve, or be retained to serve by the year, or by the week, or day, for such wages, and in such reasonable sort and manner as they shall think meet.

Sessions.

« Where authority is given to two justices to do any act, the 13 sessions may do it in all cases, except where appeal is directed l to the sessions.

Justices may issue their warrants for apprehending persons & charged with crimes within the cognizance of the sessions, and x bind them over to appear there, although the offender be not ;j» yet indicted.

z If jarifdiction be given to the sessions, to hear and deter-g mine, and doth not say by information, this shall be by in-g. distment, and not upon information.

^ The sessions is all as one day, and the justices may alter theirjudgments at any time whilst it continues.

It seemeth certain, that the sessions hath no authority to amerce any justice, for his non-attendance at the icffions, as ^ the judges of assize may for the absence of any such justice at ^ the gaol delivery : Inter pares non eft.

The sessions may proceed to outlawry in cases of indictments found before them : But they cannot issue a capias,

but must return the record of the outlawry into the king's bench, and thence process of capias utlagatum. shall issue. g The sessions cannot award an attachment for contempt in not complying with their orders; but the ordinary and proper method is by indictment.

The justices are not punishable for what they do in sessions : Unless there be some manifest act of oppression, or wilful abuse 1 of power.

The justices being met, the usual course is with three o-yes to proclaim the sessions, and then read the commission of the peace: Then the grand jury are called and sworn, and the

'? charge given to them.

If there be any who are to take their oaths, in order to qua-Jl lify them for offices, this must be done between the hours of f nine and twelve in the forenoon, and not otherwise.

The king's proclamation against profaneness and immorality ? is also to be read; and likewise divers acts of parliament;

against popery, the riot aft, the black aft, the act about ale f measures, and about burying in woollen, are required to be given in charge at the sessions 5 the acts concerning jurors are

to be read in Midsummer sessions yearly; and the statute ^ against bribery and corruption in cleft ions of members of parliament is to be read at every Easter sessions.

? Then the recognizances may be called, especially such as are A to prosecute and give evidence, that so bills may be drawn 0 and prepared.

Upon appeals to be made to the sessions against judgments f or orders, the justices shall cause any defect of form in such t original judgments or orders, to bereftified and amended, and 0 then shall proceed upon the merits.

On summons, he is bound to attend the sessions of the peace, ::l*here to return his precepts, to take the charge of the prisoners, to receive fines for the king, and the like.

No sheriff shall exercise the office of a justice of the peace, n any county wherein he is sheriff, and in such case, his acts is a justice shall be void.

Surety for the Peace#

If one who fears that the surety of the peace will be demanded against him, find sureties before any justice of the same county, either before or after a warrant is iflbed against bin, he may have a supersedeas from such justice, which shall discharge him from arrest from any other justice, at the soit of the same party, for whose security he has given fitch fnrety.

Where a person authorized by warrant of a just ice of the peace, to compel a man who is sheltered in an hoafe, to find sureties for the peace or good behaviour, is denied quietly to enter into it, he may justify breaking open the doors, is order to take him; but he must first frgnify to thofo in the house the cause of his coming, and request them to give him admittance.

If the warrant specially direct that the party AaH be brought before the justice who made it, the officer ought not to carry him before any other; but if the warrant be general, to bring him before any justice of fuchplace, the efficcn has the ele&on to bring him before what justice he pleaseth, and may cany him to prison for refuting to find surety before such justice.

If the party is carried before another justice, and not before him who issued the warrant, such other justice must take the surety, and bind him by recognizance in all points as theforn of the precept doth reauire.

If the officer arrest the party, and do not carry him before the justice to find sureties; or upon the refusal of the party, if the officer shall arrest him, and do not carry him to the gaol, in both these cases the officer is punishable by the justices for this neglect, by indictment and fine at their sessions. When the party cometh before the justice, he must offer sureties, or else the justice may commit him; for the justice needeth sot to demand surety of him*

If a man that was bound to keep the peace, hath broken his bond, the justices ought of discretion to bind him anew; bat not until he be thereof convicted by due course of law.

The recognizance, which the justice takes for the keeping of the peace, is rather of congruity, than by any exprefr authority given either by the common law, or by liatute.

The recognizance is forfeited, if the party make default of appearance, and the same default shall be recorded.

It may also be forfeited by any actual violence to the perfba of another, whether it be done by the party hiafclf, or by others through his procurement.

The justices cannot, in any case, proceed against the jwty, for a forfeiture of his recognizance, either in respect of his doc appearing, or breaking the peace; the recognizance itfdf, with the record of default of appearance, ought to be removed into so<ne of the courts at Westminster.

behaviour and for the peace; and yet the good beha- Good behaviour viour includeth the peace; and he that is bound to the good i“tludeth peace* behaviour, is therein also bound to the peace.

The surety* of the good behaviour is of great affinity with Dalt r# that of the peace, and is provided chiefly for the preservatioa of the peace; and is moll commonly granted either in the Granted in fef-open sessions, or by two or three justices out of sessions. Yet, fJon, or ^ two by the words of the commission, as also by the common opinion or more justice of the learned, one justice alone, out of sessions, may grant this surety of the good behaviour. But this is not usual, unless it be to prevent some great and sudden danger, especially a gain ft Out of session*, a man that is of any good estate, carriage, or report. And it by ooe» shall be good discretion in the justices, that they do not grant cTutioVna*1* it, but either upon sufficient cause seen to themselves, or upon jafticCt the suitor complaint of others, and the same very honest and credible persons.

A man may be bound to his good behaviour for many causes of scandal, which give him a bad same, as being contrary to good manners only; as for contorting with women of bad same; or for (peaking words of contempt of an inferior magistrate, as a just ice of the peace, or mayor, though he be not then in the actual execution of his office; or of an inferior officer of justice, as a con liable, and such like, being in the actual execution of his office.

It seems the better opinion, that no one ought to be bound to the good behaviour, for any rafti, quarrelsome, or unmannerly words, unless they either directly tend to a breach of the peace, or to scandalize the government, by a*bufing those who are intruded by it with the administration of justice, or to deter an officer from doing his duty.

The magistrate has a discretion ary power to take such surety of all those whom he shall have just cause to suspect to be dangerous, quarrelsome, or scandalous ; as of those who Geep in the day, and go abroad in the night; and of such as keep luf-picious company ; and of such as are generally suspected to be robbers, common drunkards, and the like ; and all other persons of evil same.

' In general, whatsoever act or thing is of itself a mifoeha-viour, is cause sufficient to bind such an offender to good behaviour.

But if the churchwarden or other person, who shall receive any person so sent, shall think the examination to be false, lie may carry the person so font before a justice, who, if he fee cause, may commit such person to the house of correction tin the next sessions; and the justices there, if they fee cause, may deal with such person as an incorrigible rogue ; but theperfoa so sent shall not be removed from the place to which he Is sent, but by order of two justices, in the same manner as ocher poor persons are removed to the place of their settlement-

Lunatic vagrants may be apprehended, and kept safely locked of in some secure place within the county, or precinct, as two justices shall appoint; and all charges shall be paid by the parish, township, or place, to which such person belongs, by order of two justices, directed to the churchwardens and overseers for that purpose.

If any person shall knowingly permit any rogue, vagabond, or incorrigible rogue, to lodge or take (belter in his house, bam, or other out-house or building, and shall not apprehend and carry him before a justice, or give notice to the constable so to do, and (halt be convicted thereof by confession, or oath of one witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit not exceeding 40s. nor Icfs than 10s. half to the informer, and half to the poor, by distress and sale; and if any charge shall be brought on any parish or place, by means of such offence, the same shall be answered to the said parish or place by such offender, and be levied by distress and sale of his goods as aforesaid; and if sufficient distress cannot be found, such offender shall be committed to the hoafe of correction by the justice, for any time not exceeding one month.

Where any vagrant woman shall be delivered of a child or children, and become chargeable, the churchwardens or overseers may detain such woman in their custody until they cat safely convey her to a justice, who shall examine her, and commit her to the hoofe of correction until the next sessions ; who may, if they fee convenient, order her to be publicly whipped, and detained in the house of correction for any further time not exceeding six months. And upon application by the churchwardens and overseers of the place where (he was (o delivered, the justices at such sessions shall order the treasurerto pay them such a sum, as shall be adjudged a reasonable satisfaction for the charges such place has been put to on such woman's account. And if such woman shall be detained and coo-veyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which -(he is delivered, if a bastard, shall not be settled in the place where so ' born,

born, nor be sent thither for want of other settlement, by a 17 *c* 5*

pass, by virtue of this act; but the settlement of such woman shall be deemed the settlement of such child.

And that it may appear that the overieers have done what , .

was incumbent upon them, in order to avoid such settlement, it is requisite for the justice (as he ought to do in all other cases JultKC r° m*BC wherein he afteth as judge) to make a record of the whole ceedinii. proceedings before him ; which record (as it seemeth) will be the proper evidence in such case, if the settlement shall afterwards be contested.

If any constable, or other officer, shall be defective in his duty, in any case for which no punishment is herein before Negligent con-particularly provided ; or if any person shall hinder the execution of this act, and shall be thereof convicted, on oath of puQ* one witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit not exceeding 5I. nor under 10s. to the poor by distress; and, if sufficient distress cannot be found, shall be committed to the house of correction to be kept to hard labour, not exceeding two months.

Any person aggrieved by the act of any justice out of sessions, W. in or concerning the execution of this act, may appeal to the appeal,

next general or quarter-sessions of the county, riding, liberty, or division, giving reasonable notice thereof; whose order thereupon shall be final.

This act, after a recital of 6 G.

Any of his Majesty's judges at the assizes, and the justices, at the general or quarter-sessions, or any justice of the peace, is and are hereby impowered to order, whenever he or they shall think proper, any convict, upon his discharge from prison, to be conveyed by pass under hand and seal, in manner and form directed by the ad 17 <7. 2. c. 5. and according to the provifxons therein contained ; and the judge, justices, or justice aforesaid, is or are also empowered to convey by pass any person who shall be acquitted at the affixes, or general or quarter-sessions, or discharged by proclamation or otherwise, who shall of himself or herself, or by any other person in his or her behalf, apply to the court whereat he or she has beta acquitted or discharged, or to any justice of the peace, so be conveyed as aforesaid; and the judge, justices, or justice aforesaid, shall certify in such pass that the person so conveyed was discharged from prison, or a person acquitted, or otherwise discharged, at the assizes or sessions, as the case may be; and such convict, or person acquitted or discharged, shall pay no fee whatever for such pass.

The present mode of conveying vagrants in the costody of a constable being frequently inefficient, from the miscondoct and negligence of constables, the justices of the peace, at the general or quarter-sessions held for any county, riding, city, borough, town corporate, division, or liberty, or any adjournment thereof, shall be empowered to make an order that all rogues and vagabonds apprehended in their respective counties, ridings, cities, Sec. and who are ordered to be conveyed by pass, shall be conveyed by the mailer of the house of correction or his servants, or by a constable, as such justices at thegeneialor quarter-sessions, or any adjournment thereof, shall think proper; and such justices shall also be empowered to make an order, if they think proper, that all constable* to whom rogues or vagabonds brought from another county, riding, city.

Warrant.

IF a justice fee a felony or other breach of the peace committed in his presence, he may, in his own person, appre-, bend the felon; and so he may by word command any person to apprehend him, and such command is a good warrant without writing; but if the same be dohe in his absence, then he most issue his warrant in writing.

There seems to be no doubt, but that a warrant may be lawfully granted by any justice, for treason, felony, or praemunire, or any other offence against the peace: Also it seems clear, that wherever a statute gives to any one justice a jurisdiction over any offence, or a power to require any person to do a certain thing ordained by such statute, it by implication gives a power to every such justice to make out a warrant to bring before him any person accused of such offence, or compellable to do the thing ordained by such statute; for it cannot but be intended, that a statute giving a person jurisdiction over an offence, doth mean also to give him the power incident to all courts of compelling the parry to come before him.

But in cases where the king b no party, or where no corporal punishment is appointed, as in cases for servants* wages, and the like, it seemeth that a summons is the more proper process ; and for default of appearance, the justice may proceed ; and fb indeed oftentimes it is directed by special statutes.

It is convenient, though not always necessary, that the party who demands the warrant be first examined on oath, touching

the whole matter whereupon the warrant is demanded, and

that examination put in writing.

Or at lead it is safe to bind him over to give evidence; left afterwards when the offender shall be apprehended, or shall forrender himself, the party that procured the warrant be

gone.

A justice hath power to issue a warrant to apprehend a person suspected of felony. For the justices are judges of the lfUfc*iony* reasonableness of the suspicion, and when they have examined the party accusing, touching the reasons of his suspicion, if they find the causes of suspicion to be reasonable, it is now become the justices* suspicion as well as his.

Yet insomuch as justices claim this power rather connivance, than any express warrant of law, and since the undue execution of it may prove so highly prejudicial to the reputation as well as the liberty of the party, a justice cannot well be too tender in his proceedings of this kind, and seems to be punishable not only at the suit of the king, bat also of the party grieved, if he grant any such warrant, without such probable cause as might induce a candid and impartial man to fnspect the party to be guilty.

It is safe, but perhaps not necessary, in the body of the warrant to shew the place where it was made; yet it leems necessary to set forth the county, in the margin at least, if it be not set forth in the body.

It may be directed to the sheriff, bailiff, constable, or to any indifferent person by name who is no officer; for the justice may authorize any one to be his officer, whom he pleases to make such ; yet it is most adviseable to direct it to the constable of the precinct wherein it is to be executed, for that no other constable, and a fortion no private person is compellable to serve it.

In the case of an act of parliament, if the act directeth that a joftice shall grant a warrant, and doth not say to whom it shall be directed, by consequence of law it must be directed to the constable, and it cannot be directed to the sheriff, unless such power is given in the ad.

The warrant, especially if it be for the peace or good behaviour, or the like, where fureries are to be found or required, ought to contain the special cause and matter where-Warrjnt to con- upon it is granted, to the intent the party upon whom it is to uin the Jpeoitl ^ served may provide his furedes, and take them with him to the justice to be bound for him; bat if the warrant be for treason, murder, or felony, or other capital offence, the warrant of the justice may be to bring the party before him, to make answer to such things or matters generally, as shall be objected against him on the king's behalf.

The warrant may issue to bring the party before the joftice who granted the warrant Jpec tally, and then the officer is bound to bring him before justice; but if the warrant

be to bring him before any justice, then it is in the election of the officer to bring him before what justice of the county he (the officer) thinks fit, and not in the election of the prisoner.

Finally, it ought to be under the hand and seal of the justice who makes it ont.

If any person, against whom a warrant shall be issued, shall escape out of the jurisdiction of the justice granting the warrant; any justice for the county or place, where such person shall so escape or be, upon proof on oath of the hand-writing of the justice granting such warrant, shall indorse his name thereon; which shall be a sufficient authority to the person bringing such warrant, and to all other persons to whom the same was originally directed, to execute the same in such other county or place; and to carry the offender before the justice who indorsed the warrant, or some other justice or justices of that county, if the offence be bailable, and the offender be ready to give bail for his appearance at the next assizes or sessions for the county or place where the offence was committed; and such justice or justices shall take bail accordingly, and shall deliver the recognisance together with the examination or confession of the offender, and all other proceedings relating thereto, to the constable or other person, who shall (on pain of 10I. to him who shall foe) deliver over the same to the clerk of assize, or clerk of the peace, where the offender is required to appear. And if the offence is not bailable, or he shall not rive bail to the satisfaction of the justice before whom he is Drought, the constable or other person shall carry the offender before a justice of the proper county or place where the offence was committed, there to be dealt with according to law*

The form of which Indorsement may be thus:

And the justice may further order (if he thinks fit) the party, according as he shall appear bailable or not bailable upon the face of the warrant, to be brought before himself or some other justice or justices of that county, or to be carried back into the county from whence the warrant did issue.

Weights and Measures,

A STANDARD of weights and measures is to be kept in market towns, at which balance all the inhabitants my freely weigh without paying any thing; and joftices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and Howards of franchises, may a. quire of offenders against this ordinance, and do execution of them that be found faulty.

The mayors, and other head officers in market towns, shall twice a year, or oftner, cause all weights and measures within the same to be brought before them, and examined; and such as they find defective, to be broken and bnrnt; and the offender shall forfeit to the maydr or other officer, for the M time, 6s. 8d. for the second time, 13s. 4d. and for the third time, zos. and be set on the pillory.

No merchant, or other person or persons within any city or market town, shall buy or fell with any weight ormeafnrt, except it be marked and signed, as directed by this act; any other perform or persons, out of the said , boroughs, tod market towns, except it be like and equal with the said iftandard.

Two justices (1 have authority, as well by examination as by enquiry, to hear and determine the defaults of the said mayors, bailiffs, or other head officers, in that behalf; and also of all buyers and fellers doing contrary to this present act and ordinance, and to set fines and amerciaments upon the offenders by their discretion ; and the said weights andmei. sures so found defective, to be forfeited and burnt.

By this act, there shall be but one weight, one meafore, and one yard, according to the'standard of the exchequer, throughout all the realm, as *well in places privileged us wtknt. And whosoever shall fell by or keep any other weight, measure, or yard, than as aforesaid, whereby any corn, grain, or other thing is bought or sold, shall forfeit, for every such offence, 5 s. on conviction before one justice, or mayor, on oath of one y/itness; to be levied by the churchwardens and overseen, or

VOLUNTARILY ESTABLISHED,

THE FOLLOWING

WORK,

August, 1783.

---

A LARGE imprdfion of this work having been already dispersed, under the recommendation of a very respectable Name*, the p.efent edition needed not to have fought for other patronage or protection: But the object of the following compilation being to facilitate a due administration of the laws, it fecms to solicit, with peculiar propriety, tire favour of that honourable Society, to which it is inscribed; the Members of which are seen Handing forth in a cause, which demands the utmost vigilance which they can employ; the utmost activity which they an exert; and the bell information which they can obtain.

Their endeavours, it is hoped, will be crowned with such success, as will prove highly satisfactory to the Royal Personage, whose good intentions they are labouring to accomplish; and eminently conducive to the general welfare.

The leading chandler of the Society is — to assist the Magistrate in his duty; and the following pages,

Bamber Gascoyne, Esq; one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the county of Essex, Recemr-General of the Cuttoros, See.

it

[ vi ]

it is apprehended, will point out, in the readiest manner, HOW that assistance may be moll effefrtu-ally applied.

As the Editor has never heard that any of his Brother-Magistrates, who have milled to its direction, have been milled in any material inllance by mif-quotations, or omissions, in the former edition of this work, he hopes they will have still-Iefs to fear from the present publication; which is more full and correct than the former, and includes the statutes of the latest date, even to the present day.

The retirement of the late Chief Justice of the King's-Bench from the office which he filled with such distinguished honour to himself, and with such benefit to his country, docs not render the Magistrate's situation at all more precarious than heretofore. The candour, liberality, and benevolence of his successor, will afford to every well-deligning Justice of the Peace all the protection he can reasonably delire — while in every case, in which the mala mens is discovered, it will be reprobated with all authority, and meet with the treatment which it deserves.

It is with great Satisfaction, that the Editor looks forward to an event, which (in consequence of a resolution lately adopted by the Society) is about to

add

[ vn ]

add many truly honourable names to the number of ailing Magistrates within these great cities of London and West minder, and their environs; where theservices of the most pure, disinterested, and active Magistrates in the kingdom are wanted, almost every hour: If such of the Members of this respec-table Society, in particular, as now resolve to take upon them this office, shall derive the smallest assistance from the following work, the Editor will have reason to rejoice, that he has found time; amongst other important engagements, to accomplish it at any rate. And he will esteem .himself very highly indebted to any of those numerous Magistrates, who are better informed, and have had more experience than himself, if they will candidly point out any material errors, the correction whereof may render this book more perfect, and of more general utility to his brethren in the commission of the peace.

TO THE

READER.

THE high Estimation in which Dr. Burns Work, entitled, The Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, has long been deservedly holder encourages the Editor of the following fleets to hope, that another fracture raised, with a similar design, on so solid a foundation, though to a much left elevated height, will not he deemed unworthy of the public notice. It claims very little merit, but what is derived from a new arrangement of that useful information, for which this country is so much indebted to the labours of the eminent Compiler already mentioned.

Its merit, if it has any, chiefly consists in pointing out more immediately to the eye of the Magistrate, who may be supposed to have many other engagements on his hands, that line of conduit, which, in almost every emergency, it is his duty to pursue. The authorities, as well from the common, as the statute law, are indeed

[ X ]

less numirms than in many other booh of this kind; yet it is hoped, that they are f ifificiently copious for direction bow to proceed in every ordinary case, which may occur: The statutes, as to every thing material, are faithfully recited: and though feme technical expressms, not oj the efface of the law, may, fir brevity's fake, be omitted, the Editor falters himself, that what remains will be abundantly fuss,dent to guard the person who tonfults them from any error in his decision. Adjudged cases, for the confirmation of his judgment, may be found at large in many very judicious coiled ions of this fort The work of Lord Dudley and Ward, and T. Cunningham, Esq-, entitled, The Law of a Justice of Peace and Parish Officer, (tfc. is a mofi valuable collodion of information on this subject. And the Magis-irate will find it prudent to have finch useful books of reference as that compilation, and also Dr. Burn's Justice of the Peace, always at his band. But with all tlcfe at Ids comm and, be r.evertbelefs fiands in need of Jbne more obvious direction, -when he is wishing to dif-patch the bufness which prefenls ifelf, with expedition, fafeiy, and satisfaction to himjelf and others.

It is well known, that several compilations of a fmi-lar nature with this have ken heretofore offered to the public, under a great variety of titles and descriptions: a id there is no doubt, that the Magiflr'ate has derived

[ xi ]

no inconsiderable advantage, from the lights communicated to him by such publications: and — valeant quantum valere poffint — is our fmcere desire: we by no means wish to raise the reputation of the following work, by depreciating the merits of any other. The reader is left at fail liberty (and this liberty he certainly would take, whether we indulged him with it or not) to call to his affiance those productions, which he thinks mjl likely to direit, secure, and satisfy him in the discharge of his duty.

In the mean time, when a matter of doubt and difficulty is before him (and such he must expel! will feme-times occur) he will be happy to avail himself of that liberal sentiment of One of the most illustrious ornaments of this or any other nation: “ Where the Magistrate appears to have been misguided by an erroneous judgment, without any purpose of doing ill', GOD forbid., (fays this venerable Personage*) that the courts of law should not give him credit fat the purity of his intention; and put the mofe favourable conjlruHtoh on his conduit, that the case can pofftbly admit of.”

This is, in substance, the declaration, which, coming from such respeliable authority, has doubtless encouraged many to engage in the useful employment of a Justice of the Peace, who would otherwise have been very cautious

' The late Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench,

b 2 of

[ ™ 3

of expofng themselves to the difagfeeabU canfequences of a faux pas in interpreting the laws. IThe htdulgenee here given, emboldens those, who are disposed to all, under the directions of an honest intention, and a plain underfunding, freely, to exercise their left judgment j no longer apprehenfvc, that the want if form, or the emission of some legal punHilio, may bring them within the reach of the censures of a superior court.

It is not however inf mated, that indifference or wilful negligence is at any rate excuseabk in interpreting cr enforcing a plain and pofttive fatute: on the contrary, frequent occafms will offer themselves, wherein it is impffble to he too minutely precise; because in such cases, every advantage will ajfurcdly be taken of any want cf accuracy, cr of the fnallef inattention to the letter of the law. As a proof of this, and to convince the jllagifrate of the necessity of extreme carefulness in his duty, it may not be amiss to observe, that Dr. Bufr\ enumerates not less than twenty inflames, in which an Order of Removal has been, or is liable to be, quajhei, on account of some apparently infgnificant error in the mere matter of form. AH, therefore, which is intended by the encouragement hohlen forth, as above, is to remove from the mind of a well-meaning, but timorous AIagijlrate, the apprehenfm of something more, perhapsj

[ »u 3

baps, than.jtafime, for. an . involuntary error., in his conduitbut no licence is hereby given him to trifle with the obvious directions of a statute, or to adopt a latitude of interpretation, which is neither fqfie nor warrantable.

It was certainly an 'injidnce' of equal candour and wisdom to encourage, as much as possible, those persons to Jlep forward, who, though their rani'and situation in life as well as their liberal education marked them as mofl proper for this office, had yet been found too generally averse from engaging in it. We will not allow ourselves to impute this backward jiefs to a mere love of dissipation, or a mere difike to business. We are willing to think, that there are very few individuals of the above description, in point of rank, fortuneand education, who would not feel great satisfaction in finding themselves so materially serviceable to their country, in the discharge of an office so important to the suppression of vice, and to the advancement and security of the public welfare: we have seen them cheerfully foregoing the comfor(s of domestic life^ and readily withdrawing their attention from their private concerns, in order to devote their time, and feme, even their health and fortune, to the necessary duties of a military life: Whence is it then that so few have been found equally ready to dedicate feme portion of their Icifure-haurs to

the

[ xiv ]

the prefieruation of public peace, and to the maintenance of good order and decency among their neighbours ?' It could only have arifien from the apprehension of feme more than ordinary objlacles and impediments: They miift surely have been deterred by the consideration, that, in order to attain to a competent knowledge of the duties of a magistrate, a tedious, thorny path was to be purfiued-, where no small Share of difficulties would meet them by the way, and after all their labour, no inconsiderable danger of mificarrying would be incurred, even under the left information, which, till of late years, they were able to procure.

It has been our happier lot, to find these objections in a great measure removed: We have seen, what light has been thrown on the Jludy of the municipal and statute laws, by the ingenious, elegant, and learned commentaries of that accomplished writer. Sir William Blackstone : And we have good reason to hope, that the chair of magistracy will in future more easily be filled by perfims of confiequence and refipcilalility, well qualified for this useful department in ficiety; when we refieli, that the Jludy of the common law makes at this time a very confide-ralle part of academical education.

But if no finch advantages as thefie fiubfified, the excellent work of Dr. Burn would alone be fiufificient

to

t xv 3

Jo remove the principal discouragements, which formerly deterred such, as were not inured to the habits of close enquiry, and toilsome researches. Since that wort has been so universally received\ and so jujlly admired and approved., the Justice of the Peace has seldom been at a loss for necessary information in almost every pojftble case: And perhaps the only apology which can be offered for hazarding the following attempt, when a work, so deservedly e/leemed, is in almost every handy is this: That the four volumes of Dr. Burn, (though no Magistrate ought to be without them, as books of reference) comprize much more, than it is necessary for a Justice of the Peace to invejligate, in the ordinary duties of his office: From these, undoubtedly, much satisfactory information may be derived on subjects of no inconsiderable importance, though not immediately connected with the duties of a magistrate.

If the following work shall be found in any degree to facilitate the administration of justice, by more ob-viously exhibiting all that is written in the law on every common subject, the Editor flatters himfef he shall have rendered no inconsiderable service to his brethren in the commijfmr, and will think his labours amply recompensed by their favourable acceptance of his befl endeavours.

Accessary.

ACCESSARY is one that A..concerned in the felony by commandment, aid, or receipt.

In high treason, there are no accessaries, either before 1 Halt's Hip. or after; for all are principals. — In cases that are criminal, br,. but not capital, such as petty larceny, trespass, &c. there are

no acceflaries_But as to felonies by act of parliament, those

that coonfel or command the offence, are accessaries before; and those that knowingly receive the offender, are accessaries after.

The buyer or receiver of stolen lead, iron, copper, brass, 29 G. 2. c. 30. bell-metal, or folder, 'knowing them to be stolen, may be convicted, although the principal hath not been convicted; and shall be transported for fourteen years.

Every person, who shall buy or receive any stolen jewel or 10 C. 3. c. 48. jewels, or. any stolen gold of hiver plate, watch. or watches, knowing the lame to have been stolen, accompanied with a burglary actually committed in Healing the same, or to have been feloniously taken by a robbery on the highway, shall be triable, as well before conviction of the principal felon, whether he be in or out of custody, as after his conviction: and if such person, so buying or receiving, shall be convicted thereof, he shall beguilty of felony, and transported for 14 years.

Affray.

AN affray is a public offence to the tenor of the king's ful-, jells i so called, because it affrigbteth and maketh men afraid.

From whence it seems clearly to follow, that there may be an assault, which will not amount to an affray.

Anyone who fees others fighting, may lawfully part them, 1 thw. j;6. and also flay them till the heat be over, and then deliver them to the constable to be carried before a justice, to find sureties

I for the peace.

A constable is bound at his peril to use his belt endeavours 1 Haw. 137. to part an affray; and to demand the assistance of others, which if they refuse to give him, they are punishable with line and imprisonment. — And he may either carry the offender before a justice, to find sureties for the peace, or he may imprison him of his own authority for a reasonable time, till the heat be over, and also afterwards detain him till he And such surety by obligation. — But a constable hath no power to *

Affray.

arreit a man for an affray done oat of his own view, without a warrant from a justice, unless a felony were done, or likely to be done; for it is the proper bulinefsof a con liable to pre-ferre the peace, and not to punish the breach of it. i Haw. 13-. A justice of the peace cannot without a warrant authorize the

arrest of any person for an affray out of his own view; yet he may make his warrant to bring the offender before him, in order to compel him to find sureties for the peace.

~ All affrays in general are punishable by fine and impri-5'" fonment.

i. If the arrest is by virtue of a warrant to bring the party be- £ fore the justice who granted the warrant speciallj, then the of- ? ficer is bound to bring him before, the same justice; but if the warrant be to bring him before any justice of the county, then it is in the election, of the officer, to bring him before what justice he thinks fit, and not in the election of the prisoner. rse.

Bail.

ESe's, PI. 95. T? AIL Cgnifies the delivery of a man out of custody, upon I -D the undertaking of one or mote persons for him, that he shall appear at a day limited, to answer and be jollified by the I law. — The difference between bail and mainprise is, that main. I pernors are only surety, but bail is a custody. J

Sale's, Pi- 9S. If a person be brought before a justice, if it appears that no felony is committed, he may discharge him; but if a felony tj be committed, tho* it appears not that the party accused is $ guilty, yet he cannot discharge him, but mult commit or bail him. - ‘ -i

z i.-f. t:5. In case of homicide, the offender is not bailable.

If a person has dangeronlly wounded another, the justice ft ought to be very cautious how he takes bail, dll the year and |j day be pall. |

No distinSion Teems here to be made respecting bail, be- !§ tween such homicide as is malicious, and that which happens! j by misadventure or in self-defence. . 1

Any two justices (1 5J.) may of common right-bail persons \

indiftedatthe sessions. !

1 SzP.SM. If a person be arrested for manjlaugbter, or felony, or fufpiem I !3- thereof, being bailable by law, he shall not be let to bailor j

mainprise by any justices, but in open, sessions, except it be by j two justices at the least (1 Q^) and the same to be present together at the dme of the said bailment.

And the said justices, or one of them, being of the.quprum, shall take theexamination of the Taiiprisoner, and information ! of them that bring, him, and the same, or as much thereof as ' shall be material to prove the felony, shall be put in-writing before they make- the bailment: — Which examination, together with the bailment, the said .justices shall certify at tht next general gaol delivery to be bolden within thelimits ol their commif&on. : -

And the said justices shall have power, to.bind all such. by. recognizance as do declare any thing material to prove the offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery to give evidence against the party on his trial. — And shall,.certify tht same in like manner.

In London, Middlesex, and in other cities and towns corpo-j rate, justices may let prisoners to bail, as they might before this act; but when they do bail, they are to take and certify the bail and examination as is here directed. ttr.^/.a.r.a. Bv the declaration of righes, exceCve bail ought not to be required. i

zihzj.az. To refuse bail, where the party ought to be bailed, isafflif-i demeanor punishable by indictment.

Admitting

Banks destroying. 17

Admitting bail, where it ought not, is punishable by the H. P. 97. judges of assize by fine; or punishable as a negligent escape at common law.

Altho' the conltablcby his own authority, without any war- Bum. V. I. p. rant of commitment, may carry offenders to gaol, yet, since »5J* the institution of the office of justices of the peace, it is better that they be carried before a justice, to be sent by him to gaol by warrant of commitment.

The warrant of commitment ought to set forth the cause efpc- Id. daily; thatistofay, not for treason, or felony in general, but treason for counterfeiting the king's coin, or felony forJlealing the goods of such a one to such a 'value, and the like; that the court may judge whether the offence is such, for which a prisoner ought to be admitted to bail.

Banks destroying.

IF any personshall unlawfully and maliciously break down or $ g. z. <. 37.

cut down the bank of any river or sea bank, whereby any lands shal) be overflowed or damaged, he shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

And if any person shall remove any materials, driven into to G. a. c. 31 the ground, and used for the securing any marsh or sea-walls, or hanks, on complaint or information thereof made upon oath to any justice redding near the place, such justice shall summon the party complained of, or shall issue his warrant to apprehend and bring such person before him; and upon his appearance, or neglect to appear, he shall proceed to examine the fast, and upon due proof thereof made either by confession, or oath of one witness, shall convict the offender; who shall thereupon forfeit 20I. half to the informer, and half to the overseer for the use of the poor, to be levied by distress and sale: for want ofsufficientdiftrefs, to be committed to thehouse of correction, to be kept to hard labour for six months.

Bankrupt.

Certiorari.

A CERTIORARI is an original writ, issuing out of the court of chancery, or the king's bench, directed in the king's name to the judges or officers of inferior courts, commandingthem to certify, or to return the records of a cause depending before them, to the end the party may have the more fare and speedy justice, before the king or such justices as he shall assign to determine the cause.

The justices of the peace may deliver or fend into the king's bench, indictments found before them, or recognizances of the peace taken before them, or force recorded by them, without any certiorari.

A certiorari lies in all judicial proceedings, in which a writ of error does not lie; and it is aconsequence of all inferior jurisdictions erected by act of parliament to have their proceedings returnable in the king's bench.

And therefore a certiorari lies to justices of the peace, even in such cases which they, are impowered by llarutc finally to hear and determine.

If a certiorari for the removal of an indictment before justices of the peace be not delivered, before the jury be sworn for the trial of it, the justices may proceed.

No certiorari shall be granted, to remove any convidlioa, judgment, &c. unless it is applied for in six calendar months, and six days notice are given to the justices, to Ihevv cause, if they think fit, against issuing the certiorari.

If a ftperfedeas come out of a superior court, to the justices, they ought to surcease, altho' the fuptrfeitas be awarded again!! iaw; for they are not to dispute the command of a superior icouri, which is a warrant to them.

1 F.very return of a certiorari ought to be under seal. — And liitho' the ctiflot rmtihrum keep the records, yet mult the justices to whom it is dirqiled, return the certiorari; and therefore if lit it directed to the justices of the peace, and the clerk of the peace only return it, nothing is thereby removed.

9 A return was in paper (andnot upon parchment); and for that reason was held by the court not good.

I Upon a certiorari to remove an indictment of a riot, orforci-|b!e entry, or the like, the return mull have tnefe words, as 9rip to hear and determine divers felonies, &c. according to the Scommission; for if the return mentions only that they are juf-itices of the peace, without such words, the return is infuffi-iciant, l'or

All persons obtaining goods, money, or merchandize, by false pretences, shall be deemed offenders again!! the law, and the public peace; and the court, before whom any such offender shall be tried, shall, on conviction, order them to be put in the pillory, or publickly whipped, or to be transported, as icon as conveniently may be, for seven years. — And if the party, charged as being the offender, shall be committed to prison, or admitted to bail, to answer the matters complained of at the next ledlnns or assizes, the judice shall bind over the profacutor to appear and prosecute such offender with cd'etlj and if such goads, so fraudulently obtained, appear to such juf-tree to exceed the value of 20I. the recognizance shall be in not less than double the value of the goods.

or any merchandize; on pain of treble value, half to the king, and half to him that shall sue: and the contract shall be void.

Benefit of Clergy.

ANCIENTLY princes and Hates, converted to C'hrlftia-nity, did grant to the clergy very bountiful privileges and exemptions; and particularly, an exemption of their persons from criminal proceedings, in some capital cases before secular judges; which wasthe true original of the benefit of clergy. — But this claim of exemption grew so burdensome, that it was from time to time qualified and abridged by the civil power; and therefore, if they were indicted in cases criminal, but not capital, nor wherein they were to lose life or limb, there the privilege of clergy was not allowed; and therefore not in indictments of trespass or petit larceny. — Alfoit was not allowed them in high treason.

If the statute enacts generally, that it shall be felony without i If. ir. -jj, benefit of clergy, or that he shall suffer as in case of felony . without benefit of clergy, this excludes it in all circumstances, and to all intents.

When any person shall be convicted of any felony within the >9 G. j. c. 74. benefit of clergy, for which he shall be liable to be burned in the hand, the court may, if they think fit, inltcad thereof! impose upon the offender a moderate pecuniary fine; or other, wife, instead of such burning, in any of the cases aforesaid, except manslaughter, may order the offender to be once oroft-ner, but not more than thrice, either publickly or privately whipped, such private whipping to be in the presence of not less than two persons, besides the offender and the officer who inflicts the same; and in case of female offenders, in the presence of females only. — Provided, that this shall not extend to deprive the court of the power now vested in them, of detaining such offender in prison for any time not exceeding one year, or of committing him to the house of correction or other public workhouse, to be kept to hard labour for any time not less than six months, nor exceeding two years.

A person admitted to his clergy, forfeits all his goods that he s Um jj. .33, hath at the time of the conviction. — But presently upon his j burning in the hand, he ought to be reltored to the possession I of his lands, and from thenceforth to enjoy the profits thereof.

H And it is holden, that after a man is admitted to his clergy, 1 ,JW !5J' 1 itis actionable to call him'felon; becaufehis offence being par-8 doned by the statute, all the infamy and other consequences of 9 it are discharged. 1

Where a statute appoints imprisonment, without limiting Dolt. e. 170. the time, the prisoner mult remain at the discretion of the court.

It mult be under seal; and without this, the commitment is iJ/. J/. 5S3. unlawful.

But this mud not be intended of a commitment by the lef- 1H, II. 584. fions, or other court of record; for there the record itself, or the memorial thereof, which may at any time be entered of record, is a sufficient warrant, without any warrant under

seal.

It should also set forth the place at which it is made, that it . Him. 119; may appear to be within the jurisdiction ok the justice.

It mull also have a certain date, of the year and day. z H. II. 113.

Every person who shall be committed to the common or usual 3 J- ,0-gaol, by any justice of the peace, the said person having means or ability thereunto, shall bear his own reasonable charges, and the charges also of such as shall be appointed to guard him to such gaol: and if any such person shall refuse to defray the said charges, then such justice shall, by writing under his hand and seal, give warrant to the constable of the hundred, or constable of the township where such person shall be dwelling and inhabit, to fell such and so much of the goods and chattels of the said person so to be committed, as by the discretion of the said justice shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy i and pay the charges of such'his conveying and fending to the said gaol; the appraisement to be made by fourof thehouell inhabitants of the parish where such goods shall be; the overplus to be delivered to the party.

When any person, not having goods or money in the county zjC.z. 3. where he is taken, sufficient to bear the charges of himselfand of those who convey him, is committed to gaol, or to the house of correction, by warrant (rom a justice, then on application, by the constable or other officer who conveyed him, to any justice for such county or place, such justice shall upon oath examine into and ascertain the reasonable expences, and shall without fee by his warrant order the treasurer to pay the same. But in Middlesex, the same shall be paid by the over-fters of the poor of the parish where the person was apprehended.

Constable.

In which case, a summons may be diiedted to several inhabi. tants of the parish to appear before the justice for him to make choice of one of them to take the oath, Sec.

The petty constable ought to be chosen in the leet; and the high constable (properly so called) in the torn, which is the general leet of the wholehnndred.

They are to be [worn and placed in their office by the lord or his steward, or by the sheriff respectively, as being judge of the court.

But now the usual manner is, that the high constables of hundreds be chosen either at the lessions, or by the greater number of the justices of the division.

And every petty constable, being a principal peace officer, and it being necessary for the preservation of the peace, that every vill should be furnished with one; the justices of the peace have, ever since the institution of their office, taken : upon them, as conservators of the peace, not only to swear the i petty constables that have been chosen at a torn or leet, but also to nominate and swear those, who have not been chosen at any such court, on the neglect of the sheriffs or lords to hold their court, or to take care that such officers are appointed in them. And this power of justices of the peace having been ; confirmed by the uninterrupted usage of many ages, shall not now be disputed, but shall be presumed to be established upon sufficient authority.

Justices of the peace had power to nominate and swear constables, on the default of the torn or leet, before the statute of 13 13 14. C. 2. c. iz. Ifa constable shall die, orgoout of the parish, any two justices may make and swear a new one'till the lord shall hold a leet, or 'till the next quarter sessions, who shall approve of the officer so made and sworn, or appoint another; and if any officer shall continue above a year in hit office, the justices in their quarter sessions may discharge him, and pu: in another, 'till the lord shall hold a court.

If constables lawfully chosen refusetobe sworn, a justice of the peace may bind them over to the affizesor sessions, thereto be indifled.

_ High cor.ftsbles are to take the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, as other persons who qualify for offices; but petty constables are exempted.

Every high and petty constable is by the common law con-fervator of the peace; and therefore if any man shall make an affray or break the peace, the constable may commit him to the jiocks or other safe custody for the present, and afterwards may carry him before a justice or to gaol, until he shall find furcty fur the peace.

Bn: he cannot require surety of the peace, unless the offencs be upon his own view; for he cannot take a man's oath, because he is no: a judge of record.

The

Constable. 5.5

The constable is a proper officer to'a justice of the peace; 2Hnv.z6x. and bound to execute his warrants; and therefore it hath been resolved, that where a statute authorizes a justice of the peace to convict a man of a crime, and to levy the penalty by warrant of distress, without saying to whom such warrant shall be directed, or by whom it shall be executed, the constable is the proper officer to serve such warrant, and indiftable for difo-: beying it. 1 :

" No action shall be brought against any constable, or other person acting by his order, and in his aid, for any thing done in obedience to the warrant of a justice of the peace, until demand hath been made by the party, or his attorney, in writing, signed by the party demanding the same, of the perusal and copy of such warrant, and the same hath been refused or neglected for six days after such demand; and if such action be brought jointly against the justice and constable, on proof of such warrant, the jury shall find for the constable; andifthe verdict be given against the justice, the plaintiff shall receive his cods against him, to be taxed in such manner by the proper officer, as to include such costs as the plaintiff is liable to pay to such defendant, for whom such verdict shall be found as aforesaid.

The constable ought not to return the warrant to the justice, but to keep it for his own justification; but he mud certify to' the justice whathe hath done in the execution thereof.

The constable executing a justice's warrant, forlevyihga 27C.1. penalty, or other sum of money directed by an act of parliament! by distress, may deduct his own,reasonable charges of taking, keeping, and felling the goods distrained; returning the overplus on demand, after such penalty or sum of money

and charges deducted.--- See Commitment.

Every constable or other such officer shall every three months, «S C. 3. r. 19. and within 14 days after he shall go out of his office, deliver to the overseers a just account in writing, fairly entered in a I book to be kepe for that purpose, and signed by him, of all sums by him expended on account of the said parish, town-ship, or place, in all cases not hitherto provided for by law, and also of all sums received by him on the account of the said parish, township, or place; and the overseers shall, within the next 14 days after the account shall be so delivered, lay the same before the inhabitants, and if approved by the majority of them, the overseers shall pay out of the poor rate such sum as shall appear to be due on the said account- But if the account, or any part thereof, shall be disallowed, the overseers shall deliver back to the constable, or other officer, such book of accounts; who may then produce the said book to a justice, giving reasonable notice thereof to the overseer; which justice shall examine the same, and hear and determine any objection that shall be made to the account.

Constable. I

and settle the sum which shall appear to him to be due, and I enter the same in the account, and Cgn his name thereto; and the overseers shall pay the same accordingly. — Provided, that E if the orerfeer shall find that the parish, cownship, or place is Ej aggrieved by any thing done or omitted by the said constable, (§ or other officer, or by the justice, he may, giving reasonable notice to the said justice, constable, or other officer, appeal to the next general or quarter-sessions. — And the justices in sessions may from time to time lay down or alter such rules and re. gulations as to any costs or charges to be allowed to any person by virtue of this act, as to them shall seem just; which rales and regulations haring received the approbation and fig. j nature of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding, and not otherwise, on all persons whatsoever.

The highconstables shall, at the general or quarter-sessions, if thereunto required, account for the general county rate by : them received, on pain of being committed to gaol until they i shall account; and all their accounts and vouchers shall, after having been passed at the said sessions, be deposited with the clerk of the peace, to be kept amongst the records, and in spefted by any justice without fee.

If there shall be cause to remove and put an high constable from his place, it shall be done by the greater part of the juf. dees of that dirifion, or at the sessions.

The justices of the peace have also used, for good cause, to displace all such constables, as have been chosen and sworn by them.

Conviction.

WHERE a special power is given to a justice of the peace by act of parliament to convict an offender in a summary manner, without a trial by jury, it mull appear that he hath strictly pursued that power; otherwise the common la* will break in upon him, and level all his proceedings. Therefore he mull proceed according to the conrfe of common law in trials by juries, and confiaer himself only as constituted in the place both of judge and jury. There mud be an information orcharge against aperson; thenhemuftbesummoned, orhave notice of such charge, and have an opportunity to make his defence; and the evidence against him must be such as the common law approves of, unless the fiatuie specially directeth otherwise; then, if the person be found guilty, there must be a conviction, judgment, and execution, all according to the course of the common law, directed and influenced by the special authority given by statute; and in the conclusion, there must be a record of the whole proceedings, wherein the

Conviction.

justice most set forth the particular manner and circumstances; so that, if he shall be called to account by any superior court, it may appear that he hath conformed to the law, and not exceeded the bounds prescribed to his jurisdiction.

Corn.

HpO buy or fell corn in the Ihcaf, before it is threlhed 3/077.197.

j. and measured, is against the common law of England.

In the measure of corn, the cultom of the place is to be ob- Earl. 5784 served, if it be a cultom beyond all memory, and used without any visible interruption.

livery person, who shall unlawfully cut or take away any corn 43 £/. r. 7 or grain growing, being convicted thereof by confession, or oath of one witness, before onejustice, shall for the first offence pay such damages as the justice shall appoint; and if the justice shall think him not able or sufficient, or if he do not pay such damages, he shall commit him to the constable where the offence is committed, or where the the party is apprehended, there to be whipped; and for every other offence lie shall in like manner be whipped. The constable refusing, shall bd committed by the justice, till he conform.

The inspector of the returns of corn shall demand of every at <? 1-c-cornfactor, in the Corn-Exchange, in Mark-lane, a weekly return of the several quantities of corn or grain by him bona fide fold and delivered in such week, as also the name or names of the purchaser or pnrehafers thereof, which return shall be ligned by each cornfactor delivering the same, and a transcript of such account shall be published in the London Gazette weekly; which shall be deemed to have been the average prices, during each respective week, in Kent, Essex, and London.

The weekly returns taken by the inspector, shall be filed, and dcuofited in his office. The inspector shall compute the aggregate quantity of each sort of grain, and the average prices thereof, which shall be fold previous to the sessions for London, in April 1782; and so on from session to feffiun; which account he shall transcribe into a book; and deliver, on the first day of the said sessions, (and afterwards on the first day of each quarter session,) in open court, to the lord mayor, aldermen, julliccs of the peace for the city of London. The duties on-importation of foreign grain shall be regulated by the said ave. rage prices. The cornfactors shall verify their returns on oath, under a penalty of, from 25I. to 50I. one moiety to the inspec-; for, and another as the court shall think proper, if they obey not the summons of the court. The proprietors, in case of I the

Cornfactors neglecting to deliver weekly returns, to be summoned before the sessions, and in case they Until not appear, the said persons so offending shall be fined not more than ten pounds, nor left than five pounds, to be divided as before. — A duty of a halfpenny per last on all corn fold shall be paid to the inspector, the amount thereof to be dated, and presented to the lefiions twice a year. — The inspefior shall give security in a sum not less than two hundred pounds, nor more than three hundred pounds, for the faithful accounting and payment of all monies

commons of the same county.

And none hut freeholders have a voice at such election. When any persons comes to an unnatural death, the town-ship shall give notice thereof to the coroner. Otherwifeif the body be interred before he come, the township shall be amerced.

When notice is given to the coroner, he is to issue a precept to the constables of the four, live, or fix next townships, to return a competent number of good and lawful men of their townships, to appear before him in such a place, and to make an inejuifition touching the matter. Or he may fend his precept to the contlab'eof the hundred.

Evidence.

BEFORE a justice of the peace, in divers cases, one witness is fafficient to con via an offender; the same being di-rested by special statutes.

Bat in case of high treason, no person shall be attainted, bat apon the oaths of two witnesses.

Dcvifes of lands shall be attested by three witnesses at the lead.

The confcSon of the defendant, whether taken on an examination before justices of the peace, or in discourse with private persons, hath always been allowed to be given in evidence, against the party confef&ng, but not against others.

An attainder, judgement, or conviction of treason, felony, perjury, or forgery on 5 El. and also judgment to (land on the pillory, or to be whipped or branded, are good caules of exception against a witness, while they continue in force.

The compulsory means to bring in witnesses are of two kinds. 1. By process ofyiIpar.a, issued in the king's name, by the justices, or others, where the trial is to be. 2. (which is the more ordinary and more effectual means in criminal cases) the justices that take the examination of the person accufsd, and the information of the witnesses, may at that time, or at any time after, and before the trial, bind ever the witnesses to appear at the sessions; and in case of their refusal either to come, or to be bound over, may commit them for their contempt in such refusal.

When any poor person shall appear on recognizance in any court to give evidence, the court may order the treasurer to pay him l'uch sum as they shall think reasonable, except in MiJMfftx, where the same shall be paid by the overseers of the poor where the person was apprehended.

The justices in sessions from time to time may lay down or alter such rules and regulations concerning any cods or charges to be allowed to any person by virtue of this act, as to them mail seem just; which rules and regulations, having received the approbation and signature of one or

more

Evidence. 69

more of the judges of assize, shall be binding on all persons whatsoever.

If any person, upon whom a process out of any of the courts 5 c‘ 5* of record shall be served, to certify or depose concerning any matter depending therein, and having tendered unto him a reasonable sum for his colls and charges, do not appear according to the tenor of the process, having not a lawful and reasonable impediment, he shall forfeit tol. and shall yield such further recompence to the party aggrieved, as to the judge of the court shall fecm meet.

In criminal cases, if a witness hath been bound over, and do not appear, he shall forfeit his recognizance.

He who affirms the matter in issue, whether plaintiff or Lit. 36. defendant, ought to begin to give evidence.

The evidence both for and against a prisoner, ought to be upon oath.

But a quaker's affirmation, in all cases not being criminal, j&Sir.e. 34. shall be allowed as evidence, without an oath; but in criminal cases, his affirmation shall not be allowed.

It is no satisfaction lor a witness to say, that he thinks or Dyer 53. persuades himself; the judge ought to have more ground than thinking.

The court may indulge a prisoner in examining the wit- St. Tr. V. 4,9. nesses apart, but he cannot demand it of right.

In cases of life, no evidence is to be given against a pri- z/fine. 428. foner, but in his presence.

In every issue, the affirmative is to be proved. A nega- T/m. of Enid. tive cannot regularly be proved. 1

A prisoner may not call witnesses to disprove what his St. Tr. V. 1. own witnesses have sworn. 792.

A witness shall not be permitted to read his evidence, but St. Tr. V. 445. he may look upon his notes to refrellt his memory.

A witness shall not be cross examined till he has gone St. Tr. r. 2792. thro' the evidence for the party on whose side lie was produced.

A deporttion taken by a witness before a justice of the - Haiti. 430. peace, may at the prisoner's desire be read at the trial, in order to take off the credit of the witness, by Ihcwing a variance between such depositiens, and the evidence given in court.

There may be four witnesses put in one fubptena.

cot discharge him, bat he mail either be bailed or committed; for it is not fit that a man once arrested and charged with felony, or suspicion thereof, should be delivered, upon any man's discretion, without farther trial.

In order to which bail or commitment, the examination and information of the parties mult first be taken, according to the following statutes:

Two or more justices (t QJ or one of the said justices, before they bail a person apprehended for felony (if the offence is bailable) shall take his examination, and the information of them that bring him, of the fast and circumstances thereof, and the same, or as much thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, shall put in writing; which examination they shall certify (together with the bailment) at the next general gaol delivery, to be holden within the limits of their commission. — And they shall have power to bind by recogni-zance all such as do declare any thing material to prove the offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery ; and shall certify such recognizance in like manner — And if they offend in any thing herein, they shall be fined by the justices of gaol delivery.

Where the person is not bailed, but committed, the justice or justices, who commit him, shall, before such commitment, take the like examination and information, and shall put the same in writing within two days after the said examination, and shall in like manner bind over the witnesses; and certify the whole as above.

If on some reasonable hindrance the justice cannot at the return of the warrant take the examination, he may by word of mouth command the constable or any other person, to dc-tain in custody the prisoner till the next day, and then to bring him before the justice, for farther examination.

But the time of the detainer muff be no longer than is ne-ccssary.

The examination of the person accused, ought not to be upon oath.

But it‘upon his examination he shall confess the matter, it fnaii not be amiss that he subscribe his name, or mark to it.

Which examination being voluntary, and sworn by the justice or his clerk to be truly taken, may be given in evidence against the party confessing, but not against others.

Excise and Customs.

The statute of 8 G. c. 18. brings the recognizance not only 8 C. c. 18. of the said forfeiture, but also of several others hereafter following, under the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace.

All feiznres may in a summary way be determined by two justices of the peace residing near the place where the seizure is made; who shall summon the party accused, and on appearance or default proceed to hear and give judgement, and issue warrants for sale of such as shall be by them condemned; whose judgment shall not be liable to any appeal or certiorari.

In. trials of seizures, the justices shall proceed to the merits 9 C. t. t. 35. of the cause, without enquiring into the form or manner of seizure.

Any officer of the customs or excise, and their assistants, 19 c. 3. c. 69. may arrest persons who shall be found aiding in unshipping any uncustomed or prohibited goods to be laid on land; and shall forthwith carry them before a justice residing near; who shall, if he fee cause, commit the offender to the county gaol till the next general quarter-sessions. In which case, the officer shall enter into recognizance in 40I. to appear and prosecute. And the justices at such sessions shall hear and determine the offence; and, in lieu of any other punishment by any former act, may commit the offender to hard labour in the house of correction, not exceeding three years, nor less than one.

And generally, no' public officer shall take any other fees W. or rewards, for doing any thing relating to his office, than-some statute in force gives him, or than hath been anciently and accultomably taken; and' if he do otherwise, he is guilty of extortion. — The fees in sessions, for traversing, trying, or distharging indictments, discharging recognizances, and the like, do vary according to the different cultoms in different places.

Felony.

IT would be very tedious to set down every thing which may be comprehended under this word Felony; therefore it is necessary to refer the consideration of the several particular kinds of felonies to their respective titles; as Homicide, Rcilery, Burglary, Rape, Coin, Forgery, and especially Larceny.

The course and whole procedure of trying an offender, is treated of under the title SeJJlom.

The felon shall pay the charges of his carrying to gaol, if 3 7 'la-able; to be levied by distress by warrant of one justice.

If he is not able, the same shall be paid, by order of such 17 G. 1. 3.

17 G a. r. 3. When any poor person shall appear on recognizance to give evidence, whether any bill of indictment be preferred or not, the court may order the treasurer to pay him such sum as they shall think reasonable.

14 C. 3. c. as. Every person, charged with any felony or other crime, against whom no bill of indictment shall be found, or who shall on trial be acquitted, or who shall be discharged by proclamation for want of prosecution, shall be immediately set at large in open court, without paying any fee to the sheriff or gaoler; and such fees as had been usually paid, not exceeding 15s. qd. for each person, shall, on the certificate of a judge or judice before whom such prisoner shall have been discharged, be paid out of the general county rate.

Misprision of Felony

The party grieved, if he will lofc the benefit of his treble damages and colts, may be aided and have the assistance of the justices at the general sessions, by way of indictment on the statute of 8 H. 6.

In the caption of which indictment, it will be sufficient to 1 Haiv. 147. say, jujtiui assigned to keep the peace of our lord the king, without shewing that they have authority to hear and determine felonies and trespasses; for the statute enables all justices of the peace, as such, to take such indictment and the tenement in which the force was made, mull be described with convenient certainty; and mult set forth that the defendant 2ftually entered; and ousted the party grieved; and con-linucth his possession at the time of finding the indictment.

But if a man's wife, children, or servants do continue in Do!:, e. 132. the house or upon the land, he is not ousted of his possession.

Bat aitho' or.c justice alone may proceed in such cases, yet it may be adviseable for him, if the time for viewing the force will fairer ir, to take to his assistance one or two more justices.

After complaint made to such justice, by the party grieved, of a forcible entry made into lands, tenements, or other posses-iions, or forcible holding thereof, he shall, within a convenient time, at the colls of the party grieved (without any examining or llanding upon the right or title of either party) take sufficient power of the county, and go to the place where such force is made.

All such justices onght to make a record of such force by them viewed; which record shall be a sufficient conviction of the offenders, and the parties shall not be allowed to traverse it: and this record, being made out of the sessions, by a particular justice, may be kept by him j or he may make it indented, and certify the one part into the king's bench, or leave it with the clerk of the peace, and the other part he may keep himself.

- And the offenders, being arrested (as before is said) shall be put in the next gaol, there to abide convict by the record of the same justice, until they have made fine and ransom to the king.

9- The justice shall make his precept to the sheriff, commanding him in the king's behalf, to cause to come before him, sufficient and indifferent persons, dwelling next about the lands so entered, to enquire of such entries: whereof every man shall have lands or tenements of 40s. a year, above re-prizes. And the sheriff shall return issues on every of them, at the day of the first precept returnable 20s. and at the second day 40s. and at the third iocs, and at every d.ay after double. And the sheriff making default, shall on conviction before the same justice, or before the judge of assize, forfeit act. half to the king, and half to him who shall sue, with coils; and moreover shall make fine and ransom to the king.

And if such forcible entry or detainer be found before such justice, then the said justice shall cause to refeize the lands and tenements so entered orholden, and shall restore the party put out, to the full possession of the same.

” No restitution upon an indictment of forcible entry. Or holding with force, shall be made, if the person indicted have had the occupation, or been in quiet possession for three years together next before the indictment found, and his estate

Although regularly the justices only who were present at Ddt. c. 44. the enquiry, and when the indictment was found, ought to award restitution, yet if the record be certified by the justice or justices into the king's bench, the justices of that court may award a writ of restitution to the sheriff, to restore pof-session to the party expelled. — If a forcible entry or detainer shall be made by three persons or more, it is also a riot, and may be proceeded against as such, if no enquiry hath before been made of the force.

And moreover, when it shall appear, upon the view of two jnilices, that any public highway, not in the situation herein before described, or public bridle-way, or foot-way, may be diverted, so as to make the same nearer or more commodious, to die public, and the owner of the lands, through which such new highway, bridle-way, or foot-way; is proposed to be made, shall consent thereto by writing under his hand and seal; it shall be lawful, by order of the juiliccs at some special sessions, to divert and turn, and to Hop up such foot-way, and to divert, turn, Hop up, and inclose, sell and dispose of such old highway or bridle-way, and to purchase the ground and foil for such new highway, bridle-way, or foot-way, by such ways and means, and subject to such exceptions and conditions in all respects, as herein before mentioned with regard to highways to be widened or diverted. And it shall be lawful for any person injured or aggrieved by any such order or proceeding, or by the inclosure of any highway by virtue of an inqnifition taken upon a writ of ad quad datrwur., to appeal to the next general quarter-sessions, on giving ten days notice in writing to the forveyor and party interested in such inclosure, if there be time for that purpose; if hot, then to the next sessions after. Bat no incloluie or lloppage of such old way shall be made, until the new way shall be compleated, and so certified by two justices upon view; which certificate shall be returned to the clerk of the peace, and by him inrolled amongst the records. r

Provided, that no common land, lying between the fences of any old highway to be Hopped up or inclosed by virtue of this aci, shall be inclosed. And where the same, not 'being common land, shall upon a medium exceed 30 feet in breadth, and not extend to 50 feet, the same shall no; be Hopped up or inclosed, until farisfaction be made to the owner for so mnch as shall exceed the breadth of 30 feet; and if the parties cannot agree, the same shall be adjnfted by the said justices.

BY manllaughter is to be understood such killing of a man 66.

as happens either on a sudden quarrel, or in the Commission of an unlawful aft, without any deliberate intention ofdoing any mischief at all.

There is this difference between murder and manllaughter; 3 I»jl. jj. viz. that murder is upon malice forethought, and manslaughter upon a sudden occasion.

This offence is not bailable by the julliccs of the peace. % Ed. 1 c. ij.

Murder is, when a man of found memory, and of the age of,

discretion, unlawfully killeth .any person under the king's peace, with malice forethought, either expressed by the party, or implied by law; foas the party wounded or hurt, dieof the woundorhurt, within a year and a, day.

The law so far abhors all duelling in cold blood, that not , s2,

only the principal who actually'kills the other, biit'also his fcconds, arc guilty of murder, whether they fought , or not.

And it is holden, that the seconds of the party flain' are like-wife guilty as acccffarics.

They that are present when any man is flain, and do not 3 r»/f. 53-their bell endeavour to apprehend the murderer or manflaycr,

Where any person shall beicloniously flrickcnor poilpned in one county, and die in another county, the offender'may be indicted in the county where the party dies, before the coroner, julliccs of the peace, or other justices.

The justices of the peace, in their respective quarter-sessions, shall fix a reasonable salary for the governor or keeper of the house of correction, and may moreover allow him some proportion of the profits earned by the prisoners.

Governors are empowered to handcuff or fetter any refrac- si G. 3. e. 64. tory prisoner. — The justices of the peace, at their general quarter-sessions, may, if they think fit, appoint a minister of the church of England, residing in or near the place where every such house of correction shall be situate, to perform divine service there every Sunday, and may appoint such salary for his-trouble as they shall think fit, not exceeding 20I. per annum, to be paid by the treasurer of the county; but such salary to be diminished, at any future quarter-sessions, if the justices shall think fit. — All penalties inflicted by this act, shall, in default of payment, after due summons and demand made, be levied by aiftrefs and sale, by virtue of a warrant under the hand and seal of any justice of the peace having jurisdiction where such offender shall dwell; and for want of such distress, it shall and may be lawful to and for any justice of the peace to commit such offender to the common gaol, for any space not exceeding six calendar months, nor less than one calendar month; every such penalty and forfeiture shall be paid to the treasurer of the county.

FOR levying hue and cry, although it is a good course to have the warrant of a justice of the peace, when time will permit, in order to prevent canfelefs hue and cry; yet by the frame of the statntes, it is by no means necessary, nor is it always convenient; for the felon may escape before the warrant be obtained, and hue and cry was part of the law, before justices of the peace were first instituted.

Constables of hundreds shall be chosen, who shall present before juIUces aligned, defaults of the suits of towns, and all such as lodge Grangers in uplandish towns, for whom they will not answer.

Such as are partly at the salt of the king, and partly, at the salt of the party; which are commonly called informations qui tom, from those words in the information when the proceedings were in Latin, qui iazj pro dcixixo rogo quampro fsipfo, far.

All offences against any penal ilatute, for which any common informer may ground a popular action, bill, plaint, salt, or information, before the judges of assize, orjustices of the peace in their general or quarter-sessions (having power to hear and determine the same) shall be prosecuted in the county where they were committed, and not elsewhere; and if the offence is not proved to have been committed in the same county, the defendant shall be found not guilty.

No informer shall compound or agree with the defendant, but after answer made in court; nor after answer, but by the order or consent of the court; on pain of being set on the pil-lory, in some market town next adjoining, in open market, for two hours, and of being disabled to be informer on any penal Ilatute, and also of forfeiting tol. half to the king, and half to the party grieved, to be recovered in any court of record, by action of debtor information.

BY many statutes, peculiar punishments are appointed for £)-/.-. c. jSS.

several offences, as pillory, docks, imprisonroent, and the like; and in all these cases, no room is left for thejuf. tices'discretion, for they ought to give judgment, andtoin-flidt the punishment in all the circumstances thereof, as such statutes'dodireft.

Jurors.

THE justices, at Midsummer sessions, shall issue forth their 36)' $.dn. c. 18.

warrants under the hands and fealsof two or more of them, to the high constables, requiring them to issue forth their precept to the petty constables, thereby directing and requiring them to make and return true lifts in writing, of the names and places of abode of all persons, within their respective con-liablcwichs, with their titles and additions, between the ages of 21 and 70, qualified to serve on juries by having in their 24.

The high-condable failing to issue this precept, shall forfeit 10I. on conviction at the assizes or sessions.

And if any petty constable shall wilfully omit any person who ought to be inserted, or insert anyone who ought to be B b 2 omitted.

And such justice shall, in writing under his hand, certify the same to the next sessions; who shall direst. the clerk of the peace toinfert orftrikeout the name of such person so inserted or omitted wrongfully.

the lifts in open court. zr Or inftrad of this, after they have compleated their lifts, it shall be fumcient if they subscribe the same in the presence of one justice, and at the same time attest the truth thereof upon oath to the belt of their knowledge or belief: and then the said lifts, being first signed by the justice, and subscribed as aforesaid, shall be delivered by the said petty constables to the high constables, who shall deliver in the same at the said sessions in open court, attesting at the same time, upon oath, the receipt of such-Iifts from the petty constables, and that no alteration hath been made therein lince their receipt thereof. ftSljy. c. 3:.

By a clause in the comraiflion of the peace, it is said. We command our sheriff, that at certain days, which you (the justices) shall make known to him, he cause to come before you so many and such good and lawful men of his bailiwick, (as well within liberties as without) by whom the truth shall be the better known and enquired into. sfJctr. 406. ft seems that justices of the peace may not order a jury to be returned immediately, nor on the same day, for the trial of a prisoner arraigned before them, as justices of gaol delivery may, unless the crime amount to felony, or the party confetti to be tried immediately.

But with the alTent of the justices they may both eat and Dr. (5 St. 138. drink; and if they cannot agree, the justices may in such case futfer the jury to have both meat and drink for a time, to fee whether they will agree. — But if the case lb happen, that the jury can in no wife agree, the justices (as it seemeth) in such case may take such order in the matter, as shall seem to them by their discretion to (land with reason and conscience, by awarding a new in quell, or otherwise, as they shall think bell.

If a jury give a verdifi against all reason, convicting or ac- z7j.77.303, quitting a person indicted of felony, what shall be done ? If 310. the jury convifl a man, against or without evidence, and against the direction of the court, the court may reprieve him before judgment, and acquaint the king, and certify for his pardon: if the jury acquit him in like manner, the court may fend them back again (and so in the former case) to conlider better of it, before they record the verdict; but if they are peremptory in it, and (land to their verdict, the court mull take their verdict and record it.

ARE judges of record, appointed by the king, to be justices within certain limits, for the conservation of the peace, and for the execution of divers things comprehended within their commission, and within divers ftaiutes committed to their charge.

And a record or memorial, made by a justice of the peace, of things done before him judicially in the execution of his office, Sail be of such credit, that it shall not be gainsaid.

In ancient times such officers or ministers, as were instituted, cither for preservation of the peace of the county, or for execution of justice, were, by force of the king's writ in every several county, chosen in full or open court by the freeholders of that county-Besides these conservators of the peace properly so called, there were and are other conservators of the peace by virtue of certain offices : viz. (1) The lord chancellor, and every justice of the king's bench, throughout all die realm, (z) Every court of record within its own precinct. (3) Every justice of the peace. (4) Every sheriff. (5) Every coroner. And (6) every high and petty constable.

There were also other conservators of the peace by tenure; who held lands of the king by this service; and other conservators of the peace by prescription.

The general duty of the conservators of the peace by the common law, is to employ their own, and to command'the help of others, to arrefi and pacify all such who in their pre-fence, and within their jurisdiction and limits, by word or deed, shall go about to break the peace. — And if the conservators of the peace have committed or bound over any offenders, they are then to send to, or be prefect at, the next sessions of the peace, or gaol delivery, there to object against them.

. Justices of the peace at this day are of three forts ; 1. By aS of parliament; as the bishop of Ely and his successors, and the archbishop of York, and bishop of Durham. 2. By charter, or grant made by the king under the great seal; as mayors and the chief officers in divers corporate towns. 3. By commission.

No person shall be capable of being or afling as a justice of the peace, who shall not have in law or equity, lor his own use, in pofiession, a freehold, copyhold, or customary estate for life, or for some greater ellate, or an estate for forae long term of years, determinable upon one or more lives, or for a certain term originally created for 21 year: or more, in lands,

tenements,

Justices of the Peace. 191

tenements, or hereditaments, in England or Wales, of the clear yearly value of tool, above what will discharge all incumbrances affecting the same, and all rents and charges payable out of the same : or who shall not be entitled to the immediate reversion or remainder of lands leased for one, two, or three lives, or for any term of years determinable on the death of one, two, or three lives, upon reserved rents of the clear yearly value of 300I.

Everyjustice of the peace before he acts, at the sessions of the county where he intends to act, shall take and subscribe the oath following: I A. B. dojkvear, that I truly ami bona fide have fitch an estate, in law nr equity, to and for my own use and benefit, confifiing of — (specifying the nature of such cllate whether. messuage, land,- rent, tythe, office, benciice, or what else) as doth qualify me to ail as a jufiiee of the peace for the

county, riding, or division of----, according to the true intent

and meaning of an act of parliament made in the 18th year of the reign of his majesty hing' George the second, entitled, an ail to amend and render snore ej'eilual an ail passed in the fifth year of his present majesty's reign, entitled, an all for the further qualification ofjujliccs of the peace; and that the same (except where it confills of an office, benefice, or ecclesiastical preferment, which it shall be sufficient to ascertain by their known and usual names) is lying or beisig, or fining out of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, being within the parifit, township, or preeinil

of ----- -, or in the feuseral parishes, townships, or precinils of

— , in the county of — , or in the Jcvcral counties of ----- ----- ,

(as the case may be.)

Which oath taken and subscribed, shall be kept by the clerk of the peace among the records of the sessions.

And if any person shall act as justice, without having taken and subscribed the said oath, or without being qualified as above, he shall, for every offence, forfeit tool, half to the poof of the patish in which he moll usually resides, and half to him who shall sue, with full cods. The prosecution to be in six months.

No sheriff shall exercise the office of a jufiiee of the peace, sM.frjj'.i. c.n. during the time that he aftsas sheriff.

Justices of the peace have jurisdiction of all inferior crimes i llav.^o. within their commission, whether such crimes be mentioned in any statute concerning them or not; for all such crimes are cither directly, or at leait by consequence and judgment of law, against the peace.

The Justice of the Feace his Oath of Office.

YE shall swear, that as justice of the peace in the county of M. in all articles in the king's commission to you directed,

you

ig2

Justices of the Peace.

you shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich, after your cunning, wit, and power, and after the laws and custoras of the realm, and statutes thereof made: and ye shall not be of counsel of any quarrel hanging before you: and that ye hold your sessions after the form of the liatutes thereof made: and the iifues, fines, and amerciaments that shall happen to be made, and all forfeitures which shall fall .before you, ye shall cause to be made without any concealment (or embezzling) and truly fend them to the king's exchequer. Ye shall not let, for gift or other cause, but well and truly ye shall do your office of justice of the peace in that behalf: and you shall take nothing for your office of justice of the peace to be done, but of the king, and fees accustomed, and colts limited by Haute. And ye shall not direct, nor cause to be directed, any warrant (by you to be made)-to the parties, but ye shall Hired them to the bailiff of the said county, nr other the king's officers or ministers, or other indifferent persons, to do execution thereof. So help you God.” zSG.z. c. 14. The justices at Midsummer sessions 1753, shall settle a table of their clerk's fees; which being approved by the justices at the next succeeding sessions, with such alterations as the justices there shall think proper, shall be laid before the judges at the next affixes, who shall confirm the same with such alterations, additions, or abatements, as to them shall appear just and reaionzble: and the sessions from time to time may make any other table of fees, and after the same shall have been approved by the next succeeding sessions, shall lay the lame before the judges at the next affixes, who may ratify the same in like manner: and no tabic of fees shall be valid, until confirmed by the judges. — And if after three months from the time thatfnch table shall be confirmed, any justice's clerk shall demand or take any other or greater fee than shall have been so confirmed, he shall forfeit zol. to him who shallfue in three

months____The said table of fees shall be deposited with the clerk of the peace, who shall cause true copies thereof to be kept constantly in a conspicuous part of the room where the sessions are held, on pain of rol.

27 G. z. c. 16. In Middlesex, the like table shall be confirmed by the two lords chief justices, and the lord chief baron or any two of them.

Dzl:. c. 173. Regularly, justices of the peace ought not to execute their office, in their own.case; but cause the offenders to be convened or carried before feme other justice, or desire the aid of some other justice being present.

Cn. Cir. 394. If a justice exceed his authority, in granting a warrant, yet

the officer must execute it, and is indemnified for so doing; but if it be a case wherein he hath no jurisdiction, or in a matter whereof he hath no cognizance, the officer ought not

to

Justices of the Peace. 193

to execute such warrant; so that the officer is bound to take notice of the authority and jurisdiction of the justice.

If the officer, in six days after demand, shall grant to the g.i. c. 44. party complaining a perusal and copy of the warrant, he shall not be liable to any action, but the justice only'.

In summary convictions, theparty ought to be heard, and, iSalk.iSu for that purpose, ought to be summoned in fa£l; and if the: justice proceed against a person without summoning him, it would be a misdemeanor in him, for which an information would lie.

In all cases where justices may hear and determine out of Dajt> f sections (viz. on their own view,- or confession, or oath of witnesses) the justices ought to make a record, in writing under their hands, of all the matters and proofs ; which record, nor-withstanding, in many cases they may keep by them. — And if, upon such conviction, the offender is to be fined to the king, then the justices are to estreat such fine, and to fend the estreat into the exchequer, whereby the barons of the exchequer may cause the said fine or forfeiture to be levied for the king's use.

Forasmuch as most of the business of a justice of the peace Dahc. 1-3. confiftech in the execution of divers statutes, which cannot bi ' sufficiently abridged, but that they will come short of the Tub* stance and body thereof, therefore it shall be safest for the justices to have an eye to the statutes at large, and thereby to take their further and better directions, for their whole proceedings.

A justice of the peace is strongly protected by the law, in the just execution of his office.

Thus, in the first place, he is not to be fiandcred or abused.

In-the next place, he is not punishable at the suit of the aa,». gs, party, but only at the suit of the king, for what he doth as judge, in matters which he hath power by law to hear and determine without the concurrence of any other; but in cases wherein he proceeds ministerially, rather than judicially, if he aft corruptly, he is liable to an action at the suit of the party, as well as to an information at the suit of the king.

in the next place, if any action shall be brought against a 7 J. c. 5. justice for any thing done by virtue of his office, he may plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence; and if he recover, he shall have double costs.

No writ shall be sued out against, or copyof any process, at c. 2. r. 44-the suit of a subject, shall be served on any justice, for any thing done by him in the execution of his office, until notice in writing shall have been given to him, or left at Jiis usual place of abode, by the attorney for the party, one month before thefuiijg out, orferving the same; containing the cause of action, and indorsedwith his name and place of abode; lor which he shall be entitled to a fee of zos. and no more —

And the justice may at any time, within one month after such C c notice.

Justices of the Peace.

notice, tender amends to the party complaining, or to his attorney; and if the same is cot accepted, he may plead such tender in bar to the action, together with the plea of not guilty, and any other plea, with leave of the court; and if upon issue joined, the jury shall find the amends tendered to hare been sufficient, they shall give a verdict for the defendant.

Ifajudice will not, on complaint to him made, execute his office, or shall misbehave in his office, the party grieved may-move the court of king's bench for an information, and afterwards may apply to the court of chancery to put him out of the commission.

Carried into Execution by Commissionen. Justices not, as such, concerned in it.

0 person shall be capable to act as commissioner in any county or riding at large, (the counties of Merioneth,

Cardigan, Carmarthen, Glamorgan, Montgomery, Pembroke, and Monmouth, excepted) unless he be seized of lands, tenements, &c. which were taxed, or did pay, in the year next before, for the value of tool, a year of his own cilatc.

Larceny.

COMES from lalrcchtiua, latrocin)'* and by contraction, or rather abnfe, larceny.

Grand larceny is a felonious and fraudulent taking, and carrying away, by any person, of the mere personal goods of another, above the value of 12d.

A juliice of the peace, before whom an offender shall be brought for petty larceny out of sessions, may not punish the said offender by his discretion, and so let him go; but mult have him committed or bailed, to the intent he may come to his trial, as in cases of other felonies: and if upon his trial, the jury shall find the goods stolen to exceed tad. in value, the offender shall have judgment to die for the fault.

All petty larceny is felony, and consequently requires the vtotifclsaiiaJIj in an indictment for it; yet it is certain, that it is not pnoiffiable with the Iofs of life or lands, but only with the forfeiture of goods, and whipping, transportation, or other corporal punishment.

If the goods arc taken from a man's person, and if it is attended with putting him in fear, it is called robbery; if it is without putting him in fear, then it is called barely larceny from the person.

If it is done privily without his knowledge, by picking of ^ pockets, or otherwise, it is excluded from the benefit of clergy by the S El. <-.4. (that is, if the thing stolen be above the value of tad).

If it is done openly and avowedly before his face, it is within the benefit of clergy, except where it is committed in a dwelling house, or outhouse thereunto belonging, to the value of 40s. from which the benefit of clergy is taken away.

Every person that shall feloniously take away any goods, being in a dwelling house, any person being thereio, and put in fear, or shall rob any dwelling house in the day time, any person

Larceny. 201

person being therein; he, his comforters and abettors, shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy. \

Every person who shall be convicted. of feloniously taking El.«. 1$. away in the day time any money or goods of the value of $s,-from any dwelling house, or outhouse thereunto belonging, and used to and with the same, although no person be therein,' shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy. '

This requires an actual breaking, and* not entering by the 1H- // 54J* doors being open, ' /

Every person that shall feloniously Heal any money, goods, 1* A-.fi- f- 7* or merchandizes, to the value of'40s. being in any dwelling house, or outhouse thereunto belonging, although: it be not broken open, nor any person be therein; shall be guilty-of felony without benefit of clergy.

of the marine and land forces are, in such cases, to take rank according to the seniority of their commissions in either service.

Marine forces being borne as part of the complement of any ships of war, are liable to be governed by the rules established by an act made in the twenty second year of the reign of his late majesty king George the second, intituled,- an act for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act of parliament, the laws relating to the government of his majesty's ships, vessels, and forces by sea.

Northern Borders.

THE justices of Northumberland and Cumberland, may make order in sessions, for charging the respective counties, for (ecuring the same against the mol's-troopers (that is, thieves and robbers, who after having committed offences in the borders, eicape through the tvailes and moifcs:) so as Northumberland be not charged above jooi. nor Cumberland above aool. a year. And they may appoint a commander, with 30 men in Northumberland, and 12 men in Cumberland, to search for, pursue, and apprehend offenders.

If any person against whom a warrant shall be issued by any justice in England, for any offence against the laws of England, shall escape or go into Scotland; the (hcriff, or steward depute, orsubstitute, or any justice of the county or place where such person shall be, may indorse his name on the said warrant, to apprehend the person against whom such warrant is granted, and to convey him into the county or place in England (being adjacent to Scotland) in which the offence was committed, before a justice of such county or place, to be there dealt with according to law ; in case the offence was committed in the county not next adjacent to Scotland, then to convey him into any county of England adjacent to Scotland, before a justice there; who .'nail proceed, with regard to such perihn, by indorsing the warrant, as by the 24.

Nuisance.

A COMMON nuisance seems to be, an offence against the public, either by doing a thing which tends to the annoyance of all the king's subjects, or by neglecting to do a thing which the common good requires.

Annoyances to the prejudice of particular persons, are not punishable by a public prosecution as common nuisances, but are left to be redrcffed by the private actions of the parties aggrieved by them.

If it is a public nuisance, the law hath provided an apt remedy, by presentment or indictment at the suit of the king, in the behalf of all his subjects.

Oaths.

IN all cases, where any penalty is directed to be levied, or distress to be made, by any act of parliament now in force, or hereafter to be made, it shall be lawful for any justice or justices, acting under the authority of such acts respectively, to administer an oath or oaths for the purpose of levying such penalties, or making such distresses.

The person accused shall not be examined upon oath, for by the common law no man is obliged to accuse himself: but it seemeth convenient, in cases of felony especially, that the information, which the julliccs do take against the prisoner, be upon oath; otherwise, upon the trial of the prisoner, such information taken by the justice shall not be read or delivered to the jury, nor given in evidence against the prisoner upon his trial.

The information of the prosecutor or witnesses ought to be upon oath, although the statute doth not mention an oath ; which information upon oath, being sworn on the trial to be K. k 2 truly

Where one justice may punish offenders upon accusation or proof generally, it seemeth that this mull be by examination of witnesses; and though the statute doth not expressly set down that it shall be upon oath, yet it seemeth fit, that the justice do it upon oath: yea in all other cases, wheresoever any man is authorised to examine witnesses, such authority to examine flia.ll be taken and construed to be in such manner as the law requires, which is only by oath.

And if such person shall neglect or refuse to appear and take the oaths at the said sessions (the name of such person being publicly read at the first meeting of the said sessions) then such person shall be esteemed and adjudged a popish recusant convict; and the same shall be thence certified by the clerk of the peace into the chancery or king's bench, to be there recorded.

By the 31 G. c. 22, altered and explained by the 32 G, 2. e. 35, there are certain duties hid upon offices and pensions ; and so much of the fabrics of such offices, as ariseth from per-quintes, is directed to be under the management of the commissioners of the land tax.

By perquisites are meant such profits of offices and employments, as arise from fees established by cuilom or authority, and payable either by the crown, or the subjects, in consideration of business done in the conrle of executing such offices and employments.

IF any person shall be aggrieved by any thing done or omitted by the churchwardens and overseers, or by any of his majesty's justices of the peace, he may, giving reasonable notice to the churchwardens or overseers, appeal to the next general or quarter sessions, where the same shall be heard, and finally determined; but if reasonable notice be not given, then they shall adjourn the appeal to the next quarter sessions ; and the court may award reasonable cods to either party, as they may do by 8 and 9 tV. in case of appeals concerning settlements.

Provided that if any person shall be aggrieved by any act done by the said churchwardens and other persons, he may appeal to the general quarter sessions, whose order therein shall bind all parties.

Of Persons having no Settlement.

Noperlon, who shall come into any parish by such certificate, shall be adjudged by any act whatsoever to have procured a legal settlement in such parish, unless he shall really and Iona fie take a lease of a tenement of the yearly value of tol. or shall execute feme annual office in such parish.

KA./.t.t.i! If any persons shall be an apprentice or a hired servant to any person who came into any parish by means of a certificate, and hath not afterwards gained a legal settlement there; such apprentice or servant shall not be adjudged thereby to have any settlement in such parish.

3 G.r. r. The witnesses who attest the execution of the certificate by the churchwardens and overseers, or one of the said witnesses, shall make oath before the justices who are to allow the same, that such witness or witnesses did fee the churchwardens and overseers of the poor, whose names and seals are thereunto subscribed and set, severally sign and seal the said certificate; and that their names are of their own proper hand-writing: which said justices shall alfe certify, that such oath was made before them. And every such certificate so allowed, and oath of the execution thereof lb certified by the said justices, shall be allowed, in all courts whatsoever, and received as evidence, without other proof thereof.

Certain general Rules concerning Certificates.

A Parish cannot be compelled to grant a Certificate.

A Certificate is not binding, unless signed by the Justices.

Snr-r-.il i THE justices are not obliged ministerially to allow and (ign tejr:lt. a certificate. They have a discretion to allow it, or not to allow it, if it be liable to objection. And if it is not a certificate within the act (which it is not, unless properly signed} it cannot conclude the parish.

9 & io W, xi.

A Certificate extends

ip — NOT only to the certificate man himself, but likewise to all -9 his family and all his children, whether born before or after the certificate.

A certi-

Poor. (Certificate.)

287

A Certificate is conclusive .against the Parish cer-tifying.

BECAUSE a .certificate is a solemn ‘acknowledgment jS«S, 535. whereby the party is owned to be legally settled there: and as all other panlhes on this certificate are bound to receive him, so the parish that certifies is concluded as to all other panlhes.

A Certificate is not binding against a subsequent Settlement.

A CERTIFICATE promising to receive the persons when- 3 Salk, *53. ever they become chargeable, is not conclusive against a settlement obtained afterwards; for though it be according to the agreement between the parishes, yet a private agreement'in this respect shall not alter the law.

A Certificate is not restrictive from gaining a Settlement in a third Parish.

A CERTIFICATE provides for the security of that parish Burrwv't Sefth only, into which the certificate persons came to reside by virtue c«/‘ of fdch certificate; but doth not exclude a certificate person from gaining a settlement in another parish, in the same manner as any other person may do^

A Certificate is discharged by an Estate of a Man's own.

A MAN may not be removed from his own, whether it come gg'iojKe. 11. to him by defeent, devise, or purchase; and continuing s q, c % 7. thereon 40 days, he shall thereby gain a settlement, provided that, in case of purchase, the consideration paid amouat,'A>»<j side, to the sum of 30I.

A Certificate is discharged by a Removal. '

THE law is so far from looking upon a Certificate as continuing after an order of removal, that the pauper cannot return to the place from which he was removed, without incuring a penalty.

A Certificate is discharged by the Pauper's desert ing it.

THE certificate aft fays, that the apprentice shall not gain a settlement in the parish to which his mailer came by certificate. But if this apprentice hath gained an intermediate settlement, he ought to be sent to that settlement which he hath intermediately gained.

Of Settlement by Birth.

Of Bastards.

A BASTARD child is prima fade settled where born: and this was the antient genuine settlement: but this rule admits of divers exceptions.

If a woman comes into a place by privity and collusion of the officers where (he belongs, and is there delivered of a baf-tard, such bastard gains no settlement, notwithstanding its birth.

If a woman big with child of a baitard, and settled in one parish, is perfuadedto go intoanother, and there be delivered; this fraud will make the parish chargeable where the mother was settled, though the child was not born there.

If a bafiard is born under an order of removal, and before the mother can be sent to the place of settlement, being hindered by water or otherwise, such bastard-shall not be settled where so born, but at the mother's settlement.

If the officers are carrying a woman by virtue of an order of removal, and (he be delivered on the road in transtu, the baf-tard shall go with the mother where (he is going, by virtue of the order, notwithstanding the birth.

Where any woman, wandering and begging, shall be delivered of a child in any parish or place to which (he doth not belong, and thereby shall become chargeable to the same, the churchwardens or overseers may detain her till they can safely

convey

Poor. (Settlement by Birth.) 2.89

convey her to a justice of the peace. And if such woman shall be detained and conveyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which (he is delivered, if a ballard, shall not be settled in the place where so born,' nor be sent thither by a vagrant pass; but the settlement of such woman shall be deemed the settlement of such child.

A child born in thehouse ofcorreftion, shall be.sent to the 1 Sulflr. 35S. place of its mother's settlement.

A ballard born in a lying-in-hospital, shall follow the mo- 131?. 5. t.Si. ther's settlement.

If a woman come into a parish by certificate, and be there Stjf. C. V. a. delivered of a. ballard, that child shall not be/included in the 1Ta‘ certificate as part of the family, but shall befettled where born.

Yet it seems, that the ballard child shall go with the mother for nurture till (even years, and be maintained at the charge of the parish where it was born. See case of Darlington, H, 17

G. 3.

Of legitimate Children.

THE father's settlement is the settlement of the children, when it can be found out; otherwise the birth of the child prima facie is the settlement of the child, until there is another settlement found out. ' If they cannot find out the legal settlement of the father, the birth is the settlement of the child. The settlement by birth is only quoufpe they find the father's settlement; and if they never can find that, it is absolute upon them.

" Of the Settlement of Children with their Parents.

THE birth of legitimate children doth not give them a Fo/ry.i6g. settlement, except where the settlement of their father and mother is not known, and then only till it is known.

A child of seven years of age may be bound apprentice to a 5 El. c. 5. shipwright, fiiherman, owner of a ship, or other person using the trade of the fcas; and by the vagrant act of the 17 G. z, a vagrant's child of that age may by the justices be put out an apprentice: and as soon as he shall have redded and lodged in a parish for 40 days under the indenture, he will have thereby gained a settlement. So that the precise time when a person may have gained a settlement in his own right is at the age of seven years and 40 days.

Wihere ,a father gains a second settlement after the birth of s,r‘ 5So' his child, that settlement is immediately communicated to the'

child. And a child may be sent to the place of his father's settlement, without ever having been there before.

The place where a bastard is born is the place of his settle, meet, onlefs there is some trick to charge the parish; but the place where legitimate children are born is not the place of their settlement; for let that be where it will, the children are settled where their parents are settled.

Though the place of the birth of a child, where the father hath no settlement, is the place of the settlement of the child, yet where the father hath gained a settlement, his children, though born in another parish, shall be looked on as settled at the place of their father's lall legal settlement, and shall be removed thither, as well after the death of their father, if occasion requires, as in his life-time, supposing they have gained no settlement of their own.

If the father dies before the child is born, yet the child shall be settled where the father was settled before his death.

If a widow, by renting tol.ayear, gains a uewlettlement, her children are settled with her.

But if a woman marry again to a man settled in another parish, her children by her former husband mud go with her for nurture, yet they are no part of her second husband's family ; and therefore gain no settlement in the parish where the father-in-law is settled.

Those under seven years of age shall be kept at the charge of the other parish, where their father whilst living was settled ; and to that parish they may be sent after seven years old, as to the place of their lawful settlement.

The child's settlement follows that of its father, if the father's can be found ; and no recourse shall be had to the mother's settlement, till that of the father can be traced no further.

Where a child is fird known to be, that parish mud provide for it, till they find another.

Of Settlement by Apprenticeship.

ON complaint by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor, within 40 days after any person shall come to settle in any parish, on any tenement under 10I. ayear, two justices (1 ij.) may remove him to the place where he was lad-legally settled, either as a native, housholder, sojourner, apprentice, or fervent, for the space of 40 days at the lead.

The said 40 days shall be reckoned, not from the time of his coming to inhabit, but from the time of his delivering notice in writing: and by 3 If', c. 11. not from the time or delivering such notice, but from the time of the publication of such notice in the church.

If any person, after June 24, 1713, shall be an apprentice nM-JI.ic.it hound by indenture to any person reading under a certificate, in any parish, and not afterwards having gained a legal settlement.in such parish, such apprentice, by virtue of such apprenticeship, shall not gain any settlement in such parish.

No person who shall have been bound an apprentice, by any 3I c. i.r. n deed, writing, or contrail, not indented, being first legally damped, shall be liable to be removed from the place where he was so bound and resident 40 days, by any order of removal, or order of sessions, by reason only of such writing not being indented.

An apprentice may gain afettlement, whilst his master, not Bum. renting 10I. a year, gains none. In such case, the matter being removed, may apply to the justices to compel the apprentice to go with him.

If the master runs-away, the apprentice is not sufficiently £>/<-, e/s. fui juris to hire himself, nor can he gain a settlement till his '

indentures be legally cancelled.

Of Settlement by Service.

IF any unmarrried person, not having child or children, 3 W'. c., shall be lawfully hired into any parish or town for one year, such service shall be adjudged and deemed a good settlement therein.

No such person so hired as aforesaid, shall be adjudged or 8^9 Jf'.e..0 deemed to have a good settlement in any such parish or town- J

ship, unless such person shall continue and abide in the same service during the space of one whole year.

If any person after June 24, 1713, shall be a hired servant M. ji % with any person who did come into, or shall reftde in any pa- ' lS- *' rish, township, or place, by means or licence of a certificate, and not afterwards having gained a legal settlement in such parish, township, or place; such servant shall not gain any settlement in such parish, township, or place, by reason of such hiring or service, but shall have his settlement as if he had not been an hired servant to such person.

If a man, who has a ‘daughter married and settled elsewhere, Cu/'i <fgi __ hires himself for a year, and serves the year, he gains a settlementby the service, though not strictly a single man.

N. B. Though the case here alluded to is that of a daughter married and settled elsewhere, it /hould seem equally clear in the case of a/on, or fons, that have obtained a legal settlement elsewhere, previous to the father's obtaining a new settlement by the fcivice of a year, under a legal hiring-for a year.

Poor. (Settlement by Service.)

If a man hired for a year marries, having served half a year, the-marriage doth not hinder the serviceif the man performs the service, he gains a iettlement.

All hiring for a few days, lhort of a year, for the purpose of avoiding a Iettlement, will be considered as fraudulent; and the service will be allowed to make a good settlement. Lef; than 40 days residence in any parish will not gain a settlement : but if the contract be for a year, and the service be performed (suppose at sea, or in distant jonrnies) the residence need not be 40 days successively; it is sufficient if within the year.he resides 40 days in the whole.

Where there is a hiring for a year, and a service for a year, and a continuance under the same service, it is sufficient to gain a settlement; and such settlement mud be in the parish where itwas performed the Iafc 40 days.

Of Settlement by Marriage.

THE settlement of a woman in herhufband's parish, being a minor, and hot having obtained the content of his parents or guardians, set aCde in the case of K. and Tenham.

A woman marrying a husband, who hath a known settlement, shall follow the husband's settlement.

A wife can gain no settlement, separate and distinct from her husband, during the coverture.

A woman marrying a husband, that hath no known settlement, doth not lose her former settlement, which the had before marriage.

Of Settlement by continuing 40 Days after Notice.

THE 40 days continuance of a person in a parish, to make 3 settlement, shall be accounted from the time of his delivering notice in writing, of the house of his abode, and the number of his family, if he have any, to one of the churchwardens or overseers of the parish to which he shall remove.

Which said notice in writing, the said churchwarden or overfser shall read, or cause to be read, publicly, immediately after divine service, in the church or chapel, on the next Lord's day, when there shall be divine service in the same. And the said churchwarden or overseer shall regiller or cause to be registered, the said notice in writing, in the book kept for the poor's account.

And if any churchwarden or overseer shall refuse or neglect to read, or cause to be read, such notice in writing as aforesaid, he shall (on proof thereof by the oath of two witnesses before one justice) forfeit for every offence 40s. to the party grieved, by distress, by warrant directed to the constable of the parish or town where the offender dwells; and for want of sufficient

distress.

distre(s,thesaidjustice shall commit him to the common gaol for one month. 'And if any churchwarden or-'overseer shall refuse or neglect to regiller, or causetobe regillred,' such-notice in writing; he shall, on the like conviction, forfeit 40s.f to the use of the poor of the parish or town where the offender dwells,. to be levied as aforesaid; and for want ofsufficient distress, then the saidjultice shall commit him as aforesaid, for the time aforesaid.

N. B. No soldier, fcaman, shipwright, or other artificer, ^W. c.u. or workman in his majesty's fervite, shall have any settlement in any parish, port-town, or other town, by delivering and publication of notice in writing, unless the same' be after a difmiliion out of the service.

All persons not removable may become settled without giv- Bun. ing notice, the notice being only intended where the person is removable. '

When this notice given in writing has been omitted, the Str. 853. court has held all conftro&ive notices to be no legal settlement, such as, attending' the leet, amending the highways, and doing watch andward. - -

Of Settlement by paying Parish Rates.

FORTY days inhabitancy shall gain a settlement. '3 & 14 C. a.

Such 4odaysare to be reckoned from the delivering of ho- c" I* j c, tice in writing, and from the publication of such notice in 3 jy. i. ,1. the church.

But if any person, who shall come to inhabit in any town Id. or parish, shall be charged with, and pay his share, towards the public taxes or levies of the said town or parish, he shall be adj udged to have a legal settlement in the same, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published.

But persons residing under a certificate, shall gain no settle- 9 & to W. ment by being rated to and paying any such levies, taxes, or c- n« assessments.

Payments for the repair of the church, the relief of the poor, and the land tax, have been adjudged sufficient to gain a settlement : but no payment for the repair of the highways, or of the county-bridges, or of the duties on houses and windows,

shall make a good settlement.

Where the tenant is 'assessed to, and pays the land tax, tho' Burma's Sml. it be afterwards allowed by the landlord, and deducted out of CaJ' 75*

N. B. In many inllinces the landkri is ujftjfti by name though the truant pays the land tax, in confidence that it will be allowed him: in which cate, the notoiicty of such a person's inhabitancy is loft; and it Humid seem thit there is no ground on which toestablish a legal settlement.

the

294 Poor. (Settlement by Office.)

the rent, the tenant hereby gains a settlement: which is fop-posed to turn on the notice of inhabitancy, that arises from the party's being assessed and paying the tax, which is considered as tantamount to notice in writing.

Cf Settlement by serving a Parish Office.

3 jr. r. n. IF any person, who shall come to inhabit in any town or parish, shall for himself, and on his own account, execute any public and annual office or charge in the said town or parish, curing one whole year, he shall be adjudged to have a legal settlement in the same, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published.

joiofP'. c.it. No person, who shall come into any parish by certificate, shall be adjudged by any act whatsoever, to have procured a legal settlement in such parish, unless he shall really and Iona fit take a lease of a tenement of the yearly value of iol. or shall execute some annual office in such parish, being legally placed in such office.

Tittr Sail. To serve the office of con liable as deputy to another, doth not gain a settlement, though it be served a year: for, by the words of the act, he mall serve the office fir limjelf, and ok his snvK account.

Barrm's Sir.!. He mull also be legally placed in his office, by taking the

Cj/; a+r- oaths which belong to it. It mull appear to the court, how he came into his employment or office.

Of Settlement by renting iol. a Year.

THE aft (9 fc? 10 IF. c. 11.) doth not require aperson rent. <--/c 571. ing a tenement of iol. a year, to occupy it; it is enough if he rents it, and resides 40 days in the parish. The ground the act goes upon, is a person's having credit sufficient to hire a tenement of that value.

If the tenement is under 10I. a year, the justices, upon complaint within 40 days, have power to remove the person coming thither to reside ; if it is not under iol. a year, they have no power to remove him; and continuing upon the same unremovable for 40 days, he thereby gains a settlement.

Of Settlement by a Person's own Estate. '

g&ioir. c.n. NO certificate person shall gain a settlement, but by renting iol. a year, or executing an annual office.

But,

Poor. (Settlement by Estate.) 295

But, where a person has an eliate for life, oran estate of in- Fskj. *57> heritance of his own, that gains him a settlement, though less than 10I. a year; for he cannot be removed; and if he cannot be removed, he certainly gains a settlement.

Where a man lives upon his own, it is a case of a very ten- Burma's Smt. der nature, and the law will not unsettle him : persons to be ! removed under the statute of C. 2. are those that wander from place to place, and not those who live upon their own estate.

No person shall be deemed to acquire any settlement in any 9 C. c. 7. parish or place, by virtue of any purchase of any eliate or in-rereft in such parish or place, whereof the consideration for such purchase doth not amount to the sum of 30I. bona fide paid, for any longer or further time than such person shall inhabit in such eliate, and shall then be liable to be removed to such parish or place where he was lad legally settled before the said purchase and inhabitancy therein.

A person may not be removed from his own, although not Burma's Sett'. settled thereby, be the value ever so small, or let him come to CaS‘ 411-it in what manner soever.

A certificate person shall gain a settlement by an eliate of his own, notwithstanding the abovesaid statute of the 9 {s' io W. '

If an eliate descends to a certificate person, it gains him a Burma's Sail. settlement, becaufeit is byoperation of law, and not by an act G-fiics-of his own.

Having land in a parish will not make a settlement, but 2 Salt. 514. living in a parish where one has land, will gain a settlement without notice ; for the act never meant to banish men from the enjoyment of their own lands.

Of Removals.

IT shall be lawful, upon complaint made by the church- 13 & 14C.1t. wardens or overseers of the poor of any parish, to any justice of the peace, within 40 days after any poor person comes to settle in any tenement under the yearly value of 10I. for any twojultices of the peace (one whereof is of the quorum) of the division where any person that is likely to become chargeable to the parish shall come to inhabit, by their warrant to remove and- convey such persons to such parish where he was tail legally settled, unless he give sufficient security for the discharge of the said parish, to be allowed by the said justices.

And if such person shall refuse to go, or shall not remain in M, such parish where he ought to be settled, but shall return of his own accord to the parish from whence he was removed, one justice may fend him to the house of correction, there to be p«-niflted as a vagabond.

Poor. (Removal.)

All persons who shall unlawfully return to such parish of place from whence they have been legally removed by order of two justices, without bringing a certificate from the parish or place whereunto they belong, shall be deemed idle and disorderly persons; and one justice may commit them (being thereof convifiled before him, by his own view, or by their own confession, or by the oath of one credible witness) to the house cf correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one month.

And if the churchwardens and overseers of the parish to which he shall be removed, refafe to receive such person, and to provide work for him, as other inhabitants of the parish ; any justice of that division shall bind any such officer in whom there shall be default to the affixes or sessions, there to be in-difled for his contempt in that behalf.

If any p.rfun be removed by virtue of this act, by warrant of two justices; the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of the parish or town to which such person shall be removed, are required to receive the said person: which if he or they shall refuse to do, the person offending, on proof by the oath of twowitnesses, before one justice of the place to which the person snail be removed, shall forfeit for each offence 5I. to the use of the poor of the parish or town, from which such person was removed : to be levied by distress, by warrant to the constable of the parish or town where such offender dwells ; and for want of sufficient distress, the said justice shall commit the offender to the common gaol for 40 days.

Though the complaint maybe to one justice, yet the examination ought to be by two, and those the same who sign the order of removal.

And, ;r.c:: ur.d'.ihcllj, the justices ought to be both together at the bearing and determining; though the practice in many places is otherwise.

After an order and adjudication is made, that the same may appear upon record afterwards, in order to charge the parish, the mall regular way fur the justices to proceed is to make a record of the complaint and adjudication, and upon that to make a warrant to the churchwardens and overseers, to convey the persons to the parish to which they ought to be Tent, and deliver in the record by their own hands into court the nextfcfficns, tofce hep: thereamongst therccords.

' If any person, v.-lia shall come into any parish or place, thereto reiide, shall deliver a certificate to one of the churchwardens or ovcnl-ers there, such certificate fitall oblige the parish or place granting the same, to receive and provide for the parlor, mentioned in the said certificate, together with his family, as inhabitant, of that parish, whenever they shall happen to become chargeable to, or be forced to act relief of, the parish, township, or place, to which such certificate was given;

Poor. . (Removal.)

given; and then, and not before, it shall be lawful-for any such person, and his children,-though born in that pariflv not having otherwise acquired a legal settlement there; to be re--moved, conveyed,-and settled in the parish or place-from-whence such certificate was brought. ' i.

When any overseer or other person shall remove back any persons or their families, residing under a certificate, and becoming chargeable, to the parish or place to which they shall belong, such overseer or other person shall bereimbursed such reasonable charges as they may have been put unto in maintaining and removing such persons, by the churchwardens or overseers of the place to which such persons are removed; the said charges being firil ascertained and allowed of-by one or morejultices for the county or place to which such removal shall be made; which said charges so ascertained and allowed, shall, in case of a refusal of payment,- be levied by distress and fate of the goods of the churchwardens and overseers of the place to which such certificate person is removed, by warrant of such justice orjuilices.

All persons who think themselves aggrieved by atiy such judgment of the said twojuilices, may appeal to the justices of the peace of the said county, at their next quarter sessions, who shall do them justice according to the merits of their cause.

- The appeal against any order of removal of any poor person; shall be nad, prosecuted, and determined, at the general or quarter sessions of the peace for the county, division, or riding, wherein the parish, township, or place, from whence such poor person shall be removed doth lie, and not elsewhere.

N. B. In case of an order of removal from a town corporate, the appeal mud be to the sessions of the county; and not ab eoiem ad eimdem, the same justices probably fitting who made the order.

No appeal from any order of removal shall be proceeded upon, unless reasonable notice be given by the churchwardens or overseers of the parish or place appealing, unto the churchwardens or overseers of the parish or place from which the removal shall be; the reasonablencfs of which notice shall be determined by the justices at the quarter sessions to which the appeal is made; and if it shall appear to them, that reasonable time of notice was not given, they shall adjourn the appeal to the next quarter sessions, and then and there finally determine the same.

On all appeals to the sessions against the judgment or orders of any justices of the peace, the justices there shall cause defers of form to be rectified and amendrd, without any coil to the party, and after such amendment shall proceed to hear the truth 4nd merits of the cause.

concerning the settlement of any poor person, or upon arty proof before them there to be made, of notice of any such appeal to have been given by the proper officers to the churchwardens or overseers of any parish or place (though they did not afterwards profeente such appeal) shall at the same sessions order to the party in whose behalf such appeal shall be determined, or to whom such notice did appear to have been given, such costs and charges in the law, as by the said justices in their discretion shall be thought most reasonable and just ; to be paid by the churchwardens, overseers, or any other per-ibn, against whom such appeal shall be determined, or by the person that did give such notice; and if the person ordered to pay such colts, shall live out of the jurisdiction of the said court, any justice where such person shall inhabit, shall on re-quest to him made, and a true copy of the order for the payment of such colb produced, and proved by some credible witness on oath, by his warrant cause the same to be levied bydillrefs; and if no such distress can be had, shall commit inch person to the common gaol, there to remain by the space of zo days.

if the justices shall at their quarter sessions, upon an appeal before them there had, concerning the settlement of any poor person, determine in favour of the appellant, that such poor person was unduly removed, they dial!, at the same quarter sessions, order and award to such appellant, so much money, as shall appear to the said justices to have been reasonably paid by the patiih or other place on whose behalf such appeal was made, towards the relief of such poor person, between the time of such undue removal, and the determination of such appeal; the said money so awarded, to be recovered in the same manner as cods and charges upon an appeal are to be recovered by the datute jud mentioned.

An order of two justice:, if quashed at the sessions upon an appeal, for want of form only, is not concluftre between the two parishes.

It was moved for setting aside an order of sessions confirming an order of two justices upon appeal. But the court would hear nothing of the merits of the cause, the order of sessions being in that case final, unless there had been an error in form.

Of the Poor Rate, and other Helps towards their Relief.

THE churchwardens and overseers of the poor of every pa-riih, or the greater part of them, shall raise weekly or otherwise (by taxation of every inhabitant, parson, vicar, and other,

and

and of every occupier of lands, houses, tithes impropriate, propriations of tithes, coal mines, or saleable underwoods in the said parish) a convenient dock of flax, hemp, wool, thread, iron, and other ware and fluff, to set the poor to work j and also competent fnms for the necessary relief of the lame, impotent, old, blind, and such other among them being poor as are not able to work, and also for the putting out poor children apprentices.

Where there shall be any dispute in what parish or place ,17 c. s. r, 37, improved wastes, and drained and improved marlh lands lie, and ought to be rated; the occupiers of such lands, or houses built thereon, tithes arising therefrom, mines therein, and saleable underwoods, shall be rated to the relief of the poor, and to all other parish rates, within such parish and place which lies nearest to such lands; and if on application to the officers of such parish or place to have the same assessed, any dispute shall arise, the justices at the next sessions after such application made, and after notice given to the officers of the several parishes and places adjoining to such lands, and to all others interested therein, may hear and determine the same on the appeal of any person interested, and may cause. the same to be equally assessed, whose determination therein shall be final.

The churchwardens and overseers shall cause public notice 17c, 1.1. to be given in the church, of every rate for relief of the poor, allowed by the justices, the nextSunday after such allowance; and no rate shall be reputed sufficient to be collected, till after such notice given. — And they shall permit any inhabitant to inspect such rate at all seasonable times, paying is. and shall give copies on demand, being paid 6d. for every 24 names, —

And if any churchwarden or overseer shall not permit any inhabitant to inspect, or refuse to give copies as aforesaid, he shall forfeit 20I. to the party grieved.

If a person shall be aggrieved by any assessment, or shall ,7 <7... (. have any material objection to any person's being put in or left out of such assessment, or to the sum charged on any person or persons therein; he may, giving reasonablcnotice to the' churchwardens or overseers, appeal to the next sessions for the county, riding, division, corporation, or franchise; but if reasonable notice be not given, then they shall adjourn the appeal to the next quarter sessions after.

On all appeals from rates, the justices shall amend the same, ^ without altering such rates, with respect to other persons mentioned in the same; but if upon an appeal from the whole rate, it shall be found necessary to set afidc the same, then they shall order a new rate to be made. — And the court may award colls to either party, as in cases of settlement by the 8d 9 ff'.

True copies of the rates shall be entered in a book, by the churchwardens and overseers, within 14 days after ail appeals from such rates are determined; and they shall attest the same, by putting their names thereto; and they shall be delivered over from time to time, to the new churchwardens and over* leers, as soon as they enter into their offices, to be preserved and produced at the sessions when any appeal is to be heard.

43 EZa.It shall be lawful as well for the present as subsequent churchwardens and overseers, or any of them, by warrant from any two such justices, one whereof is of the quorum, to levy the said sums, and all arrearages, of every one that shall refuse to contribute according as they shall be aiTelTed, by ditlrefs and sale.

17 G. e. t. 38. And if sufficient distress cannot be found within the county, on oath made thereof before a judice of any other county, the goods may be levied in another county or precinct.

43 Ei. c. z. In defe£t of such didrefs, it shall be lawful for two such justices to commit such person to the common gaol, there to remain without bail or mainprize, until payment of the same.

17 G.;. r. 38. Where persons shall come into, or occupy any premises, out of which any other person aiTelTed shall be removed, or which at the time of making such rate was unoccupied; every pqrfon l'o removing from, or coming into, or occupying the same, shall be liable to pay such rate, in proportion to the time that such person occupied the same respectively, under the like penalty of didrefs, as if such person so removing had not removed, or the person coming in or occupying had been originally adessed in such rate; which proportion, in case of dispute, shall be ascertained by two justices.

Id- If there has been any irregularity of proceeding in the par-

ties didraining, and tender of amends hath been made by the said parties before an action is brought, no plaintiff shall recover in any aSion for such irregularity.

li- And if any person shall neglect to pay to such overseers, the

succeeding overseers shall levy the arrears, and shall reimburse their predecessors the same which are allowed to be due to them in their accounts.

43 £'. £. i. jf the justices perceive that the inhabitants of any parish arc

not able to levy among themselves sufficient sums for the purposes aforesaid, then the said two justices (1 shall tax, rate, and assess as aforesaid any other of other parishes, or out of any parish within the hundred, to pay such sums to the churchwardens and overseers of the said poor parish, as the justices shall think fit.

li. The father and graudfather, mother and grandmother, and

children of every poor, old, blind, lame and impotent perron, or other poor person not able to work, being of a sufficient ability, (nail at their own charges relieve and maintain every such poor person, in that manner, and according to

that rate, which by the justices of that county where such sufficient persons dwell, in their sessions shall be assessed; on pain of 20s. a.month: which penalty shall go to the use of the poor of the same parish, and be levied by some or one of the churchwardens or overseers, by warrant from two such justices (t Q.) by distress; or in defect thereof, any two such justices may commit the offender to the common gaol, there to remain without bail or mainprize, till the said forfeitures shall be paid.

Where any wife, child, or children, shall be left by their S G. husband or parents, it shall be lawful for the churchwardens or overseers, by warrant of two justices, to take andfeize so much of the goods and chattels, and receive so much of the annual rents and profits of the lands and tenements of such husband, father, or mother, as such two justices shall order and direct, towards the discharge of the parish or place where such wife, child, or children are left, for the bringing up and providing for such wife, child, or children; which warrant or order being confirmed -at the next quarter sessions, it shall be lawful for the justices there, to make an order for the churchwardens or overseers to dispose of such goods or chattels by sale or otherwise, or so much of them, for the purposes aforesaid, as the court shall think lit, and to receive the rents and profits, or so much of them as shall be ordered by the said sessions, of his or her lands and tenements, for the purposes aforesaid.

And the said churchwardens and overseers shall be accoun- Id. table to the justices at the quarter sessions for all such money as they shall so receive.

All persons running away out of their parishes, and leaving 7 J. c. 4. their families upon the parish, shall be deemed and fuller as incorrigible rogues. See the article Vagrant!.

By 17 G.z. c. 5. these offenders are ranked in a less criminal class, and are to be punished only as rogues and vagabonds.

Sec the said article Vagrant!.

If a person doth but threaten to run away, and leave his >7 G. 1.1. j. wife and children upon the parish; he shall, on conviction, before one justice by confession, or oath of one witness, be committed to the house of correction, for any time not exceeding one month.

Of the Relief and ordering of the Poor.

THE churchwardens and overseers, with theconfent of two ^El.t.z. justices (1 ^.) shall take order from time to time, for setting to work the children of all such whose parents shall not by the said churchwardens and overseers, or the greater part of them,

And the said justices, or one of them, shall send to the bonfe of correction, or common gaol, such as shall not employ themselves to work, being appointed thereunto as aforesaid.

Two or more parishes, townships, or places may join (with the approbation of any justice in or near such parish, &c. signified under his hand and seal) in purchasing, hiring, or taking any honfe or houses for the lodging, keeping, and maintaining of the poor of the said parishes ; the major part of the inhabitants assembled in veliry and consenting, and notice being first given of such public meeting for this purpose.

The churchwardens and overseers of one parish, &c. may contract with those of another, without joining, for the lodging, maintaining, and employing of the poor.

There shall be provided and kept in every parish a book, wherein the names of all persons who receive collection shall beregillered, with the day and year when they were lirft ad-mittra to have relief; and the occasion which brought them under that necessity; and yearly in Easter week, or as often as shall be thought convenient, the parishioners shall meet in vestry, or other usual place of meeting in the parish, before whom the book shall be produced, and all persons receiving collection shall be called over, and the reasons of their taking relief examined, and a new lift made and entered of such persons as they shall think fit, and allow to receive collection; and no person shall be allowed to receive collection of the parish, but by authority of one justice redding in or near such parish, or by order of the justices in felEons, except in cases of plague or (mail pox, for such families as shall be therewith infected.

No justice shall order relief to any poor person, till oath be made before him, that the same person hath applied to the parishioners in veliry, or to two of the overseers, without being relieved, and till such justice hath summoned the two overseers to appear and shew caofe why such relief should not be given.

if any churchwarden or overseer of the poor, or person authorized by bim, shall make any payments to the poor in any base or counterfeit money, one justice, on complaint, may summon the offender, and on proof of the offence, by the oath of one witness, may adjudge him to forfeit not lets than tos. nor more than 20s. to be levied by distress, and to be applied to the use of the poor.

Prison-Breaking.

Jffd. X. c. 15.

s Eiw. 137.

Iff.ff. 6sx.

I Hi-. 71.

'-[“'HOSE who have broken prison are not bailable by juf-X tices of the peace; and that for two reasons: 1. Because it carries a presumption of guilt. And, z. Because it is a fu-peradded offence to the former, for which they Hood committed.

The party may be arraigned for prison-breaking, before he be convicted of the crime for which he was imprisoned: for that it is not material whether he were guilty of such crime or not; for the words of thestatuteare, for which keiuat taken and iaprisontd.

The gaoler shall not be punished as a felon for the party's breach of prison, unless he voluntarily consented to it; but it seems to be a negligent escape in the gaoler, for which he may be punished by fine and imprisonment, because there wanted either that due strength in the gaol, or that due vigilance in the gaoler or his officers, that should have prevented it: and if gaolers might not be punished for this as a negligent escape, they would be careless either to secure their prisoners, or to retake them that escape.

If a criminal endeavouring to break the gaol, assault his gaoler, he may be lawfully lulled by him in the affray.

Process.

Process.

BY the commission of the peace, the justices in sessions have power to make-and continue processes upon indictments, against the persons indicted, until they can be taken, furren-der themselves, or beoutlawed.

Indictments and presentments, taken in theiheriiPs tourn, shall be delivered to the next sessions; who. may award process thereupon, in like form as if they had been taken before them* selves.

The law in several cases in express words directs process to be made by justices out of sessions; and in other cases by necessary implication: as where a statute doth give power to justices out of sessions to esquire, hear, and determine, there they may make process to cause the party to come and answer, other,wife they cannot proceed to hear and determine; and this may be either before or after presentment or indictment as the several statutes do require: before presentment or indictment it is called a warrant; after presentmentorindiflment it is pro* perly called process.

Wherever the king is a party to the suit (as he certainly is to all informations and indictments), the process ought to be executed by the Ihcriff himself, and not by the bailiff of any franchise.

If the party be in an house, if the doors belhut, and the sheriff (having given notice of his process) demand admittance; and the doors .be not opened; he may-break-open the doors, and enter to take the offender.

It seemeth that any one justice may bail persons indicted at thefeflions,for any offence under the degree of felony) for that the statutes relating specially to the power of justices in granting bail, do not in this case seem to take away the power, which one justice had before the making of the said statutes.

It is said, that the justices in sessions cannot issue a capias utlagatum, but mull return the record of the outlawry into the king's bench, and there process of capias utlagatum shall issue.

If one be outlawed before the justices of the peace on an indictment of felony, they may award a capias utlagatum \ for they that have power to award process of outlawry, have also power to award a capias utlagatum, as incident to their authority and jurisdiction.

By the outlawry all pctfonal chattels are vested in the king by forfeitures; but real chattels, or freehold ellates arc not vested in the king, till after inquisition found.

If a man.be indicted before justices of the peace, and thereupon outlawed, and is taken and committed to prison, the

any woman child, under the age of ten years, whether with herconsent or against it, he shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

t f/rw. to". The offence of rape is no way mitigated, by shewing that the woman at Iaft yielded to the violence, if fuel) her consent was forced by fear of death, or of duress.

U. It is net a sufficient excuse in the ravilher, to prove that the

woman is a common (trumpet; for (he is (till under the pro-f eft ion of the law, and may not be forced: nor is it any ex-cufe, that (he consented after the fast.

j H. E. 63;. The party ravished may give evidence on oath, and is in law a competent witness; but the credibility of her tellimony, and how far (he is to be believed, mull be left to the jury, and is more or less credible, according to the circumstances of facts that concnr in that tWlimony.

f*- Forinllance, if the witness be of good same; if file presently

discovered the offence, and made pursuit after the offender; fnewed circumstances and signs of the injury, whereof many are of that nature, that only women are the most proper examiners and inspectors; if the place, wherpin the fastwas done, was remote from people, inhabitants, or' passengers; if the offender fled for it; these, and the like, are concurring evidences to give greater probability to her testimony, when proved by others as well as herself.

' -

Upon the whole, rape", it is true, is amost deteftablecrimej and therefore ought severely and impartially to be punished' with death; but it mult be remembered, that it is an accusation' easily to be made, and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho'never so innocent: therefore, a wife jury will be cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, that they be not so much transported with indignation' at the heinousness of the offence, as to be over hallily carried' to the conviction of the person accused thereof, by the coni fident testimony, sometimes of malicious and false witnesses.

Recognizance.

RECOGNIZANCE is a bond of record, teflifyingtherei cognizor to owe a certain sum of money to some other; and the acknowledgment of the same is to remain upon record; and none can take it but only a j udge or officer of record, &c< Recognizances are taken from the reputed fathers of baltard children. — See appendix. No. 12.

To indi£t for felony. No. 23.

To give evidence for felony. No. 24.

For good behaviour, No. 30. Toindiaformisdemeanour, No. 48. Toanswer formisdemeanour, No. 49.

To give evidence for misdemeanour. No. 50. To keep the peace. No. 52.

Besides these, there are general recognizances.

Without sureties, No-65.

And these recognizances, in some cases, the justicCs of the peace are enabled to take by the express words of certain statutes: but in other cases (as for the peace, and good behaviour, and the like) it is rather in congruity, and by reasonable intendment of law, than by any express authority given them, cither By their commission, or by the statute law.

files or sessions,- or to take sureties for any matter or cause, they may take a recognizance. Yea, wheresoever they have authority given them-to cause a man to do a thing, there it seemeth they have in congruity power given them to bind the party by recognizance to do it; and if the party shall refuse to be bonnd, the justice may fend him to gaol.

Every obligation and recognizance, taken by justices of the peace, must be made to oar lord the king: on pain of imprisonment of any person that shall take it otherwise.

When the parties are to enter into recognizance, call them by their names thus: Yon A. B. acknowledge to owe to our ‘ sovereign lord the king, the sum of , and yon C. D.

‘ acknowledge to owe to onr sovereign lord the king, the sum of ; to be levied of yonrrespective goods and chattels, ‘ lands and tenements, for the use of onr said lord the king, ' his heirs and successors, if default shall be made in the con-‘ ditioa following: that is to say, if you the said A. B. shall make default in appearing, &c.” But the parties need not sign it. And it is nfual for the justices to mark at the foot of the examination, A. B. in 40I. to appear &c. And from such short cote make out a record afterwards.

Lord Coke fays, that arecord is a memorial or remembrance in rolls of parchment, &!c. from whence it seemeth that a recognizance ought tube ingrafted on parchment; but since there is no law which prohibits it to be engrafted on paper, it seemeth that if it shall be on paper only, and not on parchment, - it is good in law.

And when it is made up, if the justice shall only subscribe his name, without his seal to it, this is well enough; and that maybe in either of these forts, acknowledged before me, J. P. or only to subscribe his name thus, J P.

The justices shall certify their recognizances for keeping the peace, to the next sessions, that the party may be called ; and if he make default, the default shall be recorded, and the recognizance, with the record of the default, shall be sent and certified into the chancery, king's bencL, or exchequer.

But in cases of felony, the recognizances are to be certified to the general gaol delivery.

Riot, rout, and unlawful assembly.

WHEN three persons or more shall assemble them selves i naw. i^, together, with an intent mutually to a (lift one another, Dolt. c. 136, against any who shall oppose . them, in the execution of some enterprize of a private nature, .with force or violence, against the peace, or to the manifest terror of the people, whether the act intended were of itself lawful or unlawful;.if they only meet to such a purjiofe or intent, although they shall, after'depart of their own accord, without doing any thing, this is an unlawful alTembly: if after the first meeting they shall'move forward towards the execution of any such act, whether they put their intended purposes in execution or not; this, according to the general opinion, is a rout: — And if they execute such a thing in deed, then, it is a riot.

The justices of the peace (or, as it hath been resolved, one 34. Ed, 3. e, u justice) shall have power to restrain rioters, and to arrest and chastise them according to their offence; and cause them to be imprisoned and duly punished, according to the law and custom of the realm, and according to that which to them shall seem bed to do, by . their discretion and good advisement.

Butiftheriotersareabovethenumberoftwelve, theofFence tG.ft. 1. c. is greatly enhanced, and the power of one justice very much enlarged, by the act commonly called the riot aft, which is required to be read at every quarter-sessions and lect. — Every justice, (herilf, under-sheriff, and mayor, shall on notice or knowledge of any unlawful, riotous, and tumultuous assembly of persons to the number of twelve or more, together with such help as he shall command, resort to the place: and with a loud voice command, or cause to be commanded, silence to be, while proclamation is making; and after that, shall openly and with a loud voice make, or cause to be made, proclamation in these words, or like in eifeft:

And the said justices and otherofficers shall execute their offices aforesaid at the king's cods, in going and continuing in-doing their said offices, by payment thereof to be made by the sheriff, by indentures betwixt the said sheriff and justices, and other officers aforesaid, whereof the sheriff upon his account in the exchequer may have due allowance.

Search-Warrant.

A JUSTICE cannot legally grant a blank warrant for the „ Sl> 8 arrell of a Angle person, leaving it to the party to dll up, ' ' much less can he grant such a general warrant, as might have the effeflof an hundred blank warrants.

A justice cannot, upon a bare surmise, make a warrant to 4 j„jjt ,-7> break any man's house, to search for a felon, or for Itolen goods; for the jiiltices being created'by act of parliament, have no such authority granted to them by any act of parliament.

Whether the stolen goods are in a suspected house or not, , //, ;/. ,j, the officer and his affiltants in the day time may enter, the doors -being open, to make search, and is justifiable. by the warrant.

As touching the goods brought before him, if it appear to id. the justice that-they were not stolen, they are to be reitored to the poflelTor; if it appear they were stolen, they are not to -be delivered to the proprietor, but deposited in the hand of the U u 2 Ihcrilf

sheriff or conliable, to the end the party robbed may .proceed, by indifling and convicting the offender, to have restitution.

As touching the party that had the custody of the goods, if they were not ilolen, then he is to be discharged; if stolen, but not by him, bat by another that fold or delivered them to him, if it appear that he was ignorant that they were Ilolen, he may be discharged as an offender, and bound over to give evidence as a witness against him that fold them; if it appear he was knowing they were Ilolen, he mult be committed or bound over to answer the felony.

Sessions.

THE sessions of the peace is a court of record, holden before two or more justices, whereof one is of the quorum, for execution of the authority given them by the commission of the peace, and certain statutes and acts of parliament.

Such

Sessions. 359.

Such sessions only are properly called general quarter feffi- 2 Raw, 42. ons, which are holden in the four quarters of the year, in pursuance of the 2 H. 5. any other sessions holden at any other time for the general execution of the justices' authority, may be properly called general sessions, and those holden on a special occasion for the execution of some particular branch of their authority, may properly be called special sessions.

The justices shall keep their sessions in every quarter of the 12 R. 2. c. 10. year at least, and for three days, if need be; to wit, in the first week after the feast of St. Michael, in the first week after the Epiphany, in the fi.rft week after Easter, and in the first week after St. Thomas, and more often if need be.

Except in Middlesex; where the justices shall keep their 14 H. 6. c. 4. sessions twice in the year at least, and more often (if need be) for any riot or forcible entry within the said county.

N. B. How many adjournments soever shall be holden af- Rum, ml. terwards in that quarter of the year, all shall refer to the first f. 181. commencement of the sessions.

Any two justices, one whereof is of the quorum, by the # words of the commission of the peace, may issue their precept to the sheriff to summon a session, for the general execution of their authority; and such session, holden at any time within that quarter of a year, is'a general quarter session.

Any two such justices may direct their precept under their 5 telle to the sheriff, for the summons of the sessions, thereby commanding him to return a grand jury before them, or their fellow justices at a certain day and place, and to give notice . to all stewards, constables, and bailiffs of liberties, to be present and do their duties at such day and place, and to proclaim in proper places throughout his bailiwick, that such sessions will be holden at such day and place, and to attend there himself to do his duty.

And such precept should bear telle, or be dated, fifteen days An/, intrant before the return. jS'

The sheriff also shall cause a jury to appear at such days and £««* places, as the said justices, or such two or more of them as aforesaid shall appoint.

1. The justices of the peace are compellable to appear at the Dak. c. 185. sessions; for without their appearance the sessions cannot be

holden.

But a justice ought not to join in an order at sessions wherein 2 Sail.607. himself is concerned, nor ought his name to be in the caption.

— An order was quashed for that reason.

2. The custos rotulorum ought to be there himself, or by bah. c. 185. his deputy, who is the clerk of the peace. — 5. The sheriff

also, by himself or his deputy; to receive the fines, to return jurors, to execute process, and what else to his office doth appertain. — 4. All coroners. — j. The high constables, and all

The gaoler, to bring thither his prisoners, and to receive such as may be committed. — 2. The keeper of the house of correction, to give in a calendar and account of persons in his custody. — 9. All persons returned by the sheriff, by virtue of the aforesaid precept. — And the jurors not appearing according to their summons, are punishable by loss of issues, which usually make part of the eltreats of sessions. — 10. All persons returned by recognizance to answer, or to prosecute and give evidence.

All persons may freely attend at the felSons for the advancement of public justice, and for the service of the king. — And they are invited thither by a certain freedom of access, and by protection from common arreff.

No person shall act as solicitor, attorney, or agent, or sue out any process at any general or quarter-sessions, either with respect to matters of a criminal or civil nature, unlessheis admitted znd inrolled according to law; on pain of 50I. to him who shall sue in tz months, with treble costs.

Where authority is given to two justices to do any-act, the sessions may do it in all cases, except where appeal is directed to the sessions.

Justices may issue their warrants for apprehending persons charged of crimes within the cognizance of the sessions, and bind them over to appear there, although the offender be not

yet indicted.

If jurisdiction be given to the sessions, to hear and determine, ana doth not say by information, this shall be by indict-ment, and not upon information.

The sessions is alias one day, and the justices may alter their judgments, at any time whilftit continues.

It feerr.eth certain, that the sessions hath no authority to amerce any justice, for his non-attendance at the sessions, as the judge, cf assize may for the absence of any such justice at the gaol delivery: hair fares r.m if; fsttjias.

The sessions may proceed to outlawry in cases of indictments found before them: but they cannot issue a tafias utlagatum, but mud return the record of the outlawry into the king's bench, r.r.d thence process of tafias utlagatum shall issue.

The sections cannot award an attachment for contempt-in not compiling with their orders; but the ordinary and proper method is by indictment.

The indices are no: punishable for what they do in sessions: unless there be some manifest act of oppression, or wilful abuse of power.

The justices being met, the usual course is with three o-yes B„/, c> ,sJ( to proclaim the sessions, and then read the commission of the peace: then the grand jury are called and sworn, and the charge given to them.

If there be any who are to take their oaths, in order to qua- a5 C. a. c. a lify them for offices, this mull be done between the hours of nine and twelve in the forenoon, and not otherwise.

The king's proclamation against profaneness and immorality is also to be read; and likewise divers acts of parliament; against popery, the riot aft, the black aft, the act about ale meaftires, and about burying in woollen, are required to be given in charge at the sessions; the acts concerning jurors are to be read in Midsummer sessions yearly; and the Statute against bribery and corruption in eleflior.s of members of parliament is to be read at every Easter sessions.

Then the recognizances may be called, especially such as jbait. are to prosecute and give evidence, thatfo bills may be drawn and prepared.

Upon appeals to be made to the sessions against judgments or 5 orders, the justices shall cause any defect of form in such original judgments or orders, to be rectified and amended, and then shall proceed upon the merits.

In case of trespass and aflfault, the court frequently recomi Cn.Cir. 5! mends to the defendant to talk with the prolocutor, that is; to make amends for the injury done him; and if the prosecutor comes and acknowledges a satisfaction received, the court will only set a small fine on the defendant.

Sometimes the prosecutor and defendant agree, before the U. defendant pleads to the indictment; and then the defendant comes into court in his proper person, and pleads guilty to the indictment; and upon proving, by a subscribing witness, a general release executed by the prosecutor, the defendant fub-mits to a small fine, such as the court is pleased to impose.

THE sheriff hath a jurisdiction both in criminal and civil cases; and for this purposehe hath two courts, his torn fur criminal caules, which is therefore the king's court ; the other is his county court for civil causes, and this is the court of the sheriff himself.

The sheriff having a justice of the peace's warrant directed to him, shall execute the same; he need not go in person to execute it, but may authorize another to do it.

On summons, he is bound to attend the sessions of the peace, there to return his precepts, to take the charge of the prisoners, to receive fines for the king, and the like.

It seems clear, that the Ihcriff ispunishable by the justices in fclfions, for defaults in executing their writs and precepts.

No sheriff (haliexercise the office of a justice of the peace, in any county wherein he is sheriff, and in such case, his acts as a justice shall be void.

But where the same hath for time out of mind been repaired JJ. at the expence of any particular places or persons; or any particular places or persons are bound by law and ancient usage to furnish the same with benches, tables, rails, or other fixtures, they shall continue liable as before.

Summons.

IN all legal proceedings, the person complained of ought to Bun have notice of the charge laid against him, and to have an of- p. *56. portunity of being heard in his own defence. — Consequently, where a person is accused before the justices, they ought to summon the party to appear, or issue their warrant to bring him before them. The manner of convening the parties is sometimes directed by the acts of parliament creating the respective offences; which therefore ought to be pursued accordingly. — In other cases, where it is leftdiferetionary in the justices, it seem-eth most agreeable to the mildness of our laws to put the party to no more inconvenience than needs mull; and therefore, where the case will bear it, a summons* seems more apposite than a compulsory process. — But in cases of sureties of the peace, petty larcenies, and other felonies, and generally where the king is party, and also in cases between party and party, where the body of the offender is liable, a warrant is the regubr process, and not a summons.

SURETY for the peace is the acknowledging a recognizance, or bond, to the king, taken by a competent judge of record, for the keepicgf the peace. — And thisfuretyof the peace every justice of the peace may take and command, 1. As a mi-niiter, commanded thereto by a higher authority. 2. As a judge, and by virtue of his office, derived from his commission.

By the commission of the peace, one or more justices have power to cause to come before them, all those who to any of the king's people concerning their bodies, or the firing of their honfes, have used threats, to find sufficient security for the peace or their good behaviour towards the king and his people: and if they shall refuse to find such security, to cause them in the king's prisons to be safely kept, until they shall find such surety.

A wife may demand it against her husband threatening to beat her ontrageously, and a husband also may have it against his wife.

An infant under the age of 14 years may demand this surety, and it shall be granted him.

It ought, upon a jolt cause of complaint, to be granted by any justice of the peace, against any person whatsoever, under the degree of nobility, being of fane memory, whether he be a ma-giltrate or private person, and whether he be of full age, or under age. — The fafell way of proceeding against a peer, is by complaint to the court of chancery or king's bench.

If the person to be bound be in the presence of the justice, he may be immediately committed, unless he offers sureties.

The justice mar make the warrant under seal, to bring the party before himself or some other justice, or he may make it to bring the party before himself only; for he that maketh the warrant fortbe moll part hath the bell knowledge of the matter, and therefore he is the fitted to do justice in the case.

If one who fears that the surety of the peace will be demanded against him, find sureties before any justice of the same county, either before or after a warrant is issued against him, he may have a fnprrfedeas from such justice, which shall discharge him from arref: from any other justice, at the suit of the same party, for whose security he has given such surety.

Where a person authorized by warrant of a justice of the peace, to compel a man who is flickered in an house, to find sureties fur the peace or good behaviour, is denied quietly to enter into it, he may jullify breaking open the doors, in order

to take him; but he mull first signify to those in the house the cause of his coming,: and request them (ogive him admittance.

If the warrant specially dircfl that the party shall be b:ought i jfow.tzS. before the justice who made it, the officer ought not to carry him before any other.; but if the warrant be general, to bring him before any ,'justit'e' of such place! the officer has'the:‘ele£lipn ..to bring him before jvhat justice He pleaseth, and m'ay carry him' tbprifo'n'for'refusing.to find surety before such justice.' " , ''

' If the party,is carried before another justice, and not before ,3, him whoiiirue'd'the warrant, such other justice mud take the surety, andj'ihd' Him by recognizance in all points as the form of the precept doth require.' .

If.the officerarrell the party, and do not carry him before,the j(i jiiftfcc 'to find sureties; or upon the refusal of the party, if'the officer shall afrejVKIiii, and do notcarry him to the gaol, iri b.oth these.cales tKe officer.is" punifltable by the justicea for this" n'eg-lefl, 'by tndiflintnr and fine at their (eflions. — When the party comedi before the justice, he mull effa- sureties, or else the justice may'commithim; for the julhee needeth not to demand surety of him.

If a man that was bound to keep the peace, .hath broken'his bond, the justices ought of discretion to bind him anew;'but not until he be thereof convicted by due course of law. Crw

The recognizance, which the justice takes for the keeping of the peace, is rather of congruity, than by any express authority “ r'1 given either by the common law, or by statute.

The recognizance is forfeited, if the party make default of ^ c> 3_ appearance, and the same default shall be recorded.

It may also Be forfeited by any aflual violence to the person of 3 „

another, whether it be done by, the party himself, or by others through his procurement.

The.justices cannot in any case proceed against the party, for a forfeiture of his recognizance, either in relpefl of his not appearing, or breaking the peace; the recognizance itself, with the record of default of appearance, ought to be removed into some of the courts at Westminster.

He who is bound to the peace, and to appear at a certain day, f> ll0, mull appear at that day, and record his appearance, although he who craved the peace cometh not to desire that it may be continued; otherwise the recognizance cannot be discharged.

A MAN may be compelled to find sureties both for the good behaviour and for the peace; and yet the good behaviour included! the peace: and he that is boond to the good behaviour, is therein also bound to the peace.

The surety* of the good behaviour is of great affinity with that of the peace, and is provided chiefly for the preservation of the peace; and is most commonly granted either in the open iessions, or by two or three jnflices out of sessions. — Yet by the words of the commission, as also by the common opinion of the leaned, one justice alone, out of sessions, may grant this surety of the good behaviour. — But this is not usual, unless it be to prevent some great andfudden danger, especially again (I a man that is of any good ellate, carriage, or report. — And it shall be good distretion in the jnflices, that they do not grant it, but either upon {efficient cause seen to themselves, or upon the suit or complaint of others, and the same very honest and credible per-foos.

A man may be bound to his good behaviour for many causes of scandal, which give him a bad same, as being contrary to good manners only; as for consorting with women of bad same; or for {peaking words of contempt ot an inferior magistrate, as a justice of the peace, or mayor, though he be not then in the actual execution of his office; or of an inferior officer of justice, as a constable, and such like, being in the actual execution of his office.

It seems the better opinion, that no one ought to be bound to the good behaviour, for any raffi, quarrelfumc, or unmannerly words, unless they cither directly tend to a breach of the peace, or to scandalize the government, by abusing those who are in-trnfled by it with the administration of justice, or to deter an officer from doing hi; duty.

The magistrate has a discretionary power to take such surety of all those whom he shall have just cause to suspect to be dangerous, quarrelsome, or scandalous; as of those who lleep in the day, and go abroad in the night; and of such as keep suspicious company; and of such as are generally suspected to be robbers, common drunkards, and the like; and all other persons of evil same.

In general, whatsoever ad or thing is of itself a misbehvaiour, is cause sufficient to bind such an offender to good behaviour.

The judice? in sessions may transport such rogues, vagabonds, and Hardy beggars, as shall be duly convicted, and adjudged to bn incorrigible.

If the child of any vagrant, above the age of seven years, shall be committed to the house of correction, the ju dices in sessions, if they fee convenient, at any time before such child be discharged, may order such child to be placed out as a servant or apprentice to any person within their jurisdiction, who is willing to take loch child, till such child shall be of the age of :i years, or for a less time: and if any offender, who was found wandering with such child, shall be again found with the same child which was so placed out, he shall be deemed an incorrigible rogue.

Where any vagrants have been committed to the house of correction till the next sessions, if on examination of such persons no place can be found, to which they may be conveyed by a pass, the sessions shall order them to be detained and employed in the house of correction, until they can provide for themselves, or until the justices in sessions can place them in some lawful calling, as servants, apprentices, soldiers, mariners, or otherwise.

After whipping or confinement, the justice may, if he thinks convenient, by a pass, under hand and seal, cause the vagrant to be conveyed to the place of his lait legal settlement; but if it cannot be found, then to the place of his birth; or if he be under the age of 14 years, and have any father or mother living, then to the place of the abode of such. father or mother, there to be delivered to some churchwarden or over-seer.

And the justice shall make a duplicate of the pass and examination, and sign the same: and shall afterwards transmit the duplicate of the pass, annexed to the examination, to the next sessions, there to be filed and kept on record; and shall annex the duplicateof the examination to'the pass, and fend it with the same; and the said pass, examination, and duplicate thereof, shall and may be read in any court of record as evidence.

And the justice, who shall make the pass, shall with the pass cause likewise to be delivered to the condable a note or certificate ascertaining how they are to be conveyed, by horse, err:, or on foot, and what allowance such condable is to have for conveying them.

And the condable, who shall receive such pass and certificate, shall convey the person according to the direction of the psf, the next direst way to the place where lie is ordered to be ion!, if it be in the same county, riding, divisinn, corporation, or franchise; if not, he shall deliver the said person to the condable c: the firti town, pariib, or place, in the next

county.

county, riding, division, corporation, or franchise; in the direct way to the place whither he is to be conveyed, together with the pass and duplicate of the examination, taking his receipt for the same. And such constable shall without delay apply to some justice in the same county or division, who shall make the like certificate, and deliver it to such constable, who shall with all speed convey such person unto the firltparish, town, or place to which he is to be conveyed. — And so from one county or division to another, till they come to the place to which such person is sent. — And the constable, who shall deliver such person to the churchwarden, or other person ordered to receive him, by such pass, shall at the same time deliver the said pass, with the duplicate of the examination, taking their receipt for the same.

The justices in sessions shall limit what rates and allowances, 17 G. 2. c. 5. by the mile, or otherwise, shall be made, for conveying or maintaining rogues, vagabonds, or incorrigible rogues; and make such other orders for the more regular proceeding therein, as they shall think proper.

And if any petty constable shall bring to any high constable IJ. such certificate as aforesaid, together with a receipt or note from the constable to whom the person was delivered, the said high constable shall pay the rates ascertained by such certificate, taking the petty constable's receipt. — And if the high conlta-blc shall refuse or neglect to pay the same on demand, it shall be lawful for one justice, by his warrant, to levy double the sum by distress.

Where the high constable haih not money in his hand fufli- s6 C. 2. c. 34; cient to answer the said expences, the treasurer shall pay the same to such petty constable, on his producing the certificate, and such other vouchers as aforesaid.

If a petty constable, or governor of any house of correction, 17c-1- *

shall counterfeit such certificate or receipt, or knowingly permit any alteration to be made therein, he shall forfeit 50I_

And if he shall not convey, or cause to be conveyed, such vagrants, or not deliver them to the proper person; or if any constable shall refuse to receive any such person, or to give such receipt, he shall forfeit 20I. by distress and falc, by warrant of the justices in sessions, where the offence shall be committed; half to the informer, and half to the treasurer, to be applied, by him as part of the public Hock; returning the overplus upon demand, charges of distress being first satisfied.

The parish or place to which any rogue, vagabond, or in- W-corrigible rogue shall be conveyed, shall employ in work or place in some workhouse or almshouse, the person so conveyed, until he shall betake himself to some service or other employment : and if he shall refuse to work, or not betake himself to some service or other employment, the overseers may cause

him to br carried to some justice to be sent to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour.

But if the churchwarden or other person, who shall receive any person so sent, shall think the examination to be false, he may carry the person so sent before a justice, who, if he fee cause, may commit such person to the house of- correction till the next fcllions; and the ju dices there, if they fee cause, may deal with such person as an incorrigible rogue;- but the per- , son so sent shall not be removed from the place to which he' is sent, but by order of two justices, in the same manner as other poor persons are removed to the place of their settlement.

Lunatick vagrants may be apprehended, and' kept safely locked up in some secure place within the county, or precinct, as two justices shall appoint; and all charges shall be paid by the parish, township, or place, to which such person belongs, by order of two justices, directed to the churchwardens and overseers for that purpose.

If any person shall knowingly permit any rogue, vagabond, or incorrigible rogue, to lodge or take (belter in his house, barn, or other outhouse or building, and shall not apprehend and carry him before a justice, or give notice to the constable fotodo; and shall be convicted thereof by confession, or oath of one witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit not exceeding 40s. nor less than 10s. half to the informer, and half to the poor, by distress and sale; and if any charge shall be brought on any parish or place, by means of such offence, the same shall be answered to the said parish or place by such offender, and be levied by distress and sale of his goods as aforesaid: and if fuficient distress cannot be found, such offender shall be committed to the house of correction by the justice, for any time not exceeding one month.

Where any vagrant woman shall be delivered of a child or children, and become chargeable, the churchwardens or overseers may detain such woman in their custody until they can safely convey her to a justice; who shall examine her, and commit her to the house of correction until the next sessions; who may, if they fee convenient, order her to be publickly whipped, and detained in the house of correction for any further time cot exceeding six months. — And upon application by the churchwardens and overseers of the place where (he was so delivered, the justices at such sessions shall order the treasurer to pay them such a sum, as shall be adjudged a reasonable satisfaction for the charges such place has been put to on such woman's account. — And if such woman shall be detained and conveyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which (he is delivered, ifabaflard, shall not be fctt'cd in the place where so born, nor be sent thither for v.'2nt of other settlement, by a

pass.

Jsafs, by virtue of this act; but the settlement of such woman shall be deemed the settlement of such child.

And that it may appear, that the overseers have done what Barn, Art. was incumbent upon them, in ordet to avoid such settlement, Vagrant. it is requisite for the justice (as he ought to do in all other cases wherein he afteth as judge) to make a record of the whole proceedings before him; which record (as it seemeth) will be the proper evidence in such case, if the settlement shall afterwards be contested.

If any con liable, or other officer, shall bedefeflive ih his 17 G.t. c. 5, duty, in any case for which no punishment is herein before particularly provided; or if any person shall hinder the execution of this act, and shall be thereof convicted, on oath of one witness, before one justice, he shall forfeit not exceeding cl. nor under 10s. to the poor bydiltrefs; and, if sufficient distress cannot be found, mail be committed to the houie of correction to be kept to hard labour, not exceeding two months.

To defray the expences of apprehending, conveying, and id. maintaining rogues, vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues, and defraying all other expences necessary for the execution of this act, not herein before provided for, the ju dices in sessions may cause such sums as shall be necessary, to be raised in the same manner as the general county rate.

Any person aggrieved by the act of any justice out of sessions; id. in or concerning the execution of this act, may appeal to the next general or quarter sessions of the county, riding, liberty, or division, giving reasonable notice thereof; whose order thereupon shall be final.

This act, after a recital of 6 G. 1, c. 19, empowers justices 17 G. 3. c. it. to commit those vagrants, and other persons charged with small offences, either to the common gaol, or to any house of cor.

ion, within their respective jurisdictions, as to such justices shall seem moll proper, whom by any law nowin force, or hereafter to be made, they are, or shall be authorized to commit to the common gaol.

nire, or any other offence against the peace: Also it seems clear, that wherever a lHtute gives to any one justice a juris-diiition over any offence, or a power to require any person to do a certain thing ordained by Inch statute, it by implication gives a power to every such juliice to make out a warrant to bring before him any person accused of such offence, dr compellable to do the thing ordained by such statute; for it cannot but be intended, that a statute giving a person jurisdiction over an offence, doth mean also to give him the power incident to all courts of compelling the party to come before bim.

Bnt in cases where the king is no party, or where no corporal punishment is appointed, as in cases for Tenants' wages, and the like, it seemeth that a summons is the more proper process: and for default of appearance the justice may proceed ; and so indeed oftentimes it is directed by special natures

It is convenient, though not always necessary, that the party who demands the warrant be first examined on oath, touching the whole matter whereupon the warrant is demanded, and that examination put in writing.

Or at leafs it is safe to bind him over to give evidence; less afterwards when the offender shall be apprehended, or shall surrender himself, the party that procured the warrant be gone.

A justice hath power to issue a warrant to apprehend a person suspected of felony. — For the justices are judges of the reasonablenels of the suspicion, and when they have examined the party acculing, touching the reasons of his suspicion, if they find the causes cf suspicion to be reasonable, it is now become the justices' suspicion as well as his.

Yet insomuch as justices claim this power rather by connivance, than any express warrant of law, and since the undue execution of it may prove so highly prejudicial to the reputation as well as the liberty of the party, a justice cannot well be too tender in his proceedings of this kind, and seems to be punishable not only at the suit of the king, but also of the party grieved, if hegrant any such warrant, without such probable cause as might induce a candid and impartial man to fuf-pecl the party to be guilty.

It is safe, but perhaps not necessary, in the body of the warrant to shew the place where it was made; yet it seems ne-cdiary to set forth the county, in the margin at lead, if it be not set forth in the body.

It may be directed to the sheriff, bailiff, constable, or to any indifferent person by-name who is no officer; for the justice may authorize any one to be his officer, whom he pleases to make such; yet it is moss adviseable to direst it to the con-ffableof the precinct wherein it is to be executed, for that no

other con liable, and a fortion no private person is compellable to serve it.

In the case of an act of parliament, if the act directeth that a justice shall1 grant a warrant, and doth not say to whom it shall be directed, by consequence of law it mud be directed to the con liable, and it cannot be directed to the sheriff, unless such power is given in the act.

The warrant, especially if it be for the peace or good behaviour, or the like, where sureties are to be found or required, ought to contain the special cause and matter whereupon it is granted, to the intent the party upon whom it is to be served may provide his sureties, and take them with him to the justice to be bound for him; but if the warrant be for treason, murder, or felony, dr other capital offence, the warrant of the justice may be to bring the party before him, to make answer to such things or matters generally, as shall be objected against him on the king's behalf.

The warrant may issue to bring the party before the justice who granted the warrant speciailj, and then the officer is bound to bring him before the same justice; but if the warrant be to bring him before any justice, then it is in the election of the officer to bring him before what justice of the county he (the officer) thinks lit, and notin the election of theprisoner.

Finally, it ought to be under the hand and seal of the justice who makes it out.

If any person, against whom a warrant shall be issued, shall escape out of the jurisdiction of the justice granting the warrant; any justice for the county or place, where such person shall so escape or be, upon proof on oath of the handwriting of the justice granting such warrant, shall indorse his name thereon; which shall be a sufficient authority to the person bringing such warrant, and to all other persons to whom the same was originally directed, to execute the same in such other county or place; and to carry the offender before the justice who tndorfed the warrant, or some other justice or justices of that county, if the offence be bailable, and the offender be ready to give bail for his appearance at the next affixes or feffi-ons for the county or place where the offence was committed; and such justice or juliices shall take bail accordingly, and shall deliver the recognizance together with the examination or confession of the offender, and all other proceedings relating thereto, to the constable or other person, who shall (on pain of tol. to him who shall fuc) deliver over the same to the clerk of assize, or clerk of the peace, where the offender is required to appear. — And if the offence is not bailable, or he shall not give bail to the satisfaction of the justice before whom he is brought, the'constable or other person shall carry the offender before a justice of the proper county or place where the offence was committed, there to be dealt with according to law.

Weights and Measures,

A STANDARD of weights 3nd measures is to be kept 11 B. 7. c. 4. f~\ in market towns, at which balance all the inhabitants may freely weigh without paying any thing; and justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and stewards of franchises may enqaire of offenders against this ordinance, and do execution of them that be found faulty.

The mayors, and other head officers in market towns, shall twice a year or oftner cause all weights and measures within the same, to be brought before them, and examined; and such as they find defective, to be broken and burnt; and the offender shall forfeit to the mayor or other officer, for the first

But after all, Dr. Burn observes, notwithstanding the pu-nishments aforesaid, appointed by statute, for felling by false weights and measures; yet the same is also an offence' at the common law, and consequently may be punished by indictment, fine, and imprisonment.

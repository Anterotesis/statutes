ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S JUSTICES OF THE PEACE FOR THE COUNTY OF ESSEX,

THIS SUMMARY OF THOSE LAWS WHICH UNIFORMLY REGULATE HIS CONDUCT

AS A MAGISTRATE,

TO THE

HONOUR OF HIS SOVEREIGN, ANP TO THE BENEFIT AND HAPPINESS OF THAT COUNTY,

WITH UNFEIGNED IS DEDICATED, RESPECT, BY HIS MOST OBLIGED FRIEND,

AND FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT,

THE EDITOR,

[ i ]

TO THE

READER.

THE high Estimation in which Dr. Burns Work, entitled, The Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, has long been ie-. fervedly holden, encourages the Editor of the following Sheets to hope, that another Struct ture raij'ed, with a similar Design, on Jb J'olid a Foundation, though to a much less elevated Height, will not be deemed unworthy of the public Notice. It claims very little, Merit, but what is derived from a new Arrangement of that iifeful Information, for which this Country is so much indebted to the Labours of the eminent Compiler already mentioned.

Its merit, if it has any, chiefly consists in pointing out more immediately to the eye of the Magistrate, who may be supposed to have many other engagements on his hands, that line of ConduSl, which, in almost every a Enter -

[ ii ]

Emergency, it is his Duty to ptirfue. The Authorities, as well from the Common, as the Statute-Law, are indeed less numerous than in many other Books of this Kind; yet it is hoped, that they are sufficiently copious for Direction how to proceed in every ordinary Cafe, which may occur. The Statutes, as to every Thing material, are faithfully recited: and the' J'ome technical Expressions, not of the EJfence of the Law, may for Brevity's Sake, be omitted, the Editor flatters himself, that what remains will be abundantly sufficient to guard the Person who consults them from any Error in his Decision. Adjudged Cafes, for the Confirmation of his Judgment may be found at large in many very judicious Collections of this Sort: The Work of Lord Dudley and Ward, and T. Cunningham, Esq; entitled, the Law of a Justice of Peace and Parish Officer, &c. is a mofi valuable Collection of Information on this Subject. And the Magistrate will find it prudent to have such' useful Books of Reference as that Compilation, and also Dr. Burn's Justice of the Peace, always at his Hand. But with all these at his Command, he nevertheless fiaiids in Need of same more obvious Direction,

when

[ iii ]

when he is wiping to dispatch the Business which presents itj'elf with Expedition, Safety, and Satisfaction to him]elf and others.

It is well known that several Compilations of a similar Nature with this have been heretofore offered to the Public, imder a great Variety of Pities' and Descriptms: And there is no Doubt, that the Magistrate has derived no inconsiderable Advantage from the Lights communicated to him by such Publications: And — valeant quantum valere poffint — is our sincere Desire: We by no Means wifi to raise the Reputation of the following Work, by depreciating the Merits of any other. Phe Reader is left at full Liberty f and this Liberty he certainly would take, whether we indulged him with it or notJ to call to his Afffance those Productions, which he thinks mofl likely to direB, secure, and satisfy him in the Discharge of his Duty.

In the mean Pime, when a Matter of Doubt and Difficulty is before him f and such he must expeB will sometimes occur) he will be happy to avail himjelf of that liberal Sentiment of one of the mofl illustrious Ornaments of this or any other Nation. " Where the Magistrate appears to have been misguided a % by

[ iv ]

by an erroneous "judgment, without any Purs pose of doing ill, GOD forbid, fays this venerable Personage, that the Courts of Law f:ould not give him Credit for the Purity of his Intention; and put the moji favourable Construction on his Gonduft, that the Cafe can possibly admit of.

This is, in Subfance, the Declaration, which, coming from such respectable Authority, has doubtless encouraged many to engage in the useful Employment of a Justice of the Peace, who would otherwise have been very cautious of exposing themselves to the difa-greeable Gonsequences oj a faux pas in interpreting the Laws. The Indulgence here given emboldens those, who are disposed to aid, under the DireBions of an honest Intention, and a plain Underfunding, freely to exercise their bef Judgment -, No longer apprebenfve, that the Want of Form, or the Omission of same legal PmBilio may bring them within the Reach oj the Censures of a superior Court.

It it not however injinuated, that Indifference or wilful Negligeftce is at any Rate excnfeable in interpreting or inforcing a plain andpojitive Statute: On the contrary, frequent Occajjons will offer themfdv.es, wherem

[ v ]

it is impossible to be too minutely precise $ because in such Cafes, every Advantage will assuredly be taken of any Want of Accuracy, or Inattention to the Letter of the Law: As a Proof of this, and to convince the Magistrate of the absolute Necefjity of extreme Carefulness in his Duty, it may not be amiss to observe, that Dr. Burn enumerates not less than twenty Infiances, in which an Order of Removal has been, or is liable to be, quashed, on Account of same apparently .injignif eant Error in the mere Matter of Form: All therefore which is intended by the Encouragement bolden forth, as above, is to remove from the Mind of a well-meaning, but timorous Magistrate, the Apprehension of something more, perhaps, than Genfure, for an involuntary Error in his Conduit: But no Licence is hereby given him to trifle with the obvious DireBions of a Statute, or to adopt a Latitude of Interpretation, which is neither safe nor warrantable.

It was certainly an Inflame of equal Candour and Wisdom to encourage, as much as possible, those Persons to flep forward, who, though their Rank and Situation in Life as well as their liberal Education marked them as mofl proper for this Office, had yet

[ vi ]

been found too generally averse from engaging in it. We will not allow ourselves to impute this Backwardness to a mere Love of Dffii pation, or a mere Difiike to Business. We are willing to think, that there are very few Individuals of the above Description, who would not feel great SatisfaBion in finding themselves so materially serviceable to their < Country, in the Discharge of an Office so important to the Suppression of Vice, and to the Advancement and Security of the public Welfare: We havefeen them chearfully foregoing the Comforts of domestic Life, and readily withdrawing their Attention from their private Concerns, in Order to devote their Lime, and same, even their Health and Fortune to the necessary Duties of a Military Life: Whence is it then that so few have been found equally ready to dedicate some Portion of their Leisure Hours to the Preservation of public Peace, and to the Maintenance of good Order and Decency among their Neighbours? It could only have arisen from the Apprehension of some more than ordinary Obfiacles and Impediments: They must surely have been deterred by the Confederation, that, in Order to attain, to a competent Knowledge of the Duties of a Magistrate, a tedious, thorny Path was to

[ vii ]

be pursued -, inhere no [mall Share of Difir cullies would meet them by the Way, and after all their Labour, no inconsiderable Danger of miscarrying would be incurred, even under the heft Information, which, till of late Tears, they were able to procure.

It has been our happier Lot, to find these Objections in a great Measure removed: We have seen, what Light has been thrown on the Study of the Municipal and Statute Laws, by the ingenious, elegant, and learned Commentaries of that accomplished Writer, Sir William Blackstone: And we have good Reason to hope, that the Chair of Magistracy will in future more easily be filled by PerJ'ons of Consequence and RespeBability, well qualified for this useful Department in Society; when we refiedl, that the Study of the common Law makes at this Time a very considerable Part of Academical Education.

But if no such Advantages as these fub-fified, the excellent Work of Dr. Burn would alone be fifficient to remove the principal Discouragements, which formerly deterred such, as were not inured to the Habits of close Enquiry, and toilsome Researches. Since that Work has been so universatty received, and so jufily admired and approved, the

[ via ]

Justice of the Peace has seldom been at a Loss for necessary Information in almost every pofible Cafe: And perhaps the only Apology . which can be offered for hazarding the following Attempt, when a Work, so deservedly efeetnedis in almost every Hand, is this: Lhat the four Volumes cj Dr. Burn, though no Ma-gijlrate ought to be without them, as Books of Reference, comprize much more, than it is necessary for a Justice of the Peace to invefigate, in the ordinary Duties of his Office: Prom these, undoubtedly, much satis-faBory Information may be derived on Sub-jeSts of no inconsiderable Importance, though not immediately conneBed with the Duties of a Magistrate.

If the following Work pall be found in any Degree to facilitate the Administration of Justice, by more obviously exhibiting all that is written in the Law on every ordinary SubjeB, the Editor flatters himself, he pall have rendered no inconsiderable Service to his Brethren in the Commifion; and will think his Labours amply recompensed by their favourable Acceptance of his befl Endeavours,

Accessary.

ACCESSARY is one that /> concerned in the felony by commandment, aid, or receipt.

In high treason, there are no acceflhries, either before i It,-.It's Sip.

or after; for all are principals___In cases that are criminal, 613.

but not capital, there are no accefi'aries__But as to felonies

by act of parliament, those that counsel or command the offence, arc accellaries before; and those that knowingly receive the offender, arc accessaries after.

The buyer or receiver offtolen lead, iron, copper, brass, ^G-i. c.-fi. bell-metal, or folder, 'knowing them to be ilolen, may be convicted, although the principal hath not been convicted ; and shall be transported for fourteen years.

Every person, who shall buy or receive any (lolcn jewel or J0 G. j. c. 42. jewels, or any stolen gold or iilver plate, watch or watches, knowing the same to have been Ilolen, accompanied with a burglary actually committed in Healing the same, or to have been feloniously taken by a robbery on the highway, shall be triable, as well before conviction of the principal felon, whether he be in or out of custody, as after his conviction: and if such person, so buying or receiving, shall be convicted thereof, he shall be guilty of felony, and trans-

From whence it seems dearly to follow, that there may be an ajfatilt, which will not amount to an affray.

Any one who fees others fighting, may lawfully part them, , r-c. and also ltay them till the heat be over, and then deliver them to the constable to be carried before a justice, to find sureties for the peace.

A constable is bound at his peril to use his bell endeavours 1 Haw. 137. to part an affray; and to demand the assistance of others, which if they refuse to give him, they are punishable with fine and imprisonment. — And he may either carry the often-

ported for 14 years.

N affray is a public offence to the terror of the ling's ful-jccls; so called because it affrighteth and maketh men

afraid.

der before a just ice, to find sureties for the peace, or he may imprison him of his own authority for a reasonable time, till the heat be over, and also afterwards detain him till he find such surety by obligation, — But a constable hath no power to arrestaman for an affray done out of his own view, without a warrant from a justice, unlessa felony were done, or likely to be done; for it is the proper business of a constable to prc-serve the peace, and not to punish the breach of it. t Ifow. 137. A justice of the peace cannot without a warrant authorize the arrest of any person for att affray out of his own view; yet he may make his warrant to bring the offender before him, in order to compel him to find sureties for the peace.

Alehouses.

IF an alehouse lodges and entertains travellers, it is also an inn.

Two justices (1 may esquire of innholders, and of all and Angular other persons, who shall offend in the abuse of weights and measures, or in the sale of victuals. *

5 G. 3. t. 46. Every, person, lawfully convicted of felling ale or beer, or other exciseable liquors, by retail, without licence (except in 'fairs, and except retailers of spirituous liquors without 9 G. 3. c. 6, licence, for whom other penalties are provided by law) shall forfeit for the first offence 40s. and also the colls and expences of conviction; if not paid within 14 days after conviction, the offender to be imprisoned for one month, unless he shall sooner pay the penalty, and the colls,; for the second offence 4I. and also the colls, and expences of conviction; if not paid within one week, to be imprisoned two months, unless he shall sooner pay the penalty, and the colls; for the third offence 61. and also the colls and expences of conviction; if not paid within three days, to be imprisoned for three months, unless he shall -sooner pay the penalty, and the cods; and the like penalty for every other offence after the third, as for the third offence. All which colls and expences shall be ascertained by the justice before whom the offender shall be convicted. One moiety of all which penalties and forfeitures shall be to the king; and the other moiety, and all such costs, charges, and expences, to the prosecutor. — The same to be heard and determined by one justice : who shall fsummon the party accused, and the' witnesses; and shall proceed to hear the matter, and examine witnesses on oath, and give judgment; and if he convict the party accused, and such party shall refuse to pay the penalty.

with the colls, he shall issue his warrant for apprehending and Committing to prison every such offender, for such time, and in such manner, as the nature of the offence shall require.

Where a justice shall suspect that any person fells without 56c. e, licence, he may call such person before him, and also any excise-officer' to produce his Hock-book ; and may examine such officer on oath in what manner he charges such person, and how such person pays the duties; and'if it shall appear, that such person is surveyed as a victualler or retailer, and is-chargcdwith the same duties that victuallers and retailers arc charged with, he shall be deemed an alehouse-keeper, victualler, retailer, or feller thereof.

Witness neglecting or refusing to appear upon summons at 5 <? 3. the time-and place appointed, without a reasonable excuse to be allowed by such justice, or appearing and refusing to be . examined on oath and give evidence, shall forfeit 20s.

And if any person shall think himself aggrieved by the 5 <7. 3. conviction of such justice, he may appeal to the next quarter-sessions.

If any person shall fell or deliver any beer or ale, to any 4 '] c. person that shall then fell beer or ale as a common tipler or alehousekeeper, (except it be for the use of his houshold only) the same person not having licence to fell ale or beer; he shall forfeit for every barrel 6s. 8d. and so proportionably for other quantities; half to the poor, and half to him that shall sue in sessions, by action of debt, information, indictment, or presentment.

No licence shall be granted to any person to keep a com- -G--mon inn or alehouse, but at a general meeting of the justices ~6G": acting in the -division where the said person dwells, to be holden for that purpose, on the lirft day of September yearly,'

or within twenty days after, and not at any other time__

This shall not alter the power or the time of granting li- 2 cences, in cities and towns corporate. " '

The day and place for granting licences shall be appointed 26 G. by two or more justices for the division, by warrant under their hands and seals, at lead: ten days before such meeting, directed to the high constables, requiring them to order their petty constables, or other peace officers, to give notice to the several innkeepers and alehousekeepers within their respective conllablewicks, of the day and place of such meeting. And all licences granted at any other time and place shall be void.

— And no licence shall be granted to any person not licensed the year preceding (except in cities or towns corporate) unless he produce a certificate under the hands of the minister and the major fart of the churchwardens and overseers, or else of three or four reputable and substantial houlhoiders of the place, setting forth that such person is of good same and of sober life and conversation; and it shall be mentioned in B 2 such

the licence shall be void.

A mandamus will not lie to compel the justices to license any person. '

No justice of the peace, being a common brewer of ale or beer, innkeeper, or distiller, or a feller of or dealer in ale or spirituous liquors, or interested in any of the said trades, or being a victualler or malfter, shall be capable, or have any power to grant licences for felling ale or beer or any other liquors, but the same shall be void.

The person licensed shall enter into a recognizance in 10I. with two sureties in 5I. each, or one surety in 10I. as well against the uling of unlawful games, as also for the uling and maintenance of good order and rule, to be had and used within the same.

These three things are especially recommended to the justices' care, 1. That no alehousekeeper, upon the Lord's day, should receive, or suffer to remain, any persons whatsoever, as their guelts, in any of their houses or other places, to tipple, eat or drink; other than travellers, and such as come upon necessary business. 2. That they suffer no person whatever, resorting to their houses only to eat and drink, to remain there after the hour of nine in the evening in winter, and ten in summer. 3. That they suffer no person, resorting to their houses only to eat and drink, to remain tipling there above one hour, other than travellers.

. The recognizance, with the condition thereof, fairly written or printed, shall forthwith, or at the next sessions at far-theft, be sent or returned to the clerk of the peace, under the hands of the justices, to be by him entered or filed among the records. — And for every licence granted, without taking such recognizance 5 and for every such recognizance taken, and not sent or returned; every justice signing such licence, shall forfeit 3I. 6sl 8d. to him who shall sue, together with coils. — The clerk of the peace shall keep a regiller or calendar of all such recognizances, and shall deliver to the justices, at the meeting for granting licences, a true copy of such regiller or calendar. — And for every recognizance shall be paid by the clerks of the justices taking such recognizances, to the clerk of the peace, for filing or recording the same, &c. is. which shall be paid to the clerks of the said justices, by the persons licensed, over and above the fees payable to the said justices' clerks.

t. The justices shall have power, in their quarter-sessions, to enquire of all such persons as shall be admitted and allowed to keep any alehouse or tiplinghouse, and that they be so bound by recognizance, if they have done any act whereby they have forfeited the same recognizance, and they shall upon such presentment or information award process against every

such person so presented or complained of before them, to

ftiew why he should not forfeit his recognizance ; and ill all have power to hear and determine the same, by all such ways and means, as by their discretion shall be thought good.

Any justice, on complaint or information that such licensed 20 G. 2. r.31. person hath committed-.any act, whereby in the judgment of such justice the recognizance may be forfeited, may, by summons under hand and seal, require such person to up-pear at the general or quarter-sessions, then and there to answer to the matter of such complaint or information; and also may bind the complainant, or any other person in recognizance, to appear and give evidence; and the sessions 'may direct the jury, which shall there attend for the trial of traverses, or some other jury of twelve honeit and substantial men, to be then arid there impannelled by the sheriff without fee, to enquire thereof; and if the jury find that such person hath done any act, whereby the recognizance is broken, such act being specified in such complaint or information, the court may adjudge him guilty; which verdict and adjudication shall be final j and thereupon the court shall order the recognizance to be ellreated into the Exchequer, to be levied to his majesty's use; and the said person shall be disabled to fell any ale, &c. for three years. Provided, that the julliccs, at the request of the prosecutor, or of the party complained of, or either of his sureties, may adjourn the trial to the then next sessions.t — And if any person shall be disabled, by conviction, to fell ale, beer, cyder or perry, he shall, by the same conviction, be disabled to fell any spirituous liquors, any licence before obtained for that purpose notwithstanding j which said conviction shall be certified to the next sessions, to be filed amongst the records.

If any licensed person shall die or remove out of his house 2(, 29 G. 2. so licensed, his executors, administrators or assigns, or the occupier thereof, may continue during the residue of the term, without any new licence or certificate.

If any alehouse shall become empty or unoccupied after the ge- ,9 <j. 2. c. 12. neral day for licensing (the occupier whereof was duly licensed the year preceding) two justices at a petty sessions may grant a licence to any new tenant- or occupier till the next general licensing day, obtaining first a certificate as abovementioned.

The justices in Easter sessions yearly (and mayors in cor- % EUc. 9. porations) shall rate the price of all barrels, kilderkins, firkins, and other vessels to be sold for ale or beer to be uttered therein: Arid if any cooper-shall not fell the same according to such rate, lie shall forfeit 3s. +d.; half to the king, and half to him that shall sue.

If any apprentice shall flee into any other shire, the justices 5 £/. c, 4. may ifluc1 writs of capias to the sheriffs of the counties, to take his body, that he may be put in prison, till he finds sufficient surety well and honestly to serve his mailer.

If a justice shall ifl'ue a warrant against such person, and he H 55* i shall escape.into another shire,' the constable or other person, on having the warrant indorsed by a justice in such other . shire, may arrest him there, and carry him before a justice in such other shire, if the offence is bailable, to find bail, or else shall carry him back before a justice in the shire from whence the warrant did first issue.

If an)- apprentice shall absent himself from his matter's fer- 6 C. 3. c. 53. vice, before the term of his apprenticeship shall be expired, he shall, at any time thereafter, whenever he shall be found (so it be within seven years after the expiration of his term) be compelled to fare his said mailer, for so long time as he shall have absented himself; unless he shall make satisfaction to his mailer for the ldfs he shall have sustained by such absence; and if he shall refuse so to serve, or to make satisfaction, the mailer may complain upon oath to one justice where he shall reside, who shall issue his warrant for apprehending such apprentice. And such justice, on hearing the complaint, may determine what satisfaction shall be made to such matter by the apprentice. And if the said apprentice shall not give (ccurity to make satisfaction according to such determination, such justice may commit him to the honfc of correction for any time'not exceeding three months.

Persons aggrieved by such determination, order, or warrant of the justice (except any order of commitment) may appeal to the next sessions.

Provided, that, nothing herein shall extend to the stannaries in Devon or Cornwall; or to impeach or lefl'en the jurisdiction of the chamberlain of London, or of any other court within the said city, touching apprentices; nor to any apprentice, whose master shall have received with him the sum of 10I.

Arraignment.

ARRAIGNMENT is nothing else but the calling the of* fender to tf^e bar of the court, to answer the matter charged upon him.

The prisoner on his arraignment, though under an indictment of the highell crime, must be brought to the bar without irons and all manner of lhackles or bonds, unless there be a danger of escape, and then he may be brought with irons.

Arrest.

POWER is given to the justices of the peace, to arrest all those whom they find by indictment, or by ftifpicion, and to put them in prison.

By the justices' oath of office, the warrant ought not to be directed to the party, but to some indifferent person, to execute it.

Constables and others may, on having the warrant indorsed by a justice in another county, into which an offender shall have escaped, arreff an offender in such other county, and carry him before the justice who indorsed the warrant, or some other justice or justices of such other county, if the offence is bailable, to find bail; or else Ihajl carry him back again before a justice in the county from whence the warrant did first issue.

Any justice, or the sheriff, may take of the county any number that he shall think meet, to pursue, arrest, and imprison traitors, murderers, robbers, and other felons; or such as do break, or go about to break, or disturb the king's peace: and every man, being required, ought to assist and

aid them, on pain of fine and imprisonment_____Where a

justice, sheriff, or other officer, is enabled to take the power Of the county, it seemeth they may command and ought to have the aid and attendance of all knights, gentlemen, yeomen, husbandmen, labourers, tradesmen, servants, mid apprentices, and of all other persons being above the age of fifteen years, and able to travel — And in such case it is referred to the discretion of the justice, sheriff, or other officer, what number they will have to attend on them, and how and after what manner they shall be armed or otherwise furnished.

1. Doors may be broken open upon a warrant from a justice of the peace, to find sureties for the peace or good behaviour — 2. An officer upon any warrant from a justice, either for the peace or good behaviour, or in any case where the king

Arrest. 13

king is party, may by force break open a man's knife, to 2 ir„w. 86. arrest the offender. 3. On awarrant to search for stolen goods, 1 Hmu. 137. the doors may be broke open, if the goods are there; and if1 they are not there, the constable seems indemnified, but he that made the suggestion, is punishable. 4. Where forcible . entry or detainer is found by inquisition before justices of the peace, or appears on their view. 5.. On the warrant of a justice of the peace for the levying of a forfeiture, in execution of a judgment, or conviction for it, grounded on any statute, which gives the whole or any part of such forfeiture to the king. 6. Where an affray is made in a house, in the view or hearing of the constable, he may break open the doors to take them. 7. If there be disorderly drinking or noise in a house, at an unseasonable'time of night, especially in inns, taverns, or alehouses, the constable or his watch, demanding entrance, and being refused, may break open the doors, to fee and suppress the disorder.

If the constable come unto the party, and require, him to Dait.e. tjS. go before the justice, this is no arrest nor imprisonment. -When a private person hath arrested a felon, or one fuf- r II. 11, 5S9. fpcfted of felony, he may deliver him to the constable, who may either carry him to gaol, or to a justice of the peace, or he may carry him immediately to a justice of the peace.

If the ^constable, or his watch, hath arrested affrayers, or a if.//. 95. persons drinking in an alehouse at an unseasonable time of night, he may put the persons in the flocks, or in the prison, if there be one in thevill, 'till the heat of their passion or intemperance is over, tho' he deliver them afterwards; or 'till he can bring them before a justice.

If the arrest is by virtue of a warrant to bring the party be- 1 //.jjfe, fore the justice who granted the warrant specially, then the 2 H. 11.112. officer is bound to bring him before the same justice; but if the warrant be to bring him before any justice of the county, then it is in the eleilion of the officer, to bring him before what justices he thinks fit, and not in the cleflion of the prisoner.'

And when he hath brought him to the justice, yet he is in a //, //. I20i law Hill in his custody, till the justice discharge, or bail, or commit him.

. No action shall be brought against any constable or other 24. c. 2. e. 44.

officer, or person ailing by his order, and in his aid, for any

thing done in obedience to the warrant of a justice of the

peace, until demand hath been made of the perusal and copy

for six days after such demand.

ASSAULT is an attempt or offer, with force and violence; to do a corporal hurt to another, by linking at him with or without a weapon ; or by any other such like aft, done in an angry, threatening manner.

One charged with an assault and battery, may be found guilty of the assault, and yet acquitted of the battery; but every battery includes an assault.

If an officer, having a lawful warrant, lay hands on another to arrcll him, or if a parent in a reasonable manner chastise a child, a mailer his apprentice, a school-mallerhis scholar; in all these cases, and such like, it is justifiable. -Where a man in his own defence beats another who first affaults him, he may take advantage thereof, both upon an indictment, and upon an action.

Bail.

BAIL lignifies the delivery of a man out of custody, upon Balts, PI. 96.

the undertaking of one or more persons for him, that he shall appear at a day limited, to answer and be jellified by the law. — The difference between bail and mainprise is, that mainpernors are only surety, but bail is a custody.

If a person be brought before a justice, if it appears that Buie's, PI. 9S. no feloriy is committed, he may discharge him; but if a felony be committed, tho' it appears not that the party accused is guilty, yet he cannot discharge him, but mull commit or bail him.

In case of homicide, the offender is not bailable. ihfl. j36.

If a person has dangeronfly wounded another, the justice ought to be very cautious how he takes bail, till the year and day be pall.

No dillinftion between such homicide as is malicious, and that which happens by misadventure or in self-defence.

Any two justices {1 ijJ.) may of common right bail persons indicted tit the sessions.

If a person be arrelled for manjlaugliler, or felony, or suffi- i&iP.&Hf-non thereof, being bailable by law, he shall not be let to baile-1V or mainprise by any justices, but in open sessions, except it lie by two justices at the leall (1 QJ and the same to be present together at the time of the said bailment.

And the said justices, or one of them, being of the quorum, shall take the examination of the said prisoner, and information of them that bring him, and the same, or as much thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, shall be put in writing before they make the bailment: Which examination, together with the bailment, the said justices shall certify at the next general gaol delivery to be holden within the limits of their commission.

And the said justices shall have power to bind all such by recognizance as do declare any thing material to prove the offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery to give evidence against the party on his trial And shall certify the same in like manner.

In London, Middlesex, and in other cities and towns corporate, justices may let prisoners to bail, as they might be. fore this act ; but when they do bail, they are to take and certify the bail and examination as is here directed. iJP.fess.t. c.*. By the declaration of rights, excessive bail ought not to be required.

2 Ham. qo. To refule bail, where the party ought to be bailed, is a misdemeanor punishable by indictment.

. H. V. 97. Admitting bail, where it ought not, is punishable by the judges of assize by fine; or punishable as a negligent escape at common law.

Burn. V. I. p. Altho' the constable by his own authority, without any *51. warrant of commitment, may carry offenders to gaol, yet,

since the inflitution of the office of justices of the peace, it is better that they be carried before a justice, to be sent by him to gaol by warrant of commitment.

Xi. The warrant of commitment ought to set forth the cause

especially; that is to say, not for treason, or felony in general, but treason for. counterfeiting the king's coin, or felony for feeding the goods of fuels a one to fetch a <value, and the like; that the court may judge whether the offence is such, for which a prisoner ought to be admitted to bail.

And if any person shall happen to be (lain by such burglar, in endeavouring to apprehend him, the executors or admini-llrators of such person (lain shall have the like certificate; which certificate shall be inrolled by the clerk of the peace of the county in which it shall be granted; for which he shall have is. and no more: And the said certificate shall be once assigned over; and the original proprietor, or the assignee of the same, shall by virtue thereof be discharged from all manner of parish and ward offices, within the parish and ward where the felony was committed.

Certiorari.

A CERTIORARI is an original writ, issuing out of the Ca-ihrari,whac.

court of chancery or the king's bench, directed in the king's name to the judges or officers of inferior courts, commanding them to certify, or to return the records of a cause depending before them, to the end the party may have the more sure and speedy justice, before the king or such justices as he shall assign to determine the cause.

The justices of the peace may deliver or fend into the Belt. r. 195. king's bench, indictments found before them, or recognizances of the peace taken before them, or force recorded by them, without any certiorari.

Certiorari.

A certiorari lies in all judicial proceedings, in which a writ of error does not lie'; and it is a consequence of all ill-ferior j urisdictions erected by act of parliament to have their proceedings'returnable in the king's bench.

And therefore a certiorari lies to j ullices of the peace, even in such cases which they are impowered by ilatute finally to hear and determine.

If a certiorari for the removal of ah indictment before jaf-'tices of the peace be not delivered, before the jury be sworn for the trial of it, the justices may proceed.

If a supersedeas come out ofa'superior court, to the justices, they ought to surcease, altho' the supersedeas be awarded against- law; for they are not to dispute the command of a superior court, which is a warrant to them.

Every return of a certiorari ought to be under seal. And altho' the cijlos rotnlarum keep the records, yet mull' the justices, to whom it is directed, return the' certiorari; and therefore if it is directed to the justices of the peace, and the clerk of the peace only return it, nothing is thereby removed.

A return was in paper (and not upon parchment); and for that reason was held by the court not good.

Upon a certiorari to remove an indictment of a riot,' or forcible entry, or the like, the return mull have these words, as also to hear am! determine divers felonies, &c. according to the commission ; for if the return mentions only that they arc justices of the peace, without such words, the return is insufficient.

Cheat.

CHEATS, which arc punishable by the common law, may in general be described to be deceitful practices, in defrauding, or endeavouring to defraud another of his known right, by means of some artful device, contrary to the plain rules of common itonclly.

If any person shall falsely and deceitfully obtain, or get into his hands or possession, any money, goods, &c. of any other person, and shall be convicted thereof, by examination of witness'es, or confcliion, at the assizes or fclfions, or by action in any court of record., he shall have such punishment by imprisonment, pillory, or other corporal pain (except death) as the court shall appoint. Saving to the party grieved such remedy, by action or otherwise, for the goods

so obtained, as he might have had by the common law_______

And two justices (1 *£.) may call and convent, by process or otherwise, t0theaffi7.es or sessions, any person suspected, and commit or bail him to {he next assizes or sessions.

All such persone shall be deemed offenders again!! the Jaw 30 G.z. <-.24. and public peace; and the court, before whom any such offender shall be tried, shall, on conviction, order him to be .3 put in the pillory, or publickly whipped, or to be trans-

ported, as soon as conveniently may be, for seven years___

5' And if die party, charged as being the offender, shall be j committed to prison, or admitted to bail, to answer the mat-ters complained of at the next sessions or assizes, the said f. justice shall bind over the profeentor to appear and prosecute such offender with effect; and if such goods, so fraudulently obtained, appear to such justice to exceed the value of 20I.

Those that pay no church rates, shall have no vote in affairs relating to it, except it be the reftor or vicar.

It is moil convenient, that every parish aft there be en. tered in the- parish book of accounts, and every man's, hand consenting to it be set thereto 5 for then it will be a certain rule for the churchwardens to' go by. ' " ' .

The rates for the repair of the church shall he laid upon every occupier of lands in the parish; altho' such occupier live in another parish.

If any person find himself aggrieved at the inequality of the assessment, his appeal mud be to the ecclesiastical judge.

If any refuse to pay the rates, being demanded by the churchwardens, they are to be sued for in the ecclesiastical courts.

A quaker, refusing to pay church rates, may be sued, as other parishioners, in the ecclesiastical court; or he may be prosecuted before the justices of the peace, in the same manner as for his tithes.

-The foil and freehold of the church is the parson's; the use of the body of the church, and the repair of it, common to the parishioners.

Benefit of Clergy.

ANCIENTLY princes and states, converted to Christia-nity, did grant to the clergy very bountiful privileges and exemptions; and particularly, an exemption of their persons from criminal proceedings, in some capital cases before secular judges; which was the true original of the benefit

nefit of clergy. — But this claim of exemption grew so bur-dcnfome, that it was from time to time qualified and abridged by the civil power; and therefore, if they were indicted in cases criminal, but not capital, nor wherein they were , to Iofe life or limb, there the privilege of clergy was not allowed; and therefore not in indictments of .trespass or petit larceny.

1 — -Also it was not allowed them in high treason.

s 11. II. 335. ^ tbs statute enacts generally, that it shall be felony with-

out benefit of clergy, or that he shall fuft'er as in case of felony without benefit of clergy, this excludes it in all circum-ilances, and to all intents, jg £?. 3. r. 74. When any person shall be convicted of any felony within the benefit of clergy, for which he shall be liable to be burned in the hand, the court may, if they think fit, inllead thereof,'impose upon the offender a moderate pecuniary fine; or otherwise, inllead of fitch burning, in any of the cases aforesaid, except manllaughter, may order the offender to be once or oftener, but not more than thrice, either publickly Oi' privately whipped, such private whipping to be in the presence of not less than two persons, besides the offender and the officer who inflifts the same; and in case of female offenders, in the prefen.ee of females only — Provided, that this shall not extend to deprive the court of the power now vested in them, of detaining such offender in prison for any time not exceeding one year, or of committing him to the Jtoufe of correction or other public workhouse, to be kept to hard labour for any time not less than six months, nor exceeding two years.

J that he hath at the time of the conviction. — But presently

upon his burning in the hand, he ought to be rellored to the poflession of his lands, and from thenceforth to enjoy the profits thereof.

PERSONS apprehended for offences which are not bailable, and also all persons whq neglect to offer bail for

offences, which are bailable, mull be committed_Where-

soever a justice is impowered by any statute to bind a person over, or to cause him to do a certain thing, and such person being in his presence shall refuse to be bound, dr to do such thing, the justice may commit him to the gaol, to remain there, till he shall comply.

If a prisoner be brought before a justice, expressly charged with felony upon oath, the justice cannot discharge him, but mult bail or commit him. But if he be charged with fuf-picion only of felony, yet if there be no felony at all proved to be committed, or if the fast charged as a felony be in truth no felony in point of law, the justice may discharge him. But if a man be killed, by another, tho' it be by mifad-venture, or in self-dcfence, the justice ought not to discharge him, for he mull undergo his trial for it; and therefore he mult be committed, or at leait bailed.

But commitment by the justices of the peace almost in all cases (except for the peace, good, behaviour, felony, or higher offences) is bu t to retain the party till he hath made line to the king; and therefore, if he offer to pay it, or find sureties by recognizance to pay it, he ought not to be committed, but'to be delivered presently.

All felons shall be committed to the common gaol, and not elsewhere.

But vagrants, and other criminals charged with small offences, may be committed either to the common gaol, or house of correction, as the justices in their judgment shall think proper. And they may commit other offenders to the flocks, or other custody, by particular statutes.

If a person is apprehended, upon a warrant indorsed, in another county, for an offence not bailable, or if he shall not there find' bail, he shall be carried back into the first county, and be committed (or if bailable, bailed) by the justices in such first county.

The commitment muit be in writing, either in the name of the king, and only attested by .'he person who makes it, or it may be made by such person in his own name, expressing his office or authority, and mult be directed to the gaoler, or keeper of the prison.'

It should contain the name and surname of the party committed, if known; and if not known, then it maybe sufficicnl to del'cribe the person by his age, llature, complexion, colour of his hair, and the like, and to add that he refuseth to tell his name.

It is safe, but not necessary, to' set forth, that the party is , ,

It ought to contain the cause, as for treason, or felony, or 2 jrjj, p, suspicion thereof. . . '

A warrant or mittimus to answer to such things as shall be 2 lr.fi. 591. objected against him, is utterly-against law.

It ought to contain the certainty of the cause; if it be for - H- W-felony, it ought to be for felony for the death of such .an one, or for burglary in breaking the house of such an one.

If it is for felony, it mull.be to detain him till lie be thence 3 /;. //, 333. delivered by law, or by order of law, or by due coiirfe of law.

A commitment grounded on an act of parliament, ought zliaio. Hot 33. to be conformable to the method prescribed by it. The difference is, where a man is committed as a criminal, and where only for.contumacy; in the first case, the commitment muff be, until discharged according to law; bat in the latter, until he comply.-

It mutt be under seal; and -without this, the commit- 111. a. 5S3.

ment is unlawful.

But this mull not be intended of a commitment by the fef- 1 it. ll. 5S4. lions, or other court of record; for there the record itself, or the memorial thereof, which may at any time be entered of record, is a sufficient warrant, without any warrant under seal.

It should also set forth the place at which it is made, that 2 //.:». 119. it may appear to be within the jurisdiction of the justice.

It mull also have a certain date, of the year and day. 2 it. a. 123. Every person who shall be committed to the common or 3 y. <-. ic. usual gaol, by any justice of the peace, the said person having-means or ability thereunto, shall bear his own reasonable charges, and the charges also of such as shall be appointed to guard him to such gaol: and if any such person shall refuse to defray the said charges, then such justice shall, by writing under his hand and seal, give warrant to the con liable of the hundred, or constable of the township where such person shall be dwelling and inhabit, to fell such and so much of the goods and chattels of the said person so to be committed, as by the discretion of the said justice shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy and pay the charges of such his conveying and fending to the said goal; the appraisement to be made by four of the honeil inhabitants of the parish where fitch goods shall be; the overplus to be delivered to the party.

When any person, not having goods or money in the 2jC. 2. e. 3. county where he is taken, sufficient to bear the charges of himself and of those who convey him, is committed to gaol, or to the house of correction, by warrant from a justice, then on application, by the constable or other officer who conveyed him, to any justice for such county or place,

If the gaoler shall refuse to receive a felon, or take any thing for receiving him, he shall be punished for the Tame, by the justices of gaol delivery,

But if a man be committed for felony, and the gaoley will not receive him, the constable mud bring him back to the town where he was taken; and that town shall be charged with the keeping of him, until the next gaol delivery,

Constable.

The petty constable ought to be chosen in the leet; and the high constable (properly so called) in the torn, which is the general leet of the whole hundred.

They are to be sworn and placed in their office by the lord or his steward, or by the sheriff respectively, as being judge of the court.

But now the usual manner is, that the high constables of hundreds be chosen either at the sessions, or by the greater number of the justices of the division.

And every petty constable, being a principal peace officer, and it being necessary for the preservation of the peace, that every vill Should be furnished with one; the justices of the peace have, ever since the institution of their office, taken upon them, as conservators of the peace, not only to fwcarthe petty constables, that have been chosen at a torn or leet,. bu; also to nominate and swearthofe, who have not been chosen at any such court, on the neglect of the sheriffs or lords to hold their court, or to take care that such officers are appointed in them. And this power of justices of the peace having been confirmed by the uninterrupted usage of many ages, shall not now be disputed, but mail be presumed to be established upon sufficient authority.

Justices of the peace had power to nominate and swear constables, on the default of the torn or leet, before the statute of 13 iff 14 C. 2. r. 12. If a constable shall die, or go out of the parish, any two justices may make and swear a new one, 'till the lord shall hold a leet, or 'till the next quarter sessions, who shall approve of the officer so made and sworn, or appoint another; and if any officer shall continue above a ycai in his office, the justices in their quarter sessions may discharge him, and put'in another, 'till the lord shall hold 2 court.

If constables lawfully chosen refuse to be sworn, a justice of the peace may bind them over to the assizes or sessions, there to be indicted.

High constables are to take the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, as other persons who qualify fot offices; but petty constables are exempted.

Every high and petty constable is by the common law con-fervator of the peace ; and therefore if any man shall make an affray or break the peace, the constable may commit him to the llocks or other safe custody for the present, and afterwards may carry him before a justice or to gaol, until he shall find surety for the peace.

But he cannot require surety of the peace, unless the offence be upon his own view ; for he cannot take any man's oath, because he is not a judge of record.

The constable is a proper officer to a justice of the peace, and bound to execute his warrants; and therefore it hath been resolved, that where a statute authorizes a justice of the

peace

\ Constable. 47

1 peace to convict a man of a crime, and to levy the penalty by { warrant of distress, without saying to whom such warrant j shall be directed, or by whom it shall be executed, the con- liable is the proper officer to serve such warrant, and indifta-l ble for disobeying it.

! No action shall be brought against any constable,' or other jperson acting by his order, and in his aid, for any thing done in obedience to the warrant of a justice of the peace, until I demand hath been made by the party, or his attorney, in writing, signed by the party demanding the same, of the pe-rufal and copy of such warrant, and the same hath been refused or neglected for six days after such demand j and if such action be brought jointly against the justice and constable, on proof of such warrant, the jury shall find for the constable; and if the verdict be given against the justice, the plaintiff shall receive his colts against him, to be I taxed in such manner by the proper officer, as to include [such colls as the plaintiff is liable to pay to such defendant,

(for whom such verdict shall be found as aforesaid.

The constable ought not to return the warrant to the juf-Itice, but to keep it for his own junification; but he mull [certify to the justice what he hath done in the execution [thereof.

! The constable executing a justice's warrant, for levying a 17 C. 1.1. so. [penalty, or other sum of money directed by an act of parliament, by distress, may deduct his own reasonable charges iof taking, keeping, and felling the goods distrained; returning the overplus on demand, after such penalty or sum of money and charges deducted.---- See Commitment.

Every constable or other such officer shall every three jS C. 3. c. 19. months, and within 14. days after he shall go out of his office, deliver to the overseers a just account in writing, fairly entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and signed by him, of all sums by him expended on account of the said parish, township, or place, in all cases not hitherto provided for by law, and also of all sums received by him on the account of the said parish, township, or place; and the overseers shall, within the next 14 days after the account shall be so delivered, lay the same before the inhabitants, and if approved by the majority of them, the overseers shall pay out of the poor rate such sum as shall appear to be due on the said account: But if the account, or any part thereof, shall be disallowed, the overseers shall deliver back to the constable, or other officer, such book of accounts; who may then produce the said book to a justice, giving reasonable notice thereof to the overseer; which justice shall examine the same, and hear and determine any objection that shall be made to the account, and settle the sum which shall appear to him to be due, and enter the same in the account, and sign his name thereto; and the overseers shall pay the

48 Constable.

same accordingly. — Provided, that if the overseer shall find that the parish, township, or place is aggrieved by any thing done or omitted by the said constable, or other officer, or by the' justice, he may, giving reasonable notice to the said justice, constable, or other officer, appeal to the next general or quarter-sessions. — And the justices in sessions may from time to time lay down or alter such rules and regulations as to any colls or charges to be allowed to any person by virtue of this act,' as to them shall fecm just; which rules and regulations having received the approbation and signature of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding, and not otherwise, on all persons whatsoever.

12 C. 2. t. 29. The high constables shall, at the general or quarter-sessions, if thereunto required, account for the general county rate by them received, on pain of being committed to gaol until .they shall account; and all their accounts and vouchers shall, 1 after having been pasted at the said sessions, be deposited with the clerk of the peace, to be kept amongst the records, and inspected by any justice without fee.

Dalt. c. 28. If there shall be cause to remove and put an high constable

from his place, it shall be done by the greater part of the justices of that division, or at the sessions.

zlleia, 65. The justices of the peace have also used, for good cause, to displace all such constables, as have been chosen and sworn by them.

Convifition.

WHERE a special power is given toajustice of the peace1 by act of parliament to convifl an offender in a summary manner, without a trial by jury, it mull appear that he hath ftrittly pursued that power ; otherwise the common law will break in upon him, and level all his proceedings. Therefore he mull proceed according to the course of common law in trials by juries, and consider himself only as constituted in the place both of judge and jury. There mull be an information or charge against a person ; then he mull be summoned, or have notice of fitch charge, and have an opportunity to make his defence ; and the evidence against him mull be such as the common law approves of, unless the statute specially directeth otherwise; then, if the person be found guilty, there must be a conviction, judgment, and execution, all according to the course of the common law, directed and influenced by the special authority given by statute ; and in the conclusion, there mull be a record of the whole proceedings, wherein the justice mull set forth the particular

Coroner.

CORONERS are ancient officers by the common law, so called because they deal principally with ,the pleas of the crown, and were of old time the principal conservators of the peace-

in ancient times this office was of great estimation ; for none could have it under the degree of a knight.

The coroner shall be chosen in the county court, by the commons of the same county.

And none but freeholders have a voice at such election. When any person comes to an unnatural death, the town-ship shall give notice thereof to the coroner. Otherwise if the body be interred before he come, the township shall be amerced.

When notice is given to the coroner, he is to issue a precept to the constables of the four, five, or fix next townships, to return a competent number of good and lawful men of their townships, to appear before him in such a place, and to make an inquisition touching the matter. Or he may fend his precept to the constable of the hundred.

These are to be at leaf! twelve.

The jury appearing is to be sworn and charged by the coroner to esquire, upon the view of the body, how the party came by his death.

» If the body cannot be viewed, the coroner can do nothing: but the justices of the peace shall esquire thereof.

1 For every inquisition (not taken upon view of a body dying in gaol) he shall have 20s. and also gi. for every mile he shall be compelled to travel from his usual place of abode to taks such inquisition ; to be paid by order of the justices in fcl-lions, out of the county rates — And for every inquisition taken on view of a body dying in prison, he shall be paid so much, not exceeding 20s. as the justices in sessions shall allow, .10 be oaid in like manner.

County-Court.

NO plaint shall be entered in the county-court, but g f where the plaintiff, or his attorney is present; and the ‘7 ' 3 plaintiff shall find pledges to pursue his plaint; and he shall have but one plaint for one trespass, on pain of 40s. half to the king, and half to the prosecutor. -And one justice may examine the sheriff or other officer, making default; and shall, within a quarter of a year, certify the examination into the exchequer.

Estreat.

ESTREAT (extraSum) is used for the true cop)' or note of some original writing or record, and especially of lines and amerciaments, imposed in the rolls of a court, to be levied by the bailiff or other officer.

In levying, the sheriff shall shew the ellreats under the seal 4- -Ed. 3. c. 9. of the exchequer, to the party indebted; on pain of treble damages to the party, and line to the king, on conviction before the juliices of the peace, or other juliices.

-An attainder, judgment, or conviction of treason, felony, perjury, or forgery on 5 El. and also judgment to Hand on I0,' the pillory, or to be whipped or branded, are good causes of exception against a witness, while they continue in force.

Evidence.

The compulsory means to bring in witnesses are of two kinds. 1. By process otfubpatna, issued in the king's'name, ; by the justices, or others, where the trial is to bev 2. (which is the more ordinary and more effectual means in criminal cases) the justices that take the examination of the person accused, and the information of the witnesses, may at' that time, or at any time after, and before the trial, bind! over the witnesses to appear at the fcllions 3 and in case of; their refusal either to come, or to be bound over, may commit them for their contempt in such refusal.

When any poor person-Mil'appear on recognizance in any; court to give evidence, the court may order the treasurer:to! pay. him fuchfum as they shall think reasonable, except ia Middlesex, where the same shall be paid by -the overseers of the- poor where the person was apprehended.- The justices in sessions from time to time may lay down or: alter such rules and regulations concerning any coftsor charges to be allowed to any person by-virtue of this act, as; to them shall seem just; which rules and regulations,-; having received the approbation and lignature of one or more of the judges of assize, Mil be binding on all persons whatsoever. . - r

. if-any person, upon whom a process out of any of the courts of record shall beferved; to testify or depose concerning any matter depending therein, and having tendered unto him z reasonable sum for his costs and charges; do not appear according-to the tenor of the process, having not a lawful and reasonable impediment, he shall forfeit uol.-'and Mil yield such further recompence to the party aggrieved, as to the judge ,of the court shall seem meet, i In criminal cases, if a witness hath been bound over, and do not .appear, he Mil forfeit his recognizance.

. He who affirms the matter in issue, whether plaintiff or defendant, ought to begin to give evidence.

The evidence both for and against a prisoner, ought to he

upon oath.'....

- But a quaker's affirmation, in all cases not being criminal, shall be allowed as evidence, without an oath; but in' criminal cases; his affirmation MU'not be allowed.

It is no satisfaction for a witness to say, that he thinks or persuades- himself;.-the judge ought- to-have-more ground than thinking.

' The' court may indulge a prisoner in examining the witnesses. apart, but he camiot demand it of-right.

In cases-of life,-no evidence-.is-to be given against a prisoner, -but in his presence. - -t ;: 1....

.' In every issue,- the affirmative is to be proved. A negative cannot regularly be proved.

A prisoner may- not call witnesses to disprove what his

own witnesses have sworn,..... :

A witness

. Evidence; 61

A witness shall not be permitted to read his evidence, but Stt 7-r_ K _ he may look upon his notes to refresh his memory.

" A witness shall not be cross examined, till he has gone St.Tr.y.zj^ thro' the evidence for the party on whose side he was produced....

A deposition taken by a witness before a justice of the zHmv.tfo, peace, may at the prisoner's desire be,read at the trial, in order to take off the credit of the witness, by Ihcwing a variance between such depositions, and the evidence given in court.

' There may be four witnesses put in one fubpccna.

Examination.

IF a felony is committed, and one is brought before a juf-

tice upon suspicion thereof, and the jttftice finds upon ex- ae‘1 4' amination that the prisoner is not guilty, yet the justice shall not discharge him, but he mull either be bailed or. committed ; for it is not fit that a man once arrested and charged with felony, or suspicion thereof, should be delivered, upon arty man's discretion, without farther trial.

In order to which bail or commitment, the examination and information of the parties mull firit be taken, according to the following statutes: .

Twoormorejultiees (i £K) or one of the said justices, be- igt- p.&nf. fore they bail a person apprehended for felony (if the offence c. 13. is bailable) shall take his examination, and the information of them that bring him, of the fail and circumstances thereof, and the same, or. as much thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, shall put in writing; which examination they shall certify (together with the bailment) at the next general gaol delivery, to be holden within the limits of their commission.-7-And they shall have power to bind by recognizance all such as do declare any thing material to prove tlje offence, to appear at the next general gaol delivery; and shall certify such recognizance in like manner. — And if they offend in any thing herein, they shall be fined by the justices of gaol delivery.

Where the person is not bailed, but committed, the inf- its tice or justices, who commit him, shall, before such commit- lament, take the like examination and information, and shall put the same in writing within two days after the said examination, and shall in like manner bind over the witnesses; and certify the Whole as above.

If on some reasonable hindrance the justice cannot at the jgj,

return of the warrant take the examination, he may by word of mouth command the constable Or any other person, to de- " tain

tain in custody the prisoner till the next day; and then to bring him before the justice, for farther examination.

a Haw. 119. But the time of the detainer mull be no longer than is necessary.

iH.ll. 585. The examination of the person accused, ought not to be

upon oath.

Dalt. c. 164. But if upon his examination he shall fonfefs the matter, it shall not be amiss that lie subscribe his name, or mark to it.

2 Haw. 4agt Which examination being voluntary, and sworn by the justice or his clerk to be truly taken, may be given in evidence against the party con felling, but not against others.

EXTORTION, in a large sense, (ignifies any oppression ! Haw. 170.

under colour of right; but in a drift sense, it significs the taking of money by any officer, by colour of his office, either where none at all is due, or not so much is due, or where it is not yet due.

The justices of the peace are bound by their oath of office, odt. c. 41. to take nothing for their office of justice of the peace to be

Dell. c. 41. And generally, no public officer shall take any other fees or rewards, for doing any thing relating to his office; than some statute in force gives him, or than hath been anciently and accustomably taken; and if he do otherwise, he is guilty of extortion. — The fees in sessions, for traversing, trying, or' discharging indictments, discharging recognizances, and the like, do vary according to the different customs in different places.

Felony.

IT would be very tedious to set down every thing which may be comprehended under this word Felony; therefore

it is necessary to refer the consideration of the several particular kinds of felonies to their respective tides; as Homicide, Robbery, Burglary, Rape, Coin, Forgery, and especially Larceny. The course and whole procedure of trying an offender, is treated of under the title SeJJiom.

3 y. c. 10. The felon shall pay the charges of his carrying to gaol, if able ; to be levied by d'lftrefs by warrant of one justice. vj G. z. c. 3. If he is not able, the same shall be paid, by order of such justice, by the treasurer out of the county rate ; and in Middlesex, by the overseers of the poor where the party was ap. prehendea.

15 G, i. c, 36. ' The court, before whom any person hath been tried and conviSed of any grand or petit larceny, or other felony, may at the prayer of the prosecutor, and on consideration of his circumstances, order the treasurer of the county in which the offence shall have been committed, to pay him such sum as they shall judge reasonable, not exceeding the expences he was put to in carrying on the prosecution, with a reasonable allowance for his time and trouble.

18 C. 3,19. The justices in sessions may lay down or alter, from time to time, such rules and regulations concerning any costs or charges thereafter to be allowed to any person by virtue of this act; which rules and regulations, having received the approbation and signaturc of one or more of the judges of assize, shall be binding, and not otherwise, on all persons whatsoever.

!' G. z. 1. When any poor person shall appear on recognizance to give evidence, whether any bill of indictment be preferred or not, the court may order the treasurer to pay him such fur.i as they shall think reasonable.

14 C. 3. r, 2e. Every person, charged with any felony or other crime, against whom no bill of indictment shall be found, or who shall on trial be acquitted, or who shall be discharged by

proclamation,

proclamation for want of prosecution, .shall be immediately i'et at large in open court, without paying any fee to the.

sheriff or gaoler : and such fees as had been usually paid, not exceeding 13s. ,-pd. for each person, shall, on the certificate of ajudge or justice before whom such prisoner shall have been discharged, be paid out of the general county rate.

MisprifiQn of Felony

IS the concealing of a felony which a man knows, but 1/7.11,374. never conlented to.

Jf any person will favc himself from the crime of misprision, 4 /,140, he mult discover the offence to a magistrate with all the speed that he can.

The party grieved, if he will lose the benefit of his treble damages and colls, may be aided and have the alfiltance of the justices at the general sessions, by way of indictment on the jftatiirc of 3 H. 6.

In the caption of which indictment, it will be suficient to say, justices assigned to hep the peace of our lord the king, without shewing that they have authority to hear and determine felonies and trespasses; for the statute enables all justices of the peace, as such, to take such indictments. — And the tenement in which the force was made, mnfl be described with convenient certainty j and must set forth that the defendant actually.entered ; and oulted the party grieved ; and

contin ucth his pofiession at the time of finding the indict.

ment.

But if a man's wife, children, or servants do continue in the house or upon the land, he is not oulted of his possession.' For a more speedy remedy, the party grieved may complain to any one justice, .or to a mayor, Iherifly or bailiff, within their liberties.

But altho' one justice alone may proceed in such cases, yet it may be adviseable for. him, if the time for viewing the force will suffer it, to take to his afiiitance one or two more justices.

After complaint made to such justice, by the party grieved, of a forcible entry made into lands, tenements, or other pof-sessions, or forcible holding thereof, he shall, within a convenient time, at thccolls of the party grieved (without any .examining or Handing upon the right or title of either party) take ‘suficient power of the county, and go to the^ place where such force is made.

And if after such entry made, the justice shall find such force, he shall cause the offenders to be arrested.

All. such justices ought to make a record of such force by them viewed ; which record frail be a suficient conviction of the offenders, and the parties shall not be allowed to traverst it: And this record, being made out of the sessions, by3 particular justice, may be kept by him; or he may make it

. And the offenders, being arrested (as before is said) shall 15 K.e. c.i, be put in the next gaol, there to abide convict by the record of the same juliice, until they have made line and ransom to the king.

The j liftice shall make his precept to the sheriff, command- g h. 6. t. 9, ing him in the king's behalf, to caiifc to come before him, sufficient and indifferent peffons, dwelling next about the lands so entered, to enquire of such entries; whereof every man shall have lands or teneihents of 40s. a year, above reprizes. And the sheriff shall return issues on every of them, at the day of the first precept returnable 20s. and at the fe-fcond day 40s. and at the third 100s. and at every day after double. And the sheriff making default, shall on conviction before the same justice, of before the judge of assize, forfeit 20I. half to the king, and half to him who shall sue, with colts; and moreover shall make line and ransom to the king.

No restitution upon an indictment of forcible entry, or 31 *.

holding with force, shall be made, if the person indicted have had the occupation, or been in quiet pofl'cflion for three years together next before the indictment found, and his ellate therein not determined ; and if it is found against the party indifted1, he shall pay such colts and damages as the judge's or justices shall assess; to be recovered as colts and damages in judgment on other addons.

And if such forcible entry of detainer be found before such S H. 6. c. g. juliice, then the said juliice shall cause to refeize the lands and tenements so entered or holden, and shall reltore the party put out, to the full possession of the same.

Such judges* justices, or justices of the peace, as may give 21 ?*J« restitution unto tenants of any ellate of freehold, may give the like unto tenants for term of years, &c. of lands or tenements by them so holden, which shall be entered upon by force, or holden from them by fofee.

Although regularly the justices only who were present at Balt. c. 44, the enquiry, and when the indictment was found, ought to award restitution, yet if the record be certified by the justice or justices into the king's bench, the justices of that court may award a writ of restitution to the sheriff, to rellore poffeiliori to the party expelled. — If a forcible entry or detainer shall be made by three persons or more, it is also a riot, and may be proceeded against as such, if no enquiry hath before been made of the force.

Manslaughter.

BY manslaughter is to be understood such billing of a man i lUiv. 66. as happens either on a fuddeii quarrel, or in the commission of an unlawful aft, without any deliberate intention of doing any mischief at all.

There is no difference between murder and manslaughter, 31»J>. 55. but that murder is upon malice forethought, and manslaughter upon a sudden occasion.

This offence is not bailable by the justices of the peace. 3 fj, t. c. j 5. Murder is, when a man of found memory, and of the age of discretion, unlawfully killeth any person under the king's peace, with malice forethought, either expressed by the party, or implied by law; so as the party wounded or hurt, die of the wound or hurt, within a year and a day.

The law so far abhors all duelling in cold blood, that not 1 //«» only the principal who actually kills the other, but also his fcconds, are guilty of murder, whether they fought or not.

And it is holden, that the seconds of the party flain are like-wife guilty as accessaries.

They that are present when any man is flain, and do not 3 hjl. 53. their heft endeavour to apprehend the murderer or manflayer, shall be fined and imprisoned.

Where any person shall be feloniously flricken or poisoned ' & 1 ]uI-in one county, and die in another county, the offender may c' "4‘ be indicted in the county where the party dies, before the coroner, justices of the peace, or other justices.

By the rubrick in the book of common-prayer, before 13 & C. a.

the burial office, a person who hath laid violent hands upon 24-himself, shall not have that office used at his interment.

N. B. No distinction seems to be here made as to the Hate of mind in which the party put an end to his life; the prohibition in the rubrick, with respect to the burial service, is sbfolute.

Buying of stolen Horses.

EVERY person offending against this statute, shall for- a fit 3 F.6SM.

If any horse shall be stolen, and afterwards shall be fold in open fair or market, if claim be made in six months, where the horse shall be found, before the mayor, if in a town corporate, or else before a justice near the place where found, and :o as proof be made before such magistrate in 40 days next ensuing

150 Horses.

ensuing by two witnesses, that the property of such horse was in the party claiming, - and was stolen from him within six months next before such claim, such sale shall not take away the owner's property; but the party from whom the fameWas ltolen may at all times after, notwithstanding such sale, take again the said horse, on payment, or readiness to offer to the party who hath possession, so much as he shall swear before such magistrate, that he paid for-the same.

Killing or maiming Horses in the Night.

s. WHERE any person Jliall in the night-time maliciously 7* kill or destroy any horses, he shall be guilty of felony, and

may be transported, by three justices in sessions, for seven years — If any person shall in the night-time maliciously wound or hurt any horses, he shall forfeit to the party grieved treble damages, to be recovered by action at law, or before three justices.

Horse-Races.

WHEREAS the great- number of horse races for small plates or prizes have contributed very much to the encouragement of idleness, and impoverishment of many of the meaner fort of people, and the breed of strong and useful horses hath been much prejudiced thereby, it is enacted, that no person shall enter, Hart, or run any horse (mare or gelding) for any prize, unless the same shall be bona fide his own property, on pain of forfeiting the same, or the value thereof.

And no plate, prize, sum of money, or other thing, shall be run for, or advertised or proclaimed to be run for, unless such plate, prize, or sum of money, be of the real and in-trinlic value of 50I. or upwards: and if any person shall enter, Hart, or run any horse for any such plate, prize, or sum of money, under the value of 50I.; or shall make, print, advertise, or publish any adverfisement of any such prize under the value of ;ol. every such person so entering, darting, or running such horse, shall forfeit zool. and every maker, printer, or publisher of such advertisement, shall forfeit tool. — And no person shall dart or run any match for any sum of money or other thing, unless it be at Newmarket or Black-Hainblcton, or unless such sum or other thing be of the real and intrinsic value of 50I. or upwards, on pain of zool.

Betting, loling, tvinning, cheating, and the like, at horse races, are within the statutes of Gaming; for which fee the title Gaming.

A MAN's home or habitation is so far protested by the Bkgk. 223. law, that if any person attempts to break open a house 1 in the night-time, and shall be killed in such attempt, the i (layer shall be acquitted and discharged.

1 In the case of burglary, which is breaking and entering a 3!V. e. 9.

dwelling-house in the night-time with intent to commit fe-| lony, it is a capital offence, although no felony be actually j committed. And where the offence falls short of burglary, it 1 is by several particular (lattices made felony without benefit of clergy, to rob any dwelling-house in the day-time, any per-(ba being therein; or dealing in the day-time to the value of ;s. in any dwelling-house or outhouse thereunto belonging, although no person be therein; or dealing to the value of .(.os. ia any dwelling-house or outhouse, although the same be not broken open; or breaking a house in the day-time, any person being therein and put in fear, although nothing be doion; or privately dealing any goods to the value of 5s. in any shop, warehouse, or liable, although it be not broken open, nor any person be therein.

House of Correction.

BY the 7 J. c. 4. it was enacted, that before Michaelmas 1611 > there should be built or provided within every county, one or more fit and convenient houses of correction ; which houses were to be purchased, conveyed, or allured unto such persons, as by the justices in sessions should be directed, upon trust that the same should be employed for the keeping, correcting, and setting to work the said rogues, vagabonds, or sturdy beggars, and other idle and disorderly persons.

On presentment of the grand-jury, that there is no house 17 G. % . c. of correction, and that it will be necessary to provide one or more; or that the houses of correction already provided arc not sufficient or convenient, or want to be enlarged, die justices in feiftohs shall have power to build or enlarge one or more fit houses of correction, or to buy or hire such houses for that purpose, with convenient outlets thereto adjoining, as on examination of able and sufficient workmen, or others, shall appear to be necessary for that purpose: and if houses or ' lands are to be purchased, they shall be conveyed to such persons as the said justices in sessions shall direct, in trust and for the uses and purposes aforesaid. And the justices in sessions shall appoint at their will and pleasure lit persons to be governors or mailers of such houses so to be provided; and shall appoint such sums yearly as they shall think meet, to be paid quarterly beforehand by the treasurer, the said mailer or governor giving sufficient feenrity for the continuance and performance of the said service; which sums shall be paid out 1- G. % . c. 29. of the general county-rate.

And the justices in sessions shall take care, that the houses 17 G. 2. c. 5. of correction (except those erected or maintained by particular founders) shall be duly fitted up and supplied with implements, materials, and furniture, for keeping, relieving, employing, and correcting all idle and disorderly persons, rogues,

Vagabonds, incorrigible rogues, and others, who shall be sent i.io, confined or continued in the same; and shall make such orders and regulations as they shall think fit, for the better (governing and regulating the said houses, and for employing,

relieving, and punishing the persons therein, or for fending them to or from thence; which orders shall not be removed by any certiorari.

And whereas doubts may arise, where authority is given to any justice or justices, to commit offenders to the house of correction, for offences cognizable before them out of sessions, how long offenders may be there detained, and in what manner treated, where the time and manner of their punishment is not by law expressly limited; it is enacted, that where any offenders shall be committed as aforesaid, by virtue of any law in being or to be made, and the time and manner of their punishment is not expressly limited, the said justice or justices shall commit such offenders to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour until the next general or quarter-sessions, or until discharged by due courfcoflaw: and Svo justices (of which thcjusticewho committed him shall be one) may discharge the said offender before the sessions, if they fee' cattfc ; and if he shall not be so discharged, the said feiiiom may either discharge him, or continue him further not a-ceeding three months.

And where any person liable by law to be committed to the house of correction, shall be apprehended within any liberty, city, or town corporate, whose inhabitants are contributors to the house of correction of the county, the justices of such liberty may commit such person to the house of correction of the county.

Two justices within the respective hundreds, divisions, or jurisdictions, where there shall be any house of correction, or any. two justices appointed by the sessions, shall visit the same twice a year, or oftener if need be, and report the state thereof to the next sessions. And if the governors thereof shall not set or keep the said idle and disorderiy persons, rogues, vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues, to hard labour, and pusiilh and correct them according to the directions of their warrants of commitment, or shall otherwise misbehave themselves, the said justices in sessions shall fine them ; the fines to be pail to the treasurer, and accounted for by him as part of the cotmty-stock.

Hue and Cry.

FOR levying hue and cry, although it is a good course to have the warrant of a justice of the peace, when time will permit, in order to prevent causeless hue and cry; yet by the frame of the statutes, it is by no means necessary, m is it always convenient; for the felon may escape before the warrant be obtained, and hue and cry was part of the law, before justices of the peace were first instituted.

Constables of hundreds shall be chosen, who shall prefer,t before justices assigned, defaults of the suits of towns, and all such as lodge strangers in uplandish towns, for whom they will not answer.

And they which levy not hue and cry, or pursue not upon hue and cry, may be indicted, fined, and imprisoned.

Judgment.

BY many statutes, peculiar punishments are appointed for Dak. c. iSS.

several offences, as pillory, stocks, imprisonment, and the like; and in all these cases, no room is left for the justices' discretion, for they ought to give judgment, and to in-stiff the punishment in all the circumstances thereof, as such llatiites do direct.

HE justices, at Midsummer sessions, shall issue forth their i&nAt. c. iS.

. warrants under the hands and seals of two or more of them, to the high constables, requiring them to issue forth their precept to the petty constables, thereby directing and requiring them to make and return true lifts in writing, of the names and places of abode, of all persons within their respective constablewicks, qualified to serve on juries, with their titles and additions, between the ages of 21 and 70.

High constable failing to issue this precept, shall forfeit tol. on conviction at the affixes or sessions.

And if any petty constable shall wilfully omit any person, 3 G. 2. c. 15. ivlio ought to be inserted, or insert any one who ought to be omitted, or shall take any reward for omitting or inserting any person, he shall forfeit 20s. on conviction before one justice, on confession, or oath of one witness; half to the informer, and half to the poor of the parish or place, for which the lift is returned; if not paid in five days, to be levied by distress. And such justice shall, in writing under his hand, certify the same to the next sessions; who shall direct the clerk of the peace to insert or strike out the name of such person so inserted or omitted wrongfully.

The petty constables, at Michaelmas sessions, shall deliver 7 c. 32, in the lifts in open court.

Or instead of this, after they have compleated their lifts, it 3 0.2. r. 23. shall be sufficient if they subscribe the same in the presence of one justice, and at the same time attest the truth thereof upon oath to the best of their knowledge or belief: and then the said lifts, being first ligned by the justice, and subscribed as aforesaid, shall be delivered by the said petty constables to the high constables, who shall deliver in the same at the said sessions in open court, attesting at the same time upon oath the receipt of such lifts from the petty constables, and that no alteration hath been made therein nnee their receipt thereof.

The constable failing to make return shall forfeit 5I. to the king, to be recovered by bill, plaint, or information.

And if any person, not qualified, shall find his name mentioned in such lill, and the person required to make futh lid shall refuse to omit him, or think it doubtful whether lie ought to be omitted, the justices at the fcllions to which the lifts shall be returned, on satisfaction from the oath of the

party complaining, or other proof that he is not qualified,

may order his name to be struck out, or omitted to be entered in the book.

The justices shall then cause the lifts to be fairly entered in a book by the clerk of the peace, to be by him provided and kept for that purpose amongst the records of the sessions.

By a clause in the commission of the peace, it is said, \vt command our IhcrilF, that at certain days, which yon (the justices) shall make known to him, he cause to come before you so many and such good and lawful men of his bailiwick (as well within liberties as without) by whom the truth shall be the better known and enquired into.

It seems that justices of the peace may not order a jury to be returned immediately, nor on the same day, for the trial of a prisoner arraigned before them, as justices of gaol deli-very may, unless the crime amount to felony, or the party consent to be tried immediately.

And although the words of the writ be twelve, yet by the ancient conrfe, the sheriff mull: return twenty-four, for the expedition of justice; for if twelve only should be returned, there would seldom a full jury appear; and in this case usage and custom makes the law.

Besides the challenges which may be taken by the plaintiff or defendant, it is enacted, that in cases where the king is party, the justices of assize, or of the peace in sessions, any reform the panels of jurors, by putting to and taking on; the names of the persons impanelled by their discretion ; and if the (lieriiF do not return the panel so reformed, he shall forfeit 20I. half to the king, and half to him that shall sue.

By the law of England, a jury after their evidence given upon the issue, ought to be kept together in some convenient place, without meat or drink, fire or candle, and without speecli with any, unless it be the bailiff, and with him only if they be agreed.

But with the act'ont of the justices they may both eat and drink ; and if they cannot agree, the justices may in such calc fusse'r the jury to have both meat and drink for a time,

to fee whether they will agree___But if the case so happen,

that the jury can in no wile agree, the justices (as it seemeth) in such case may take such order in the matter, as shall seem to them by their discretion to Hand with reason and confid-

If a man afthult or threaten a juror, for giving a verdict 1 Hawk.57,5s, against him, he is highly punishable by fine and imprisonment ; and if he Strikes him in the court, in the presence of the judge ofaffize, he shall lose his hand, and his goods, and profits of his lands during life, and suffer perpetual imprisonment.

In canfes of nisi print, every person whose name shall be 3(5.2.1.55. drawn, and who shall not appear, after being openly called ; three times, shall on oath made of his having been lawfully ; Summoned, forfeit not exceeding 5I, nor less than 40s. un-! less leir.e reni'cn.tble cause of absence be proved, by oath or affidavit, to the satisfttftion of the judge.

If the grand jury at the assizes or sessions will not find a 3 //. 7. <. 1. bill, the court may impanel another inquest to enquire of their concealments, and thereupon let fines upon them.

I In the next place, if any action shall be brought against 7 J- c- ; a justice for any thing done by virtue of his office, he may plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evi-g dence; and if he recover, he shall have double costs.

No writ shall be sued out against, or copy of any process at c i the luit of a subject shall be served on any justice, for any "

I thing done by him in the execution of his office, until notice I in writing shall have been given to him, or left at his usual I place of abode, by the attorney for the party, one month be-I fore the suing out, or serving the same; containing the canfe I of action, and indovled with his name and place of abode; for luhich he shall be entitled to a fee of 20s. and no more. —

And the justice may at any time, within one month after such fnotice, tender amends to the party complaining, or to his jjittorncy; and if the same is not accepted, he may plead such |tender in bar to the action, together with the plea of not Iguilty, and any other plea with leave of the courtand if (upon issue joined, the jury shall find the amends tendered to Save been sufficient, they shall give a verdict for the defendant.

If a justice will not, on complaint to him made, execute Crm. 7. His afhee, or shall misbehave in his office, the party grieved 'itsy move the court of king's bench for an information, and Wtenvards may apply to the court of chancery to put him out of the commission.

Larceny.

A justice of the peace, before whom an offender shall be

brought for petty larceny out of sessions, may not punish the said offender by his discretion, and so let him go ; but irtnii have him committed or bailed, to the intent he may come to his trial, as in cases of other felonies : And if upon his trial, the jury shall find' the goods stolen to exceed I2d in value, the offender shall have judgment to die for the-faulr.

All tpetty-larceny is felony, and consequently requires the word felonionlly in an indictment for it;- yet it is certain, that it is not pnnifliable with the loss of life or lands, but only with the forfeiture of goods, and whipping, transportalion, or other corporal punishment.

If the goods are taken from a man's person, and if it is attended with putting him in fear, it is called robbery; ifitis without putting him in fear, then it is called barely larceny from the person.

Ifitis done privily without his knowledge, by picking of pockets, or otherwise, it is excluded from the benefit of clergy by the & El. c. 4 (That is, if the thing stolen be above the value ofizd.)

If it is done openly and avowedly before his face, it k

within the benefit of clergy, except where it is committed in a dwelling honfe, or outhouse thereunto belonging, to ik value of 40s. from which the benefit of clergy is taken away.

Every person that shall feloniously take away any goods, being in .a dwelling house, any person being therein, and put in fear, or shall rob any dwelling house in the day time, any person being therein; he, his comforters and abettors, shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

Every person who shall be convicted of feloniously taking away in the day time any money or goods of the value ofy. from any dwelling house, or outhouse thereunto belonging, and used to and with the same, altho no person be therein, shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

This requires an actual breaking, and not entering by tfe doors being open.

Every person that shall feloniously Ileal any money, goods, or merchandizes, to the value of 40s. being in any dwelling house, or outhouse thereunto belonging, altho' it ha no: broken open, nor any person be therein, shall be guilty cl felony without benefit of clepgy.

Every person who shall be convicted of breaking any honk in the day time, any person being therein, and put in fcr, shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

But it requires not only an actual breaking, and putting is fear, but also an entry with an intent to commit felony, anil is so to belaid in the indictment.

And moreover, if any person being out of prison, shall commit any litch housebreaking in the day time as aforesaid; and afterwards discover two or more the like offenders, so as they be convicted, he shall have the like reward and allowance of 40I. and also all other advantages which arc given to persons who shall apprehend and convifl any the like offenders; and shall also have the king's pardon for all burglaries, robberies, and felonies (except murder and treason) by him committed before such discovery made.

If any person, who shall come into any pariflt or place there S S' 9 IF. c. 30. to reside, shall at the same time procure, bring, and deliver to the churchwardens or overseers of the parish or place or to any of them, a certificate,' under the hands and seals of the churchwardens and overseers of any other parish, or the major part' of them, or of the overseers where tlicre- are no .churchwardens.;, to be attested by two or more credible wic-nesses; thereby owning and acknowledging the person mentioned in the said certificate, to be an inhabitant legally settled in that parish, township, of place; every such certificate, having been-allowed of and subscribed by two justices of the place, shall oblige the said parish or place, from which the certificate shall come, to receive and provide for the person,mentioned in the said certificate, together with his family, as inhabitants of that pariflt, whenever they shall ltap-pen.to become chargeable to, or be forced to alk relief of the parish, township, or place, to which certificate was given:

And then and not before, it shall be lawful for such person, and his children, tho'born in that pariflt,- not having otherwise acquired a legal settlement there, to be removed, conveyed , and settled in the parish' or place, from whence such certificate was brought.

Ho person, who shall come into any pnrish.by such certifi. 9 @ 10 IK cate, shall be adjudged by any act whatsoever to have pro- 11. cured a legal settlement in such parish, unless he shall really and Iona side take a lease of a tenement of the yearly value of lot, or shall execute some annual office in such parish.

If any person shall be an apprentice or a hired servant, to n A*. ft. t. any person who came into any pariflt by means of a certift- iS* cate, and hath not afterwards gained a legal settlement there; such apprentice or servant Stall not be adjudged thereby to have any settlement in such pariflt.

Which said just ices shall also certify, that such oath was madt before them. And every such certificate so allowed, and oaih of the execution thereof so certified by the said justices, Hull be allowed, in all courts whatsoever, and received as evi. dence, without other proof thereof.

Certain general rules concerning certificates.

A parish cannot be compelled to grant a certificate. A certificate is not binding unless signed by the

Burrvafs Sail. THE justices are not obliged ministerially to allow and lign tjfi581. a certificate,. They have a discretion to allow it,'or not to allow it, if it be liable to objection. And if it is not a ccr-tificate within the act (which it is not, unless properly signed) it cannot conclude the parish.

A certificate extends

S IS 9 )K c. 30. NOT only to the certificate man himself, but likewifeto ill ! his family and all his children, whether born before' or aftu the certificate.

A certificate is conclusive against the parish certifying.

Salk. 533. Because a certificate is a solemn ‘acknowledgment whereby the party' is owned to be legally' settled there: and as all otbtr parishes on this certificate are bound to receive him, so the parish' that certifies is'concluded ;as to all other parishes.

A certificate is not binding against a subsequent let-"dement.' ''

3 253. A certificate promiling to receive the persons wheneva

they become chargeable, is. not conclusive against a settlement obtained afterwards; for tho' it be according to the agreement between the parishes, yet a. private agreement in this respect shall not alter the law. 1

‘ Appendix, No. 59. - %

A ccr*

221

A certificate is not restrictive from gaining a settle-ment in a third parish.

A certificate provides for the security of that parish only Burma's Scut into which the certificate persons came to reside by virtue of Cu/. 1S6, such certificate j but doth not exclude a certificate person from gaining a settlement in another parish, in the same manner as any other person may do. '

A certificate is discharged by an estate of a man's own.

A man may not be removed from his own, whether it come 3 £? to to him by descent,' devise,' or purchase; arid continuing thereon 40 days,' he shall thereby gain a settlement, provided that in case of purchase, the consideration paid amount hsa side to the fuiri of 30I.

A certificate is discharged by a removal.

THE law is so far from looking upon a certificate as con- Burma's Sail. tilting after an order of removal, that the pauper cannot re-Ca/o,373, torn to the place from which he was removed, without incurring a penalty.

A certificate is discharged by the pauper's deserting it.

THE certificate aft fays, that the apprentice shall not gain id, 5-7. .'.settlement in the parish to which his mailer came by certificate. But if this apprentice hath gained an intermediate settlement, he ought to be lent to that settlement which he hath intermediately gained.

Of. settlement by birth.

Of bastards.

A Ballard child is frima facie settled where born: and this was'the antient genuine settlement: but this rule admits'of divers exceptions.

Poor. (Settlement by birtk)

If a woman comes into a place by privity and collusion of the officers where (he. belongs, and is there delivered of a bastard, such bastard gains no settlement, notwithstanding its birth. ;

If a woman big with child of a bastard, and settled in one parish, is persuaded to go into another,' and there be delivered ; this fraud will make the parish chargeable where the mother was settled, though the child was not born there.

. If a bastard is born under , an order of removal, and before the mother can be lent to the place of settlement, being hindered by water or otherwise, such bastard shall not be settled where so born, but at the mother's settlement.

If the officers are carrying a woman by virtue of an order of removal, and {he be delivered on the road in transttu, the ' bastard shall go with the mother where fhc is going, by virtue of the order, notwithstanding the birth.

Where any woman, wandering and begging, shall be delivered of a child, in any parish or place, to which fhc doth not belong, and thereby shall become chargeable to the same, the churchwardens or overseers may detain her, till they eta safely convey her to a justice of the peace. And if such woman shall be detained and conveyed to a justice as aforesaid, the child of which file is delivered, if a bastard, shall sot be settled in the place where so born, nor be sent thither by a vagrant pals; but the settlement of such woman shall lie deemed the settlement of such child.

A child born in the hqufe of correction, shall be sent to the place of its mother's settlement.

A ballavd born in a lying-in hc/pital, shall follow the mo-tliev's settlement.

if a woman come into a parish by certificate, and be there'-delivered of a bastard, that child shall not be included in the certificate as part of the family, but shall be settled where born.

Yet it seems, that the bastard child shall go with titc bo- 1 titer for nurture, till seven years, and be maintained at the charge of the parish where the mother is settled.

Of legitimate children.

THE lather's settlement is the settlement of the children, when it can be found out; otherwise the birth of tire child prints fade is the settlement of the child, until there is another settlement found out. If they cannot f.nd oat the legal settlement of the father, the birth is the settlement of the child. The fetticmerrt by birth is only Kumrfpic they tind the father's settlement; and if they never can find shat, St is absolute up-era them.

'Of

223

Poor. (Settlement with the Parents.)

OF the settlement of children with their parents.

THE birth of legitimate children doth not give them a Fo/ry. 269, settlement, except where the settlement of their father and mother is not known, and then only till it is known.

A child of seven years of age may be bound apprentice to a j El. c. 5. (hipwright, fisherman, owner of a ship, or other person tiling the trade of thefeas; and by the vagrant act of the 17 G. z, a vagrant's child of that age may by the justices be put out an apprentice: And as soon as he shall have refrded and lodged in a parish for 40 days under the indenture, he will have thereby gained a settlement. So that the precise time, when a person may have gained a settlement in his own right, is at the age of seven years and 40 days.

Where a father gains a second settlement after the birth of Sir. 580. his child, that settlement is immediately communicated to the child. And'a child may be sent to the place of his father's settlement, without ever having been there before.

The place where a bastard is born, is the place of his fet- 3 259.

tlrment, unless there is some trick to charge the parish; but the place where legitimate children are born, is not the place of their settlement; for let that be where it will, the children arc settled where their parents are settled.

Tho' the place of the birth of a child, where the father Sir. 5S0.. hath no settlement, is the place of the settlement of the child, yet where the father hath gained a settlement, his children, though born in another parish, shall be looked on as settled at the place of their father's lad legal settlement, and shall be removed thither, as well after the death of their father, if occasion requires, as in his life-time, supposing they have gained t no settlement of their own.

Jf the father dies before the child is born, yet the child *9 V«ur. 382.

! fall he settled where the father was settled before his death.

' If a widow, by renting iol. a year, gains a new settlement, 254. her children arc settled witlt her.

But if a woman marry again to a man settled in another A. Raym. 1473. parish, her children by her former hulbnnd mud go with her for nurture, yet they are 110 part of her second husband's family; and therefore gain no settlement in the parish where the father-in-law is settled.

Those under seven years of age shall be kept at the charge 3 239.

of the other parish, where their father whild living was settled; and to that parish' they may be sent after seven years old, as to the place of their lawful settlement.

The child's settlement follows that of its father, if the fa- ^,t!'

titer's can be found; and no recourse shall be had to the mo- c*'' ther's settlement, till that of the father can be traced no further.

ON complaint by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor, within 40 days after any person shall come to settle in any parish, bn any tenement under 10I. a year, two justices (t fj.) may remove him to the place where he was lafi legally settled, either as a native, hbuiholder, sojourner, apprentice, or servant, for the space of 40 days at the lead.

The said 40 days shall be reckoned, not from the time of his coming to inhabit, but from the time of his delivering notice in writing: and by fW. c. n. not from the time of delivering such notice, but from the time of the publication of such notice in the church.

If any person shall be bound an apprentice by indenture, and inhabit in any town or parish, such binding and inhabitation shall be adjudged a good settlement, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published;

If any person, after June 24, 1713, shall be an apprentice bound by indenture to any person redding tinder a certificate, in any parish, and not afterwards having gained a legal fet-tlcment in such parish, such apprentice, by virtue of such apprenticcship, shall not gain any settlement in such parish.

No person who shall have been bound an apprentice, by any deed, writing, or contract, not indented, being first legally stamped, shall be liable to be removed from the place where he was so bound and resident 40 days, by any order of removal, or order of sessions, by reason only of such writing not being indented.

An apprentice may gain a settlement, whilst his mailer, not renting 10I. a year, gains none. In such case, the maltu being removed, may apply to the justices so compel the apprentice to go with him.

If the mailer runs away, the apprentice is not sufficiently fui juris to hire himself, nor can he gain a settlement, till his indentures be legally cancelled.

If a man, who has a daughter married and settled elsewhere. Cafes e/S. 7. hires himself for a year, and serves the year, he gains a settlement by the service, tho' not ftriflly a single man.

If a man hired for a year marries, having served half a year, 4 Salk. 527. the marriage doth not hinder the service; if the man performs the service, he gains a settlement.

All hiring for a few days, lhort of a year, for the purpose Cafn o/S. So, of avoiding a settlement, will be considered as fraudulent; 11 arrow's Stt, and the service will be allowed to make a good settlement. ty. 243.

Less than 40 days residence in any parish will not gain a settlement: but if the cpntradl be for a year, and the service be performed (suppose at sea, or in distant journies) the residence need not be 40 days successively; it is sufficient if within the year he resides 40 days in the whole.

Where there is a hiring for a year, and a service for a year, u. 156, and a continuance under the same service, it is sufficieijt to gain a settlement; and such settlement, mull be in the parish where it was performed the last 40 days.

All persons not removable may become settled without giving notice, the notice being only intended where the person is removable.

When this notice given in writing has been omitted, the court has held all conllru&ive notices to be no legal settlement, such as, attending the leet, amending the highways, and doingwatch and ward.

Payments for the repair of the church, the relief of the poor, 'and the land tax, have been adjudged sufficient to gain a settlement: but no payment for the repair of the highways,. or of the county bridges, or of the duties on houses and windows, shall make a good settlement.

Where the tenant is assessed to, and pays the land tax, tho' ihtm-.v's it be afterwards allowed by the landlord, and deducted out of Cafi 75. the rent, the tenant hereby gains a settlement: which is supposed to turn on the notice of inhabitancy, that arises from the party's being afiefled and paying the tax, which, is con-fulcred as tantamount to notice in writing.

Of settlement by serving a parish office.

IF any person, who shall come to inhabit in any town or 3 if'. r, u. parish, shall for himself, and on his own account, execute any public and annual office or charge in the said town or parish, during one whole year, he shall be adjudged to have a legal settlement in the same, though no such notice in writing be delivered and published.

No person, who shall come into any parish by certificate, g & 10 IP-shall be adjudged by any act whatsoever, to have procured a c. m. legal settlement in such parish, unless he shall really and knit fuk take a lease of a tenement of the yearly value of 10I. or shall execute forne annual office in such parish, being legally placed in such office.

Tofcrve the office of constable as deputy to another, doth PhcrSctti. not gain a settlement, though it he served a year: for, by the words of the act, he mult Serve the office for himself, and on his emu account.

He mult also be legally placet/ in his office, by taking the Barrows Sttli. oaths, which belong to it. It must appear to the court, how CV/i '44-hc rame into his employment or office.

And if such person shall refuse to go, or shall not remain in such parish where he ought to be settled, but shall return of his own accord to the parish from whence he was removed, one justice may fend him to the house of correction, there to he punished as a vagabond.

AH persons who shall unlawfully return to such parish or place fiom whence they have been legally removed by order oftworjustices, without bringing a certificate from the pa. tish or place whereunto they belong, shall be deemed idle and disorderly persons; and one justice may commit them (being thereof convicted before him, by his own view, or by their own confession, or by the oath of one credible witness) to the house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one month.

And if the churchwardens and overseers of the parish to which he shall be removed, refuse to receive such person, and to provide work for him, as other inhabitants of the parish;. any justice of that division shall bind any such officer in whom there shall be default to the affixes or sessions, there to be indicted for hiscontempt in that behalf.

If any person be removed by virtue of this act, by warrant of two justices j the churchwardens or overseers of thepoor.of the parish or town to which such person shall be removed, are required to receive the said person: which if he or they shall refuse to do, the person offending, on proof by the oath of two witnesses, before one justice of the place to which the person shall be removed, shall forfeit for each offence ;1. to the use of the poor of the parish or town, from which such person was removed: to be levied by distress, by warrant to thcconflable of the parish or town where fuel) offender dwells; and for want of sufficient distress, the said justice shall commit the offender to the common gaol for 40 days.

Though the complaint may be to one justice, yet the examination ought to be by two, and those the same, who sign the order of removal.

; And, mop undoubtedly, the justices ought to be both together at the hearing and determining; tho' the practice in many places is otherwise.

After an order and adjudication is made, that the same may appear upon record afterwards, in order to charge the parish, the most regular way for the justices to proceed is to make a . record

If any person, who shall come into any parish or place, there to relide, shall deliver a certificate to one of the churchwardens or overseers there, such certificate shall oblige the parish or place granting the same, to receive and provide for the-perl'on mentioned in the said certificate, together with his family, as inhabitants of that parish, whenever they shall happen to become chargeable to, or be forced to alk relief of the parish, township, or place, to which such certificate was given; and then and not before, it shall be lawful for any such person, and his children, though born in that parish, nor having otherwise acquired a legal settlement there, to be re. moved, conveyed, and settled in the parish. qr place from whence such certificate was brought.

When any overseer or other person shall remove back an; persons or their families, residing under a certificate, and be. coming chargeable, to the parish or place to which they shall belong, such overseer or other person shall be reimbursed such reasonable cltarges as they may have been put unto in main, taining and removing such persons, by the churchwardens 0; overseers of the place to which such persons are removed; the fold charges being first ascertained and allowed of by one or more justices for the county or place to which such removal shall be made; which fold charges so ascertained and allowed, shall, in case of a refusal of payment, be levied, by distress and salt of the goods of the churchwardens and overseers of the place to which such certificate person is removed, by warrant of such justice or justices.

All persons, who think themselves aggrieved by any such judgment of the said two justices, may appeal to the justices of the peace of the said county, at their next quarter-Mm?, who shall do them justice according to the merits of tlurir canfc.

The appeal against any order of removal of any poor person, snail be had, prosecuted, and determined, at the general or quarter-sessions of the peace for the county, division, or riding, wherein the parish, township, or place, from whence such poor person shall be removed doth lie, and not elf:-where.

On all appeals to the sessions against the judgment or orders 5 G. i. c. 19. of any justices of the peace, the justices there shall cause defers of form to be rectified and amended, without any colt to the party, and after such amendment shall proceed to hear the truth and merits of the cause.

And for the more effectual preventing of vexatious removals $ & 9 IK r. 30. and frivolous appeals, the justices in sessions upon any appeal concerning the settlement of any poor person, or upon any proof before them there to be made, of notice of any such appeal to have been given by the proper officers to the churchwardens or overseers of any parish or place (tho' they did not afterwards prosecute such appeal) shall at the same sessions order to the party in whose behalf such appeal shall be determined, or to whom such notice did appear to have been given, such costs and charges in the law, as by the said justices ill their discretion shall be thought most reasonable and just; to be paid by the churchwardens, overseers, or any other person, against whom such appeal shall be determined, or by the person that did give such notice; and if the person ordered to pay such costs, shall live out of the jurisdiction of the said court, any justice where such person shall inhabit, shall on requell to him made, and a true copy of the order for the pay-mento'f such costs produced, and proved by some credible witness on oath, by his warrant cause the same to be levied by distress; and if no such distress can be had, shall commit such person to the common gaol, there to remain by the space of jo days.

If the justices shall at their quarter-sessions, upon an appeal 9 G. c. 7. before them there had, concerning the settlement of any poor person, determine in favour of the appellant, that such poor person was unduly removed, they shall, at the same quarter-sessions, order and award to such appellant, so much money, as shall appear to the said justices to have been reasonably paid by the parish or other place on whose behalf such appeal was made, towards the relief of such poor person, between the time of such undue removal, and the determination of such appeal; the said money so awarded, to be recovered in the same manner as costs and charges upon an appeal are to be recovered by the statute just mentioned.

An order of two justices, if quashed at the sessions upon an Filey. 276. appeal, for want of form only, is not conclusive between the two parishes.

Prison-Breaking.

HOSE who have broken prison are not bailable by jjM.i.e.'ip _ justices of the peace; and that for two reasons: 1. Be-cause it carries a presumption of guilt; And, 2. Because it is a superadded offence to the former for which they Hood committed;

The party may be arraigned for prifori-breaking, before he 2 How. 137. be convicted of the crime for which he was imprisoned: for that it is not material whether he were guilty of such crime or not; for the words of the statute are, for 'which he 'was taken etui imprisoned.

The gaoler, shall not be puniftted as a felon for the party's 1/7.77. Con breach of prison, unless he voluntarily consented to it; blit it seems to be a negligent escape in the gaoler, for which he may be punished by fine and imprisonment, because there K k ' wanted

wanted, either that due strength in the gaol, or that due vigi. lance in the gaoler or his officers, that should have prevented it: and if gaolers-might not he punished for this as a negligent escape, they Would be careless either to secure their prisoners, or to .retake them that escape. i Haw. 71. If a criminal endeavouring to break the gaol, assault his gaoler, he may. be lawfully killed by him in the affray.

Process.

BY.the commission of the peace, the justices in sessions have power to make and continue proceil'cs upon indictments, against the persons indifled, until they can be taken, furren-

der themselves, or be'outlawed.

Indictments and presentments, taken in the sheriff's tourn, shall be delivered to the next sessions; who may award procef; thereupon, in like form as if they had been taken before themselves.

The law in several cases in express words directs process to Be made by justices out of sessions; and in other cases by necessary implication: as where a statute doth give power to, justices put of sessions to esquire, hear, and determine, there they may make process to cause the party to come and anliver, otherwise they cannot proceed to hear and determine; am! this may be either before or after presentment or indictments; the several statutes do require : before presentment or indifl-ment it is called a warrant; after presentment or indictment it is properly called process.

Wherever the king is a party to the suit (as he certainly i; to all informations and indictments), the process ought to be executed by the sheriff himself, and not by the bailiff of any franchise.

If the party.be in an house, if the doors be fltut, and the sheriff (having given notice of his process) demand admittance, and the doors be not opened, he may break open the doors, and enter to take the offender.

It feemet'n that any one jtiflice may bail persons indicted at the sessions, for any offence under the degree of felony ; for that the statutes relating Specially to the" power of justices in granting bail, do not hi this case seem to take away the power, which one justice had before the making of the .faitl statutes.

It is laid; that the justices in sessions cannot issue a ctfse Titkgaium, but mull return the record of the outlawry into

the king's bench, and there process of capias utlagatum shall issue.

If one be outlawed before the justices of the peace on an to, indictment of felony, they may award a capias ntlagatutr.; for they that have power to award process of outlawry, have also power to award a capias ntlagatum, as incident to their authority and jurisdiction.

By the outlawry all personal chattels are vested in the king 3 Salk- -6t-by forfeitures; but real chattels, or freehold estates are not vested in the king, till after inouilition found.

If a man be nidified before justices of the peace, and hjl. 166. thereupon outlawed, and is taken and committed to prison, PI. 1;S. the justices of gaol-delivery may award execution of this pri- -!1, !1- 35-foner; for they arc conllituted to deliver the gaol.

The party ravished may give evidence on oath, and is in law a' competent witness; but the credibility of her teilimony, and how far she is to be believed, mull be left to the jury, and is more or less credible, according to the: circumilancts of fasts that concur in that testimony. '

Upon the whole, rape, it is true, is a most detellable crime, 1 *35?

and therefore" ought severely and impartially to be punished 63<"' with death; but it mull be remembered, that it is an accusation calily to be made, and hard to be proved, and harder to

be defended by the party accused, tho' never so innocent:

therefore, a wife jury will be cautions upon trials of offences of this nature, that they be not so much transported with in-

"donation at the heinonfness of the offence, as to be over haltily carried to the conviction of the person accused thereof, by the confident teBimony, sometimes of malicious and false witnesses.

And these recognizances, in some cases, the justices of the peace arc enabled to take by the express words of certain fames : but in other cases (as for the peace, and good beha. viour, and the like)' it is rather in .congruity, and by reasonable intendment of lav/, than by any express authority given them, either by their commission,. or by the llatmc law.

' But wheresoever any statute giveth them power to take2 bond of any man, or to bind over any man to appear at the assizes or sessions, or to .take sureties for any matter or cause, they may take a recognizance. Yea, wheresoever they have authority given, them to cause a man to do a thing, there it seemeth they have.in congruity power given them to bind the party by recognizance to do it: and if the party shall refuse to be bound, the justice may fend him to gaol.

Every obligation and recognizance, taken by justices of the peace, irtuft be made to our lord the king; on pain of imprisonment of any person that shall take it otherwise.

When the parties are to enter into recognizance, call then by their names thus: " You A. B.. acknowledge to owe to ‘ our fovcieign lord the king, the sum of — : , and you

C..D. acknowledge to owe to our.sovereign lord, the king,

" the sum of — ; to be levied of your respective goods and

chattels, lands and tenements, for the use of pur said lord " the king, his heirs and fitccessors, if default shall be made " in the condition following; that is to say, if you the said " A. B. shall make default in appearing, &c." lint the panics need not sign it. And it is tifua! for the justices to mark at the foot of the examination, A. B. in 40I. to appear &c. And from fitch short note make out a record afterwards.

Lord Coke fays, that a record is a memorial or remea-brance in rolls of parchment; &c, from whence it seemeth that a recognizance ought to be ingrafted on parchment; but finet there is no law which prohibits it to be engrossed on paper, it seemeth that if it shall be on paper only, and not on parchment, it is good in law.

And when it is made up, if the justice shall only subserite his name, without his seal to it, this is well enough; and that may be in either of these forts, acknowledged before me. J. P. or only to subscribe his name thus, J. P.

The justices shall certify their recognizances for keeping the peace, to the next sessions, that the party may be called; and if he make default, the default shall be recorded, all the recognizance, with the record of the default, shall be fe; and certified into th.e chancery, king's bench, or exchequer. !

But in cases of felony, the recognizances are to be certified to the general gaol delivery.

JO_ The justices shall keep their sessions in every quarter of the year at Ieall, and for three days, if need be; to wit, in th: lirll week after the feast of St. Michael, in the first weekaf. ter the Epiphany, in the first week after Easter, and in the first week after St. Thomas, and more often if need be. Except in Middlesex; where the justices. shall keep their

li'llions twice in the year at least, and more' often (if need be) for any riot or forcible entry within the said county.

N. J3. How many adjournments soever shall be holden af- jjur„, terwards in that quarter of the year, all shall refer to the first p. iS>. commencement of the sessions.

Any two justices, one whereof is of the quorum, by the ;j_ words of the commilHon of the peace, may ifl'ue their precept to the ihcriff to summon a session, for the general execution of their authority ; and such session, holden at any time within that quarter of a year, is a general quarter session.

Any two such justices may direst their precept under their z Iljw. 4:. telle to the Iherift', for the summons of the sessions, thereby commanding him to return a grand jury before them', or their fellow justices at a certain day and place, and to give notice to all Stewards, constables, and bailiffs of liberties, to be pre-feat and do their duties at such day and place, and to proclaim in proper places throughout his bailiwick, that such filiians will be holden at such day and place, and to attend there liinifelf to do his duty.

The flierilf also shall cause a jury to appear at such days and 3?*. places, as the said justices, or such two or more of them as aforesaid shall appoint.

t. The justices of the peace are compellable to appear at Dah. c. 1S5. the sessions; for without their appearance the sessions cannot he holden.

Dm a justice ought not to join in an order at sessions where- a &/t. 607. in himself is concerned, nor ought his name to be in the caption. An order was quaflicd for that reason.

a. The custos rotulorum ought to be there himself, or by Da!t. c. 1S5. his deputy, who is the clerk of the peace. 3. The Ilieriff also, by himself or his deputy; to receive the fines, to return jurors, to execute process, and what else to his office doth appertain. 4. All coroners. 5.

And they are invited thither by a certain freedom of access, and by protection from common arrest.

No person shall act as solicitor, attorney, or agent, or sue out any process at any general or quarter-sessions, either with respect to matters of a criminal or civil nature, tmlcfs he is admitted and inrolled according to law; on pain of 50I. to him who shall sue in 12 months, with treble costs.

Where authority is given to two justices to do any act, the sessions may do it in all cases, except where appeal is directed to the sessions.

Justices may id'uc their warrants for apprehending personss charged of crimes within the cognizance of the sessions, and bind them over to appear there, although the offender be not yet indicted.

If jurisdiction be given to the sessions, to hear and delei-mine, and doth not say by information, this shall bebyir.-distment, and not upon information.

The sessions is all as one day, and the justices may alter their judgments, at any time whild it continues.

It seemeth certain, that the sessions hath no authority tv amerce any justice, for his non-attendance at the sessions,.as the judges of assize may for the absence of any such jtiflice at the gaol delivery, inter fares non eji fotejias.

The sessions may proceed to outlawry in cases of indiftraentt found before them: but they cannot issue a capias sttlagatum, but mull return the record of the outlawry into the king': bench, and there process of capias utlagatmn shall issue.

The sessions cannot award an attachment for contempt in not complying with their orders; but the ordinary and proper method is by indictment.

The justices are not punishable for what they do in sessions: unless there be some manifed act of oppression, or wilful abuse of power.

The justices being met, the usual course is with three o-yer to proclaim the sessions, and then read the commission of the peace: then the grand jury arc called and sworn, and the charge given to them.

If there be any who are to take their oaths, in order to qualify them for oflices, this mud be done between the hour! of nine and twelve in the forenoon, and not otherwise.

The king's proclamation against profaneness and immorality is also to be read; and likewise divers acts of parliament; against popery; the riot aft; and the black set; the act about ale measures; about burying in woollen ; are required to be given in charge at the sessions; the acts concerning jurors are to be read in Tvlidfnmmer sessions yearly; and the datute against bribery and corruption in eleftiousol members of parliament is to be read at every Eader sessions.

Then the recognizances may be called, especially fitch as D.:h. c. iS are to prosecute and give evidence, that so bills may be drawn ami prepared.

Upon appeals to be made to the sessions against judgments jU.-.t, or orders, the julfices shall cause any defect of form in such original judgments or orders, to bereftified and amended, and then shall proceed.upon the merits.

In cale of trespass and act'ault, the court frequently recom- Cn.Cir. 53 mends to the defendant to talk with the prosecutor, that is, to make him amends for the injury done him j and if thepro-fecutor comes and acknowledges a satisfaction received, the court will set a small fine on the defendant.

Sometimes the profeentor and defendant agree, before the U. defendant pleads 10 the indictment; and then the defendant comes into court in his proper person, and pleads guilty to the indictment; and upon proving, by a subserihing witness,

1 general release executed by the profeentor, the defendant luhaiits to a final! fine, such as the court is pleased to im-pose.

37 OR one year after the expiration of a commission of 15 F.l. c. 9 P sewers, the justices of the peace, or fix of them, (23k) may execute the powers of the said commission, unless a Hew commission shall-bc issued ir. the mean lime.

Sheep.

If any person shall drive away, or steal any (hcep or lamb; or shall wilfully kill any sheep or lamb, with a felonious intent to Heal the carcase or any part thereof; or shall alil!( in committing any the said offences; he shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

And every person, who shall apprehend and prosecuteto conviction any such offender, shall have a reward of 10I.; in order to which, he shall have a certificate signed by the judge, before the end of the nflizes, certifying such conviction, anil where the offence was committed, and that the offender was apprehended and prosecuted by the person claiming tile re-ward; and if more than one claim the reward, he shall therein appoint what share shall be paid to each claimant: whichccr. tificate being tendered to the Ihcriff, he shall pay the same within a month, without deduction, on pain of forfeiting double, with treble costs.

Sheriff.

f-p'HK Ihcriff hath a jurisdiction both in criminal and civil cases; and for this purpose he hath two courts, his torn for criminal causes, which is therefore the king's con::; the other is his county court for civil causes, and this is the court of the sheriff himself.

The sheriff having a justice of the peace's warrant directei to him, shall execute the same; but he need not go in person to execute it, but may authorize another to do it.

On summons, he is bound to attend the sessions of the peace, there to return his precepts, to take the charge of tie prisoners, to receive fines for the king, and the like.

It seems clear, that the Ihcriff is punishable by the justice-in sessions, for defaults in executing their writs and precepts. !

No Ihcriff shall exercise the oflice of a justice of the peace, in any county wherein he is sheriff; and in such calc, lit acts as a justice shall lie void.

If the gaoler fuft'er a felon voluntarily to escape, this, inal-much as it reacheth to life, is felony only in the gaoler, but the sheriff may be indicted, fined, and imprisoned.-

But where the same hath for time out of mind been re- y, paired at the expence of any particular places or persons; or any particular places or persons arc bound by law and ancient iilage to furnish the same with benches, tables, rails, or other fixtures, they shall continue liable as before.

Summons.

IN all legal proceedings, the person complained of ought to have notice of the charge laid again!! him, and to have an T.arn,vd.iv. opportunity of being heard in his own defence. Consequent- A ly, where a person is accused before the justices, they ought to funimon the party to appear,'or issue their warrant to bring him before them. The manner of convening the parties is sometimes directed by the acts of parliament creating the re-.

Ipeflive offences; which therefore ought to be pursued accordingly. In other cases, where it is left discretionary in the justices, it fecmelh most agreeable to the mildness of our laws to put the party to no more inconvenience than needs mull; and therefore, where the case will bear it, a '-‘fumnions fcems more appofitc than a compulsory process. But in cases of sureties of the peace, petty larcenies, and other felonies, and generally where the king is party, and also in cases between party and party, where the body of the offender is li-ablf, a warrant is the regular process, and not a summons.

It ought, upon a just cause of complaint, to be granted by any justice of the peace, against any person whatsoever, nndtr the degree of nobility, being of fane memory, whether he t: a magistrate or private person, and whether he be of full age, or under age. The safest way of proceeding against a peer, is by complaint to the court of chancery or king's bench.

Jf the person to be bound be in the prefenfcc of the jullitt, he may be immediately committed, unless he offers sureties.

The justice may make the warrant under seal, to bring die party before himself or forne other jnflice, or he may make it to bring the party before himself only; for he that maheil the warrant for the moll part hath the bell knowledge of th: matter, and therefore he is the fitted to do judice in the case.

If one who fears that the surety of the peace will be demanded against him, find sureties before any judice of lit dime county, either before or after a warrant is issued agaias him, lie may have a supersedeas from such judice, which shall discharge him from arred from any other judice, at thefuit of the same party, for whose security lie has given fuel surety.

Where a person authorized by warrant of a judice of tk peace, to compel a man who is fheltcred in an house, to ad sureties for the peace or good behaviour, is denied quietly to enter into it, he. may jullify breaking open the door;, h order to take him; but he mud first signify to those in tbs house the cause of his coming, and request them to give bin admittance.

If the warrant special.ly direct that the party shall bebrongl: before the judice who made it, the officer ought not to cajij him before any other; but if the warrant be general, to bring him before any judice of such place, the officer has the election to bring him before what judice he pleaseth, and

Surety for the peace. 303

carry him to pril'on for refilling to find surety before such

justice.

. If the party is carried before another justice, and not before j>ah. c. ui. him who iflited the warrant, such other justice must take the surety, and bind him by recognizance in all points as the form of the precept doth require.

If the officer arrest the party, and do not carry him before Id. the justice to find sureties; or upon the refusal of the party, if the officer shall arrest him, and do not carry him to the gaol, in both these cases the officer is punishable by the justices for this neglect, by indictment and fine at their sessions.

— When the party cometh before the justice, he must offer sureties, orelfethe justice may commit him; for the justice needeth not to demand surety of him.

If a man that was bound to keep the peace, hath broken toml. 7S. his bond, the justices ought of discretion to bind him anew; hat not until he be thereof convicted by due course of law. Cnm. 115.

The recognizance, which the justice takes for the keeping Ci Jgs_ of the peace, is rather of congruity, than by any express authority given either by the common law, or by statute.

The recognizance is forfeited, if the party make default of - //. 7. c. u appearance, and the same default shall be recorded.

It may also be forfeited by any actual violence to the per- 1 Haw. 130. fan of another, whether it be done by the party himself; or by others through his procurement.

The justices cannot in any case proceed again!! the party, hi. for a forfeiture of his recognizance, either in respect of his not appearing, or breaking the peace; the recognizance it-Teif, with the record of default of appearance, ought to be removed into some of the courts at Westminster.

He who is bound to the peace, and to appear at a certain Belt. e. no. day, mill! appear' at that day, and record his appearance, although he who craved the peace cometh not to desire that i; nay be continued; otherwise the recognizance cannot be disch'arged.

Surety for the good behaviour.

A MAN may be compelled to find sureties both for the DjIi. c. jjs, good behaviour and for the peace; and yet the good behaviour includeth the peace: and he that is bound to the good behaviour, is therein also bound to the peace.

The "surety of the good behaviour is.of great affinity with ' n;. that of the peace, and is provided chiefly for the preservation of the peace; and is most commonly granted either in the open sessions, or by two or three justices out of sessions; Yet

Surety for the good behaviour.

by the words of the commission, as also by the common bpi- j nion of the learned, one justice alone, out of sessions, may grant this surety of the good behaviour. But this is not usual, unless it be to prevent lorne 'great and sudden danger, especially against a man that is of any good estate, carriage; or report. And it shall -be good discretion in the justices, that they do not grant it, but either upon suficient cause seen to themfclviss, or upon the snit or complaint of others, and the same very honed.and credible persons.

A man may be bound to his good behaviour for many causes of scandal, which give him a bad same, as being contrary to good manners only; as for conferring with women of bad same; or for speaking words of contempt of an inferior magistrate, as a justice of the peace, or mayor, though he be not then in the actual execution of his office; or of an inferior officer of justice, as a constable, and such like, being in the actual execution of his office.

It seems the better, opinion, that no one ought to be bound to the good behaviour, for any ralh, quarrelibme, or unmannerly words, unless they either directly tend to a breach of the peace, or to scandalize the government, by abusing those who are intruded by it with the administration of justice, or to deter an officer from doing his duty.

The magistrate has a discretionary power to take such surety of all those whom he shall have just cause to suspect 10 be dangerous, quarrelsome, or scandalous; as of thofcivho-deep in the day, and go abroad in the night; and of fad as keep suspicious company; and of such as arc generally fut-pefted to be robbers, common drunkards, and the like; and all other persons of evil same.

In general, whatsoever aft or thing is of itself a miileha. viour, is cause suficient to bind such an offender to good behaviour.

Treason.

THO' treason and misprilion of treason are not within the 4 u„w,

letter of the commission of the peace, yet inasmuch as Hale's PI. i68< they arc against the peace of the king and of the realm, any 1 H. 37--justice of the peace may, either upon his own knowledge, or the complaint of others, cause any person to be apprehended for any such offence. And such justice may take the examination of the person so apprehended, and the information of all those who can give any material evidence against him, and put the same in writing; and also bind over such as are able to give any such evidence to the king's bench, or gaol delivery, and certify his proceedings to such court.

And having committed the offender (for he is by no means bailable by justices of the peace, 3 Ed. 1. c. iy. 2 Ha-v. pp.) it may be adviseable for him to fend an account immediately, of all the particulars, to a secretary of date.

The nature of treason which had not been exactly defined before, was ascertained by the 2; Ed. 3. Which aft was reinforced by the 1 Mar. So that no offence is now to be ellccmed high treason, unless declared to be such by the fiid statute 25 Ed. 3. or by the 1 Mar. or by some subsequent statute.

Where the high constable hath not money in his hand fuf. ficient to answer the said experices, the treafarer !hai! pay the same to such petty constable, on his producing the certificatt, and such other vouchers as aforesaid.

If a petty constable, or governor of any house of correc. § tion, shall coanterleit such certificate or receipt, or knew, ingly permit any alteration to be made therein, he shall forfeit 50I. And if he shall not convey, or cause to be con-Veyed, such vagrants, or not deliver them to the proper person; or if any constable shall refuse to receive any such ptr-son, or to give such receipt, he shall forfeit 20I. by didreii and sale, by warrant of the julticos in sessions, where the of fence shall be committed; half to the informer, and half to the treasurer, to he applied by him as part of the public stock; returning the overplus upon demand, charges of distress being first satisfied.

But if the churchwarden or other person, who shall receive any person so sent, shall think the examination to be fills, he may carry the person so font before a justice, who, if he fs cause, may commit such person to the house of correction till -the next sessions; and the justices there, if they.fee cause, may-deal with such person as an incorrigible rogue: but the person so lent shall not be removed from the place to which he is sent, but by order of two justices, in the same manner si other poor persons are removed to the place of their settlement.

Where any vagrant woman shall be delivered of a child or 17 G. 1. e. 5. children, and become chargeable, the churchwardens or over-kersmay detain such woman in their custody, until they can rifely convey her to a justice; who shall examine her; and commit her to the house of correction until the next sessions; who may, if they fee convenient, order her to be publickly whipped, and detained in the house of correction for any fur- . ther time not exceeding ftx months. And upon application by the' churchwardens and overseers of the place where (lie was lb delivered, the ju.Tices at such sessions shall order the treasurer to pay them such a sum, as shall be adjudged a rca-fcicblc iaiisfhflion for the charges such place has been put to 03 such woman's account. And if such woman shall be de-tained and conveyed to a justice' as aforesaid, the child of which Ihe is delivered, if a bollard, shall not be settled in the place where so born, her be Cent thither for want of other fet-tlemeni,' by a pass, by virtue of this act; but the' settlement of such woman dull be deemed the settlement of such child.

And that it may appear, that the overseers have done svhat Sm, -jcl. h, was incumbent upon them, in order to avoid such settlement, 35--it is requifttc for the justice (as he ought ro do in all other cases wherein lie afletii "as judge) 10 make a record of the whole proceedings before him;'which record (as it seemeth) will be the proper evidence in such case, if the (ettleinent shall afterwards be contclled.

Warrant.

zH, H. 86. TF a justice fee a felony or other breach of the peace eons X mitted in his presence, he may in his own person apprehend the felon; and so he may by word command any person to apprehend him, and such command is a good warrant without writing: but if the same be done in his absence, then he mult issue his warrant in writing.

1 Ui'ji. 84. There seems to be no doubt, but that a warrant may K lawfully granted by any justice, for treason, felony, orpti-munire, or any other offence against the peace: Also it fetat clear, that Wherever a (iatute gives to any one justice a jo-rifdiction over any offence, or a power to require any perfos to do a certain thing ordained by such (Iatute, it by implicit® gives a power to every such justice to make out a warrants bring before him any person accused of such offence, or cost, pcllable to do the thing ordained by such statutej for it cat not but be intended, that a statute giving a person jurisdiSisa over an offence, doth mean also to give him the power incident to all courts of compelling the party to come tiefe: him.

Run. v. iv. But in cases where the king is no party, or where no ter-poral punishment is appointed, as in cases for servants' W2=e, and the like, it seemeth that a summons is the more proper process: and for default of appearance the justice may pieced ; and so indeed oftentimes it is directed by l'perit statutes.

1 II. U. jSi. It is convenient, though not always necessary, that tb

2 II. II. hi. party who demands the warrant be first examined on oats,

touching the whole matter whereupon the warrant is dtmsni cd, and that examination put in writing.

flj/r. c, 1S9. Or at lcall: it is safe to bind him over to give evidence; 1:': afterwards when the offender shall be apprehended, or lb. surrender himself, the party that procured the warrant 1 gone.

zH.H. 107. A justice hath power to

ill.II. So. suspected of felony. For the justices are judges of the id fonableness of the suspicion, and when they have exams! the party accuiing touching the reasons of his suspicion.: they find the causes of suspicion to be reasonable, it is B1 become the justices' suspicion as well as his.

Warrant. 319

Yet insomuch as jnllices claim this power rather by conni- s Jbv>. S<. vance, than any express warrant of law, and since the undue execution of it may prove so highly prejudicial to the reputation as well as the liberty of the party, ajustice cannot well be too tender in his proceedings of this kind, and seems to be punishable not only at the suit of the king, but also of the party grieved, if he grant any such warrant, without such probable cause as might induce a candid and impartial man to suspect the party to be guilty.

Itisfafe, but perhaps not necessary, in the body of the u. warrant to Iheiv the plnce where it was made; yet it seems ne-cdl'ary to set forth the county, in the margin at leak, if it be not set forth in the body.

It may be directed to the sheriff, bailiff, constable, or to jj, any indifferent person by name who is no officer; for the jnf-tice may authorize any one to be his officer, whom he pleases lo make such; yet it is most adviseable to direct it to the con-Sable of the precinct wherein it is to be executed, for that no other constable, and a fortion no private person is compellable to serve it.

In the case of an act of parliament, if the act directeth that L. Rcya. nc. ajustice shall grant a warrant, and doth not say to whom it tSM. 381. shall be directed, by consequence of law it mult be directed to the constable, and it cannot be directed to the sheriff, unless such power is given in the act.

The warrant, especially if it be for the peace or good be- Dah. c. 169-haviour, or the like, where sureties are to be found or re- - !j; quired, ought to contain the special cause and matter where- ~ ' '11 ' upon it is granted, to the intent the party upon whom it is to be served may provide his sureties, and take them with him to the justice to be bound for him; but if the warrant be for treason, murder, or felony, or other capital offence, the warrant of the justice may be to bring the party before him, to make answer to such things or matters generally, as shall be objected again!! him on the king's behalf.

The warrant may issue to bring the party before thejuf- 111. n. 5S2, lice who granted the warrant specially, and then the officer ; H. //. uz. i; bound to bring him before the same justice; hut if the warrant be to bring him before any justice, then it is in the election of the officer to bring him before what justice of the county he thinks fit, and not in the election of the prisoner.

Finally, it ought to be under the hand and seal of the juf- - Hat. Sy. iicewho makes it out.

If any person, again!! whom a warrant shall be issued, shall =4 G- -c- St-escapcout of the jurisdiction of the justice granting the warrant ; any justice for the county or place, where such person shall so escape or be, upon proof on oath of the handwriting of the justice granting such warrant, shall indorse his name thereon; which shall be a sufficient authority to the person

bringing such warrant, and to all other persons to whom the same was originally direcicd, to execute the same in such other county or place; and to carry the offender before the justice who indorsed the warrant, or font c other justice or jut', ticcsof that county, if the offence be bailable, and theof. fender be ready to give bail for his appearance at the nest assizes or feihons for the comity or place where the offence ws committed; and such justice or justices shall take bail accordingly, and shall deliver the recognizance together with the examination or consession of the offender, and all other proceedings rclacingthereto,- to the constable or other person, who shall (on pain of iol. to him who shall fuel deliver over the same to the clerk of assize, or clerk of the peace, where the offender is required to- appear. And if the offence is not bailable, or he shall not give bail to the satisfaction of the justice before whom lie is brought, the constable or other ptr. Ion shall carry the offender before a justice of the props county or place where the offence was committed, there to bt dealt with according to law.

Weights and Measures.

A STANDARD of weights and measures is to be kept SH. 6. c. 5.

in market towns, at which balance all the inhabitants H. may freely weigh without paying any thing; and justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and Rewards of franchises may esquire of offenders against this ordinance, and do execution of them that be found faulty.

The mayors, and other head officers in market towns, shall twice a year or oftner cause all weights and measures within the same, to be brought before them, and examined; and such as they find defective, to be broken and burnt; and the offender shall forfeit to the mayor or other officer, for the -first time, 6s. 8d. for the second time, 13s; 4d. and for the . third time 20s. and be set on the pillory. ' y

And whosoever shall fell by any other weight, measure, 16 C. c, 19. or yard, not according to the standard, or keep any such whereby any thing is bought or sold, shall forfeit 5s. on conviction before one justice, or mayor, on oath of one tvitness; to.be levied by the churchwardens and overseers, or foine of them, to the use of the poor, by distress., In default of diArefs, imprisonment till paid. '

But after all. Dr. Bum observes, notwithstanding the pu-nishments aforesaid, appointed by statute, for felling by false weights and measures; yet the same is also an offence at the : common law, and consequently may be punished by indidU nent, fine, and imprisonment.

Women.

IF any person shall unlawfully and carnally know and abuse ,g any woman child under the age of ten years, he shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

The marriage of any person Under the age of 21, without 2<;g. 2, c. 33. the consent of parents or guardians, shall be null and void.

The judgment against a woman, in case of high treason, is z &,«. 144. not the same as against a man tray for, to be hanged, cut down alive, have the bowels taken out, and the body quar-T t tered;

322 Women.

tered; but to be. drawn to the place of execution, and there burned: and this also is the judgment against a woman, in-case of petit treason; whereas the judgment against a man for petit treason, is, that he shall be hanged.: but in case, of felony, the judgment is the same against both man and woman, to be hanged by the neck till dead.

N. B. After all, it may be doubted, whether ajnfiiu ej the peace can interfere in this aQ at all; lince the act redraws him from proceeding under it, except where the penalty doth not exceed 20I. But there is no penalty under this act less than jol. (except only in a case of neglect in the clerk of the peace) nor is there any power in the justice to mitigate the penalties to less than 25I. being a moiety of the penalties incurred, over and above all cods and charges.

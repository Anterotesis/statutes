Preamble. TI HEREAS his mo ft excellent majejly King George the His majefty’s W Third, by his Utters patent under the great feal of Great ^vantedto^he hearing date at Westminster, the thirtieth day of April 

carl of Dun in twenty first year of his reign, did give and grant unto donald. Archibald earl 0/ Dundonald, his executors, adminijlrators, and ajftgns, his especial licence, foie power, privilege, and authority, of making, ufwg, exercising, and vending, within that part of his Majejly s kingdom of Great Britain called England, the dominion of Wales, and town Berwick upon Tweed, his invention of a method of extracting or making tar, pitch, ejfential oils, volatile alkali, mineral acids, falls, and cinders, from pit coal, for the term offour teen years, with a proviso, obliging the said Archibald earl dun i donald, by writing under his hand and feal, to cause a particular description of the nature of the said invention to be inroiled in his met jejlfs high court of chancery within four months after the date of the said recited letters patent: and whereas the said Archibald earl of Dundonald did, in purfuahee of the said proviso, cause a particular description of the said invention to be enrolled in the high court of chancery upon the twentieth day of Augustin the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty one which description is in the words Specification and form, and Ig the ejfe ft following, that is to fay: The method of the method I have invented for the extracting of tar, pitch, essential oils, of extracting volatile alkalies, mineral acids, and salts, and the making of frompit coal c^n(^ers> rom coal consists in admitting the external air to ’ have a passage or passages through the vessels or buildings in which the coal, from which any of the above substances are to be distilled, is put, whether by itself, or along with lime stone, flints, iron ore, bricks, or any other substance, by which means the said coals, after being kindled, are enabled, C by

by their own heat, and without the afiiftahee of any other fire to throw off, in distillation or vapour, the tar, oil, alkalies acids, and fairs they contain, into receivers or condensing vessels, communicating with the veflfels or buildings containing the coals, and at the same time of roasting, calcining, or burning any substances that may be mixed with them 5 it appears to me necessary, lest others encroach on my patent, to describe, as above, the principal upon which I ad, in as few words as poftible, and in such a manner as will admit of no ambiguity t therefore, according 10 what is above fet forth and declared, persons who shall extract tar, etcetera, from pit coals in vessels or buildings, (it matters not their shape or size)) the coals are made to burn or ignite, without flaming, by a regulated ad million of the external air through .different apertures in the buildings, fo as by their own heat to throw off the tar, oils, etcetera, that they may contain; persons who do fo, without my permission, are deemed to encroach upon my patent; as the only method used or known until my new discovery, was a diftijlation of coal in close vessels, where the admission of the external air was prevented; and whether other fuel or c9als were required besides the coals contained in the close vessel to produce the heat necessary to pervade the same, and to cause the coals contained therein to throw off the tar, oils, etcetera, that they contained. I do not think it any ways of moment to fubjofa any drawings of the buildings or kilns that may be used according to my new invention for the making of tar, etcetera, because these buildings may be made either square, circular, or oval, as fancy may direct, the art depending upon the management of the air admitted into the kilns, which can only be acquired by experience; and as it is by no means meant to keep the manufadure hid or concealed, those who want to see the practical part will have an opportunity foto do at the different places where the manufacture is to be carried on. Exclusive of the above invention, for which only the patent has been obtained, 

I promote the condensation of the less coercible part of the vapour that comes off in distillation, by commixing it with the fleam of boiling water, and complete the condensation by the means of cold water, either in contact with the vapour, or applied externally to the vessels through which it passes; and by an admission of the external air into the condensing vessels when needful, I also cause the vapour to pafs through more con denting vessels than one, to separate by that means the different oils and substances, according to the different degrees of cold and moisture requisite to condenfc them; or occasionally I follow the usual and common modes in practice for condensing the vapours thrown off from any substances by the action of heat : And whereas his aid mojl excellent Majejly, by his other let • His majefty’s ters patent under the feal appointed by the treaty of union to he letters patent kept and used in Scotland, in place of the great feal formerly ujed ^a^e^tc/the there, bearing date the twenty seventh day 0/ February, in the said farl of twenty firjl year of his reign, did grant the like licence, power, donald.

How Lands bolden by Knights, defending to Coparceners within Age, Jha be divided.

their portions, or of the chief Lord, and do homage unto him. And forasmuch as the said Knights haverequested to he certified how it lytth been used heretofore within our Realm of England in like case: (2.) at their inltance we doyouto wit, that such a Law and Culxom is in England in this case. That if any, holding of us in chief, happen to die, having daughters to his heirs, our ancestors and we, after the death of the Father, have always had and received homage of all such daughters, and every of them in this case do hold of us in chies: (3) And if they happened to be within age, we have always had the ward and marriage of every of them: (4) And if he be tenant unto another Lord, and not to us (the filters being within age) the Lord shall have the ward and marriage of them all, and the eldest only shall do homage for herself and all her filters. (5) And whemthe other filters come to full age, they shall do their service to the Lords of the Fee by the hands of the eldelt filter: vet shall not the eldelt by this occasion exalt of her younger fiiters, homage, ward, or any other subjection, for they be all fiiters, and in manner as one heir to one inheritance. (6) If theeldeft Should have homage of the other fiiters, and demand wardship, then the inheritance should be divided, fothat the eldelt filter Should be feigniorefs and tenant of inheritance [simul fcf fmel\ that is to say, heirof her own part, and feigniorefs to her fiiters, which coula not Itand well together in this case, for the elder can demand no more than her fiiters, but the chief meafe by reason ofherancienty. (7) Moreover, if the elder filler Should take homage of the younger, Ihe Should be as a feigniorefs to them all, and Should have the ward of them and their heirs; which Should be no other but to call the Lamb to the Wolf to be devoured. (8) And therefore we command you, that you cause the aforesaid Customs that be used within our Realm of Englandin this case, tobe proclaimed throughout our Dominion of Ireland and to be flraightly kept and observed. In tellimony whereof, &c. I witness myself at Westminster, the ix. day of Ft* binary, in the xiv. year of our Reign.

That a Marshal of Fee, which of new asketh a Paifray of Earls, Barons, and other Holding by a Part of a Barony when they have done Homage, and nevertheless another ralfray when they are made Knights, and of some that ought not to give any, alk a Psufray: (3) It is in like Manner ordained. That the said Marshal of every Earl and Baron, holding by an entire Barony, shall be contented with one Paifray, or with the Price of it, such as he hath used to have of old; (4) so that if he took a Paifray, or the Price of one, at the doing of his Homage in Form aforesaid, he shall take nothing when he is made Knight; and if he took nothing at the doin^ of his Homage, when he is made Knight he shall take.

Given the eighteenth Year of the Reign of King Edward, Son to King Henry.

The Statute of Quo Warranto, made Anno 18 Edw. I. Stat. 2. and Anno Dom. 1290,

How they shall hold their Liberties which claim them by Prescription or Grant. A Quo Warranto shall be pleaded and determined before Justices in the Eyre.

[2 Inst. 494 - 499.]

Forasmuch as Writs of Quo Warranto, and also judgements given upon Pleas of the same, were greatly delayed, because the Justices in giving Judgement were not certified of the King's Pleasure therein; (2) our Lord the King, at his Parliament holden at Westminster, after the Feast of Easter, the eighteenth Year of his Reign, of his special Grace, and for the Affection that he beareth unto his Prelates, Earls, and Barons, and other of his Realm, hath granted, That all under

[They which have Liberties by Prescription shall enjoy them.]

his Allegiance, whatsoever they be, as well spiritual as other, which can verify by good Enquest of the Country, or otherwise, that they and their Ancestors or Predecessors have used any Manner of Liberties, whereof they were impleaded by the said Writs, before the Time of King Richard our Cousin, or in all his Time, and have continued hitherto (so that they have not misused such Liberties) that the Parties shall be adjourned further unto a certain Day reasonable before the same Justices, within the which they may go to our Lord the King with the Record of the Justices, signed with their Seal, and also return; and our Lord the King, by his Letters Patents, shall confirm their Estate. (3) And they that cannot prove the Seisin of their Ancestors or Predecessors in such Manner as is before declared, shall be ordered and judged after the Law and Custom of the Realm; (4) and such as have the King's Charter shall be judged according to their Charters.

[Liberties by the King's Grant.]

II. Moreover, the King of his special Grace hath granted, that all Judgements that are to be given in Pleas of Quo Warranto, by his Justices at Westminster, after the aforesaid Easter, for our Lord the King himself, if the Parties grieved will come again before the King, he of his Grace shall give them such Remedy as before is mentioned. (2) Also our said Lord the King hath granted, for sparing of the Costs and Expenses of the People of his Realm,

[Where Pleas of Quo Warranto shall be determined. Rast. 540.]

that Pleas of Quo Warranto from henceforth shall be pleaded and determined in the Circuit of the Justices, and that all Pleas

now depending shall be adjourned into their own Shires, until the coming of the Justices into those Parts.

Another new Statute of Quo Warranto, Stat. 3. made the same Year to that Effect.*

[Liberties by Prescription, or the King's Grant.]

Concerning the Writ that is called Quo Warranto, our Lord the King, at the Feast of Pentecost, in the eighteenth Year of his Reign, hath established, That all those which claim to have quiet Possession of any Franchise before the Time of King Richard, without Interruption, and can shew the same by a lawful Enquest, shall well enjoy their Possession; (2) and in case that such Possession be demanded for Cause reasonable, our Lord the King shall confirm it by Title. (3) And those that have old Charters of Franchise, shall have the same Charters adjudged according to the Tenor and Form of them. (4) And those that have lost their Liberties sith Easter last passed by the foresaid Writ, according to the Course of Pleading in the same Writ heretofor used, shall have Restitution of their Franchise lost, and from henceforth they shall have according to the Nature of this present Constitution.

(3) And such as hold by Petty Serjeant, as to bear Shield or Spear in the King's Host, or to bear or to carry, Tenure by there is-neither Ward, Marriage, or Relief.

(5) Now somewhat is to be said of the Nature of having chivalry. Wards. There be two manner of Writs to have Wards; one Who shall be is, where Lands be holden in Knights-Jerv; the other is, 9*!"m where Lands be holden in Socage. (6) The Ward of Land \ that is holden in Knights-service belongeth to the chief Lord, Communi and the Marriage, which ought to be without Disparagement, custodia. as the great Charter limiteth, until he cometh to the Age of one and twenty Years. (7) The Ward of an Heir that holdeth Ravishment in Socage, if the Land or Inheritance descend of his Mother's of Ward,

Side, then it belongeth to the next Friend on the Father's Side, and contrariwise. (8) And a Writ to mover Ward may be brought in three Manners, One is, when a Man demandeth Ward of the Land and of the Heir, and that is in Case, when a Man holdeth Land of another, by Kni and the Te-

nant dieth, then may the chief Lord (if he be deforced) demand the Ward of his Land and Heir, and shall have both Ward and Marriage. (9) Another Manner is, when a Mhn is in-feoffed of a Verge of Land by one Man, and by another of a Carve Land, the second Lord, may not bring a Writ of Ward to recover either the Land or the Heir, for the Ward belongeth to him, of whom he was first infeoffed. (10) The third Manner is, where a Man hath Land in his Hands by Reason of a.

Ward, and bath not the Heir, then he may bring a Writ to demand the Heir, and not the Land. Altered by Stat. 12 Car. 2. cap. 24.

CAP. I.

The Causes of Erection of Abbies. Impositions set by Priors Aliens.

[2 Inst. 580. 25 Ed. 3. stat. 6.]

OF late it came to the Knowledge of our Lord the King, by the grievous Complaint of the honourable Persons, Lords, and other Noblemen of his Realm, that whereas Monasteries, Priories, and other Religious Houses were founded to the Honour and Glory of God, and the Advancement of the Holy Church, by the King and his Progenitors, and by the said Noblemen and their Ancestors,

(2) and a very great Portion of Lands and Tenements have been given by them to the said Monasteries, Priories, and Houses, and the Religious Men

[The Cause of the Foundation of Religious Houses.]

serving God in them, to the Intent that Clerks and Laymen might be admitted in such Monasteries, Priories, and Religious Houses, according to their sufficient Ability,

[Hob. 148.]

and that sick and feeble Men might be maintained, Hospitality, Almsgiving, and other charitable Deeds might be done, and that in them Prayers might be said for the Souls of the said Founders and their Heirs;

[Impositions set by certain religious Houses upon their Inferiors.]

(3) the Abbots, Priors, and Governours of the said Houses, and certain Aliens their Superiours, as the Abbots and Priors of Cestercienses, and Premonstratenses, and of the Order of St. Augustine, and St. Benedict, and many more of other Religion and Order, have at their own Pleasure set divers unwonted, heavy and importable Tallages, Payments, and Impositions upon every of the said Monasteries and Houses in Subjection unto them in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, without the Privity of our Lord the King and his Nobility, contrary to the Laws and Customs of the said Realm;

(4) and thereby the Number of Religious Persons, and other Servants in the said Houses and Religious Places being oppressed by such Tallages, Payments, and Impositions, the Service of God is diminished, Alms being not given to the Poor, the Sick, and Feeble, the Healths of the Living and the Souls of the Dead be miserably defrauded, Hospitality, Almsgiving, and other godly Deeds do cease;

(5) and so that which in Times past was charitably given to godly Uses, and to the Increase of the Service of God, is now converted to an evil End; by Permission whereof there groweth great Scandal to the People, and infinite Losses and Disheritances are like to ensue to the Founders

328 Anno tricesimo quinto Edwardi I. [1307.

of the said Houses and their Heirs, unless speedy and sufficient Remedy be provided to redress so many and grievous Detriments.

[3 Bulstr. 45.]

II. Wherefore our foresaid Lord the King, considering that it would be very prejudicial to him and his People if he should any longer suffer so great Losses and Injuries to be winked at, and therefore being willing to maintain and defend the Monasteries, Priories, and other Religious Houses erected in his Kingdom, and in all Lands subject to his Dominion, and from henceforth to provide sufficient Remedy to reform such Oppressions, as he is bound, by the Counsel of his Earls, Barons, Great Men, and other Nobles of his Kingdom in his Parliament holden at Westminster, in the five and thirtieth Year of his Reign, hath ordained and enacted,

(3) And if any will presume to offend this present Statute, he shall be grievously punished according to the Quality of his Offence, and according to his Countempt of the King's Prohibition.

Whereupon after in a Parliament of themost noble Prince King Edward the

Son of King Edward, summoned and assembled at West- Templers be-mtnftery three Weeks after the Day of the Purification of the ing dissolved, blessed Virgin Mary, in the seventeenth Year of the Reign of the Lords of the same King, great Conference was had before the King him- th5 £ces. self, in the Presence of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, Nobles, and great Men of the Realm, and others there present, whether the foresaid Lords of the Fees or others which held those Lands that were the foresaid Templers, as is aforesaid, might retain them by the Law of the Realm, and with safe Conscience.

Whereupon the greater Part of the King's Council, as well the Justices as other lay Persons being assembled together: The said Justices affirmed precisely, that our Lord the King, and other Lords of the Fees aforesaid, might well and lawfully by the Laws of the Realm retain the foresaid Lands as their Escheats, in regard of the ceasing and Dissolution of the Order aforesaid.

But because the Lands and Tenements aforesaid were given to the Brethren of the said Order for the Defence of Christians, and the Holy Land against Pagans and Saracens, and other Enemies of Christ and Christians, and the universal holy Church: It seemed good to our Lord the King, the Noblemen, and others assembled in the same Parliament, for the Health of their Souls and discharge of their Consciences, That whereas the said Military Order of Templars were originally instituted for the Defence of Christians and the universal holy Church, subversion of the Enemies of Christ and Christians, and canonifed to the Augmentation of the Honour of God, and liberal Almsgiving, that the foresaid Lands and Tenements in Demesnes, Lord ships.

And seeing the y might not remedie the same, vnlefs they came into England with an army of men of war. And by the grace of God with such puissance and with the xhelp of great men and Commons of the Realm, they have vanquished and aestroyed the said Hugfh and Hugh, Robert, and Edmond. Wherepre our Soveraign Lord King Edward that now it, at his Parliament holden at Westminster, at the time of his Coronation on the morrow after Candlemas, in the first year of his Reign, upon certain petitions and requests made to him in the said Parliament, upon such articles above rehearsed, by the common counsel of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great men, and«By the Comminalty of the Realm there being by his commandment, hath provided ordained and established in the form following.

HENRY, by the Grace of God, King a/England, Lord ^/Ireland,

their portions, or of the chief Lord, and do homage unto him. And forasmuch as the said Knights haverequested to he certified how it lytth been used heretofore within our Realm of England in like case: (2.) at their inltance we doyouto wit, that such a Law and Culxom is in England in this case. That if any, holding of us in chies, happen to die, having daughters to his heirs, our ancestors and we, after the death of the Father, have always had and received homage of all such daughters, and every of them in this case do hold of us in chies: (3) And if they happened to be within age, we have always had the ward and marriage of every of them: (4) And if he be tenant unto another Lord, and not to us (the filters being within age) the Lord shall have the ward and marriage of them all, and the eldest only shall do homage for herself and all her filters. (5) And whemthe other filters come to full age, they shall do their service to the Lords of the Fee by the hands of the eldelt filter: vet shall not the eldelt by this occasion exalt of her younger fiiters, homage, ward, or any other subjeltion, for they be all fiiters, and in manner as one heir to one inheritance. (6) If theeldeft Should have homage of the other fiiters, and demand wardship, then the inheritance should be divided, fothat the eldelt filter Should be feigniorefs and tenant of inheritance [simul fcf fmel\ that is to say, heirof her own part, and feigniorefs to her fiiters, which coula not Itand well together in this case, for the elder can demand no more than her fiiters, but the chief meafe by reason ofherancienty. (7) Moreover, if the elder filler Should take homage of the younger, Ihe Should be as a feigniorefs to them all, and Should have the ward of them and their heirs; which Should be no other but to call the Lamb to the Wolf to be devoured. (8) And therefore we command you, that you cause the aforesaid Customs that be used within our Realm of Englandin this case, tobe proclaimed throughout our Dominion of Ireland^ and to be flraightly kept and observed.

How they shall hold their Liberties which claim them by Prescription or Grant. A Quo Warranto shall be pleaded and determined before Justices in the Eyre.

[2 Inst. 494 - 499.]

Forasmuch as Writs of Quo Warranto, and also judgements given upon Pleas of the same, were greatly delayed, because the Justices in giving Judgement were not certified of the King's Pleasure therein; (2) our Lord the King, at his Parliament holden at Westminster, after the Feast of Easter, the eighteenth Year of his Reign, of his special Grace, and for the Affection that he beareth unto his Prelates, Earls, and Barons, and other of his Realm, hath granted, That all under

(3) And they that cannot prove the Seisin of their Ancestors or Predecessors in such Manner as is before declared, shall be ordered and judged after the Law and Custom of the Realm; (4) and such as have the King's Charter shall be judged according to their Charters.

[Liberties by the King's Grant.]

II. Moreover, the King of his special Grace hath granted, that all Judgements that are to be given in Pleas of Quo Warranto, by his Justices at Westminster, after the aforesaid Easter, for our Lord the King himself, if the Parties grieved will come again before the King, he of his Grace shall give them such Remedy as before is mentioned. (2) Also our said Lord the King hath granted, for sparing of the Costs and Expenses of the People of his Realm,

[Where Pleas of Quo Warranto shall be determined. Rast. 540.]

that Pleas of Quo Warranto from henceforth shall be pleaded and determined in the Circuit of the Justices, and that all Pleas

Another new Statute of Quo Warranto, Stat. 3. made the same Year to that Effect.*

[Liberties by Prescription, or the King's Grant.]

Concerning the Writ that is called Quo Warranto, our Lord the King, at the Feast of Pentecost, in the eighteenth Year of his Reign, hath established, That all those which claim to have quiet Possession of any Franchise before the Time of King Richard, without Interruption, and can shew the same by a lawful Enquest, shall well enjoy their Possession; (2) and in case that such Possession be demanded for Cause reasonable, our Lord the King shall confirm it by Title. (3) And those that have old Charters of Franchise, shall have the same Charters adjudged according to the Tenor and Form of them. (4) And those that have lost their Liberties sith Easter last passed by the foresaid Writ, according to the Course of Pleading in the same Writ heretofor used, shall have Restitution of their Franchise lost, and from henceforth they shall have according to the Nature of this present Constitution.

(3) And such as hold by Petty Serjeanty as to bear Shield or Spear in the King's Host, or to bear or to carry, Tenure by there is-neither Ward, Marriage, or Relief. (4) Also a free Petty Ser-Sokeman shall not give Ward, nor Relief, but ne shall double je»nty. his Rent after the death of his Ancestor, according as he hath whoftSlbe used to pay to his Lord, and shall not be unmealureably grie- Gardian in ved. (5) Now somewhat is to be said of the Nature of having chivalry. Wards. There be two manner of Writs to have Wards; one Who shall be is, where Lands be holden in Knights-Jerv; the other is, 9*!"m where Lands be holden in Socage. (6) The Ward of Land \ that is holden in Knights-service belongeth to the chief Lord, Communi and the Marriage, which ought to be without Disparagement, custodia. as the great Charter limiteth, until he cometh to the Age of one and twenty Years. (7) The Ward of an Heir that holdeth Ravilhment in Socage, if the Land or Inheritance descend of his Mother's of Ward,

Side, then it belongeth to the next Friend on the Father's Side, and contrariwise. (8) And a Writ to mover Ward may be brought in three Manners, One is, when a Man demandeth Ward of the Land and of the Heir, and that is in Case, when a Man holdeth Land of another, by Kni and the Te-

nant dieth, then may the chief Lord (if he be deforced) demand the Ward of his Land and Heir, and shall have both Ward and Marriage. (9) Another Manner is, when a Mhn is in-feoffed of a Verge of Land by one Man, and by another of a Carve Land, the second Lord, may not bring a Writ of Ward to recover either the Land or the Heir, for the Ward belongeth to him, of whom he was first infeoffed. (10) The third Manner is, where a Man hath Land in his Hands by Reason of a.

Ward, and bath not the Heir, then he may bring a Writ to demand the Heir, and not the Land. Altered by Stat. 12 Car. 2. cap. 24.

(6) And if it be proved by Assise, that the Exception was alledged maliciously, to delay the Plaintiff of his Right, so that they held not the same Land jointly the Day of the Writ purchased, then albeit the same Assise do pass for the Tenants, and against the Plaintiff, yet they that alledge the Exception shall be punched by one Year's Imprisonment, whence they shall not be delivered without a grievous Fine.

(9) And if it be found by Assise, that they were not jointly enfeoffed the Day of the Writ purchased, and likewise that the Tenant against whom the Writ was purchased, or ano? ther named in the Writ, did difleife the Plaintiff, then having regard to the Exception that was falsly and maliciously alledged to the Hurt of the Party, and to the Diffeifin that they made, the Party Plaintiff shall recover his Seisin and double Damages, and they that alledge the false Exception shall have the Punishment aforesaid. (10) But if neither of the Tenants do come at the Day, then upon their Default the Assise shall pass against them. (11) And if it be found thereby that the same Exception was lawfully and truly al ledged, and that they which alledged it were jointly seised before the Plaintiff purchased his Writ against them, the Assise shall pass no further, but the Writ shall be abated.

The same shall be observed, if both or one only do appear, if it be found by Assise that the Exception aforesaid was truly t alledged, as before is said. (13) jointenancy In the same Order it is efta- pleaded in blished and agreed, that in Af- Mortdaun-fifes of Mortdaunceftor, and Ju- Jif

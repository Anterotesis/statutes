How Lands bolden by Knights, defending to Coparceners within Age, Jha be divided.

HENRY, by the Grace of God, King a/England, Lord ^/Ireland,

their portions, or of the chief Lord, and do homage unto him. And forasmuch as the said Knights haverequefted to he certified how it lytth been used heretofore within our Realm of England in like case: (2.) at their inltance we doyouto wit, that such a Law and Culxom is in England in this case. That if any, holding of us in chies, happen to die, having daughters to his heirs, our ancestors and we, after the death of the Father, have always had and received homage of all such daughters, and every of them in this case do hold of us in chies: (3) And if they happened to be within age, we have always had the ward and marriage of every of them: (4) And if he be tenant unto another Lord, and not to us (the filters being within age) the Lord shall have the ward and marriage of them all, and the eldest only shall do homage for herself and all her filters. (5) And whemthe other filters come to full age, they shall do their service to the Lords of the Fee by the hands of the eldelt filter: vet shall not the eldelt by this oc-cafion exalt of her younger fiiters, homage, ward, or any other subjeltion, for they be all fiiters, and in manner as one heir to one inheritance. (6) If theeldeft Should have homage of the other fiiters, and demand wardship, then the inheritance should be divided, fothat the eldelt filter Should be feigniorefs and tenant of inheritance [fimul fcf fmel\ that is to say, heirof her own part, and feigniorefs to her fiiters, which coula not Itand well together in this case, for the elder can demand no more than her fiiters, but the chief meafe by reason ofherancienty. (7) Moreover, if the elder filler Should take homage of the younger, Ihe Should be as a feigniorefs to them all, and Should have the ward of them and their heirs; which Should be no other but to call the Lamb to the Wolf to be devoured. (8) And therefore we command you, that you cause the aforesaid Cultoms that be used within our Realm of Englandin this case, tobe proclaimed throughout our Dominion of Ireland^ and to be flraightly kept and observed.

Such as were compelied, or driuen by feare vnto the battell, and neither fought, ne did hurt: Likewise impotent persons, which, either by force or feare lent their feruants against the Sling and his sonne: And those which being conilrained or led by tore were robbers, and did robberies with the principall robbers, and when they faw opportunitie withdrew, and re-: turned to their houses, and those allb that wittingly bought others goods (hal restore the value of the goods, which they robbed or bought in such manner, and shall be amerced to the King for that they did against Justice, and because the king did forbid the same, halfe a yeere /low passed.

Impotent men and other, which did no harme, shall be re** stored to their lands without delay, and recouer their damages in the kings Court. Let false accusers be punished against the king in such wife as he beleeue. them not lightly thereafter.

All that be ransomed, shall not be bounded to answer for the harmes and trespasses done by them in the time of the commotion aforesayd, but hurts and trefpaflcs shall be forgiuen of either party. Sauing neuertheleste, the exaction to euery man that he shall not intermedle of the sayd commotion failing that that pertaineth to die Church.

Because it seemed dangerous that cattles Should be in thd power of them, which offended against the king, we Award and brdaine touching the castles of Herdley, Byham, and Chertsey, that a reasonable exchange shall be given for them.

Touching Simon de Mountford, Earle of Leicester, his Coun-r teffe and children we fay nothing, for the King hath put their matter into the hands of the King of Fraunce.

Touching London we commend it, and exhort the King, that he by his counfell will prouide a reformation for the state of the citie, as concerning their lands, rents, houses and liberties, and that the same prouifion may be made immediatly.

Concerning the Earle do Ferris, we Award that he be punched by as much as the v^lue of his lands shall amount unto in. vii. yeercs.

All those of the castell shall be in the common forme.of peace, except Honry de HaJHngSj and those that maimed the Kings messenger, which shall be imprisoned. vii. yeeres, or else put thenriselves in the Kings mercy.

Let all men from henceforth keepe the Peace firmly, and let none commit burning of houses, robberies, nor other outrages against the Peace, and whoso doeth, and be convidt thereof shall haue judgment according to the law of the land.

Moreover, all that haue to doe in this behalfe, shall fweatt upon the holy Gospels of God, that none fftall take reueng-tnent, ne procure to betaken, norconsent or suffer that any reuengment be taken by occasion of the commotion aforesaid. And if any take reuengment, he shall be punished after the custome of the Kings court.

Let the Church be satisfied by them that haue hurt her m

: there be any that will not obferue this Award, nor abide the iudgement of the King by his Peers: all that be such shall be of the number of the duherited, and fftall haue no law to hecouer their lands. And if any holding the lands of any person dilherited, be found rebell to this Award: he shall not be admitted to challenge any right in the land or ransome given him by the King.

Moreover who so will not agree to this Award, let him be had asenemie of the king, and nis sonnes, and of all the com-minaltie.: Afid people and Clergy (as farforth as the lawes and commonsdObfiermit) shall puffo^ him-as enemie of the Peace of the Church and of the Realme.

The Statute of Wards and Relief, made Anno 28 Edw. I. Stat. 1. Anno Dom. 1300.

Who shall be in Ward and fay Reliefs and who not. How

many Writs there be to recover Wards.

IT is to wit, that where any Relief is given, there Ward ship wright'sTen.

is incident, and contrariwise. (2) And such as hold by 8<. to 105. Serjeanty, to go with the King in his Host, there Ward and Re- Tenure by lief are incident. (3) And such as hold by Petty Serjeanty as to bear Shield or Spear in the King's Host, or to bear or to carry, Tenure by there is-neither Ward, Marriage, or Relief. (4) Also a free Petty Ser-Sokeman shall not give Ward, nor Relief, but ne shall double je»nty. his Rent after the death of his Ancestor, according as he hath whoftSlbe used to pay to his Lord, and shall not be unmealureably grie- Gardian in ved. (5) Now somewhat is to be said of the Nature of having chivalry. Wards. There be two manner of Writs to have Wards; one Wbo shall be is, where Lands be holden in Knights-Jerv; the other is, 9*!"m where Lands be holden in Socage. (6) The Ward of Land \ that is holden in Knights-service belongeth to the chief Lord, Communi and the Marriage, which ought to be without Disparagement, custodia. as the great Charter limiteth, until he cometh to the Age of one and twenty Years. (7) The Ward of an Heir that holdeth Ravilhment in Socage, if the Land or Inheritance descend of his Mother's of Ward,

Side, then it belongeth to the next Friend on the Father's Side, and contrariwise. (8) And a Writ to mover Ward may be brought in three Manners, One is, when a Man demandeth Ward of the Land and of the Heir, and that is in Case, when a Man holdeth Land of another, by Kni and the Te-

nant dieth, then may the chief Lord (if he be deforced) demand the Ward of his Land and Heir, and shall have both Ward and Marriage. (9) Another Manner is, when a Mhn is in-feoffed of a Verge of Land by one Man, and by another of a Carve Land, the second Lord, may not bring a Writ of Ward to recover either the Land or the Heir, for the Ward belongeth to him, of whom he was first infeoffed. (10) The third Manner is, where a Man hath Land in his Hands by Reason of a.

Ward, and bath not the Heir, then he may bring a Writ to demand the Heir, and not the Land. Altered by Stat. 12 Car. 2. cap. 24.

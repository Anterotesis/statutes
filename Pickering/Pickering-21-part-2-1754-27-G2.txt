[Part of the act of 3 Jac. 1. c. 10. relating to taxing parishes for conveying offenders to gaol, repealed.]

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty fourth day of June so much of the to above mentioned act passed in the third year of King James the First, as relates to taxing the parish where offenders are taken, for defraying the charges of conveying offenders to gaol, shall be repealed.

III. And whereas the expence as well as loss of time in attending courts of justice, is a discouragement to the poorer sort to appear as witnesses against offenders, who thereby escape the publick justice, and the punishment due to their crimes; be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[The charges of attendance to be allowed by the court to poor persons bound to give evidence against felons.]

That from and after the said twenty fourth day of June, when any poor person shall appear on recognizance in any court to give evidence against another accused of any grand or petit larceny, or other felony, it shall and may be in the power of the court, at the prayer and on the oath of such person, and on consideration of his circumstances, in open court to order the treasurer of the county or place in which the offence shall have been committed, to pay unto such person such sum of money, as to the said court shall seem reasonable for his time, trouble and expence;

which order the proper officer of such court is hereby directed and required to make out, and to deliver unto such Person, upon being paid for the same the sum of six pence, and no more; and such treasurer is hereby authorized and required, upon delivery of such order, forthwith to pay to such person, or other person authorized to receive the same, such sum of money as aforesaid, and shall be allowed the same in his accounts.

[In Middlesex the overseers of the poor of the parish where the offender was taken, to pay all such charges.]

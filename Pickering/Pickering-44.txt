WHEREAS the parish schoolmasters in Scotland are a most useful body of men, and their labour have been of essential importance to the publick welfare: and whereas by an act passed in the parliament of Scotland, in the reign of King William the Third, in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-six, intituled, Act for settling of Schools (Scotch act, 1696), it is, inter alia, statuted and ordained, that there be a school settled and established, and a schoolmaster appointed, in every parish not already provided, by advice of the heritors and minister of the parish; and for that effect, that the heritors in every parish meet and provide a commodious house for a school, and settle and modify a salary to a schoolmaster, which shall not be under one hundred merks nor above two hundred merks Scots, to be paid yearly, at two terms, Whitsunday and Martinmas, by equal portions; and certain rules and regulations were laid down by the said act, relative to the apportioning and payment of the said salary by the heritors of the parish: and whereas the highest salary by the said act granted, amounting only to eleven pounds two shillings and two-pence two-thirds of a penny sterling, which by difference in the value of money, and change in the circumstances of the country, has become a provision altogether inadequate for a body of men whose labours are of so great publick utility: may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That, from and after the term of Martinmas next, the salary of each parochial schoolmaster in every parish of Scotland shall not be under the sum of three hundred merks Scots per annum, nor above the sum of four hundred merks Scots per annum, except in the cases herein-after mentioned.

II. And be it further enacted, That within three months after the passing of this act, the heritors possessed of the qualification required by this act, and the minister of every parish, shall hold a meeting, of which intimation shall be given from the pulpit immediately after divine service in the forenoon, and by circular letters, to be written by the minister of the parifla, to such heritors having the qualification prescribed by this a, #,

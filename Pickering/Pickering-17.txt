XL And whereas the pojfeffion of ejlates in lands, tenements, and hereditaments is rendered very precarious by the frequent and fraudulent practice of tenants, in attorning to Jlrangers, who claim title to the ejlates of their respective landlord or landlords, lejfor or lejfors, tvbo by that means are turned out of pojfeffion of their respective /-fates, and put to the difficulty and essence of recovering the pojfeffion thereof by aft ions or juits at law\ for remedy thereof, be it cn- Attommentof acted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said tenants, void* twenty fourth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred arid thirty eight, all and every such attornment and attornments of any tenant or tenants of any meflii-ages, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, within that part of Great Britain called England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposeS whatsoever; and the possession of their respective landlord or landlords, leflor or leflors, shall not be deemed or construed to be any wife changed, altered, or affected by any such attornment or attornments: Provided always, Thats*^*^ nothing herein contained shall extend to vacate or affect any attornment made pursuant to and in consequence of same judgment at law, or decree or order of a court of equity, or made with the privity and consent of the landlord or landlords, leflor Or leflors, or to any mortgagee after the mortgage is become forfeited.

XIL And whereas great inconveniencies have frequently happened to landlords by their tenants fureting declarations in ejectment, which

Most gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain in parliament afTembled, being desirous not only to raise such supplies as are necessary to enable your Majesty to carry on the prclent war with fucceis, but also to use such ways and means therein, as that your Majesty may have the better and more speedy cffe<ft of the said supplies, have resolved to give and grant unto your Majesty the sum of one million out of the furplufles, excesses, and overplus monies, commonly called The Sinking Fund, towards the supply granted to your Majesty for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and forty one; and to that end and purpose do most humbly beseech your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same. That by or out of such monies as now are, or shall from time to time be and remain in the receipt of the exchequer, of the said furplufles, excesses, or overplus monies, commonly called The Sinking Fund, (after paying or reserving sufficient to pay all such sum or sums of money as have been directed by any former act or acts of parliament to be paid out of the same) tnere shall and may be issued, and applied, a sum not exceeding the said sum of one miilion, for and towards the supply granted to his Majesty for the service of the said year one tnoufand seven hundred and forty one; and the commifli-oners of his Majesty treasury, or any three or more of them now being, or the high treasurer, or any three or more of the commissioners of the treasury for the time being, are hereby authorized and empowered to issue and apply the same accordingly.

And whereas it may so happen, that there may be a want of money for carrying on the current service of the said year one thousand seven hundred and forty one, before monies sufficient may have arisen into the exchequer from the said surplusses, to satisfy and pay the said sum of one million by this ah granted; in such cate it shall and may be lawful to and for the said commissioners of his Majesty's treasury, or any three or more of them now being, or the high treasurer, or any three or more of the commimoners of the treasury for the time being, by warrant under their hands to permit and suffer any person or persons, body or bodies politick Mortey to be or corporate, to advance and lend to his Majesty at the receipt borrowed on of his exchequer, so much money as together with the monies the fmkW then remaining in the said exchequer of the said surplusses, ex- percent# ceffes or overplus monies commonly called The SinkingFund> shall interest. be wanting to compleat the said sum of one miilion, upon credit of the growing produce of the said furplufles, excesses or overplus monies, and to be repaid out of the same, as they shall quarterly afterwards arise, together with an interest for the forbearance thereof in the mean time, after a rate not exceeding three

CAP. XLII.

An act for the preservation of the publick roads in that part of Great Britain called England.

[Preamble, amended by 21 Geo. II. c.28.]

WHEREAS the highways of this kingdom are greatly damaged and made ruinous by the excessive weights carried thereon: For preventing thereof, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Trustees appointed to repair the roads may cause weighing engines to be erected at the toll-gates;]

That from and after the twenty ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and forty one, it shall and may be lawful to and for all trustees appointed, or who shall hereafter be appointed, by any act or acts of parliament for the repairs of any highway or highways within that part of Great Britain called England, or for any five of them, at any or as many gate or gates, bar or bars, as they have erected, or shall erect, for the receiving of any toll or tolls, to order and cause to be built or erected any crane, machine or engine, which they shall judge proper, for the weighing of carts, waggons, or other carriages, for the conveying of any goods or merchandize whatsoever, and by writing signed by them, or any five of them,

[and shall weigh carriages and goods;]

to order all and every or any such carriage or carriages, which shall pass through any such gate or bar, to be weighed, together with the loading thereof; and for them, or any five of them, or for any person or persons impowered by them, or any five of them, to receive and take, over and above the toll already granted, or hereafter to be granted,

[and take 20s. a hundred for all above 6000 weight, to be applied to mending the roads.]

the sum of twenty shillings a hundred weight for every hundred weight which every such cart, waggon or carriage, together with the loading thereof, shall weigh, over and above the weight of sixty hundred; and that the money arising from such additional duty of twenty shillings the hundred, shall be applied to the repair of such highway or highways where such gate or gates, bar or bars, are or shall be placed.

[Farmers may carry goods for hire, &c.]

II. Provided always, That from and after the twenty ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and forty one, it shall and may be lawful for any farmer or other person to carry goods for hire, from the fifteenth day of April to the twenty ninth day of September, in carriages drawn on wheels bound with streaks or tire of any breadth; any law or statute to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

[Collectors may seize for the additional duty.]

III. And be it further enacted, That in case any person shall neglect or refuse to pay such additional duty of twenty shillings the hundred as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said trustees, or any five of them, or any person or persons impowered by them or any five of them, to levy the same by distress and sale of goods of the person or persons so neglecting or refusing, in such manner as they are impowered to levy any other toll or duty which is or shall be given by any other statute

478 Anno decimo quarto Georgii II. c. 42. [1741.

or statutes for repair of such highway or highways, where such cranes, machines or other engines shall be placed.

[Penalty on persons opposing the collectors in their duty.]

IV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall or do hinder, or with force, or otherwise attempt to hinder or obstruct the weighing any such cart, waggon or carriage as aforesaid, or the seizing, distraining or carrying away any such distress, or any matter or thing which shall be seized, distrained or taken for default of payment of the said additional toll or duty of twenty shillings the hundred; or shall rescue the same, or use any violence to any person or persons concerned in such weighing, distraining or seizure; every such person shall, on oath thereof made by one witness before a justice of the peace of the county or place where such offence, shall be committed or such offender shall dwell, be sent to the common gaol of such county or place for three months, and shall forfeit the sum of ten pounds; half thereof to be paid to the informer, and the other half to be employed in the repair of the said highways, which penalty shall be levied on the goods of such person so offending as aforesaid, by a warrant from such justice; and if the penalty be not paid in three days after distress made, the person who shall be authorized by the said warrant to make such distress, may sell the said goods, and detain out of the money arising from such sale the said penalty of ten pounds, returning the overplus (if any) to the owner of the said goods.

[What carriages shall not be weighed.]

V. Provided always, That nothing in this act shall be deemed or construed to extend to carts, waggons, or other carriages employed only about husbandry, or carrying of only cheese, butter, hay, straw, corn unthreshed, or chalk, or any one stone, block of marble or piece of timber, nor to caravans, or the covered carriages of noblemen and gentlemen for their private use, or such timber, ammunition or artillery as shall be for his Majesty's service.

VI. And whereas an act was made in the fifth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First, intituled, An act for making more effectual the several acts passed for repairing and amending the highways of this kingdom; which hath proved insufficient for that purpose, by reason that the said act extends to such waggons and carts only as travel for hire, and by reason of many difficulties in the manner of convicting and punishing the offenders against the same;

[Act 5 Geo. 2. c.12. strengthened, and made more extensive.]

For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said act, and all and singular the clauses, penalties and forfeitures therein contained, shall extend, and be construed to extend to all waggons and carts, and to the owners and drivers thereof, his and their horses, with the geers, bridles, halters and accoutrements,

[In part repealed by 15 Geo. 2. c.2.]

whether travelling for hire, or not for hire, or in any manner whatsoever; and that all and every person and persons who shall offend against the said act, or this present act, shall for every such offence (being thereof convicted upon oath within the space of three days next after such offence before any one or more justice or justices of the peace of the county, city, liberty or division, where such offence

1741.] Anno decimo quarto Georgii II. C. 43. 479

shall be committed, or where such offender or offenders shall happen to be) several ly forfeit, be subject and liable to, the respective penalties and forfeitures in the said act contained; to be levied, recovered and applied in such manner, and to such uses, as in and by the said act is mentioned and directed; and his and their horses, with the geers, bridles, halters and accoutrements, shall for the space of three days next after such offence be and remain subject and liable to such seizures and distresses, and for the use and benefit of such person and persons, as they would or might have been, had they been seized or distrained in the fact, during the commission of such offence.

VII. And be it further enacted, That if any action or actions shall at any time or times hereafter be brought against any person or persons whatsoever, for any matter or thing which he, she or they shall do, or cause to be done, by virtue or in execution of this act,

[General issue.]

that in such case the defendant or defendants in every such action or actions shall and may plead the general issue, and give this act, and the special matter in evidence on any trial or trials to be hereafter had in such action or actions; and that if the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any such action or actions shall discontinue such action or actions, or become nonsuit, or if judgment shall be given against such plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action or actions,

[Treble costs.]

that then the defendant or defendants in every such action or actions shall recover his or their treble costs of suit; any law, custom or usage whatsoever to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

CAP. XLIII.

An act to enable Thomas Smith, esq; lord of the manor of Farlington in the county of Southampton, to supply the town of Portsmouth, and parts adjacent, with good and wholesome water, at his own proper costs and charges.

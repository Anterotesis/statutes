XL And whereas the possession of estates in lands, tenements, and hereditaments is rendered very precarious by the frequent and fraudulent practice of tenants, in attorning to strangers, who claim title to the estates of their respective landlord or landlords, lejfor or lejfors, tvbo by that means are turned out of possession of their respective /-fates, and put to the difficulty and essence of recovering the possession thereof by actions or juits at law\ for remedy thereof, be it en- Attomment of acted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said tenants, void* twenty fourth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight, all and every such attornment and attornments of any tenant or tenants of any meflii-ages, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, within that part of Great Britain called England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposeS whatsoever; and the possession of their respective landlord or landlords, leflor or leflors, shall not be deemed or construed to be any wife changed, altered, or affected by any such attornment or attornments: Provided always, Thats nothing herein contained shall extend to vacate or affect any attornment made pursuant to and in consequence of same judgment at law, or decree or order of a court of equity, or made with the privity and consent of the landlord or landlords, leflor Or leflors, or to any mortgagee after the mortgage is become forfeited.

XII. And whereas great inconveniencies have frequently happened to landlords by their tenants fureting declarations in ejectment, which

have been delivered to themy or by refusing to appear to such ejeft-mentis or to suffer their landlords to take upon them the defence Aeainst'fe- thereof \ be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That nantsfecrcting ^rom and after the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand ejeftments. seven hundred and thirty eight, every tenant, to whom any declaration in ejedtment shall be delivered for any lands* tenements, or hereditaments, in that part of Great Britain called England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall forthwith give notice thereof to his or her landlord or landlords, or his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, under penalty of forfeiting the value of three years improved or rack relit of the premisses so demised or holden in the possession of such tenant* to the person of whom he or she holds; to be recovered by action of debt to be brou|ht in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, or in the counties palatine of Chestery Lan* caster> and Durham, respectively, or in the courts of grand-sessions in Wales-, wherein no efioin, protection, or wager of law shall be allowed, nor any more than one imparlance.

XIII. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, Landlord im- That it shall and may be lawful for the court where such qedt-powered to ment shall be brought, to suffer the landlord or landlords to' make himself make him, her, or themselves defendant or defendants, by ^nin Tith7 joining with the tenant or tenants, to whom such declaration in the'tenant* cjeCtment shall be delivered, in case he or they shall appear; but

XIV. And to obviate some difiiculties that many times occur Rents how to in the recovery of rents, where the demises are not by deed, be where the de- further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and af-inifes are not ter the said twenty fourth day of June, it shall and may be lawful by deed. to and for the landlord or landlords, where the agreement is not

XV. And whereas where any lejfor or landlord, having only an estate for life in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments demised, happens

pens to die before or on the day* on which any relit is reserved, or made payable, such relit, flr 007 ^ar/ thereof\ is not by law recoverable by the executors or administrators of such lejfor or landlord; nor is the person in reversion entitled thereto, any other than for the use and occupation of such lands, tenements, hereditaments, from the death

of the tenant for life; of which advantage hath been often taken by the under-tenantsy who thereby avoid paying any thing for the fame-y for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid. Rentsrecover-That from and after the twenty fourth day of June9 one thou- able from un-sand seven hundred and thirty eight, where any tenant for life der-tenant,

XVI. And whereas landlords are often great sufferers by tenants running away in arrear % and not only Suffering the demised premisses to lie uncultivated without any distress thereon % whereby their landlords or leffors might be satisfied for the relit-arrear y but also refusing to deliver up the possession of the demised premiffes, whereby the landlords are put to the expence and delay of recovering in ejc8ment\ be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said ^Jloixls for twenty fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and where tenants thirty eight, if any tenant holding any lands, tenements, or he- deserttbe pre^ reditaments, at a rack-relit, or where the relit reserved shall bemiffcl-full three fourths of the yearly value of the demised premisses, who shall be in arrear for one year's relit, shall desert the demised premisses, and leave the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so as no sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of relit; it shall and may be lawful to and for two or more justice* of the peace of the county, riding, division, or place (having no interest in the demised premisses) at the request of the lessor or landlord, leffors or landlords, or his, her, or their bailiff or receiver, to go upon and view the same, and to affix, or cause to be affixed, on the most notorious part of the premises notice in writing, what day (at the distance of fourteen days at lead), they will return to take a second view thereof; and if upon such second view the tenant, or some person on his or her behalf,

shall not appear, and, pav the relit in arrear, or there shall not b* sufficient distress upon the premisses; then the said justices may put the landlord or landlords, feffor or leffors, into the possession of the said demised premisses; and the lease thereof to such tenant

and whereas an act passed in the seventh year of the reign of King James the First, for the due execution of divers laws heretoforth made against rogues, vagabonds and sturdy beggars, and other lewd and idle persons, it is (amongst other things) enacted, That there shall be erected, built or otherwise provided, within every county of this realm of England and Wales, where there is not one house of correction already built, provided or continued, one or more fit and convenient house or houses of correction, by the justices of the peace, or the more part of them, at their respective quarter sessions; and that the master or governors of the said houses of correction shall have sums of money yearly, as shall be thought meet by the said justices; the same to be paid quarterly beforehand,

[43 Eliz. c. 2.]

by the treasurers appointed by an act made in the three and fortieth year of the late Queen Elizabeth, intituled, An act for the relief of the poor; which said act was to continue for seven years, and till the end of the next session of parliament, and was further continued by an act passed in the third year of the reign of King Charles the First, intituled, An act for the continuance and repeal of divers Statutes, unto the end of the first session of the next parliament; and by an act passed in the sixteenth year of the same reign continued in force, until repealed by some other act of parliament: and whereas by an act passed in the forty third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled, An act for the relief of the poor, it is (amongst other things) enacted, That the justices of the peace of every county or place corporate, or the more part of them, in their general sessions to be holden next after the feast of Easter, and so yearly, as often as they shall think, meet, shall rate every parish to such a weekly sum of money as they shall think convenient, so as no parish be rated above the sum of six pence, nor under the sum of an halfpenny, weekly to be paid, and

318 Anno duodecimo Georgii II. [1739.

so as the total sum of each taxation of the parishes in every county amount not to above the rate of two pence for every parish within the said county; and it is thereby likewise enacted, That the justices of the peace at their general quarter sessions to be holden at the time of such taxation shall set down what competent sums of money shall be sent quarterly out of every county or place corporate, for the relief of the poor prisoners of the King's bench and Marshalsea; and also of such hospitals and alms-houses as shall be in the said county, and what sums of money shall be sent to every one of the said hospitals and alms-houses; so as there be sent out of every county yearly twenty shillings at the least to each of the said prisons of the King's bench and Marshalsea; which sums are rateably to be assessed upon every parish, and to be levied and collected as in and by the said act is directed: and whereas by an act passed in the fourteenth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, intituled,

[14 Eliz. c. 5.]

An act how vagabonds shall be punished, and the poor relived; it is enacted, That the justices of the peace of every county, or the more part of them, in their general quarter sessions, shall rate every parish at such reasonable sums of money, for the relief of prisoners, as they shall think convenient, so as no parish be rated above six pence or eight pence weekly; and the churchwardens of every parish shall levy the same every Sunday, and once in every quarter pay the said sums to the high constables or other head officers; and the said high constables and head officers shall pay the money received of the said churchwardens to such person as shall be appointed by the said justices in sessions, to be by them distributed weekly for the relief of prisoners; so much of which said act as relates to the taxing, levying, receiving, and employing of gaol money, was revived and continued to the end of the then next session of parliament, by an act passed in the first year of the reign of King James the First, intituled, An act for continuing and reviving of divers Statutes, and for repealing of some others; and was further continued by an act passed in the twenty first year of the reign of the said King James, intituled, An act for continuing and reviving of divers Statutes, and repeal of divers others; and was further continued to the end of the next session of parliament, by an act passed in the third year of the reign of King Charles the First, intituled, An act for the repeal and continuance of divers Statutes; and by an act passed in the sixteenth year of the same reign, was continued in force, until repealed by some other act of parliament: and whereas by an act passed in the nineteenth year of the reign of King Charles the Second, intituled,

[19 Car. 2. c. 4.]

An act for relief of poor prisoners, and setting them on work, it is (amongst other things) enacted, That the justices of the peace at their general sessions, or the major part of them, if they think fit, may provide a stock of materials for setting poor prisoners on work, in such manner and by such ways as other county charges are levied and raised, and provide and pay fit persons to oversee such work, and make such orders concerning the premisses, as they from time to time shall think fit, provided that no parish be rated a-bave six pence by the week towards the premisses:

[12 Ann. stat. s. c. 23.]

and whereas by an act passed in the twelfth year of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Anne, for reducing the laws relating to rogues, sturdy beggars, and

1739.] Anno duodecimo Georgii II. c. 29. 319

vagrants, into one act of parliament, and for the more effectual punishing such rogues, vagabonds, sturdy beggars, and vagrants, and sending them whither they ought to be sent; it is (amongst other things) enacted, That the justices of the peace at their quarter sessions may from time to time, when need shall be, by such ways and means as monies for county gaols or bridges may be raised, cause such sums of money to be raised within their respective precincts and jurisdictions, for the passing and conveying or maintaining of rogues and vagabonds, as shall be necessary for these purposes; which said several rates, when collected, are to be said, by virtue of the said several acts, into the hands of treasurers or receivers to be appointed by the justices at their respective general or quarter sessions of the peace, and to be accounted for, as in and by the said several respective acts are recited: and whereas it is apparent that the manner and methods prescribed by the said several acts for collecting some of the said rates are impracticable, the sums charged on each parish in the respective divisions being so small, that they do not by an equal pound rate amount to more than a fractional part of a farthing in the pound on the several persons thereby ratable; and if possible to have been rated, the expence of assessing and collecting the same would have amounted to more than the sum rated: and whereas many and great doubts, difficulties and inconveniences have arisen in making and collecting other of the said rates; therefore that the good ends and purposes of the said several Statutes may be answered, and the several sums of money thereby intended to be raised may effectually be collected, with as much ease and certainty, and as little expence as can be to the parties obliged by the said laws to pay the same; be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[After 1 Sept. 1739, justices to make from time to time one general assessment, instead of the several rates appointed by several acts;]

That from and after the first day of September, one thousand seven hundred and thirty nine, the justices of the peace in that part of Great Britain called England, within the respective limits of their commissions, at their general or quarter sessions, or the greater part of them then and there assembled, shall have full power and authority, from time to time, to make one general rate or assessment for such sum or sums of money as they in their discretions shall think sufficient to answer all and every the ends and purposes of the before recited acts, instead and in lieu of the several separate and distinct rates directed thereby to be made, levied and collected; which rate shall be assessed upon every town, parish or place within the respective limits of their commissions, in such proportions as any of the rates heretofore made in pursuance of the said several acts have been usually assessed; and the several and respective sums so assessed upon each and every town, parish or place within the respective limits of their commissions, shall be collected by the high constables of the respective hundreds and divisions, in which any town, parish or place doth lie, in such manner, and at such times, at is herein after directed.

320 Anno duodecimo Georgii II. c. 29. [1739.

II. And, that the respective sum or sums so to be assessed and collected may be well and truly paid to the respective high constables, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[to be paid out of the poors rate of every parish to the high constable,]

That the churchwardens and overseers of the poor for the time being of each and every parish and place within the respective counties, cities and liberties, in which they respectively lie, shall and they are hereby required, out of the money collected or to be collected for the relief of the poor of such parish or place, to pay to the high constables of the respective hundreds or divisions of the said counties, cities and liberties, the respective sum or sums of money so rated and assessed upon such parish or place, within the space of thirty days after demand thereof made in writing, to be given to the said churchwardens or overseers of the poor, or any of them, or left at their or either of their dwelling-house or houses, or affixed on any of the church doors of such parish or place to which such officer shall belong, by the said high constable or high constables of the respective hundreds or divisions; which demand the respective high constable or high constables is and are hereby required to make, at such times as the said justices of the peace, or the greater part of them, shall by their order in sessions direct; and the receipt or receipts of such high constable or high constables shall be a full and sufficient discharge to such churchwardens and overseers of the poor, or other person paying the same, and shall be allowed in their accounts as such by the justices of the peace before whom such accounts shall be passed:

[or to be levied on them by distress.]

and in case such churchwardens and overseers of the poor or any of them, shall neglect or refuse to pay any the sum or sums of money hereby assessed, after demand made as aforesaid; such high constable or high constables shall and they are hereby impowered to levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels, of such churchwardens and overseers or either of them so refusing or neglecting to pay the same as aforesaid, by warrant under the hands and seals of two or more justices of the peace of the County, ridings division, city, town-corporate, liberty, or place, residing in or near such parish or place; rendering the overplus, if any there shall be, after deducting the money assessed, and the charges of the distress and sale, to the owner or owners thereof.

[Where there is no poor's rate, the petty constable of the place to levy and pay the county rate.]

III. Provided nevertheless, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in case no rate is or shall be made for the relief of the poor in any parish, township, or place; the justices of the peace in their respective general or quarter sessions, or the greater part of them then and there assembled, shall and may by their order direct the sum of money assessed on such parish, township, or place, for the purposes of this act, to be rated and levied on any such parish, township, or place, by any petty Constable, or other peace officer, of or belonging to the same, in such manner as money for the Relief of the poor is by law to be rated or levied; which sum, so rated and levied shall be paid by such petty constable or other peace officer to

1739.] Anno duodecimo Georgii II. c. 29. 321

the respective high constable for the hundred, division, or liberty, wherein such parish, township, or place shall lie; and shall be demanded of, paid by, or levied on such petty constable or other peace officer, in the same manner as any rates are herein before directed to be demanded of, paid by, and levied on the churchwardens and overseers of the poor, or any of them; and if such petty constable or other peace officer shall pay such sum, before the same shall be so by him rated and levied as aforesaid, he may afterwards rate and levy the same, or shall and may be allowed and reimbursed the said sum of money out of any constables or other rate made or to be made on any such parish, township, or place, which the said justices of the peace or the greater part of them in their sessions shall order and direct.

IV. And whereas it will be very inconvenient to many towns, parishes, and places, in the several counties of York, Derby, Durham, Lancaster, Chester, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumberland, that the rates by this act directed to be paid by and levied on the churchwardens and overseers of the poor for the purposes aforesaid, Should be paid out of any rate to be made for the relief of the poor in such towns, parishes, and places; be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[Counties excepted from paying the rate of this act out of the poors rate.]

That it shall and may be lawful to and for the justices of the peace for the respective ridings, divisions, or counties of York, Derby, Durham, Lancaster, Chester, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumberland, at their respective general or quarter sessions, or the greater part of them then and there assembled, if they shall think convenient, to order the sum of money directed to be assessed on any such town, parish, or place, for all or any of the purposes of this act, to be paid by and levied on the petty constable of or for any such town, parish, or place within the said counties respectively, in such manner as the same is herein directed to be paid and levied, in cases where no rate is made for the relief of the poor; any thing herein contained, or any law, usage, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Proviso, in favour of places heretofore not paying county rates.]

V. Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That this act, or anything herein contained, shall not extend or be construed to extend to make any persons, liberties, divisions, or places liable to pay to any rate to be made in pursuance of this act, to which such person, liberty, division, or place did not, or was not liable to contribute before the parting hereof; but that it shall and may be lawful to and for the justices of the peace at their respective general or quarter sessions, or the greater part of them then and there assembled, to order and ascertain what proportion of any rate to be made by virtue of this act shall be assessed on and paid by the several persons, liberties, divisions, and places, who have usually contributed, or are liable to pay only to one or more of, and not to all the rates hereby intended to be raised, and thrown into one general rate or assessment.

Most gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, being desirous not only to raise such supplies as are necessary to enable your Majesty to carry on the prclent war with fucceis, but also to use such ways and means therein, as that your Majesty may have the better and more speedy cffe<ft of the said supplies, have resolved to give and grant unto your Majesty the sum of one million out of the surplusses, excesses, and overplus monies, commonly called The Sinking Fund, towards the supply granted to your Majesty for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and forty one; and to that end and purpose do most humbly beseech your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That by or out of such monies as now are, or shall from time to time be and remain in the receipt of the exchequer, of the said surplusses, excesses, or overplus monies, commonly called The Sinking Fund, (after paying or reserving sufficient to pay all such sum or sums of money as have been directed by any former act or acts of parliament to be paid out of the same) there shall and may be issued, and applied, a sum not exceeding the said sum of one million, for and towards the supply granted to his Majesty for the service of the said year one thousand seven hundred and forty one; and the Commissioners of his Majesty treasury, or any three or more of them now being, or the high treasurer, or any three or more of the commissioners of the treasury for the time being, are hereby authorized and empowered to issue and apply the same accordingly.

III. And whereas for many yeari past there have been no considerable new loads or veins of tin and copper discovered\ and the greatest and most considerable mines of tin and copper within the county of Cornwall are become so deep> that all means for the draining water out of them have already proved ineffectual \ and it hath been found by experience^ that under the present duties upon coals the application of fire engines to the draining the waters out of the mines in the said county of Cornwall bath been impracticable^ from the great expence attending the same; Therefore for the encouragement of such valuable works, wherein a great number of tinners, labourers and adventurers are employed, and sublist thereby; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty Coals used In fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and forty one, the(tin-works for all coals which shall be used in fire engines, for the draining water out of the mines of tin and copper, within the said edadrawback county of Cornwall, and for which duties have been first an- of all the di*-fwered and paid, a drawback shall be allowed and made of all ties, such duties, upon proof by oath made before the customer or collector of the said duties (which oath he is hereby impowered and required to administer) that such coals have been so used and applied, which drawback of all the said duties shall be returned and paid by the collector of the said duties to such person so making proof as aforesaid.

And whereas it may so happen, that there may be a want of money for carrying on the current service of the said year one thousand seven hundred and forty one, before monies sufficient may have arisen into the exchequer from the said surplusses, to satisfy and pay the said sum of one million by this ah granted; in such cate it shall and may be lawful to and for the said of of his Majesty's treasury, or any three or more of them now being, or the high treasurer, or any three or more of the commimoners of the treasury for the time being, by warrant under their hands to permit and suffer any person or persons, body or bodies politick Mortey to be or corporate, to advance and lend to his Majesty at the receipt borrowed on of his exchequer, so much money as together with the monies the fmkW then remaining in the said exchequer of the said surplusses, ex- percent# ceffes or overplus monies commonly called The SinkingFund> shall interest. be wanting to compleat the said sum of one million, upon credit of the growing produce of the said surplusses, excesses or overplus monies, and to be repaid out of the same, as they shall quarterly afterwards arise, together with an interest for the forbearance thereof in the mean time, after a rate not exceeding three

CAP. XLII.

An act for the preservation of the publick roads in that part of Great Britain called England.

[Preamble, amended by 21 Geo. II. c.28.]

WHEREAS the highways of this kingdom are greatly damaged and made ruinous by the excessive weights carried thereon: For preventing thereof, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Trustees appointed to repair the roads may cause weighing engines to be erected at the toll-gates; ]

That from and after the twenty ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and forty one, it shall and may be lawful to and for all trustees appointed, or who shall hereafter be appointed, by any act or acts of parliament for the repairs of any highway or highways within that part of Great Britain called England, or for any five of them, at any or as many gate or gates, bar or bars, as they have erected, or shall erect, for the receiving of any toll or tolls, to order and cause to be built or erected any crane, machine or engine, which they shall judge proper, for the weighing of carts, waggons, or other carriages, for the conveying of any goods or merchandize whatsoever, and by writing signed by them, or any five of them,

[and shall weigh carriages and goods; ]

to order all and every or any such carriage or carriages, which shall pass through any such gate or bar, to be weighed, together with the loading thereof; and for them, or any five of them, or for any person or persons impowered by them, or any five of them, to receive and take, over and above the toll already granted, or hereafter to be granted,

[and take 20s. a hundred for all above 6000 weight, to be applied to mending the roads.]

the sum of twenty shillings a hundred weight for every hundred weight which every such cart, waggon or carriage, together with the loading thereof, shall weigh, over and above the weight of sixty hundred; and that the money arising from such additional duty of twenty shillings the hundred, shall be applied to the repair of such highway or highways where such gate or gates, bar or bars, are or shall be placed.

[Farmers may carry goods for hire, &c.]

II. Provided always, That from and after the twenty ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and forty one, it shall and may be lawful for any farmer or other person to carry goods for hire, from the fifteenth day of April to the twenty ninth day of September, in carriages drawn on wheels bound with streaks or tire of any breadth; any law or Statute to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

[Collectors may seize for the additional duty.]

III. And be it further enacted, That in case any person shall neglect or refuse to pay such additional duty of twenty shillings the hundred as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said trustees, or any five of them, or any person or persons impowered by them or any five of them, to levy the same by distress and sale of goods of the person or persons so neglecting or refusing, in such manner as they are impowered to levy any other toll or duty which is or shall be given by any other Statute

478 Anno decimo quarto Georgii II. c. 42. [1741.

or Statutes for repair of such highway or highways, where such cranes, machines or other engines shall be placed.

[Penalty on persons opposing the collectors in their duty.]

IV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall or do hinder, or with force, or otherwise attempt to hinder or obstruct the weighing any such cart, waggon or carriage as aforesaid, or the seizing, distraining or carrying away any such distress, or any matter or thing which shall be seized, distrained or taken for default of payment of the said additional toll or duty of twenty shillings the hundred; or shall rescue the same, or use any violence to any person or persons concerned in such weighing, distraining or seizure; every such person shall, on oath thereof made by one witness before a justice of the peace of the county or place where such offence, shall be committed or such offender shall dwell, be sent to the common gaol of such county or place for three months, and shall forfeit the sum of ten pounds; half thereof to be paid to the informer, and the other half to be employed in the repair of the said highways, which penalty shall be levied on the goods of such person so offending as aforesaid, by a warrant from such justice; and if the penalty be not paid in three days after distress made, the person who shall be authorized by the said warrant to make such distress, may sell the said goods, and detain out of the money arising from such sale the said penalty of ten pounds, returning the overplus (if any) to the owner of the said goods.

[What carriages shall not be weighed.]

V. Provided always, That nothing in this act shall be deemed or construed to extend to carts, waggons, or other carriages employed only about husbandry, or carrying of only cheese, butter, hay, straw, corn unthreshed, or chalk, or any one stone, block of marble or piece of timber, nor to caravans, or the covered carriages of noblemen and gentlemen for their private use, or such timber, ammunition or artillery as shall be for his Majesty's service.

VI. And whereas an act was made in the fifth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First, intituled, An act for making more effectual the several acts passed for repairing and amending the highways of this kingdom; which hath proved insufficient for that purpose, by reason that the said act extends to such waggons and carts only as travel for hire, and by reason of many difficulties in the manner of convicting and punishing the offenders against the same;

[Act 5 Geo. 2. c.12. strengthened, and made more extensive.]

For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said act, and all and singular the clauses, penalties and forfeitures therein contained, shall extend, and be construed to extend to all waggons and carts, and to the owners and drivers thereof, his and their horses, with the geers, bridles, halters and accoutrements,

[In part repealed by 15 Geo. 2. c.2.]

whether travelling for hire, or not for hire, or in any manner whatsoever; and that all and every person and persons who shall offend against the said act, or this present act, shall for every such offence (being thereof convicted upon oath within the space of three days next after such offence before any one or more justice or justices of the peace of the county, city, liberty or division, where such offence

1741.] Anno decimo quarto Georgii II. C. 43. 479

shall be committed, or where such offender or offenders shall happen to be) severally forfeit, be subject and liable to, the respective penalties and forfeitures in the said act contained; to be levied, recovered and applied in such manner, and to such uses, as in and by the said act is mentioned and directed; and his and their horses, with the geers, bridles, halters and accoutrements, shall for the space of three days next after such offence be and remain subject and liable to such seizures and distresses, and for the use and benefit of such person and persons, as they would or might have been, had they been seized or distrained in the fact, during the commission of such offence.

VII. And be it further enacted, That if any action or actions shall at any time or times hereafter be brought against any person or persons whatsoever, for any matter or thing which he, she or they shall do, or cause to be done, by virtue or in execution of this act,

[General issue.]

that in such case the defendant or defendants in every such action or actions shall and may plead the general issue, and give this act, and the special matter in evidence on any trial or trials to be hereafter had in such action or actions; and that if the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any such action or actions shall discontinue such action or actions, or become nonsuit, or if judgment shall be given against such plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action or actions,

[Treble costs.]

that then the defendant or defendants in every such action or actions shall recover his or their treble costs of suit; any law, custom or usage whatsoever to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

CAP. XLIII.

An act to enable Thomas Smith, esq; lord of the manor of Farlington in the county of Southampton, to supply the town of Portsmouth, and parts adjacent, with good and wholesome water, at his own proper costs and charges.

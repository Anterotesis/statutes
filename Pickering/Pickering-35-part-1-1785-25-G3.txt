An act for vejling in Archibald earl tf/'dundonald, his executorsy administrators, and ofsigns, the sole use and property of a method of extracting or making tar, pitch, essential oils, volatile alkali, mineral acids, falls, and cinders, from pit coal, throughout his Majesty's dominions, for a limited time.

Preamble. TI HEREAS his mo ft excellent majesty King George the His majesty's W Third, by his Utters patent under the great seal of Great ^vantedto^he hearing date at Westminster, the thirtieth day of April

carl of Dun in twenty first year of his reign, did give and grant unto donald. Archibald earl 0/ Dundonald, his executors, administrators, and assigns, his especial licence, foie power, privilege, and authority, of making, using, exercising, and vending, within that part of his Majesty s kingdom of Great Britain called England, the dominion of Wales, and town Berwick upon Tweed, his invention of a method of extracting or making tar, pitch, essential oils, volatile alkali, mineral acids, falls, and cinders, from pit coal, for the term offour teen years, with a proviso, obliging the said Archibald earl dun i donald, by writing under his hand and seal, to cause a particular description of the nature of the said invention to be inroiled in his met jejlfs high court of chancery within four months after the date of the said recited letters patent: and whereas the said Archibald earl of Dundonald did, in purfuahee of the said proviso, cause a particular description of the said invention to be enrolled in the high court of chancery upon the twentieth day of Augustin the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty one which description is in the words Specification and form, and Ig the ejfe ft following, that is to say: The method of the method I have invented for the extracting of tar, pitch, essential oils, of extracting volatile alkalies, mineral acids, and salts, and the making of frompit coal c^n(^ers> rom coal consists in admitting the external air to'have a passage or passages through the vessels or buildings in which the coal, from which any of the above substances are to be distilled, is put, whether by itself, or along with lime stone, flints, iron ore, bricks, or any other substance, by which means the said coals, after being kindled, are enabled, C by

1785.] Anno vicesimo quinto georg It Iil, C 44/ i31

by their own heat, and without the afiiftahee of any other fire to throw off, in distillation or vapour, the tar, oil, alkalies acids, and fairs they contain, into receivers or condensing vessels, communicating with the vessels or buildings containing the coals, and at the same time of roasting, calcining, or burning any substances that may be mixed with them 5 it appears to me necessary, lest others encroach on my patent, to describe, as above, the principal upon which I ad, in as few words as possible, and in such a manner as will admit of no ambiguity t therefore, according 10 what is above set forth and declared, persons who shall extract tar, etcetera, from pit coals in vessels or buildings, (it matters not their shape or size)) the coals are made to burn or ignite, without flaming, by a regulated ad million of the external air through .different apertures in the buildings, so as by their own heat to throw off the tar, oils, etcetera, that they may contain; persons who do so, without my permission, are deemed to encroach upon my patent; as the only method used or known until my new discovery, was a distillation of coal in close vessels, where the admission of the external air was prevented; and whether other fuel or c9als were required besides the coals contained in the close vessel to produce the heat necessary to pervade the same, and to cause the coals contained therein to throw off the tar, oils, etcetera, that they contained. I do not think it any ways of moment to fubjofa any drawings of the buildings or kilns that may be used according to my new invention for the making of tar, etcetera, because these buildings may be made either square, circular, or oval, as fancy may direct, the art depending upon the management of the air admitted into the kilns, which can only be acquired by experience; and as it is by no means meant to keep the manufacture hid or concealed, those who want to see the practical part will have an opportunity foto do at the different places where the manufacture is to be carried on. Exclusive of the above invention, for which only the patent has been obtained,

I promote the condensation of the less coercible part of the vapour that comes off in distillation, by commixing it with the fleam of boiling water, and complete the condensation by the means of cold water, either in contact with the vapour, or applied externally to the vessels through which it passes; and by an admission of the external air into the condensing vessels when needful, I also cause the vapour to pass through more con denting vessels than one, to separate by that means the different oils and substances, according to the different degrees of cold and moisture requisite to condenfc them; or occasionally I follow the usual and common modes in practice for condensing the vapours thrown off from any substances by the action of heat: And whereas his aid most excellent Majesty, by his other let His majesty's ters patent under the seal appointed by the treaty of union to he letters patent kept and used in Scotland, in place of the great seal formerly ujed ^a^e^tc/the there, bearing date the twenty seventh day 0/ February, in the said farl of twenty first year of his reign, did grant the like licence, power, donald.

ip t ion of the nature of the said invention to be inroiled in his ma je/ly s chancery in Scotland, within four months after the date of the said recited letters patent; in pursuance of which proviso the said Archibald earl of Dundonald did cause such description to be in rolled in the said chancery of Scotland upon the twenty sixth day of June, in the said year one th oufand seven hundred and eighty one, in the same words and form, and to the same effect, as that hereinabove mentioned, as inr oiled in the high court of chancery England; and whereas, in the opinion of competent judges who have attended to the said Archibald earl of dundonald's method, and examined and used the tar, pitch, and other extractions, the invention will be attended with, the mof beneficial consequences to the public, the process being simple and easy, and the tar and pitch of a better quality for certain ujes than what is generally made in foreign countries, and particularly useful in preserving Ships bottoms from worms: and whereas the said Archibald earl of Dundonald spent much of his time, and was at a great expense in bringing his said invention to perfection before applying for the patents; and after he had procured them, his circumstances not permitting him to carry on the necessary works without the aid of others, the connexions he formed with that view turned out unfortunately y so that hitherto, and when upwards of four years of the term are elapsed, he has reaped no benefit, but on the contrary, his paternal estate is involved in debt; and he is under engagements, by taking leases of coal mines and other wise, which must be ruinous, unless the scheme is prosecuted with vigour by a large advance of money: and whereas the remainder of the Short term of exclusive privilege, granted by the said recited patents, does not afford sufficient encouragement to people otherwise willing to support the said Archibald earl Dundonald; and unless he is supported, the public must be. deprived of the benefit of the invention, while the privilege remains with him: to the end, therefore. That the said Archibald earl of Dundonald may be enabled and encouraged to prosecute and Complete his said invention, and his properly therein fecund, not only within Great Britain, but in his Majesfs colonies and plantations in North America, so that the public may reap all the advantages to be derived therefrom in their fullefi extent, and the said Archibald earl of Dundonald may obtain an adequate recompense for his labour, time and expencey may it please your most excellent Majesty (at the humble petition and request of the said Archibald earl of Dundonald) that it may be enabled, and be it enacted by the king's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual. and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same.

V And whereas, although from the various and disputed rights of voting in fever a I cities, boroughs, and other places, a pojitive oath of qualification cannot be required from the elehors, yet it is apprehended that unqualified per Jons may be deterred from polling at such'

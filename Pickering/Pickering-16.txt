tioned shall neglect or refuse to pay unto the said mayor and ci- Refuting to tizens, and their successors, or their order, the said respective sums of six shillings and eight pence, and six shillings and eight {trair^&e!" pence, by them respectively to be paid, as aforesaid, for the space of ten days next after demand thereof made, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said mayor and citizens, and their successors, to recover the said respective sums* by distress and safe of the goods and chattels of such person and persons refusing or neglecting to pay the same, rendring the overplus to the owner or owners, after the charges of such distress and sale are satisfied; or the said mayor and citizens, and their successors, may sue for, and recover the same, by action- of debt, to be brought in the name of the said mayor and citizens, in any court of record; in which action the defendant or defendants may plead the general issue, and the special matter on both fides may be given in evidence, and the court may award costs on either side, which costs shall be recovered as in other cases, where costs are given by law; and in any such action no wager of law, essoin, privilege, or protection, shall be allowed, or more than one imparlance.

X. And whereas by an act passed in the fifth year of his late majesty king George the First's reign, intituled, An act against clandestine running of uncustomed goods, and for the more effectual preventing of frauds relating to the customs, several provisions are made, relating to the )manner of examining and viewing pitch and tar, and making certificates for the same, in order to obtain the premium granted for such pitch and tar, and for injlifting penalties and forfeitures on any officer of the customs, who- shall demand or

1729.] Anno secundo Georgii II, 0, 35, 107

take any fee, gratuity or rewani for the examining, viewing or delivering such pitch > tar or other naval fores, with respehi to the premium or reward allowed by law, or for the making or signing a certificate in order to the receiving such premium or reward; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the several clauses, to be continu-matters and things contained in the said act of the fifth year ed during this of his said late Majesty, so far as the same relate to the examin- a<^* ing and viewing such pitch and tar of the produce of his Majesty's plantations, and for inflicting penalties and forfeitures upon any officer of the customs, demanding or taking any fee, gratuity or reward for examining, viewing or delivering such pitch, tar or other naval stores, with respect to the premium, and for the making or signing a certificate in order to the receiving such premium or reward, shall be continued and put in practice during the continuance of this act, as if the several matters, things and penalties were again repeated and re-enact-ied in the body of this present act 5 any law, custom or ulage to the contrary notwithstanding.

XL And whereas by an act passed in the eighth year of his late SGeo.i.c.ii. Majesty's reign, intituled, An act giving further encouragement for the importation of naval tores, and for other purposes therein mentioned, a particular method is prescribed for the making of tar from green trees prepared for that purpofie; and, before the importers were intitled to any premium, oath was to be made, that the trees were prepared after the following mannerthat is to say, when such trees were fit to bark, the bark thereof was firipped eight foot, or thereaboutS) up from the root of each tree, a flip of the bark of about four inches in breadth having been left on one side of each tree; that each tree, after having been so barked, hadflood during one year at least, and was not before cut down for the making tar; which method, if the same was followed, there is great reason to apprehend would make the tar of the plantations much cooler, and more fit for the uses of navigation; b'ut the inhabitants of the plantations, not being experienced in that method of making tar, cannot as yet furnish any quantities of tar made according to those directions: as a further encouragement therefore for the making of tar according to the directions of the said act, be it further enacted, That all and Premium for every person and persons that shall import or cause to be im- cka^tar^ ported into this kingdom any clean, good, merchantable, well conditioned tar, clear of dross or water, and fit in every respect for making cordage, made from trees prepared as aforesaid, according to the directions of the said act of the eighth year of his late Majesty's reign, shall receive, as a premium for the same, four pounds per tun, containing eight barrels, and each barrel to gauge thirty one gallons and one half, to be well hooped and filled up, on the importation thereof: Provided always, That the-importer of such tar, before he be intitled to any reward or premium for the same, shall produce to the proper officers of his Majesty's customs (who are to grant certificates upon the importation of tar) such certificate upon oath, that all the said tar was made without mixture of any other tar therewith, according

to the directions of the said act, as in the said act for that purpose is particularly mentioned and required.

XII. And whereas there are in several parts of North Britain commonly called Scotland, great fore of pine andfir trees fit for maftsy yards and howfprights, but the lands and woods, which may yield such naval jlores, are mofily in parts mountainous and remote from, navigable rivers; therefore, for the encouragement of the proprietors of such lands and woods, in the making roads, passages and rivers in those northern parts useful and commodious to the publick, as well as for conveying such trees fit for mafis, yards and boivfprights to sea*ports in North Britain, to be brought by sea to that part of Great Britain called England: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every person or persons, or bodies corporate, that shall, from and after the twenty ninth day of September one thousand mans \; c seven hundred and twenty nine, during the time limited for the irom^cotland granhng of premiums to the importers of naval {lores from*America by Virtue of this act, bring from North Britain aforesaid, into any port of South Britain aforesaid, any trees of twelve (inches diameter and upwards, fit for mails, yards or bow-fprights, regularly converted and hewed at leafi: into eight squares, found, fresh and in good and merchantable condition, shall have and receive as a reward or premium for bringing such naval {lores from North Britain to South Britain, for such trees fit for yards, mails or bowfpights^r tun (allowing forty foot to each tun, girt-measure, according to the customary way of measuring round bodies) the sum of one pound, which said reward and premium shall likewise be paid and answered, in good and lawful money of Great Britain, by the of or principal officers of his Majesty's navy, who are hereby required and impowered to make out a bill or bills to be paid in course on certificate for the same, upon certificate of the respective chief officer or from the chief officers of the customs in any port of South Britain, where such place^fim-C h*ees fit for mails, yards or bowfprights shall be imported as portation, aforesaid; such bill or bills to be made out and given to the person or persons, or bodies corporate, importing the same as aforesaid, within 'twenty days after the discharge and unlading of the ship or vessel, ships or vessels in which such trees shall be imported, upon a certificate or certificates to be produced to the chief officer or officers of the customs where such trees shall be imported, which certificate or certificates shall be under the 2nd the comp- hands and seals of the comptroller and collector of his Majesty's p-oller, &-C*. of customs, and such naval officer as his Majesty shall think fit to where the)$ appoint, or any two of them, residing at any such port or ports tl-ees are firit m North Britain as his Majesty under the great seal of Great shipped, Britain shall think fit to appoint, where such trees shall be im-barked or shipped, in order for importing the same into any port of South Britain, that before the departure of such ship or vessel, 111ips or vessels, the persons, traders or factors concerned or employed in cutting down such trees, or any two of them, had made affidavit in writing before such comptroller and collector of his Majesty's customs in North Britain, and such naval officer

XIII. And whereas by two several acts of parliament made in the eighth year of the reign of his late majesty King George the'First*For g Geot t c^talcing off the duty upon all salt uled in curing of red herrings &'*

or white herrings, and for laying proportionable duties on such herrings consumed at home only, one duty or rate of one shilling and eight pence per thousand was laid on all red herrings cured pro-riiifcuoufly with red herrings designed for exportation, but afterwards delivered out for home consumption; and another duty or rate of three shillings and four pence per barrel was laid on all white herrings cured promiscuously with white herrings designed for exportation, but afterwards delivered out for home consumption; and in each of the said dfts there is a provisiton, that in case the duties of excise on salt (which then amounted to three shillings and four pence per bushel on home made salt, aridfix shillings and eight pence per bushel on foreign salt) or any of them Should cease determine or be redeemed by parliament, then the respective rates and duties thereby imposed Should cease or be lefjcited in proportion to the.duties on salts that Should so cease, determine or be abated.

XIV. And whereas in consequence.of this present aff? four parts in five of the whole of the said duties on salt, both home made and foreign, computed together, will cease, determine and be abated from the twenty fifth day ^December one thousand seven hundred and thirty; be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid,

That a proportional part or parts of the said several rates and duties imposed by the last mentioned acts on red herrings and white herrings delivered out for home consumption, that is to say, four parts in five of each of them shall, from and after the said twenty fifth day of December one thousand seven hundred and thirty, cease, determine or be abated, so that the duties or rates on such red or white herrings shall from thenceforth be charged only after the rate of four pence for every thousand of such red herrings, and of eight pence for every barrel of such

white herrings; and the said reduced duties shall be paid and payable to the proper officers of the customs in the manner as before is directed concerning the duty on foreign salt; and in all other respects the several provisions in the same acts, in relation to the said duties or rates, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

XV. Provided always, That if the maker or curer of such red or white herrings or Home consumption, at the time for making the entry directed by both the said acts of the eighth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the First (in order to have the casks and vessels containing the same, marked, and a permit from the officer for the removal thereof) shall make oath in writing before the officer to be appointed for receiving the said entry (which oath the said officer is hereby impowered to administer) that the red or white herrings then en-tred for home consumption were cured only with salt of the product or manufacture of Great Britain, without any mixture of foreign salt whatsoever, then and in such case the said red or white herrings shall not be charged with any duty at all; but nevertheless the casks or vessels containing the same shall be marked, and such permit shall be given by the officer for the removal thereof, as the said acts direct, save only that instead of expressing in such permit, that the duties had been paid for such red or white herrings, the same shall express that such oath had been made as is before directed; and if it shall afterwards appear, that the said red or white herrings, so as aforesaid permitted to be removed without paying any duty, were cured with foreign salt or any mixture thereof, the maker or curer thereof shall (o-t ver and besides the penalties or punishments which he may suffer by law for false swearing or perjury) be also liable to all the penalties and forfeitures which are by the said last mentioned acts respectively laid or imposed on any offenders, that shall remove red or white herrings without entry, or not paying the said duties.

XVI. And whereas by the eighth article of the treaty of union between the kingdoms ^England and Scotland, it was (amongf other things relating to the duties on salt, which Scotland was after the union to be liable to) agreed, That from and after the union there Should be allowed five /killings ferling for every barrel of beef or pork salted with foreign salt, without mixture of British or Irish salt, and exported for file from Scotland to parts beyond sea, alterable by the parliament of Great Britain; and whereas by an act of parliament made in the fifth year of the reign of her said late majesty Jfiueen Anne, intituled, An act for the ease of her Majesty's subjects, in relation to the duties upon salt, and for making the ljke allowances upon the exportation of white herrings, flesh, oatmeal and grain called beer, alias bigg, as are made upon exportation of the like from Scotland, it'was amongf other things enacted\ That for every barrel of salted beef or pork which Should be exported for file from any port of the kingdom ^England, dominion of W ales or town ^Berwick upon Tweed, to pai'ts beyond the seas, after the first day of May one thoufajid fevet) hundred and fey$k> by any p erf on

persons whatsoever, ffo/v Should be for each barrel the like alloiv-rfj dr<? to be allowed on such beef and pork exported from Scotland, to be paid out of the duties on salt: and whereas the granting to Scotland the said allowance on the exportation of beef or pork salted with foreign salt only, to which they were immediately after the union to become liable, and the granting the same allowance to England, was to preserve an equality of trade in both the kingdoms, when united y but as in consequence of this act^ seven parts in ten of the duties on foreign salt will be taken off or be abated, it is reasonable also that the said allowances Should on that account be reduced and abated also; be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the said twenty fifth day of December one thousand seven hundred and thirty, the said allowances of five shillings per barrel on the exportation of salted beef or pork exported for sale, from any part of Great Britain to any parts beyond the seas, shall be reduced to an allowance of one shilling and six pence per barrel, and no more, on all beef or pork salted with foreign salt only, without any mixture of Britisfh or Irish salt, to be paid out of the same duties or revenues, and in the same manner as the bounties or allowances on fish exported are hereby before directed to be paid,

XVII.

[The cause to be heard in a summary way.]

the said judge or judges shall in a summary way examine into the matter of such petition, and hear what can or shall be alledged on either side for or against the discharge of such prisoner, upon which examination the said judge and judges is and are impowered and required to administer or tender to such prisoner the oaths in the said recited act directed and appointed to be taken by any prisoner before the judges of the court out of which the process upon which such prisoner was taken in execution issued; and the said judge or judges of assize or great sessions shall give such judgment, relief

1730.] Anno tertio Georgii II. c.27. 181

[Judgments to be entred on record.]

by the said judge or judges of assize or great session so given as aforesaid, shall be as good and effectual to all intents and purposes, as if the same had been made in the court out of which the process issued on which such prisoner was taken in execution; and the like proceedings shall be had thereupon, and a record of such judgment shall be made up in the same form, and returned and certified under the hand or hands of the judge or judges before whom it shall be made, unto the court from whence the process on which such prisoner was taken in execution issued, to be a record of the said court, and to be kept as such amongst the other records there.

V. And whereas divers rules or orders may have been made by the Courts of law in Westminster-Hall for the bringing up of prisoners, pursuant to the said recited act, from prisons at great distance from the cities of London and Westminster, which have not been obeyed by the respective sheriffs or gaolers in whose custody such prisoner or prisoners then were, by reason of the great expence attending the same; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[Orders made for bringing prisoners to Westminster-Hall vacated.]

That all such rules or orders as have been made by any of the courts in Westminster-Hall, for bringing up of such prisoners to any such courts, and all attachments and proceedings thereon, be and the same are hereby discharged and made void; and that all sheriffs and gaolers be and are hereby protected and indemnified against all actions that are or shall be brought against them, or any of them, for not obeying such rules or orders.

VI.

And whereas the said William Trench did, pursuant to the power so given him, actually ered and build a lighthouse on the said rock or island, called the Skerries, and laid out and expended in the same upwards of three thousand pounds, and also lost a ship and cargo of materials of a considerable value: (which were obliged to be fetched from distant parts) with his only son, in going to the said island to carry on the said work: and whereas the said lighthouse has been, and is of conftaqt use and benefit, not only to his Majesty's ships of war and pacquet boats, but likewise to other ships and vessels passing and crofting between Great Britain and Ireland, and to and from Ireland to Great Britain, and to ships failing through Saint George's Channel, to and from the ports south of Holyhead^ to the land's end of England, and of frequent qfe and benefit to the ports north of Leverpoob. and yvfiereas the said William Trench departed this life on or about the twenty-first day of funey in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-five, and by Lis last will and testament did charge the said lighthouse, and the duties thereof, with all his debts^ and left a legacy of five hundred pounds to Ruth Trenchy hi^ then wife, who became the only acting executrix of the faicj will, and made Sutton Morgan clerk, master of arts, and Anne ftis wife (daughter and-only surviving child of the said William Trench) residuary legatees: and whereas the said Ruth Trenchy since the death of the said William Trench, hath, by deed dated the thirtieth day of December, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine, conveyed all her right, title, and interest of, in, and to the said legacy of five hundred pounds, and of, in^ and to the said letters patent, and the lighthouse erecfted oq the rock or island of Skerries y to the said Sutton Morgan, his heirs, and assigns, for the remainder of the term of sixty years, mentioned in the said patent, on condition that he the said Sutton Morgan shall pay and discharge, as well the creditors of the said William Trendy as also the creditors of the said Ruth Trench, whose names are mentioned and set forth in^schedule annexed to the deed of assignment made between the said Sutton Morgan and the said Ruth Trench: and whereas it fq happened, that during the life-time of the said William Trenchy as well as since the said Sutton Morgan has been in possession of the said lighthouse, that the expence of maintaining"the fgme has amounted to more than the duties annually

That the said river Dee was thentofore navigable for flips and vessels of a considerable burden from the fra to the city of Chester, but by negteft of the said river, and for want of sufficient banks, works and fences on the fides thereof against the flux and reflux of the fepy the chanel of the said river was become so various and uncertain, that by sands and otherwise the navigation to the said city was almost loft and destroyedy the mayor and citizens of the said city of Chester, and their successors, were impoivered to make the said river navigable from the sea to the said city of Chester for flips of one hundred tuns or upwardsy and to enable them so to do certain duties in the said act mentioned were laid upon coals, lime and lime stone brought to and unloaded within the liberties of the said city y for the term of twenty one years, and the property of the fandsy foil and ground therein mentioned was immediately from and after such time as the said river and, chanel Should be made navigable and pajfable with and for such ships and vessels to and from the said city of Chester, to be vested in the said mayor and citizens, and their successors for every and they were $t liberty to defendy inclose and improve the famcy and receive the rents and profits thereof, and apply the same for maintaining and repairing the intended works and fences, and for making, erecting and doing such further and other worksy fences and things from time to timey as occasion Should require, for making and keeping the said river navigable: and whereas several considerable films of money have been laid out and expended pursuant to the said acty but the said river is not made' navigable, the provisions for making the same navigable by the said recited act being insufficienty and the time thereby granted for making the same navigable is noiv expired: and whereas the fandsy foil and ground not bearing grafsy commonly called The White Sands, from the city of Chester to the feay and lying between the county of Chester on the north side and the county of Flint on the ftuth fidey are of great breadth in most places, and the said river not being navigable is chiefly owing to the breadth of the said sands and to the Jhifting of the chanel from one side thereof to the othery as the winds and tide vary: and whereas tpe said sandy foil and groundy commonly called The White Sands, qre not nor qre lifely to be of-any advantage or benefit to any person

whatsoever, unless the said river be bounded in and made na-yigable by sea walls, fences as aforesaid, which will require a very great expence, as well to ere51 as to maintain and repair from time to time, as occasion fiall require; yet nevertheless, if the said finds, foil or ground, commonly called The White Sands, were recovered from the sea by sea walls, banks and fences as aforesaid, and the chattel thereby' confined to one certain courfi, it would not "only esse finally make the said river navigable, but vesting the said White Sands in the undertakers would be a considerable encouragement to the undertaking thereof; and whereas the making the said river navigable will bq a means to advance the trade of the said city, and great benefit will accrue ihereby to the inhabitants thereof and to the towns and countries adjacent or near the said river} as also be a means to increase the number of fiamen and watermen, and promote the publick good of this kingdom: may it therefore please your most excellent Majesty that it may be enacted,

WHEREAS by the ancient common law of this land, all elections ought to be free: and whereas by an act passed in the third year of the reign of King Edward the First, of famous memory, it is commanded, upon great forfeiture, that no man by force of arms, nor by malice, or menacing, shall disturb any to make free election: and forasmuch as the freedom of elections of members to serve in parliament, is of the utmost consequence to the preservation of the rights and liberties of this Kingdom: and whereas it hath been the usage and practice to cause any regiment, troops or company, or any number of soldiers, which hath been quartered in any city, borough, town, or place where any election of members to serve in parliament hath been appointed to be made, to remove and continue out of the same during the time of such election, except in such particular cases as are herein after specified:

[On notice of election of a member, the Secretary at war, or person acting as such, to send proper orders in]

To the end therefore that the said usage and practice may be settled and established for the future; be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons in parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That when and as often as any election of any peer or peers to represent the peers of Scotland in parliament, or of any member

or members to serve in parliament, shall be appointed to be writing for made, the secretary at war for the time being, or in case there shall be no secretary at war, then such person who shall officiate in the place of the secretary at war, shall and is hereby required at some convenient time before the day appointed for such election, to issue and send forth proper orders in writing for the removal of every such regiment, troop, or company, or other number of soldiers, as shall be quartered or billeted in any such city, borough, town or place where such election shall be appointed to be made, out of every such city, borough, town or place, one day at the lead before the day appointed for such election, to the distance of two or more miles from such city, borough, town or place, and not to make any nearer approach to such city, borough, town, or place as aforesaid, until one day at the least after the poll to be taken at such election shall be ended, and the poll books closed.

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in case the secretary at war for the time being, or such person who shall officiate in the place of the secretary at war, shall neglect or omit to issue or send forth such orders as aforesaid according to the true intent and meaning of this act, and shall be thereof lawfully convicted upon any indictment to be preferred at the next assizes, or sessions of oyer and terminer, to be held for the county where such offence shall be committed, or on an information to be exhibited in the court of King's Bench within six months after such offence committed, such secretary at war, or person who shall officiate in the place of the secretary at war,

[on penalty of forfeiting his office, &c.]

shall for such offence be discharged from their said respective offices, and shall from thenceforth be utterly disabled, and made incapable to hold any office or employment, civil or military, in his Majesty's service.

[Not to extend to Westminster or other place of residence of the royal family, &c.]

III. Provided nevertheless, That nothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to the city and liberty of Westminster, or the borough of Southwark, for and in respect of the guards of his Majesty, his heirs or successors, nor to any city, borough, town, or place, where his Majesty, his heirs or successors, or any of his royal family shall happen to be or reside at the time of any such election as aforesaid, for or in respect of such number of troops or soldiers only as shall be attendant as guards to his Majesty, his heirs or successors, or to such other person of the royal family as is aforesaid;

[or fortified places; ]

nor to any castle or fortified place, where any garrison is usually kept, for or in respect of such number of troops or soldiers only whereof such garrison is composed.

[or any officer, &c. having a right to vote at such election.]

IV. Provided likewise, That nothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to any officer or soldier who shall have a right to vote at any such election, as aforesaid, but that every such officer and soldier may freely, and without interruption, attend and give his vote at such election; any thing herein before contained to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

[The secretary at war, &c. not liable, in case of vacancy.]

V. Provided always, That the secretary of war, or in case there shall be no secretary at war, then such person who shall officiate in the place of the secretary at war, shall not be liable to any forfeiture or incapacity for not sending such order, as aforesaid, upon any election to be made of a member to serve in parliament on a vacancy of any seat there,

[unless notice of the writ be given by the clerk of the crown.]

unless notice of the making out any new writ for such election shall be given to him by the clerk of the crown in Chancery or other officer making out any new writ for such election, which notice he is hereby directed and required to give with all convenient speed after making out the said writ.

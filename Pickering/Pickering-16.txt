1729.] Anno secundo Georgii II. c. 19, 41

tioned shall neglect or refuse to pay unto the said mayor and ci- Refuting to tizens, and their successors, or their order, the said respective sums of six shillings and eight pence, and six shillings and eight {trair^&e!" pence, by them respectively to be paid, as aforesaid, for the space of ten days next after demand thereof made, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said mayor and citizens, and their successors, to recover the said respective sums* by distress and safe of the goods and chattels of such person and persons refusing or neglecting to pay the same, rendring the overplus to the owner or owners, after the charges of such distress and sale are satisfied; or the said mayor and citizens, and their successors, may sue for, and recover the same, by action- of debt, to be brought in the name of the said mayor and citizens, in any court of record; in which action the defendant or defendants may plead the general issue, and the special matter on both fides may be given in evidence, and the court may award costs on either side, which costs shall be recovered as in other cases, where costs are given by law; and in any such action no wager of law, essoin, privilege, or protection, shall be allowed, or more than one imparlance.

Majesty's reign, intituled, An act giving further encouragement for the importation of naval tores, and for other purposes therein mentioned, a particular method is prescribed for the making of tar from green trees prepared for that purpofie; and, before the importers were intitled to any premium, oath was to be made, that the trees were prepared after the following mannerthat is to say, when such trees were fit to bark, the bark thereof was firipped eight foot, or thereaboutS) up from the root of each tree, a flip of the bark of about four inches in breadth having been left on one side of each tree; that each tree, after having been so barked, hadflood during one year at least, and was not before cut down for the making tar; which method, if the same was followed, there is great reason to apprehend would make the tar of the plantations much cooler, and more fit for the uses of navigation; b'ut the inhabitants of the plantations, not being experienced in that method of making tar, cannot as yet furnish any quantities of tar made according to those directions: as a further encouragement therefore for the making of tar according to the directions of the said act, be it further enacted, That all and Premium for every person and persons that shall import or cause to be im- cka^tar^ ported into this kingdom any clean, good, merchantable, well conditioned tar, clear of dross or water, and fit in every respect for making cordage, made from trees prepared as aforesaid, according to the directions of the said act of the eighth year of his late Majesty's reign, shall receive, as a premium for the same, four pounds per tun, containing eight barrels, and each barrel to gauge thirty one gallons and one half, to be well hooped and filled up, on the importation thereof: Provided always, That the-importer of such tar, before he be intitled to any reward or premium for the same, shall produce to the proper officers of his Majesty's customs (who are to grant certificates upon the importation of tar) such certificate upon oath, that all the said tar was made without mixture of any other tar therewith, according

to the directions of the said act, as in the said act for that purpose is particularly mentioned and required.

And whereas there are in several parts of North Britain commonly called Scotland, great fore of pine andfir trees fit for maftsy yards and howfprights, but the lands and woods, which may yield such naval jlores, are mofily in parts mountainous and remote from, navigable rivers; therefore, for the encouragement of the proprietors of such lands and woods, in the making roads, passages and rivers in those northern parts useful and commodious to the publick, as well as for conveying such trees fit for mafis, yards and boivfprights to sea*ports in North Britain, to be brought by sea to that part of Great Britain called England: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every person or persons, or bodies corporate, that shall, from and after the twenty ninth day of September one thousand mans \; c seven hundred and twenty nine, during the time limited for the irom^cotland granhng of premiums to the importers of naval {lores from*America by Virtue of this act, bring from North Britain aforesaid, into any port of South Britain aforesaid, any trees of twelve (inches diameter and upwards, fit for mails, yards or bow-fprights, regularly converted and hewed at leafi: into eight squares, found, fresh and in good and merchantable condition, shall have and receive as a reward or premium for bringing such naval {lores from North Britain to South Britain, for such trees fit for yards, mails or bowfpights^r tun (allowing forty foot to each tun, girt-measure, according to the customary way of measuring round bodies) the sum of one pound, which said reward and premium shall likewise be paid and answered, in good and lawful money of Great Britain, by the of or principal officers of his Majesty's navy, who are hereby required and impowered to make out a bill or bills to be paid in course on certificate for the same, upon certificate of the respective chief officer or from the chief officers of the customs in any port of South Britain, where such place^fim-C h*ees fit for mails, yards or bowsprights shall be imported as portation, aforesaid; such bill or bills to be made out and given to the person or persons, or bodies corporate, importing the same as aforesaid, within 'twenty days after the discharge and unlading of the ship or vessel, ships or vessels in which such trees shall be imported, upon a certificate or certificates to be produced to the chief officer or officers of the customs where such trees shall be imported, which certificate or certificates shall be under the 2nd the comp- hands and seals of the comptroller and collector of his Majesty's p-oller, &-C*. of customs, and such naval officer as his Majesty shall think fit to where the)$ appoint, or any two of them, residing at any such port or ports tl-ees are firit m North Britain as his Majesty under the great seal of Great shipped, Britain shall think fit to appoint, where such trees shall be im-barked or shipped, in order for importing the same into any port of South Britain, that before the departure of such ship or vessel, 111ips or vessels, the persons, traders or factors concerned or employed in cutting down such trees, or any two of them, had made affidavit in writing before such comptroller and collector of his Majesty's customs in North Britain, and such naval officer

That from and after the twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and twenty, no such malfter "or maker of malt for exportation shall cause or permit any corn or grain by them making into malt, to be zuorked or made in such manner that the same shall accrejpire (that is to say) run out, grow or sprout at that end of the corn or grain from which the blade proceeds; and in case it ftoall appear upon examination that more than one part in fifteen of such corn or grain is accrespired, the entire wetting of malt, whereof such corn or grain was part, shall be deemed, taken and charged as accrefpired malt, and the malfter and maker thereof shall be charged with the full duty of six pence a bushel for every bushel of malt of that wetting, and flail also forfeit and-lose for every bushel

And whereas the said William Trench did, pursuant to the power so given him, actually ered and build a lighthouse on the said rock or island, called the Skerries, and laid out and expended in the same upwards of three thousand pounds, and also lost a ship and cargo of materials of a considerable value: (which were obliged to be fetched from distant parts) with his only son, in going to the said island to carry on the said work: and whereas the said lighthouse has been, and is of conftaqt use and benefit, not only to his Majesty's ships of war and pacquet boats, but likewise to other ships and vessels passing and crofting between Great Britain and Ireland, and to and from Ireland to Great Britain, and to ships failing through Saint George's Channel, to and from the ports south of Holyhead^ to the land's end of England, and of frequent qfe and benefit to the ports north of Leverpoob. and yvfiereas the said William Trench departed this life on or about the twenty-first day of funey in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty-five, and by Lis last will and testament did charge the said lighthouse, and the duties thereof, with all his debts^ and left a legacy of five hundred pounds to Ruth Trenchy hi^ then wife, who became the only acting executrix of the faicj will, and made Sutton Morgan clerk, master of arts, and Anne ftis wife (daughter and-only surviving child of the said William Trench) residuary legatees: and whereas the said Ruth Trenchy since the death of the said William Trench, hath, by deed dated the thirtieth day of December, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine, conveyed all her right, title, and interest of, in, and to the said legacy of five hundred pounds, and of, in^ and to the said letters patent, and the lighthouse erecfted oq the rock or island of Skerries y to the said Sutton Morgan, his heirs, and assigns, for the remainder of the term of sixty years, mentioned in the said patent, on condition that he the said Sutton Morgan shall pay and discharge, as well the creditors of the said William Trendy as also the creditors of the said Ruth Trench, whose names are mentioned and set forth in^schedule annexed to the deed of assignment made between the said Sutton Morgan and the said Ruth Trench: and whereas it fq happened, that during the life-time of the said William Trenchy as well as since the said Sutton Morgan has been in possession of the said lighthouse, that the expence of maintaining"the fgme has amounted to more than the duties annually

1730.] Anno tertio Georgii II. c. 36.

collected, which is as well owing to the want of a sufficient power to oblige mailers and owners of ships, in certain cases to pay, who have, and still do refuse to pay the same, as to several defects and omissions in the said letters patent, and particularly in not obliging foreigners to pay double duties, as are paid to other lighthouses: and whereas the said William Trench, during his life-time, supported and maintained the said light-house almost to the utter ruin of himself and family; and tire said Sutton Morgan hath, since he had possession thereof, maintained and supported the same as far as in him lay, and has borrowed and expended considerable sums of money, over and above the money arising by the duties granted by the said letters patent, but is no longer able to support the same, and the said lighthouse (though of very great use and benefit to the publick) mud inevitably fall to ruin and decay, unless the said duties are extended, and some further powers and encouragements given for the more effectual levying and collecting the same, and the said relit to the crown, and the arrears thereof be remitted, and whereas the equitable right in and to the said letters patent, and to the said lighthouse, being veiled, as aforesaid, in the said Sutton Morgan, his heirs and assigns; and whereas it is judged absolutely necessary, that the said lighthouse Should be preserved and kept up from and after the said term of sixty years, and in consideration of the great expence the said William Trench was at in erecting and building the same, it is thought just and reasonable, that the said Sutton Morgan, his heirs, and assigns, Should for ever have the keeping up and supporting of the said lighthouse, which cannot otherwise be effected but by the aid and assistance of parliament; wherefore, and to the intent that the said letters patent may be confirmed, and made more effectual, and that the said Sutton Morgan, his heirs, and assigns, may be the better enabled to maintain and keep the said lighthouse in sufficient re^ pair, and the lights therein continually burning in the night-season, and also to pay the debts of the said William Trench deceased, and the debts of the said Ruth Tre?ich> as aforesaid; to the end a work of this publick nature, so greatly beneficial to trade and navigation, may have all due and proper encouragement, may it therefore please your most excellent Majesty, at the humble requell of the said Sutton Morgan, Anne his wife,

Ruth Trench, and the creditors of the said William Trench, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That all and every the powers, liberties, privileges, authorities, and ^he duties granted in and by the said letters patent, and the said house, &c.vefl> lighthouse, and all other rights, members, and appurtenances ed in Sutton therewith occupied and enjoyed, shall be and are hereby de- Morgan> for clared to be firm, valid, and effectual to all intents and pur- ever* poses whatsoever, and the same are and shall be valid, and

[Attachment for contempt.]

shall have an attachment granted against him or them by the said court for such contempt, and the said recognizance so given, upon the allowing of such Certiorari shall not be discharged, until the costs shall be paid, and the order so confirmed shall be complied with and obeyed.

to your faithful commons the continuance of that attention which hath hitherto been Shewn to the improvement of the pubhek revenue, we have thought it our duty to apply ourselves with the utmost zeal and assiduity to carry into execution every proper measure for the attainment of that end 5 and though we have already prepared several bills for that purpose, which have received your royal approbation, we are desirous to establishfillfurther regulations, which, by a more exact and equal collection of the publick revenue, and without laying any new burthens on your people, may tend to the accomplishment of so great and salutary a design: and whereas by an act passed in the fourteenth year of the reign of his late majesty King Charles the Second (intituled,

An act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses, in his Ma-

jetty's customs) it is, amongst other things, enabled. That the person or per fens which were or Should be appointed for managing the customs, and officers of his Majesty*/ customs, and their deputies, Jfhould be thereby authorized and enabled to go and enter aboard any ship or vessel, as well ships of war as merchant ships, from thence to bring on Shore all goods prohibited or uncufemed, except jewels, if they be outwards bound; and if they be ships or vessels inwards bound, from thence to bring on Shore into his Majestfs storcbouse, all small parcels of fine goods, or other goods, which Should be found in cabins, cbefts, trunks, or other small package, or in any private or secret place in or out of the hold of the ship or vessel, vjhich might occasion a just fufpi-cion that they were intended fraudulently to be conveyed away; and all other forts of goods whatsoever, for which the duties of tonnage and poundage were not paid or compounded for within twenty days after the fir/I entry of the ship, to be put and remain in the Jlorehouse aforesaid, until his Majesty s duties thereupon be paid; unless the said person or perfens which were or Should be appointed by his Majesty for managing the customs, and officers of the customs, Should fee just (ause to allow a longer time, as in and by the said recited act more at large appears: and whereas in the cbefts, trunks, bales, casks, and other package, which contained goods j 'o sent and carried to his Majesty's Jlorehouse by the officer* of the customs in pursuance of the said act, and likewi/e in packages which are brought on Shore by virtue of a special sufferance or order from the comini fit oners or principal officers of the customs, to be examined before entry and payment of duties, at the request and application of the owners thereof; and alfe in and amongst such goods themselves, there are often found concealed and enclosed lace and other fine goods and merchandizes, which lie in little compass, and of which no entries are often intended to be made, or duties paid for, by the owners or proprietors thereof, or their agents, unless and until the same are discovered by the officers of his Majesty's customs; by which fraudulent concealments the revenue thereof is greatly defrauded: may it therefore please your Majesty, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of June, one thousand seven hundred and sixty five, all goods, wares, and merchandizes whatsoever, which shall be found ep-

closed and concealed as aforesaid, in any chest, trOnk, 'bate, calk, or other package, or in or amongst any of the goods, wares, or merchandizes contained therein, at any time after the same shall have been carried or sent to his Majesty's storehouse by any officer or officers of his Majesty's customs in pursuance pac'kaj^or of the said act, and which shall not have been, within the space goods of twenty days after the first entry of the ship in which they brought on were imported, duly entered, and his Majesty's customs, and n?olTbJrPâ¬* other duties, for them, paid or secured; or which shall he anCeUor or-found concealed as aforesaid in any chest. trunk, bale, calk, or der, and not other package, or inclosedin or amongst any of the goods there- Specified in contained, which shall be brought on shore by special suffer- therein,

ance, or order from the of or principal officers of the customs, at the request and application of the proprietor, or

Ills agent, and shall not be particularly specified and described^in such application, the same shall, in every such case, be for- forfeiture, feited and lo/i, and shall and may be feizea and prosecuted by any officer or officers of his Majesty's customs; one moiety of which forfeitures shall be to the use of his Majesty, his heirs, and successors, and the other moiety shall be to the use of such person and persons as shall seize, inform, or sue for the same, after deducting the charges of condemnation and sale from the gross produce thereof; and such seizures and forfeitures shall and may be prosecuted, tried, and determined, in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, or in the court of Exchequer at Edinburgh respectively $ wherein noessoin, protection, wager of law, or more than one imparlance, shall be allowed.

And whereas it does frequently happen, that goods and merchandizes imported, paying duty ad valorem, do, upon view and examination by the proper officers of the custcms, appear not to have been valued, by the oath or affirmation of the importer, according, to the true value and price thereof; and notwithstanding demand is made in writing by the customer or collector and comptroller of the port where such goods are entered, for delivery of the same into his Majesty's warehouse at the port of importation, for the use and benefit of the crown, agreeable to the directions of an aclof parliament made in the eleve , th year of the reign of his late majesty King George the First, (intituled, An act for rating such unrated goods and merchandizes as are ^11 ^co* usually imported into this kingdom, and pay duty ad valorem, upon the oath of the importer; and for a feet taint ng the value of all goods and merchandizes not inserted in the former or present book of rates; and f: r repealing certain duties upon drugs and rags; and for continuing the duties upon apples; and for ascertaining the method of ad-mcafuring pictures imported) yet the importers or proprietors of such goods or merchandizes do sometimes neglect or refuse to deliver the same, or tocause the same to be delivered, into his Majesty's warehouse; by which means the said recited act is rendered ineffectual to answer the purposes thereby intended; the officers of the customs not being thereby impowered to carry such goods or merchandizes to his Majesty's warehouse, although

That the laws concerning regulation of trade, customs, and such excises to which Scotland is, by Virtue of this treaty, made liable, be the same in Scotland, from and after the union, as in England; and by the seventh article of the said act of union, it is also declared and enabled. That all parts of the united kingdom be, for ever, from and after the union, liable to the same excises upon all excitable liquors; excepting only that the thirty four gallons English barrel of beer or ale, amounting to twelve gallons Scots present measure, fold in Scotland at nine shillings and six pence sterling, excluding all

duties,

duties, and retailed, including duties, at two pence the Scotch pint, or eighth part of the Scots galion, be not after the union liable, on account of the present excise upon exciseable liquors in England, to any higher imposition than two shillings sterling upon the aforesaid thirty four gallons English barrel, being twelve

fallons the present Scots measure; yet nevertheless doubts have een raised whether the brewers of that particular species of beer or ale mentioned and described in the said seventh article of the said treaty of union, and commonly called and known by the name of Two Penny Beer or Alet are within the defection and meaning of an act of parliament made and passed in the seventh and eighth years of the reign of King William the Third, intituled, An act for laying several duties upon low wines or spirits of1 '*

the first extraction; and for preventing the frauds and abuses of brewers, distillers, and other persons chargeable with the duties of excise \ and by reason of such doubts, great frauds and abuses have been, and are, daily committed and made by the brewers of such beer or ale, which is generally called Two Penny Beer or AUy by their refusing to permit or suffer the gauger or gaugers, officer or officers, to flay and continue in their brew-houses, store-houses, or other places, in the same manner as all other trewers are obliged ana accustomed to permit and suffer them, to fee such guiles or brewings brewed off, cleansed, and carried out without mixture, and by their fraudulently carrying a great part of their beer or worts away from the fight and view of such gauger or gaugers, officer or officers, before the same have been charged with any duty, and which is evidently discovered to be the practice of such brewers, from the constant great difparities which have been, and dill are, from time to time, found by the gauger or gaugers, officer or officers, on their surveys, between the cheque gauges of their beer or worts taken in the coppers, and the real gauges of the same beer or worts when cast, out of the coppers and thrown into the backs or coolers, and from whence the duty is charged, whereby his Majesty's revenue has been lessened and diminished more than one half to what the same was formerly: now, for removing and putting an end to such doubts, and for the more effectual preventing the The recited frauds aforesaid, and other frauds practised to the detriment of act of 7 8c t the revenue; be it declared and enacted by the authority afore- v^-3- 4C*. said.

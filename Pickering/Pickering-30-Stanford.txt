tarrying on of their affairs, from which it greatly imports the publick* as well as the said united company, that they should, as speedily as pof-fible, be relieyed: and whereas the said company, finding themselves under the necessity of applying to parliament for relief, did, by their petition to the houje of commons, make application far the loan of one million five hundred thousand pounds, or so much as should be Wanted to be advanced, and repaid in such manner, and to be attended with fitch other conditions and provisions as in their said petition is set forth, in consequence whereof the house of commons, came to several restations, fptcifying the terms upon which it might be expedient for the publick to advance to the said united company the fium of one million four hundred thousand pounds, and the several limitations which ought to accompany such loan: and whereas the said united company did, by a subsequent petition, declare their determination to depend on the laws of their country, and fiubmit to the temporary difficulties which may attend the present Jkuation of their affairs, rather than receive the loan offered to them upon the conditions prescribed: and whereas, in case the said company should not be forthwith affijltd by the publick with the advance of a considerable sum of money, they would remain altogether unable to provide for the payment of their debts, same of which debts being due to the publick, and others to the governor and company of the bank England, the payment thereof could not long

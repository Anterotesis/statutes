[That such act as shall be passed in Ireland to regulate the mode of summoning and returning the lords and commoners to serve in the parliament of the united kingdom, shall be considered as part of the treaty of union.]

That such Act as shall be passed in the Parliament of Ireland previous to the Union, to regulate the Mode by which the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, to serve in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on the Part of Ireland, shall be summoned and returned to the said Parliament, shall be considered as forming Part of the Treaty of Union, and shall be incorporated in the Acts of the respective Parliaments by which the said Union shall be ratified and established:

[That all questions touching the rotation or election of lords of Ireland to sit in]

650 Anno regni quadragesimo Georgii III. c. 67.

[1800.

[the united parliament shall be decided by the house of lords thereof.]

any such lords temporal, a complete election shall not be made according to the true intent of this article, the names of those peers for whom such equality of votes shall be so given, shall be written on pieces of paper of a similar form, and shall be put into a glass, by the clerk of the parliaments at the table of the house of lords, whilst the house is sitting; and the peer or peers, whose name or names shall be first drawn out by the clerk of the parliaments, shall be deemed the peer or peers elected, as the case may be:

[That any peer of Ireland may be elected to serve in the house of commons of the united kingdom, unless previously elected to sit in the house of lords, but shall not be entitled to the privilege of peerage, &c.]

That any Person holding any Peerage of Ireland now subsisting, or hereafter to be created, shall not thereby be disqualified from being elected to serve if he shall so think fit, or from serving or continuing to serve, if he shall so think fit, for any County, City, or Borough of Great Britain, in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, unless he shall have been previously elected as above, to sit in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom; but that so long as such Peer of Ireland shall so continue to be a Member of the House of Commons, he shall not be entitled to the Privilege of Peerage, nor be capable of being elected to serve as a Peer on the Part of Ireland, or of voting at any such Election; and that he shall be liable to be sued, indicted, proceeded against, and tried as a Commoner, for any Offence with which he may be charged:

[His Majesty may create peers, and make promotions in the peerage of Ireland after the union, under certain regulations.]

[If a claim be after that period made and allowed, and a new creation shall have taken place in the interval, no new right of creation shall accrue to his Majesty on the next extinction of a peerage.]

provided that nothing herein shall exclude any Person from afterwards putting in a Claim to the Peerage so deemed extinct; and if such Claim shall be allowed as valid, by Judgment of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, reported to his Majesty, such Peerage shall be considered as revived; and in case any new Creation of a Peerage of that Part of the United Kingdom called Ireland, shall have taken place in the Interval, in consequence of the supposed Extinction of such Peerage, then no new Right of Creation shall accrue to his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, in consequence of the next Extinction which shall take place of any Peerage of that Part of the United Kingdom called Ireland:

[Questions touching the election of members to sit in the house of commons of the united kingdom on the part fo Ireland shall be decided as questions touching such elections in Great Britain;]

That all Questions touching the Election of Members to sit on the Part of Ireland in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom shall be heard and decided in the same Manner as Questions touching such Elections in Great Britain now are, or at any Time hereafter shall by Law be heard and decided; subject nevertheless to such particular Regulations in respect of Ireland, as, from local Circumstances, the Parliament of the United Kingdom may from Time to Time deem expedient:

[and their qualifications in respect of property shall be the same as in England.]

That the Qualifications in respect of Property of the Members elected on the Part of Ireland to sit in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, shall be respectively the same as are now provided by Law in the Case of Elections for Counties and Cities and Boroughs respectively in that Part of Great Britain called England, unless any other Provision shall hereafter be made in that respect by Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom:

[When his Majesty shall declare his pleasure for holding a parliament of the united kingdom, a]

That when his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, shall declare his, her, or their Pleasure for holding the first or any subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, a Proclamation shall issue, under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, to cause the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, who are to serve in the Parliament thereof on the Part of Ireland, to be retuned in such

ARTICLE SEVENTH.

[The interest and the sinking fund for the reduction of the debt of either kingdom, shall continue to be defrayed separately.]

That it be the seventh Article of Union, that the Charge arising from the Payment of the Interest, and the Sinking Fund for the Reduction of the Principal, of the Debt incurred in either Kingdom before the Union, shall continue to be separately defrayed by Great Britain and Ireland respectively, except as hereinafter provided:

[The expenditure of the united kingdom to be defrayed and provided for as herein specified.]

That for the Space of twenty Years after the Union shall take place, the Contribution of Great Britain and Ireland respectively, towards the Expenditure of the United Kingdom in each Year, shall be defrayed in the Proportion of fifteen Parts for Great Britain and two Parts for Ireland; and that at the Expiration of the said twenty Years, the future Expenditure of the United Kingdom (other than the Interest and Charges of the Debt to which either Country shall be separately liable) shall be defrayed in such Proportion as the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall deem just and reasonable upon a Comparison of the real Value of the Exports and Imports of the respective Countries, upon an Average of the three Years next preceding the Period of Revision: or on a Comparison of the Value of the Quantities of the following Articles consumed within the respective Countries, on a similar Average, videlicet, Beer, Spirits, Sugar, Wine, Tea, Tobacco, and Malt; or according to the aggregate Proportion resulting from both these Considerations combined; or on a Comparison of the Amount of Income in each Country, estimated from the Produce for the same Period of a general Tax, if such shall have been imposed on the same Descriptions of Income in both Countries; and that the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall afterwards proceed in like Manner to revise and fix the said Proportions according to the same Rules, or any of them, at Periods not more distant than twenty years, nor less than seven Years from each other; unless, previous to any such Period, the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall have declared, as herein-after provided, that the Expenditure of the United Kingdom shall be defrayed indiscriminately, by equal Taxes imposed on the like Articles in both Countries. That, for the defraying the said Expenditure according to the Rules above laid down, the Revenues of Ireland shall hereafter constitute a Consolidated Fund, which shall be charged, in the first instance,

Anno regni quadragesimo Georgii III. c. 67.

[1800.

with the Interest of the Debt of Ireland, and with the Sinking Fund, applicable to the Reduction of the said Debt, and the Remainder shall be applied towards defraying the Proportion of the Expenditure of the United Kingdom, to which Ireland may be liable in each Year: That the Proportion of Contribution to which Great Britain and Ireland will be liable, shall be raised by such Taxes in each Country respectively, as the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall from Time to Time deem fit: Provided always, That in regulating the Taxes in each Country, by which their respective Proportions shall be levied, no Article in Ireland shall be made liable to any new or additional Duty, by which the whole Amount of Duty payable thereon would exceed the Amount which shall be thereafter payable in England on the like Article: That, if at the End of any Year any Surplus shall accrue from the Revenues of Ireland, after defraying the Interest, Sinking Fund, and proportional Contribution and separate Charges to which the said Country shall then be liable, Taxes shall be taken off to the Amount of such Surplus, or the Surplus shall be applied by the Parliament of the United Kingdom to local Purposes in Ireland, or to make good any Deficiency which may arise in the Revenues of Ireland in Time of Peace, or be invested, by the Commissioners of the National Debt of Ireland, in the Funds, to accumulate for the Benefit of Ireland at Compound Interest, in case of the Contribution of Ireland in Time of War; provided that the Surplus so to accumulate shall at no future Period be suffered to exceed the Sum of five Millions: That all Monies to be raised after the Union, by Loan, in Peace or War, for the Service of the United Kingdom by the Parliament thereof, shall be considered to be a joint Debt, and the Charges thereof shall be borne by the respective Countries in the Proportion of their respective Contributions; provided that, if at any Time, in raising their respective Contributions hereby fixed for each Country, the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall judge it fit to raise a greater Proportion of such respective Contributions in one Country within the Year than in the other, or to set apart a greater Proportion Sinking Fund for the Liquidation of the Whole or any Part of the Loan raised on account of the one Country than of that raised on account of the other Country, then such Part of the said Loan, for the Liquidation of which different Provisions shall have been made for the respective Countries, shall be kept distinct, and shall be borne by each separately, and only that Part of the said Loan be deemed Joint and Common, for the Reduction of which the respective Countries shall have made Provision in the Proportion of their respective Contributions: That, if at any future Day the separate Debt of each Country respectively shall have been liquidated, or, if the Values of their respective Debts (estimated according to the Amount of the Interest and Annuities attending the same, and of the Sinking Fund applicable to the Reduction thereof, and to the Period within which the whole Capital of such Debt shall appear to be redeemable by such Sinking Fund) shall be to each other in the same Proportion with the respective Contributions of each Country respectively; or if the Amount by which the Value of the

1800.] Anno regni quadragesimo Georgii III. c. 67. 671

larger of such Debts shall vary from such Proportion, shall not exceed one hundredth Part of the said Value; and if it shall appear to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, that the respective Circumstances of the two Countries will thenceforth admit of their contributing indiscriminately, by equal Taxes imposed on the same Articles in each, to the future Expenditure of the United Kingdom, it shall be competent to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to declare, that all future Expence thenceforth to be incurred, together with the Interest and Charges of all joint Debts contracted previous to such Declaration, shall be to defrayed indiscriminately by equal Taxes imposed on the same Articles in each Country, and thenceforth from Time to Time, as Circumstances may require, to impose and apply such Taxes accordingly, subject only to such particular Exemptions or Abatements in Ireland, and in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, as Circumstances may appear from Time to Time to demand: That, from the Period of such Declaration, it shall no longer be necessary to regulate the Contribution of the two Countries towards the future Expenditure of the United Kingdom, according to any specifick Proportion, or according to any of the Rules herein-before prescribed: Provided nevertheless, that the Interest or Charges which may remain on account of any Part of the separate Debt with which either Country shall be chargeable, and which shall not be liquidated or consolidated proportionably as above, shall, until extinguished, continue to be defrayed by separate Taxes in each Country: That a Sum, not less than the Sum which has been granted by the Parliament of Ireland on the Average of six Years immediately preceding the first Day of January in the Year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred, in Premiums for the internal Encouragement of Agriculture or Manufactures, or for the maintaining Institutions for pious and charitable Purposes, shall be applied, for the Period of twenty Years after the Union, to such local Purposes in Ireland, in such Manner as the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall direct: That, from and after the first Day of January one thousand eight hundred and one, all Publick Revenue arising to the United Kingdom from the territorial Dependencies thereof, and applied to the General Expenditure of the United Kingdom, shall be so applied in the Proportions of the respective Contributions of the two Countries:

modious llrcet or passage at Snow Hill, and for raising, on the credit r

of the Orphans Fund, a sum of money for those purposes; and for S

explaining and amending the said acts.- — [May 30, 1800.] i

J

Acts 35 Geo. 3* c. 126. 38 Geo. 3. c. 61, recited. Whereas considerabk j

progrets hath been made in carrying the said acts into execution, whereby t

the entrance into the said city at Temple Bar, hath been greatly improved: 1

and whereas in forming the original ertimateof the expences ofeffofting h j

the said improvements, sufficient allowances were not made for the fob* ( t

sequent depreciation of the bonds and securities which by the first redted j;

aft were directed to be given, for securing the monies thereby authorised J t

to be borrowed; nor were adequate allowances made for the sums paid 1

and to be paid in several unforeseen cases, as compensationg for good will, Losses and damages, to persons occupying or being interested ia houses and other hereditaments, by the said acts authorised to be purchased; and in the said estimate credit was taken for the monies to be received by falcof the ground rents, and the reversion, freehold, and inheritance of so many houses, or such parcel of the buildings, hods, i

tenements, and hereditaments, by the said acts authorised to be purchased,

and taken out of the streets, as should not be afterwards laid into the -

streets or otherwise appropriated to publick use; but it being found ape. 1

disjnt that the said improvements to be made at Temple Bar and Snow Hill aforesaid, ihoultl be carried on at both places at one and the kmc time, the lad mentioned monies, which will amount to a very consider* able sum, cannot be obtained by such sale, until all the purchases yet remaining to be made pursuant to the said acts shall be actually made; for' which reasons the fund created by the first herein-before redted aft, is found to be insufficient for completing the said improvements: and whereas, if the land tax charged upon the houses, buildings, hnds, tene. ments, and hereditaments, purchased and to be purchased for the kid j

improvements, were redeemed according to the statutes lately made and j

provided concerning the redemption and purchase of the land tax, such

redemption would be highly beneficial not only to the estate so intended,

to be sold as aforesaid, but ultimately to the funds provided and to be,

provided for carrying on the said improvements: and whereas the fund called The Orphan's Fund, was eftaoliflied by an act passed in the fifth and sixth years of the reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled,

An act for relief of the Orphans, and other creditors of the city of London, for the purposes therein expressed; which laid fund, and the

Common council empowered to raise thirty thousand and sixty thousand pounds upon the credit of the Orphans' Fund, of the monies to arise by sale of ground, rents, &c. Contributors to be entitled to redeemable annuities. Common council to cause bonds, or other securities, to be given for such annuities, assignable by indorsement.

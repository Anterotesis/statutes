This folder contains the OCR'd text of all 46 volumes  the Danby Pickering edition of the Statutes At Large, covering the period from Magna Charta to 1806.

They have been OCR'd using Abbyy FineReader version 12.1.5.

The raw output has been partially corrected.

But be warned: The OCR is still, at this stage, poor!

These texts are all over 200 years old, and as such are clearly in the public domain.

Preamble.

31 Geo. 3* c. 45.

37 Geo. 4. c. 94.

38 Geo, 3 c. 89.

WHEREAS by an act, ?nade in the thirty-first year of his present Majesty's reign, for the encouragement of the pilchard fifth cry, an additional bounty of one ftjrilling and sixpence was allowed for every caftk or vessel of pilchards, containing fifty galions, which fthould be exported between the twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and ninety-one, and the twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight; which bounty was further continued by an other act, of the thirty seventh year of his present Majesty's reign, for the further term ofseven years, from the said twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred. and ninety-eight: and whereas in the act made in the thirty-eighth year of his present Majesty's reign, for transferring the management of the salt duties to the commiftfioners of excise, and for repealing the duties on salt, and the drawbacks, allovoances, and bounties, paid thereout, and for granting other duties, drawbacks, allowances, and bounties thereon, provifon was not ?nade for the said bounty of one ftbilling and sixpence \ and it is expedient to grant such additional bounty as is herein-after ?nentioned: may it therefore pieafe your Majesty that it may be enabled; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament For every calk assembled, and by the authority of the same, That for every containing o ca3^ or ve^ pilchards, containing fifty galions, which has galions, ex- been duly exported from Great Britain to parts beyond the seas, ported from since the tenth day of October one thousand seven hundred and Great Britain, ninety-eight, or which shall hereafter be so exported, until and born October UpQn t^e twenty-fourth day of June one thousand eight hundred June 24, 1805, an(l and for 2nd in respect whereof the person or persons and entitled 1 exporting

exporting the same shall be entitled to the bounty of seven (hil- to the bounty lings, under or by virtue of the said act of the thirty-eighth year 7s- anad* of his present Majesty's reign, an additional bounty of one (hil- bounty of ling and sixpence shall be paid and payable to such person and I8. 6d. persons so entitled to the said bounty of seven shillings, at such times, in such manner, by such person and persons, and out of such monies, as the said bounty of seven shillings is by the said last-mentioned act directed to be paid.

II. And whereas it may sometimes he convenient that pilchards should be shipped and exported dir eft ly to the British West India islands and the Mediterranean in casks of thirty-two galions; and it is expedient to allow a bounty in due proportion. to the present bounties, on such pilchards so exported, for all such pilchards so flipped and exported;

be it therefore enacted, That for all pilchards which shall be P°r pilchards duly shipped and exported directly to any of the British West the

India istands, or to any port or place in the Mediterranean, in British West casks of thirty-two gallons or upwards, there shall be allowed a Indies, or the bounty in due proportion to the several bounties now payable, Mediterrane-and which by this act may become payable, for or in respect of 2^1 ions

pilchards exported from Great Britain, in casks containing fifty 0r upwards, a gallons; any thing in this or any other act or acts of parliament bounty to be to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding: provided always, paid in pro-That no such bounty shall be paid or allowed, unless all and fhofe°export* singular the rules, regulations, restrictions, and provisions, by ecj jn casks any former law established, for or in respect of fish-exported in containing 50 order to obtain the bounty, shall have been fully complied with, galions;

III. And whereas it has been a practice to export pilchards, in some inflames, in casks commonly called Pilchard Hogsheads, containing less than fifty galions; and it might be inconvenient^ in such cases, to withhold the bounty in proportion to the quantity of fish which has been exported, or which may be exported before the first day of June

one .thousand eight hundred; be it therefore enacted, That for all as also for ah pilchards which, since the said tenth day of October one thousand PQ^t^j*^e5ii seven hundred and ninety-eight, have been duly exported from chard hogi- " Great Britain to parts beyond the seas, in calks commonly called heads, from Pilchard Hogsheads, or which, at any time on or before the first: October 10, day of June one thousand eight hundred, shall be so exported in ^une

such casks, a bounty shall be allowed in proportion to the*several bounties now payable, or which by this act may become payable, for or in respect of pilchards exported from Great Britain, in casks containing fifty galions; any thing in this act or any other act or acts of parliament to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.

IV. And whereas it has been the practice to allow pilchards and \ other fish to be exported upon bounty from ports and places not being lawful quays, and it is expedient to continue such practice, be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to and for The commit-the of of excise, or the major part of them, to allow ^emiyallow pilchards and other fish to be exported, for the purpose of ob- fish to be ex- tabling the bounty, from such convenient port or place as they ported from

therein directed, to cause fair and true UJis to be made out in writing of all the men vfually and at that time dwelling within their respective parishes and places, between the ages of nineteen and twenty-three inclusive; from which lifts, amended and returned as by the aforesaid act directed, the fevered regiments of militia now serving Scotland have fuice been ballotted and embodied: and whereas the original lifts are in several places exhaujled, and in others reduced to so ftnail a number as to bear hard upon such parishes and places\ and it is expedient and jujl that such perj'ons as have fmee attained their nineteenth year should have their names included in the lifts of persons liable to serve in the militia; and it has been found from experience that the aforesaid period is too limited; may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parlia- I-tis Majesty's ment assembled, and by the authority of the same, That his Ma-lieutenant, jesty's lieutenant for each county, stewartry, city, or place, toge-with tjoor ther with any two or more deputy lieutenants, and on the death lieutenants/ or removal, or in the absence of his Majesty's lieutenant, the &c. to meet deputy lieutenants, or any three or more of them, shall, on the on Aug. 1, ^first day of August one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine, r^Hibto^e meet at t^le same borough or principal town of the county, stew-made out of artry, or place, where they hitherto have usually-met for the pur-men from 19 poles of the militia and shall in like manner and form, as to 30 years of directed by the aforesaid axft, proceed to issue directions for mak-

nam^rfo^be^ OUt ^air anc* truen wr^n§ of ah the men usually and putintoabox at*that time dwelling within their respective parffhes and places, in which the from and after the age of nineteen years complete, and not exceeding the age of thirty years complete, and such lifts, being afterwards amended as the case may require, and in the same mode and under the/ame regulations as is by the aforesaid act prescribed, the said lieutenant, or, failing of him, any three or more deputy lieutenants, together, with any one or more justices of the'peace lawfully assembled in a general meeting to be held for that purpose, shall declare the said lift so made up and amended to be the lift of persons liable to serve in the militia, and shall cause the names of all the militia men in each parish, written or printed on dif-tinest pieces of paper, being all as near as may be of equal ftze, and rolled up in the same manner, to be put into the box or other vessel, in which the names of all persons at present liable to serve in the militia have been included, there to remain until a fresh ballot shall take place in such parish or place, as prescribed and directed by the aforesaid act.

II. And whereas it may sometimes happen, that persons alledged to be liable, in pursuance of this present act, to serve in the militia, but entitled, on account of age or other special ground of exemption, to have their names Jlruck out of the militia lift, may, from ignorance or excusable neglect, fail 10 come forward in due time to fate the same to' the subdivision meeting appointed for amending and making up such lifts, and thereby become liable to serve in the militia, provide a sub-ignoranc^not J^liute-> or pay the penalty, be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for claiming ex- such persons failing or neglecting as aforesaid, within three calendar

III. And whereas it has been found from experience, that the penalty of ten pounds ferling, directed to be paid by persons ballotted, but refusing to serve, or to find fubfilutes in their room, has proved insufficient to enable the deputy lieutenants to provide substitutes for them, and doubts have arisen in that case as to the mode of applying and accounting for the said penalties', be it therefore enacted, That the The general said lieutenant, deputy lieutenants, and justices, assembled in a the^r general meeting held in pursuance of this or any other ad or clerk to make acts now in force respecting the militia, shall order the clerk of up an account the said meeting to make up an account of all the penalties in- °* curred within the said county, stewartry, city, or place, and shall ^ou^eto b<f direct the amount of the same to be forthwith, and as quickly applied in as possible, applied in providing (so far as it will go), substitutes providing to serve in the militia; and where the total amount of such substitutes $ penalties shall be found inadequate to the purpose of providing the full number of substitutes required, it shall be lawful for the provide the said general meeting, and they are hereby authorised and em- the whole, powered to allot the said substitutes so provided to the several they shall allot deficient parishes from which the aforesaid penalties arise, as far ed^n^dhed as possible, and that either by ballotting which of the said parishes a ballot by shall be relieved by the allotment of the said substitutes, or in the parishes such other mode as shall appear to the said general meeting just they shall de-and equitable, and best calculated for laying the burthen of pro- clare hab.le

[Masters of Vessels shall forfeit 30l. for every Slave exceeding the Proportion of one Slave for every eight square Feet of the Lower Deck.]

VII. And be it further enacted, That it shall not be lawful for any Master or other Person taking or having the Charge or Command of any such Ship or Vessel, to take or have on board at any one Time, or to convey, carry, bring, or transport Slaves from the Coast of Africa to any Part beyond the Sea, in any such Ship or Vessel, in any greater Number than in the Proportion of one such Slave for every eight Square Feet of the Superficial Contents of the Lower Deck of such Ship or Vessel, ascertained as herein-before directed; and if any such Master or other Person taking or having the Charge or Command of any such Ship or Vessel, shall act contrary hereto, such Master or other Person as aforesaid shall forfeit and pay the Sum of thirty Pounds of lawful Money of Great Britain, for each and every such Slave exceeding in Number the Proportions herein-before limited, one Moiety whereof shall go to his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, and the other Moiety thereof shall go to any person or persons who shall first sue for the same.

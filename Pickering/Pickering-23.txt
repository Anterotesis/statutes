among all other things great inconueniences daily doe increase by deflation and pulling downe, and wilfull waste of houses and townes within this Realme, and laying to pasture lands, which customably haue beene vied in tillage, whereby idlcnefle, which is the ground and beginning of all mischiefes, daily doth encrease. For where in some townes two hundred persons were occupied and hued by their lawfull labours, now there are occupied two or three heardmen, and the residue fall into idelnesse, the husbandrie which is one of the greatest commodities of this Realme is greatly decayed. Churches destroyed, the service of God withdrawen, the bodies there buried not prayed for, the Patrons and Curates wronged, the defence of this land against our enemies outward, feebled and impaired, to the great displeasure of God, to the fubveriion of the pollicie and good rule of this land, if remedie be not provided: Wherefore the King our Soueraigne Lord by the aduice of the Lords - spirituall and temporall, and the Commons in this said Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, hath oretained, enacted and stablished, that no person, of what estate degree or condition that he be, that hath any house or houses, that at any time within three yeers passed, hath beene or that now is, or that hereafter shall be lette for ferme with xx, acres of land at least, or more, lying in tillage and Husbandrie, that the owner and owners of euery such house of houses and land, doe keepe sustaine and maintainehouses and buildings upon theTaid ground, and land conuenient and necefiarie for maintaining and vphold- Tillage* ing of the saide tillage and Husbandrie. And if any such owner or owners of any such house or houses and land, take land and occupie any such house or houses, and keepe in his or their own hands, that the said owner or owners by the said authorise be bound in like wife to keepe and maintaine houses and buildings upon the (aide ground and land convenient and neceiTarie for the maintaining and vpholding of the saide tillage and Husbandrie.

And if any man doe contrary to the premises or any of them, that then it be lawfull to the King, if any such lands or houses be holden of him immediately, or to the Lords of the Fees, if any such lands be holden of them immediately, to receive yeerely halfe the value of the issues and profitsof any such lands, whereof the house or houses be not so maintained and sustained.

And the same halfe dealp of the issues and profits to have, holde and keepe to his or their owne vfe, without any thin& therefore to be payed or given, till such time as the same house or houses bee sufficiently builded or repaired againe. And that no manner of freehold be in the King, nor in any such Lord or Lords, by the taking of any such profits, of or in any such lands in no manner of forme: but onely the King and the said Lord or Lords, haue power to take, receive, and haue the said issues and profits, as is aboue saide, and therefore the King or the said Lord or Lords to haue power to distraine for the same issues and profits to be had and perceiued by them, in forme aboue fayde, by authorise of this present A&e.

people, his louing fubiedts of the tome: and being in a lull

hope and trust, that a full and perfect resolution of the said Articles, Should make a perfect concord and vnitie generally 4 amongst all his louing and obedient fubiedts, of his most ex-

cellent goodneffe not onely commanded, that the told Articles 4 Should deliberately, and aduifedly, by his said Archbishops,

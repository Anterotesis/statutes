into consumption, to the great detriment of the revenue, and the injury of the fair trader, and it is difficult to prove the same to be feraps and parings, by reason that the officers ore not authorised by law to ftize the same, so as the same may be produced on the trial, and be proved to be feraps and parings; and it is equally detrimental to the revenue by whatever means such feraps and parings get out into consumption: remedy whereof, be it enacted by the an

WHEREAS the frames for making of framework-knitted pieces, stockings, and other articles and goods in the hosiery or framework knitted manufactory, are very valuable and expensive machines, and generally the property of the hosier or manufacturer, who lets the same to hire to his workmen or framework-knitters; and it hath frequently happened that the hosier or manufacturer, being the owner or employer of such frame or frames, and having so put and let the same out to hire, and wanting, for the accommodation of his trade and business, to take and remove such frame or frames from the use and possession of one workman into the hands and custody of another, and having for such purpose given the customary and usual notice to the workman in whose hands or custody such frame was, so to deliver up the same, such workman hath wilfully detained and withheld the same, and sometimes absolutely and unlawfully sold and disposed thereof, to the great grievance, inconvenience, and loss of such hosier or manufacturer: And whereas it hath frequently happened, when discontents have arisen amongst the framework-knitters, that they and other disorderly persons have assembled in a riotous and tumultuous manner, and have destroyed or materially damaged great numbers of stocking frames, and the machines or engines thereto annexed or used therewith, and committed great violences and outrages upon many of his Majesty's good subjects; wherefore it is necessary that more effectual provision should be made against such unlawful practices, and for preventing such violences and outrages for the future, and for bringing all offenders in the premises to more speedy and exemplary justice: May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Persons so hiring frames, and selling them, to be imprisoned not less than three, nor more than twelve months;]

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any one person so renting or taking to hire any stocking frame, with or without any such machine or engine as aforesaid, shall at any time, from and after the passing of this Act, sell or otherwise unlawfully dispose of any such stocking frame, or the machine or engine therewith let (if any such there shall be), without the consent of the owner or owners thereof, every such offender, being thereof lawfully convicted upon any indictment to be found against him, shall suffer solitary imprisonment in the common gaol or house of correction of the county, riding, division, city, liberty, town, or place wherein such offence shall have been committed, without bail or mainprize, for a space not less than three calendar months, nor exceeding twelve calendar months.

[and persons purchasing them liable to the same punishment.]

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall wilfully and knowingly receive or purchase any such stocking frame, machine, or engine, so sold or unlawfully disposed of as aforesaid, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this Act, and shall thereof be lawfully convicted on any indictment to be found against him or them, every such offender or offenders shall be subject to such and the like punishment as by this Act is inflicted, or provided to be inflicted, on such person so selling or unlawfully disposing of any such stocking frame, machine, or engine as aforesaid.

[Persons entering shops, &c. with an intent to destroy, or destroying any framework-knitted pieces, to be guilty of felony.]

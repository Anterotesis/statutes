[Preamble.]

WHEREAS the laws now in fora, for the and train-

ing the militia, within that part of Great Britain Eng-Jand, are in some respects defective: and whereas frequent delays,

and many difficulties have occured in the execution of the acts now in forte for raising and training the militia, from the manner in which the whale execution of the acts is made to depend in all counties, ridings, and places, where the militia has been or shall be raised, upon holding a general meeting, on either the loft Tuesday Oaober, or the lass

Tuesday in May, in each year-, and doubts have arisen, whether, in such tale, any subsequent general meetings can now be called for the purposes of the said acts, unless there shall have been a previous ge- neral meeting on one of the days before may it therefore

And whereas the provisions in the said act passed in the not exceeding fecpod year of the reign of his present Majesty, for reimbursing 3 months# officers of parishes the monies by them expended for the relief of militia men, who on their march, or at the place where they shall be called out to annual exercise, shall, by sickness or other-wifig^ want such relief, have been found insufficient for the purposes thereby intended; be it therefore enacted, That in case A militia man any man serving in the militia shall, on the march, or at the on the march, nlace where he shall be called out to annual exercise, be disabled ofexeixiie, di£ by ficluiefs or otherwise, it shall and may be lawful for any one abled by lick* justice of the peace of the county, riding, or place, or any mayor nefs, or other-or chief roagistrate of any city, town, or place, where such 7 be.ro* man shall then be, by warrant under his hand and seal, to order o^cer8 of the him such relief as he shall think reasonable; and the officers of parithwherebe $he parish, tything, or place, where such militia man shall be so shall then be, relieyed, shall, upon producing an account of the expences P31*1^ of-occasioned thereby, allowed under the hand of a justice of the f^urftd the* peace, to the treasurer of the county, riding, or place, for which expences oc-( such militia man shall serve, shall be reimbursed such expences cafionedther^-by the treasurer of such county, out of the county (lock, and by, out of the (peb treasurer shall, upon producing such account allowed as a- uMn^r^uc-Fpresaid, be allowed the same in his accounts.^accounts"

VII. And whereas it would be very conducive to the preservi-tien of order and discipline, during the time of annual exercise, of great convenience to the corporals and private militia men in the fopplying them with necessaries, and of essential utility to their respective families, if the captains or commanding officers were enabled to flop a limited part of the daily pay of such corporals and private men when called out to annual exercise; be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for every A captain or captain or commanding officer of the militia, to put the cor- o^mayput

WHEREAS the efablijbint a manufacture of linens in England, of the kind ufally known under' the denomination of cambricks and French lawns* will be of great utility to this kingdom4 as well by the employment of a great number of poor* as by preventring the illegal importation of foreign cambricks and Freneh7tf«/w: and whereas a manufactury of cambricks and lawns hath been already set up at Winchelsea in the county of Sussex, and large quantities of such goods have been made there* and may be made in other tarts of this kingdom* equal* if not superior* in quality to those made in foreign parts; and many persons are defrous of subscribing large sums towards the support and extenfon of the said manufactury (for the effectual carrying on of which a large fund will be necessary) but are apprehenfwe that difficulties may arise* as well in rtcovenng debts which may grow due to the proprietors of the said manufactury* as in defending suits or actions which may be brought or commenced a* gainjl them for any matter or thing relative thereto* as* by law* all the several proprietors or subscribers to the said manufactury must, in such cafis both sue and be sued* implead and be impleaded* by their feviral and difinct names and descriptions; and therefore^ for the mfbe easily carrying on the manufacture* and avoiding the difficulties aforesaid* are deftrous of being incorporated and having a common seal and name by which they may sue and be sued; and many persons are defrous of subscribing large sums thereto* but are deterred from so doing, left they may thereby become liable* in case the said manufactury Should not be successful, to pay large sums of money over and above the sums by them subscribed* to make good the debts to be incurred therefrom\ and many persons who are not now liable to become bankrupts,

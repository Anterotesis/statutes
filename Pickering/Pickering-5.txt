A bill that persons, being no common surgeons, may minister medicines, notwithstanding the statute.

WHERE in the parliament holden at Westminster in the third year of the King's most gracious reign, amongst other things, for the avoiding of sorceries, witchcrafts, and other inconvenienciesy it was enabled, That no person within the city of London, nor with-in seven miles of the fame/should take upon him to exercise and occupy as pbyftcian or surgeon, except he be first examined*\ approved*, and admitted by the bishop ^London and other, under and upon certain pains and penalties in the same act mentioned: (2) fithence the making Abusei of of which said act, the company and fellowship of surgeons ^London, minding only their own lucres, ana nothing the prefit or ease of the jL the Vurgc-diseased or patient, have fuedy troubled, and vexed divers honest per- onsofLonaoxu fonsy as well men as womeny whom God hath endued with the knowledge of the naturey kind, and operation of certain herbsy roots and watersy and the using and ministering of them to such as been pained with euftomable aifeafesy as womens breasts being fore9 a pin and the web in the eye, uncomes of hands, burnings, failings, Jore mouths % the ft one, Jlrangury, faucelim and morphewy and such other like dif-eases; and yet the said persons have not taken any thing for their pains or cunning, but have minxftred the same to poor people only for neighbourhood and Gods fake, and of pity and charity. (3) And it is now well known, that the surgeons admitted will do no cure to any persony but where they shall know to be rewarded with a greater sum or reward than the cure extendeth unto: for in case they would minister their cunning unto fore people unrewarded, there should not so many rot and pertjfb to death for lack or help of surgery, as daily do; but the greatest part of surgeons admitted been much more to be blamed, than those persons that they trouble.

II. For although the most part of the persons of the said craft of surgeons have small cunningy yet they will take great sums of money, and do little therefore, and by reason thereof they do oftentimes impair and hurt their patientsy rather than do them good; (2) in considera-6 tion

truthy and continuance of the commodity in estimation, according to the of" worthiness thereof, (3) have and do daily, instead of truth, praciife^woollen fedfhood, and instead of substantial making of cloth, do praflife sleight clothes. and flender making, some by mingling of yarns of divers fpmnings in S€v^1 ?bn'CJ one doth, (4) some by mingling fell-wool and lambs-wod, or either making of* of themy with fleece-woolly (f) some by putting too little fluff, (6) cloth. some by taking them out of the mill before they be full thieked, (7) some by over-stretching them upon the tenter, and then flopping with flocks such bracks as shall be made by means thereof; (0) finally, by using so many subtle fleights and untruths, as when the clothes so made be put in the water to try them, they rife out of the same neither in length nor breadth as they ought to do, and in some place narrower than some, (9) beside such cockeling, bandoning, and divers other I great and notable faults, as almost cannot be thought to be true;

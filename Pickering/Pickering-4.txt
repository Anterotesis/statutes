And for because the said Richard is a tinner, for the causes and matters afore rehear fed, one John Furfe, tinner, under-steward of the Jleimerie in the said county, in and at four courts of the said Jln-merit at divers places and times before him severally holden in the said

county,

aunty, he and other have condemned the feud Richard in the sum of me hundred and threescore pounds: that is to wit, at every court day forty pounds, and by the procurement of the said John Furfe, at the said four several courts and lawdays, itithe said Jleimerie by him holden, in this manner published and said, that the same Richard, at the loft parliament holden at Westminster, would have avoided and utterly defrayed all liberties, privileges, andftanchises concerning the Jleimerie: by reason whereof the yJwJRiehard, upon four bills had and made thereof by the said John Furfe and other, caused that the said Richard was presented and found guilty of the premises in every of the said courts in forty pounds to be loft and forfeit by him, by reason of an act end ordinance by tinners made and had at a place in the said county called Crokerentor: the tenor of the which act appeareth in a schedule to his bill annexed: to which the said Richard was never warned nor called to make answer to the premisses, contrary to all laws, right reason, and good conference. And for the execution of the same, one John Agwiiliam, upon a surmise by him made to the King's Highness to the said condemnation to be to his grace forfeit, thereof attained a bill assigned of twenty pounds parcel of the said hundred and threescore pounds, to be to him granted by the said King's Highness: whereupon the said John Agwiiliam and other caused the said Richard to be taken and imprisoned in a dungeon and a deep pit under the ground in the castle of Lidford, in the said county, and there and elsewhere remained ay the Jpace of three weeks and more, unto such time be was delivered by a writ of privilege out of the King's Exchequer at Westminster, for that he was one of the collectors in the said county for the first of the two Quindeims granted at and in this present parliament: the which prison is one of the mqft hamous, contagious, and detestable places within this realm; so that by reason of the same imprisonment he was put in great peril and jeopardy of his life, and the said Richard, so being in prison, and the said John Agwiiliam seeing the same cruel imprisonment of the said Richard, intreated and injlantly desired one Philip Furfe (then being keeper of the feud pri-Jon) strictly to keep the said Richard in prison, and to put irons upon him to his more greater pain and jeopardy, and to give him but bread and water only, to the intent to cause the said Richard to be fain to content and pay him the said twenty pounds. And for the same prormfei the feud keeper four marks of money: for the which four marks the said Richard for to be eased of his irons and painful imprisonment aforesaid (for Safeguard of his life) promised and granted to pay the said keeper four marks: whereof he paid toe said keeper in hand thirteen Shillingsfour pence. And over that the said Richard for to be eased of his said painful imprisonment, was cufo of necessty driven to be bounden /^Thomas Denis, deputy unto Sir Henry Mamie, knight, warden of the said ftemerie, in an obligation of the sum of an C.li. upon condition whereof part is as hereafter followeth: that is to say, That if the above bound Richard Strode, defend and save harmless the said Thomas Denis, and to ufehimself as true prisoner during the time it shall please the King to have him prisoner in the castle ^Lidford, and also to do nothing, whereby he shall in the law be deemed out. of prison, and other articles comprised in the said condition, the which the said Richard perfectly remembereth not: wherefore the premisses by

service and attendance that they daily and nightly, at all hours and times, give to the King's liege people, for the relief of the same, according to their science, have been exempt and discharged from all offices and business. wherein they should use or bear any manner of armour or weapon, and with like privilege have been intreated as heralds of arms, as well in battles and fields, as other places, there for to stand unharnessed and unweaponed, according to the law of arms, because they be persons that never used feats of war, nor ought to use, but only the business and exercise of their science, to the help and comfort of the King's liege people in the time of their need:

(2) And in the aforesaid city of London, from the time of their first incorporation, when they have been many more in number than they be now, were never called nor charged to be on quest, watch, nor other office, whereby they should use or occupy any armour, or defensible geer of war, where through they should be unready, and letted to practise their cure of men being in peril:

For the dejlruRion of crows and rooks.

FORASMUCH j; innumerable number of rooks, crows and choughs do daily breed, and increase throughout this realm, which rooks, crows and choughs, do yearly devour and consume a wonderful and marvellous great quantity of corn and grain of all kinds, that is to wit, as well in the jowing of the same corn and grain, as also at the ripening and kcrnelling of the same, and over that a marvellous ief-truliion, and decay of the covertures of thatched houses, bams, reeks, flacks and other such like: (2) so that if the said crows, rooks and choughs should be suffered to breed and continue % as they have been in certain years past, they will undoubtedly be the cause of the great dcjlruftion and consumption of a great part of the corn ana grain which hereafter shall be sown throughout this realm, to the great prejudice, damage and undoing of the great number of all the tiliers, husbands and J'owers of the earth within the same.

II. For remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority of this present parliament, That every person and persons, as well spiritual as temporal, having, keeping, holding and inhabiting in any manors, meases, lands or tenements in their own manurance and occupation of any estate of inheritance, or for term of life, or foryears, or at will, or by copy of court-roll, or otherwise in poflemon or use, shall hereafter do, or cause to be done, as much as in him or them reasonably shall or may be, to kill and utterly destroy all manner of choughs, crows, rooks, coming, abiding, breeding or haunting within or upon any the said manors, meases, lands or tenements which he or they shall inhabit and dwell upon, and have in their manurance and occupation, as is aforesaid, (2) upon pain of a grievous amerciament, to be let and assessed as hereafter shall be expressed: that is to say, that if any offence be done contrary to the statute, by any person or persons inhabited within the limits of the leets, lawdays, rapes or court barons of any lords having such courts, that then upon a presentment thereof made before the Reward of such leets, lawdays, rapes or courts, the Rewards with two of the presenters, (by the Reward and presenters to be named) shall auefs and set for every default presented to be done contrary to this act, such amerciament as to them shall seem reasonable and convenient, after the quantity of the offence, (3) the said amerciament to be to the use of the lord, or lords of the leets, law-days, rapes or courts where the said offence shall be done and presented, to be levied by distress of the goods and chattels of the offender or offenders, like as other amerciaments for common annoyances (presented in leets) have been accustomed to be levied.

(4) And if the offence be done contrary to this statute by any person or persons, which shall dwell and have the manurance of and in such manors, meases, lands, tenements or hereditaments, whereunto such leets, lawdays, rapes and courts do not belong, or by reason whereof any such courts be not holden:

The bill for the increase of horses.

THE King our sovereign lord continually studying for the advancement, augmentation and increase of the public weal of this his realm, calling to his most gracious memory the great decay of the generation and breeding of good, and swift and strong horses, which heretofore have been bred in this realm, to the great defence, profit and common commodity of the same; and now remembering that like breed of horses is sore diminished and decayed, the occasion whereof is thought to proceed,

[The cause of the decay of the breed of horses.]

for that in many and most places of this realm, commonly little horses and nags of small stature and value be suffered to depasture, and also to cover mares and fillies of very small stature, by reason whereof the breed of good and strong horses of this realm is now lately diminished, altered and decayed, and farther is like to decay, if speedy remedy be not sooner provided in that behalf.

II. The King's highness willing therefore to provide remedy on that behalf, by the advice of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, hath ordained, enacted and established,

[Owners and farmers of parks shall be charged to keep mares.]

That every person and persons, as well spiritual as temporal, of what estate, degree or condition soever he or they be, which at this present time, or at any time hereafter, shall have any park or ground inclosed with hedge, ditch, wall or pale, wherein any deer is, or hereafter shall be, usually kept for game, containing the quantity of one mile in compass, and is or shall be seised thereof in fee-simple, fee-tail, or for term of life, in possession, to his or their own profit and behoof, that every such owner of every such park and ground being in his own hand, and every fermer of every such park or ground being let to ferm, from the first day of May, that shall be in the year of our Lord God 1537, shall keep for every such park or ground being inclosed as is aforesaid, as long as the same park or ground inclosed shall be used, and kept with deer in the same for games, two mares being not spayed, apt and able to bear foals, each of them of the altitude or height of thirteen handfuls at the least, to be measured from the lowest part of the hoof of the foot unto the highest part of the shoulder, and every handful to contain four inches of the standard, upon pain of forfeiture of xl. s. for every month's lacking the same mares contrary to this act; (2) and that every such owner or fermer of park or ground, whereof the compass is four miles and above, upon pain afore expressed, shall keep for every such park four mares being not spayed, apt and able to bear foals, of the altitude or height of thirteen handfuls at the least, to be measured as is aforesaid.

III. Provided, That if it shall happen any of the said mares by mischance or casualty for to die, that then the lord, owner or owners of the said mares, providing or buying others of like height and altitude as is before limited, within three months next

354 Anno vicesimo septimo Henrici VIII. [1535.

after the death of the same mares, shall not incur the danger and penalty of this estatute; any thing before rehearsed to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Mares shall not be covered with small horses.]

IV. And it is also enacted by authority aforesaid, That the lords, owners and farmers of all parks and grounds inclosed as is above rehearsed, limited and appointed by this act to keep mares, shall not at any time after the said first day of May, which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1537. willingly suffer any of the said mares to be covered or leapt with any stoned horse under the stature of fourteen handful, to be measured in form afore rehearsed, (2) upon pain of forfeiture of xl. s. The moiety of all such forfeitures shall be to the King our sovereign Lord, and the other moiety thereof to the party that will sue for the same in any court of our said sovereign lord the King, by action, bill, plaint, information, or otherwise; in which action or suit the defendant shall not be admitted to wage his law, or any protection or essoin shall be unto the defendant allowed in that behalf.

[To what counties this statute extendeth not.]

V. Provided alway, That this act extend not to charge the lord, owner or owners of any park or ground inclosed within the counties of Westmoreland, Cumberland, Northumberland and the bishoprick of Durham, nor any of them, to keep any mares for any park or parks, ground or grounds inclosed as is aforesaid, lying in the said counties of Westmoreland, Cumberland, Northumberland and the bishoprick of Durham, otherwise than they have or might have done before the making of this act; (2) nor also shall extend to charge the lords, owner or owners of any park or parks, or grounds inclosed, with the finding of any mares, the herbage of which park or parks is common to the tenants and inhabitants of the townships next adjoining to the same park or parks; any thing in this present act made to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.

[Spiritual persons may sell the increase of their mares.]

VI. Provided also, That every spiritual person and persons, charged and chargeable by this act with the finding of mares, may lawfully bargain and sell the increase and breed of their said mares; any act or acts heretofore made to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

And forasmuch as it standethat this present time in the only pleasure and will of Almighty God, whether your Majesty The perils that shall have heirs begotten and procreated between your Highness might enfueto and your said most dear and entirely beloved wife Queen Jane, or dfeany lawful heirs and issues hereafter of your own body be- ledgeofalawl gotten by any other lawful wife, and if such heirs shoula fail, fdsuccessorto as God defend, and no provision made in your life, who should the crown, rule, and govern this realm for lack of such heirs: That then this realm, after your tranlitory life, shall be destitute of a lawful govemour: or else percafe encumbered with such a person, that would covet to aspire to the same, whom the subjects of this realm shall not find in their hearts to love, dread, and obediently serve, as their sovereign Lord. And if your Grace, afore it may be certainly known whether ye shall have heirs or po, should suddenly name and declare any person or persons to succeed after your decease, and for lack of heirs of your body lawfully begotten, into the royal estate of the imperial crown of this realm: then it is to be doubted, that such person that should be so named, might happen to take great heart, and courage, and by preemption fall to inobedience and rebellion, by occasion pr which premisses great division and diflention may be, and is vejry likely to arise, and spring in this realm, to the great peril ana destruction of us your most humble and obedient subjects, and of ajl our poftenties, if remedy for the same should not be provided.

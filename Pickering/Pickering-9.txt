CAP. XXXIX.

An act for encouraging the linen manufacture of Ireland, and bringing flax and hemp into, and the making of sail cloth in this kingdom.

WHEREAS there are great sums of money and bullion yearly exported out of this kingdom, for the purchasing of flax and linen, and the productions thereof which might in great measure be prevented by being supplied from Ireland, if such proper encouragement were given as might invite foreign protestants into that kingdom to settle; be it therefore enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Hemp or flax, &c. may be imported into England from Ireland custom free, on certificate from the officer of the port in Ireland, expressing the mark and particulars in each bale. Confirmed by 1 Annae, stat. 2. c. 2.]

That from and after the first day of August, one thousand six hundred ninety six, it shall and may be lawful to and for any native or natives of England or Ireland to import into England, directly from Ireland, any sorts of hemp or flax, and all the production thereof, as thread, yarn, and linen, of the growth and manufacture of Ireland, free from all manner of customs, duties, and impositions whatsoever, the master or other chief officer of the vessel so importing the same, bringing with him or them a certificate or certificates from the chief officer or officers of the port or ports in Ireland, where such goods shall be put on board, expressing the marks, number, tale or weight, of the species in each bale or parcel mentioned in the bill or bills of lading, with the name or names, place or places of abode of the exporter or exporters from Ireland, and the name or names, place or places of abode of such other person or persons that shall have sworn the goods therein mentioned to be bona fide of the growth and manufacture of the kingdom, without fraud or covin, and where

and to whom in England consigned; and also the master or masters, chief officer or officers of the said ship or ships, vessel or vessels, on arrival in England, making oath, that the said bales, parcels and goods therein contained, are the said bales, parcels and goods taken on board, by virtue of the said certificate or certificates so to be produced; any act, custom, or usage heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding.

[English made sail cloth to be exported custom free. British linen cloth made of hemp or flax likewise may be exported custom free by 3 Geo. 1. c. 7. s.39.]

II. And forasmuch as the making of sail cloth in England is of great use and benefit to the nation, and will employ many thousands of the poor; which manufacture is already set up in several parts of the kingdom, and brought to good perfection; be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That for the encouragement of the further improvement of the same, all English made sail cloth (upon due proof upon oath of its being made in this kingdom) shall from and after the first day of August, one thousand six hundred ninety and six, be exported free from the payment of all custom and duty whatever, whether the same be exported in the piece or boult, or in sails ready made; any law, act or statute, to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

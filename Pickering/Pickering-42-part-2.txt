explaining and amending the said acts.-—[May 30, 1800.] i

J

Acts 35 Geo. 3* c. 126. 38 Geo. 3. c. 61, recited. Whereas considerabk j

progrets hath been made in carrying the said acts into execution, whereby t

the entrance into the said city at Temple Bar, hath been greatly improved: 1

and whereas in forming the original ertimateof the expences ofeffofting h j

the said improvements, sufficient allowances were not made for the fob* ( t

sequent depreciation of the bonds and securities which by the first redted j ;

aft were directed to be given, for securing the monies thereby aathorifed J t

to be borrowed; nor were adequate allowances made for the sums paid 1

and to be paid in several unforeseen cases, as compcnlationg for good will, Losses and damages, to persons occupying or being interested ia houses and other hereditaments, by the said acts aathorifed to be purchased; and in the said estimate credit was taken for the monies to be received by falcof the ground rents, and the reversion, freehold, and inheritance of so many houses, or such parcel of the buildings, hods, i

tenements, and hereditaments, by the said acts authorised to be purchased ,

and taken out of the llreets, as lliould not be afterwards laid into the -

streets or otherwise appropriated to publick use; but it being found ape. 1

dijjnt that the said improvements to be made at Temple Bar and Snow Hill aforesaid, ihoultl be carried on at both places at one and the kmc time, the lad mentioned monies, which will amount to a very consider* able sum, cannot be obtained by such sale, until all the purchases yet remaining to be made pursuant to the said acts shall be actually made; for' which reasons the fund created by the first herein-before redted aft, is found to be insufficient for completing the said improvements: and whereas, if the land tax charged upon the houses, buildings, hnds, tene. ments, and hereditaments, purchased and to be purchased for the kid j

improvements, were redeemed according to the statutes lately made and j

provided concerning the redemption and purchase of the land tax, such |

redemption would be highly beneficial not only to the estate so intended ,

to be sold as aforesaid, but ultimately to the funds provided and to be ,

provided for carrying on the said improvements: and whereas the fund called The Orphan's Fund, was eftaoliflied by an act pifled in the fifth and sixth years of the reign of King William and Queen Mary, intituled,

An act for relief of the Orphans, and other creditors of the city of London, for the purposes therein expressed; which laid fund, and the

Common council empowered to raise thirty thousand and sixty thousand pounds upon the credit of the Orphans' Fund, of the monies to arise by sale of ground, rents, &c. Contributors to be entitled to redeemable annuities. Common council to cause bonds, or other securities, to be given for such annuities, assignable by indorsement. The Orphans' Fund charged with such annuities. Future surplusses of the said fund how to be employed. Upon notice of redemption of annuities and tender of the monies, the annuities to cease.

WHEREAS it is well known by all that are acquainted with the art of navigation, That nothing is so much wanted and desired at Sea, as the discovery of the longitude, for the safety and quickness of voyages, the'preservation of ships, and the lives of men: and whereas in the judgment of able mathematicians and navigators, several methods have already been discovered9 true in theory though very difficult in practice, same of which (there is reason to expect) may be capable of improvement, same already discovered may be proposed to the publick, and others may be invented hereafter. And whereas such a discovery would be of particular advantage to the trade of Great Britain, and very much for the honour of this kingdom; but besides the great difficulty of the thing itself partly for the want of same publick reward to be settled as an encouragement for so useful and beneficial a work, and partly for want of money for trials and experiments neccessary tlyereunto, no such inventions or proposals, hr-- therto made, have been brought to perfection \ be it therefore enact-

CAP. XVI.

An act to reduce the rate of interest, without any prejudice to parliamentary securities.

WHEREAS the reducing of interest to ten, and from thence to eight, and thence to six in the hundred, hath, from time to time, by experience been found very beneficial to the advancement of trade, and improvement of lands: and whereas the heavy burden of the late long and expensive war hath been chiefly born by the owners of the land of this kingdom, by reason whereof they have been necessitated to contract very large debts, and thereby, and by the abatement in the value of their lands, are become greatly impoverished: and whereas by reason of the great interest and profit which hath been made of money at home, the foreign trade of this nation hath of late years been much neglected, and at this time there is a great abatement in the value of the merchandises, wares, and commodities of this kingdom, both at home and in foreign parts, whither they are transported: and whereas for the redress of these mischiefs, and the preventing the encrease of the same, it is absolutely necessary to reduce the high rate of interest of six pounds in the hundred pounds for a year to a nearer proportion with the interest allowed for money in foreign states; be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most excellent majesty, by and with the

That no person or persons whatsoever, from and after the nine and twentieth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, upon any contract, which shall be made from and after the said nine and twentieth day of September, take, directly or indirectly, for loan of any monies, wares, merchandise, or other commodities whatsoever, above the value of five pounds for the forbearance of one hundred pounds for a year, and so after that rate for a greater or lesser sum, or for a longer or shorter time;

[All bonds, &c. for a greater interest shall be void.]

X. And whereas the prevailing custom of convocaling numbers of his Majesty's fubjcBs together, with the practice of obliging them to perform divers services, arbitrary and opprejftve, by virtue of elaufes in charges, contracts or agreements, within the limits aforesaid, is contrary to the nature of good government, dejtruftive to the liberties of free people, inconsistent with the obedience and allegiance due to his Majt fly and government, as well as the greatest obJlruBien to the improvement of trade, husbandry and manufactories, and was one of the greatest means of raising and earying on the late unhappy rebellion: be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the first day of August in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, and all time thereafter, the annual value of the services, commonly called personal attendance, hosting, hunting, watching and warding, due by virtue of any charter, contract, custom or agreement whatsoever, shall be paid in money annually indeed of them.

WHEREAS in and by an act of parliament made and passed in the third year of his present Majesty's reign, intituled, An act for redeeming the duties and revenues which were settled to pay off principal and interest on the orders made forth on four lottery-acts passed in the ninth and tenth years of her late Majesty's reign; and for redeeming certain annuities payable on orders out of the hereditary excise, according to a former act in that behalf; and for establishing a general yearly fund, not only for the future payment of annuities, at several rates, to be payable and transferable at the bank of England, and redeemable by parliament; but also to raise monies for such proprietors of the orders, as shall choose to be paid their principal and arrears of interest in ready money; and for making good such other deficiencies and payments as in this act are mentioned; and for taking off the duties on linseed imported, and British linen exported, it is amongst other things enacted, That all the annuities at several rates charged upon and payable out of the monies of the general fund of seven hundred twenty four thousand eight hundred forty nine pounds six shillings and ten pence and one fifth part of a penny per annum, by the said act established or intended to be established, should be paid and payable by quarterly payments, at the four most usual feasts in the year (that is to say) the feasts of the birth of our Lord Christ, the annunciation of the Blessed virgin Mary, the nativity of St. John the Baptist, and St. Michael the Archangel, by even and equal portions, or within six days after every of the said feast days for ever, or until redemption or redemptions thereof shall be made, according to the provisoes contained in the said act: and whereas the proprietors in the said several annuities made payable by the said act, do consist of many thousand persons; and it is found by experience, That the adjusting and stating the accounts of the said proprietors, in order to the making a dividend every quarter of a year, as the said act directs, doth take up so much time, that the transfer-books must of necessity be kept shut up for a long while together, to the great inconvenience and detriment of the said proprietors: for remedy hereof for the future, be it enacted, &c.

Redeemed 5 Geo. 2. c. 3. sect. 2. After Christmas 1717, the annuities made payable by the recited act, shall be paid out of the general fund by that act established, by half yearly payments.

CAP. XI.

[This act is inforced, 6 Geo. 1. c. 23.]

WHEREAS it is found by experience, That the punishments inflicted by the laws now in force against the offences of robbery, larceny and other felonious taking and stealing of money and goods, have not proved effectual to deter wicked and evil-disposed persons from being guilty of the said crimes: and whereas many offenders to whom royal mercy hath been extended, upon condition of transporting themselves to the West-Indies, have often neglected to perform the

472 Anno quarto Georgii I. c. 11. [1717.

said condition, but returned to their former wickedness, and been as last for new crimes brought to a shameful and ignominious death: and whereas in many of his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America, there is great want of servants, who by their labour and industry might be the means of improving and making the said colonies and plantations more useful to this nation: be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and the commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Persons who before the 20th of Jan. 1717, have been convicted of offences within the benefit of clergy; and also such as hereafter be convicted,]

That where any person or persons have been convicted of any offence within the benefit of clergy, before the twentieth day of January one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, and are liable to be whipt or burnt in the hand, or have been ordered to any workhouse, and who shall be therein on the said twentieth day of January; as also where any person or persons shall be hereafter convicted of grand or petit larceny, or any felonious stealing or taking money or goods and chattels, either from the person, or the house of any other, or in any other manner, and who by the law shall be entitled to the benefit of clergy, and liable only to the penalties of burning in the hand or whipping,

[except receivers and buyers of stolen goods,]

(except persons convicted for receiving or buying stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen) it shall and may be lawful for the court before whom they were convicted, or any court held at the same place with the like authority, if they think fit, instead of ordering any such offenders to be burnt in the hand or whipt, to order and direct,

[shall be sent to the plantations for 7 years.]

That such offenders, as also such offenders in any workhouse, as aforesaid, shall be sent as soon as conveniently may be, to some of his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America for the space of seven years;

[The court before whom convicted to contract for their transportation.]

and that court before whom they were convicted, or any subsequent court held at the same place, with like authority as the former, shall have power to convey, transfer and make over such offenders, by order of court, to the use of any person or persons who shall contract for the performance of such transportation, to him or them, and his and their assigns, for such term of seven years;

[Persons convicted of offences, for which they are excluded the benefit of clergy,]

and where any persons have been convicted, or do now stand attainted of any offences whatsoever, for which death by law ought to be inflicted, or where any offenders shall hereafter be convicted of any crimes whatsoever, for which they are by law to be excluded the benefit of clergy, and his Majesty, his heirs or successors, shall be graciously pleased to extend royal mercy to any such offenders, upon the condition of transportation to any part of America, and such intention of mercy be signified by one of his Majesty's principal secretaries of state, it shall and may be lawful to and for any court having proper authority, to allow such offenders the benefit of a pardon under the great seal, and to order and direct the like transfer and conveyance to any person or persons, (who will contract for the performance of such transportation) and to his and their assigns, of any such before-mentioned offenders,

[and also receivers and buyers of stolen goods may be transported for 14 years;]

as also of any person or persons convicted of receiving or buying stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen, for the term of fourteen years, in case such condition of

1717.] Anno quarto Georgii I. c. 11. 473

transportation be general, or else for such other term or terms as shall be made part of such condition, if any particular time be specified by his Majesty, his heirs and successors, as aforesaid;

[and the persons contracting for their transportation, shall have a property in their service.]

and such person or persons so contracting, as aforesaid, his or their assigns, by virtue of such order of transfer, as aforesaid, shall have a property and interest in the service of such offenders for such terms of years.

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[Returning before the expiration of the term, shall be punished with death.]

That if any offender or offenders, so ordered by any such court to be transported for any term of seven years or fourteen years, or other time or times, as aforesaid, shall return into any part of Great Britain or Ireland before the end of his or their said term, he or she so returning, as aforesaid, shall be liable to be punished as any person attainted of felony without the benefit of clergy; and execution may and shall be awarded against such offender or offenders accordingly:

[The King may pardon such transportation, the offender paying his owner such sum, as two justices shall adjudge.]

provided nevertheless. That his Majesty, his heirs and successors, may pardon and dipense with any such transportation, and allow of the return of any such offender or offenders from America, he or they paying their owner or proprietor, at the time of such pardon, dispensation or allowance, such sum of money as shall be adjudged reasonable by any two justices of the peace residing within the province where such owner dwells;

[Service of the term shall have the effect of a pardon.]

and where any such offenders shall be transported, and shall have served their respective terms, according to the order of any such court, as aforesaid, such services shall have the effect of a pardon to all intents and purposes, as for that crime or crimes for which they were so transported, and shall have so served, as aforesaid.

[Contractors to give security for the transportation of such offenders,]

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every such person or persons to whom any such court shall order any such offenders to be transferred or conveyed, as aforesaid, before any of them shall be delivered over to such person or persons, or his or their assigns, to be transported, as aforesaid, he or they shall contract and agree with such person or persons as shall be ordered and appointed by such court, as aforesaid, and give sufficient security to the satisfaction of such court, that he or they will transport, or cause to be transported effectually such offenders so conveyed to him or them, as aforesaid, to some of his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America,

[and procure certificates from the governor, &c.]

as shall be ordered by the said court, and procure an authentick certificate from the governor, or the chief custom-house officer of the place (which certificate they are hereby required to give forthwith, without fee or reward, as soon as conveniently may be) of the landing of such offenders so transferred, as aforesaid,

[where landed, and that they shall not be suffered to return by his default.]

[Persons taking rewards for helping to stolen goods,]

IV. And whereas there are several persons who have secret acquaintances with felons, and who make it their business to help persons

474 Anno quarto Georgii I. c. 11. [1717.

to their stolen goods, and by that means gain money from them, which is divided between them and the felons, whereby they greatly encourage such offenders: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That where-ever any person taketh money or reward, directly or indirectly, under pretence or upon account of helping any person or persons to any stolen goods or chattels,

[unless they cause the felon to be brought to trial, shall be guilty of felony.]

every such person so taking money or reward, as aforesaid, (unless such person doth apprehend, or cause to be apprehended, such felon who stole the same, and cause such felon to be brought to his trial for the same, and give evidence against him) shall be guilty of felony, and suffer the pains and penalties of felony, according to the nature of the felony committed in dealing such goods, and in such and the same manner as if such offender had himself stolen such goods and chattels, in the manner, and with such circumstances as the same were stolen.

V. And whereas there are many idle persons, who are under the age of one and twenty years, lurking about in divers parts of London, and elsewhere, who want employment, and may be tempted to become thieves, if not provided for: and whereas they may be inclined to be transported, and to enter into services in some of his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America; but as they have no power to contract for themselves, and therefore that it is not safe for merchants to transport, or take them into such services; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[Merchants, or others, may contract with persons of the age of 15, and under 21, to serve them in America for 8 years.]

That where any person of the age of fifteen years or more, and under the age of twenty one, shall be willing to be transported, and to enter into any service in any persons of the of his Majesty's colonies or plantations in America, it shall and may be lawful for any merchant, or other, to contract with any such Person for any such service, not exceeding the term of eight years;

[and sign the same with his approbriation.]

and that then it shall be same with his lawful for any such merchant or other, to transport such person so binding him or herself, and to keep him or her within any of the said plantations or colonies, according to the tenor of such contract, as aforesaid; any law or statute to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding;

which said contract and approbation of such magistrate or magistrates, with the tenor of such contract, shall be certified by such magistrate or magistrates to the next general quarter-sessions, of the peace, held for that county where such magistrate or magistrates shall reside, to be registred by the clerk of the peace without fee or reward.

among all other things great inconueniences daily doe increase by deflation and pulling downe, and wilfull waste of houses and townes within this Realme, and laying to pasture lands, which customably haue beene vied in tillage, whereby idlcnefle, which is the ground and beginning of all mischiefes, daily doth encrease. For where in some townes two hundred persons were occupied and hued by their lawfull labours, now there are occupied two or three heardmen, and the residue fall into idelnesse, the husbandrie which is one of the greatest commodities of this Realme is greatly decayed. Churches destroyed, the service of God withdrawen, the bodies there buried not prayed for the Patrons and Curates wronged, the defence of this land against our enemies outward, feebled and impaired, to the great displeasure of God, to the subversion of the pollicie and good rule of this land, if remedie be not provided: Wherefore the King our Soueraigne Lord by the aduice of the Lords - spirituall and temporall, and the Commons in this said Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, hath oretained, enacted and stablished, that no person, of what estate degree or condition that he be, that hath any house or houses, that at any time within three yeers passed, hath beene or that now is, or that hereafter shall be lette for ferme with xx, acres of land at least, or more, lying in tillage and Husbandrie, that the owner and owners of euery such house of houses and land, doe keepe sustaine and maintainehouses and buildings upon the Taid ground, and land conuenient and necefiarie for maintaining and uphold- Tillage* ing of the saide tillage and Husbandrie. And if any such owner or owners of any such house or houses and land, take land and occupie any such house or houses, and keepe in his or their own hands, that the said owner or owners by the said authorise be bound in like wife to keepe and maintaine houses and buildings upon the (aide ground and land convenient and neceiTarie for the maintaining and upholding of the saide tillage and Husbandrie.

And if any man doe contrary to the premises or any of them, that then it be lawfull to the King, if any such lands or houses be holden of him immediately, or to the Lords of the Fees, if any such lands be holden of them immediately, to receive yeerely halfe the value of the issues and profits of any such lands, whereof the house or houses be not so maintained and sustained.

And the same halfe dealp of the issues and profits to have, holde and keepe to his or their owne vfe, without any thin& therefore to be payed or given, till such time as the same house or houses bee sufficiently builded or repaired againe. And that no manner of freehold be in the King, nor in any such Lord or Lords, by the taking of any such profits, of or in any such lands in no manner of forme: but onely the King and the said Lord or Lords, haue power to take, receive, and haue the said issues and profits, as is aboue saide, and therefore the King or the said Lord or Lords to haue power to distraine for the same issues and profits to be had and perceiued by them, in forme aboue fayde, by authorise of this present A&e.

WHERE the Kings most excellent majedie is by Gods law fupreame head immediatly under him of this whole*Church and congregation of England* intending the coofcr-c uation of the same Church and congregation in a true, sincere and vniforme doctrine of Christs religion, calling also to his ' blessed and most gracious remembrance, as well the great and ' quiet assurance, prosperous increase, and other innumerable*commodities, which haue euer insued, come and followed of concord, agreement and vnitie in opinions, as also the cnani- fold perils, dangers and inconueniences, which haue beretofore in many places and regions growne, sprung, and ariien, x of the diucrlities of mindcs and opinions, especially of matters, of christian religion: and therefore desiring, that such an vnitie might and Should be charitably established in all things touching and concerning the same, as the same so being established might chiefly be to the honour of Almighty God, the very Author and fountaine of all true vnitie and sincere con- cord, and consequently redound to the commonwealth of this his highnesse most noble realme, and of all his lotting subjects and other refiants and inhabitants of or in the lame: 4 hath therefore caused and commanded this his most high Court of Parliament, for ftindry and many vrgent causes and considerations, to be at this time summoned, and also a synod9and conuocation of all the Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men of the Clergie of this his realme, to be in like9manner assembled.

III. The Kings most royall majestie, most prudenly pondering and considering, that by occasion of variable and sundry opinions and judgements of the said Articles, great discord and variance hath arisen, as well amongst the Cleargie of this his Realme, as amongst a great number of the vulgar

people, his louing subjects of the tome: and being in a lull

hope and trust, that a full and perfect resolution of the said Articles, Should make a perfect concord and vnitie generally amongst all his louing and obedient subjects, of his most excellent goodnesse not onely commanded, that the told Articles Should deliberately, and aduifedly, by his said Archbishops,

4 Bishops, and other learned men of his Cleargie, be debated,

argued and reasoned, and their opinions therein to be understood, declared and known e, but also most graciously vouchsafed in his own Princely person, to defeend and come vnto his said high court of Parliament and counsel, 6c there like t 4 Prince of most high prudence, and no leste learning, opened and declared many things of high learning and great knowledge, touching the said articles, matters & questio's for an vnity to be had in the same: Whereupo* after a great & long deliberat U aduifed difputatio' & co'fultatio* had and made concerning the said Articles, afwell by the consent of the Kings highnesse, as by the assent of the Lords spirituall and Temporall, and other learned men of his Clergie in their Convocations, and by the consent of the Commons in this present parliament assembled, it was and is finally refolued, accorded and agreed in mannercnd forme following, that is to say,

First, That in the mofi blessed Sacrament of the Altar yby thefirength sacrament, 1 and efficacie of Chrifis mighty word (it being spoken by the Priefi) is present really wider the forme of bread and wine, the naturall body and blood of our Sauiour left Chrifiy conceiued of the Virgin Mary: and that after the consecration there remaineth no substance of Bread or Winey nor any other fubfianccy but the fubfiance of Chrifiy God and man.

Secondly, That the Communion in both kinds is not necessary Ad Communion, falutem by the law of God to all persons: and that it is to be beieeued and not doubted of but that in the flesh under the forme of breadr, is the very bloody and with the blood under forme of winey is the very fie/b as well apart as though they were both together.

Thirdly, That Priejhy after the order'of Priefihood receiuedy Marriage. as aforey may not marne by the law of God.

Fourthly, That vowes of chafiitiey widowheady by man or womdn Vowes*made to God aduifedly, ought to be obferued by the law of God: and

invented by him, and have directed several sums of money to be paid to the said John Harrison to enable him to fini/b his said machines or time keepers, or some of them, upon condition of his delivering the same up to and for the use of the publift: and whereas the said John Harrison did, by direction of the said commissioners, enter into articles with the commissioners of the navy, whereby he agreed, in consideration of the sums so advanced to him, to deliver up the three several machines or time keepers in the said articles mentioned: and whereas, upon trial of one other watch machine or time keeper in a voyage to Jamaica, the major part of the said commissioners did ad-judge the same to be of lonftderable use to the publick, and did accordingly order the payment of the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds to the said John Harrison, which sum was to be deemed and taken as part of such of the rewards, in and by the said act allowed for discovering the said longitude, as he might become intitled to, and as such has been by him received; and the said watch or time keeper was to become the property of the publick: and whereas upon a further trial of the said last mentioned watch or time keeper, a ship has failed, by the appointment of the commissioners for the discovery of the longitude, from Portsmouth in Great Britain, to Bridgetown in the island of Barbadoes in the West Indies; and whereas by means of the said watch or time keeper invented by Mr. John Harrison, the said ship did not lose it's longitude beyond ten geographical miles: and whereas the method for finding the longitude at fca, within half a degree of a great circle, or thirty geographical miles, by means of the said watch or time keeper invented by the said John Harrison, may be made generally practicable, and of general utility, if the principles upon which the said watch or time keeper is confirufted are fully discovered and explained, and other watches or time keepers of the same kind can be made; but doubts may arise, whether, by the words of the said act of the twelfth of Queen Anne, the said commissioners can dir eft the payment of the said reward of twenty thousand pounds to the said John Harrison, upon a discovery of the principles of the said watch or time keeper, and upon other watches or time keepers of the same kind being made: and whereas great progress has been made to-words discovering the longitude at fca by a set of lunar tables con-firufted by Tobias Mayer deceased, late professor at Goetingen in Germany, upon the principles of gravitation laid down by Sir Isaac Newton; in the construction of which tables he was considerably af-fifted from theorems furnished by professor Euler of the university of Berlin; and whereas the said tables are of considerable use to the publick, and may be further improved, and made of more general utility: and whereas the widow, or other representatives of the said professor Mayer, are, within the intention of the said act, deserving of a publick reward, upon her or their afftgning the property of the said tables to the said commissioners for the use of the publick; and the said professor Euler is atfi deserving of an honorary and pecuniary acknowledgment for his useful and ingenious labours towards the discovery of the longitude: and whereas it is necessary that the pow<rt of the said act of the twelfth year of Queen Anne, and also of the fad act of the twenty sixth year of King George the Second, Jbeuld

to your faithful commons the continuance of that attention which hath hitherto been Shewn to the improvement of the pubhek revenue, we have thought it our duty to apply ourselves with the utmost zeal and assiduity to carry into execution every proper measure for the attainment of that end 5 and though we have already prepared several bills for that purpose, which have received your royal approbation, we are desirous to establijbfillfurther regulations, which, by a more exact and equal collection of the publick revenue, and without laying any new burthens on your people, may tend to the accomplishment of so great and salutary a design: and whereas by an act passed in the fourteenth year of the reign of his late majesey King Charles the Second (intituled,

An act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses, in his Ma-

jetty's customs) it is, amongst other things, enabled. That the person or per fens which were or Should be appointed for managing the customs, and officers of his Majesty*/ customs, and their deputies, Jfhould be thereby authorized and enabled to go and enter aboard any ship or vessel, as well ships of war as merchant ships, from thence to bring on Shore all goods prohibited or uncufemed, except jewels, if they be outwards bound; and if they be ships or vessels inwards bound, from thence to bring on Shore into his Majestfs ftorcbouse, all small parcels of fine goods, or other goods, which Should be found in cabins, cbefts, trunks, or other small package, or in any private or secret place in or out of the hold of the ship or vessel, vjhich might occasion a just fufpi-cion that they were intended fraudulently to be conveyed away; and all other forts of goods whatsoever, for which the duties of tonnage and poundage were not paid or compounded for within twenty days after the fir/I entry of the ship, to be put and remain in the Jlorehouse aforesaid, until his Majesty s duties thereupon be paid; unless the said person or perfens which were or Should be appointed by his Majesty for managing the customs, and officers of the customs, Should fee just (ause to allow a longer time, as in and by the said recited alt more at large appears: and whereas in the cbefts, trunks, bales, casks, and other package, which contained goods j 'o sent and carried to his Majesty*s Jlorehouse by the officer* of the customs in pursuance of the said act, and likewi/e in packages which are brought on Shore by virtue of a special sufferance or order from the comini fit oners or principal officers of the customs, to be examined before entry and payment of duties, at the re-quest and application of the owners thereof; and alfe in and amongst such goods themselves, there are often found concealed and enclosed lace and other fine goods and merchandizes, which lie in little compass, and of which no entries are often intended to be made, or duties paid for, by the owners or proprietors thereof, or their agents, unless and until the same are discovered by the officers of his Majesty*s customs; by which fraudulent concealments the revenue thereof is greatly defrauded: may it therefore please your Majesty, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of June, one thousand seven hundred and sixty five, all goods, wares, and merchandizes whatsoever, which shall be found ep-

XXIII. And whereas by an act of parliament made and passed in the fifth year of the reign of her late majesty Queen Anm % intituled, An act for an union of tbt two kingdoms $/England and Scotland; it is, by the eighteenth article of the said of union, declared and enabled. That the laws concerning regulation of trade, customs, and such excises to which Scotland is, by Virtue of this treaty, made liable, be the same in Scotland, from and after the union, as in England; and by the seventh article of the said act of union, it is also declared and enabled. That all parts of the united kingdom be, for ever, from and after the union, liable to the same excises upon all excitable liquors; excepting only that the thirty four gallons English barrel of beer or ale, amounting to twelve gallons Scots present measure, fold in Scotland at nine shillings and six pence sterling, excluding all

duties,

duties, and retailed, including duties, at two pence the Scotch pint, or eighth part of the Scots galion, be not after the union liable, on account of the present excise upon exciseable liquors in England, to any higher imposition than two shillings sterling upon the aforesaid thirty four gallons English barrel, being twelve

fallons the present Scots measure; yet nevertheless doubts have een raised whether the brewers of that particular species of beer or ale mentioned and described in the said seventh article of the said treaty of union, and commonly called and known by the name of Two Penny Beer or Alet are within the defection and meaning of an act of parliament made and passed in the seventh and eighth years of the reign of King William the Third, inti-tuled.

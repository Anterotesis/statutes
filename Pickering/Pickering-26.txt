WHEREAS the efablijbint a manufacture of linens in Eng-land, of the kind ufally known under' the denomination of cambricks and French lawns* will be of great utility to this kingdom4 as well by the employment of a great number of poor* as by preventring the illegal importation of foreign cambricks and Freneh7tf«/w : and whereas a manufaCtury of cambricks and lawns hath been already fet up at Winchelfea in the county of Sufsex, and large quantities of such goods have been made there* and may be made in other tarts of this kingdom* equal* if not fuperior* in quality to those made in foreign parts; and many persons are defrous of subscribing large Jums towards the support and extenfon of the said manufaCtury (for the effectual carrying on of which a large fund will be necejfary) but are apprehenfwe that difficulties may arife* as well in rtcovenng debts which may grow due to the proprietors of the said manufaCtury* as in defending suits or actions which may be brought or commenced a* gainjl them for any matter or thing relative thereto* as* by law* all the several proprietors or subscribers to the said manufaCtury must, in such cafis both sue and be fued* implead and be impleaded* by their feviral and difinCt names and descriptions; and therefore^ for the mfbe easily carrying on the manufacture* and avoiding the difficulties aforesaid* are deftrous of being incorporated and having a common feal and name by which they may sue and be sued; and many persons are defrous of subscribing large Jums thereto* but are deterred from so doing, left they may thereby become liable* in cafe the said manufaCtury Jbould not be successful, to pay large sums of money over and above the sums by them fubfcribed* to make good the debts to be incurred therefrom\ and many persons who are not now liable to become bankrupts,

within the intent and meaning of any of the laws now in force con cerning bankrupts are likewise fearful of subscribing money to cany on the said manufacture, as, by becoming Jubjcribers to and part owners thereof they may be liable to have commissions of bankrupt ijfuecl againji them as traders: and whereas some doubts have arisen, whether such cambricks and lawns, so made and fabricated .England, can, confident with the laws now in being relating to catnbricks jmd French lawns, be legally fold, disposed of and used in Great Britain ; may it therefore please your Majesty that it may. be enadied* ana be it enadfced by the King’s mod excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the Anj person authority of the fame, That it shall and may be lawful to and may makeand for any person or persons whomsoever, to make and vend, or fell cambricks caufet0 be made and vended, all such linen goods called Cambricks this k^dom.or L(XWn5> or goods of the kind usually known by or under either *of those denominations, as shall be made in this kingdom, arid stamped in the maimer herein after directed; and that fqch lawns or cambricks, or other such like goods so made and stamped, may be exposed to sale, and worn by any person or persons in this kingdom; any law, usage, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.

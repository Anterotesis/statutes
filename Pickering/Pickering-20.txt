Note, That in a Biflextile or Leap-Year, the Number of Sundays after Epiphany will be the same, as if E after-Day had fallen one Day later than it really does. And for the same reason, one Day mull in every Leap-Year be added to the Day of the Month given by the Table for Septuagejima-Sunday: And the like muil be done for the First Day of Lent (commonly called dfb-Wednefday) unless the Table gives some D*y in the Month of March for it; for in that Case the Day given by the Table is the right Day.

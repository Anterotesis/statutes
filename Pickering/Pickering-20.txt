WHEREAS the legal supputation of the the year of our Lord in that part of Great Britain called England, according to which the year begineth on the twenty-fifth day of March, hath been found by experience to be attended with divers inconveniencies, not only as it differs from the usage of neighbouring nations, hut also from the legal method of computation in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and from the common usage throughout the whole kingdom,

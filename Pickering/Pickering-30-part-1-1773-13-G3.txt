CAP. XLI.

An act for enabling James Cox, Jeweller, to dispose of his musaeum, commonly called Cox's musaeum, by way of chance, in such manner as may be most for the benefit of himself and his creditors.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS James Cox of Shoe Lane, in the city of London, Jeweller, hath, in the prosecution of his trade, invented several mechanical pieces of uncommon and expensive workmanship; in the construction of which employment has been afforded to numbers of ingenious and industrious artists and workmen; and many of the said pieces have, for several years past, been disposed of in foreign countries, much to the honour as well as advantage of this kingdom: and whereas the said James Cox hath, with great labour, ingenuity, and expence, contrived and brought to perfection other pieces composing the musaeum, commonly called Cox's musaeum, which were originally intended to be disposed of in the East Indies, as many other pieces of the like kind, invented by the said James Cox, to the amount of near six hundred thousand pounds, have already been: and whereas the said James Cox hath necessarily contracted large debts in completing the said musaeum; and the said musaeum, on account of the great value and price thereof, and also on account of the present distress and scarcity of money in the East Indies, as well as in Europe, cannot easily be disposed of in the common way of sale: and whereas, unless some encouragement under the sanction of parliament be given to the said James Cox, to enable him to dispose of the said musaeum to the best advantage, and by such sale to continue with success, in the course of his trade as a jeweller, his ingenious and useful endeavours, which have, for many years past, found employment for near one thousand workmen and artists, the debts contracted by the said James Cox cannot speedily be discharged, and numbers of artists and workmen will be deprived of employment: in order therefore that this useful branch of trade, brought to so much perfection by the said James Cox, may still be carried on with success, may it please your Majesty, at the humble petition of the said James Cox, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Mr. Cox impowered to dispose of his musaeum.]

That it shall and may be lawful to and for the said James Cox, his heirs or assigns, and he and they is and are hereby authorised and impowered, at any time or times before the first day of January, one thousand seven hundred and eighty, to sell and dispose of the said musaeum, and the several pieces composing the said musaeum, specified in the schedule to this act annexed, in such manner as the said James Cox, his heirs or assigns, shall think proper, without being liable or subject to any penalty or forfeiture imposed by any act or acts of parliament against any sale or sales by way of lottery, or by lots, tickets, numbers, or figures; and that such sale or sales so to be made of the said musaeum, and of the several

An act to regulate the importation and exportation of corn.

[Preamble.]

---

WHEREAS the several acts of parliament heretofore made concerning the duties and bounties respectively payable on the importation and exportation of corn and grain have greatly tended U the aivancement of tillage and navigation; yet nevertheless, it having been of late years found necessary, on account of the small quantities of corn and grain in hand, and of the shortness of the crops, to suspend the operation of those laws by temporary Statutes, whereby th benefits derived from the said acts of parliament have been, during such emergencies, withheld and suspended: and whereas the regulating the importation and exportation of corn and grain by a permanent law, under such general rules and provisions as might render, for the time to come, such temporary laws unnecessary, would afford encouragement to the farmer, be the means of increasing the growth of that nectssary commodity, and of affording a cheaper and more constant supply to the poor, and preventing abuse in that article of trade; may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enabled; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal,

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS by an act, made in the twelfth year of his present Majesty's reign, (intituled, An act for granting a drawback of part of the customs upon the exportation of tea to Ireland, and the British dominions in America; for altering the drawback upon foreign sugars exported from Great Britain to Ireland; for continuing the bounty on the exportation of British-made cordage; for allowing the importation of rice from the British plantations into the ports of Bristol, Liverpoole, Lancaster, and Whitehaven, for immediate exportation to foreign parts; and to impower the chief magistrate of any corporation to administer the oath, and grant the certificate required by law, upon the removal of certain goods to London, which have been sent into the country for sale;) it is amongst other things, enacted, That for and during the space of five years, to be computed from and after the fifth day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two, there shall be drawn back and allowed for all teas which shall be sold after the said fifth day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two, at the publick sale of the united company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, or which after that time shall be imported, by licence, in pursuance of the said therein and hereinafter mentioned act, made in the eighteenth year of the reign of his late majesty King George the Second, and which shall be exported from this kingdom, as merchandise, to Ireland, or any of the British colonies or plantations in America, three-fifth parts of the several duties of customs which were paid upon the importation of such teas; which drawback or allowance, with respect to such teas as shall be exported to Ireland, shall be made to the exporter, in such manner, and under such rules, regulations, securities, penalties, and forfeitures, as any drawback or allowance was then payable, out of the duty of customs upon the exportation of foreign goods to Ireland; and with respect to such teas as shall be exported to the British colonies and plantations in America, the said drawback or allowance shall be made in such manner, and under such rules, regulations, penalties, and forfeitures, as any drawback or allowance payable out of the duty of customs upon foreign goods exported to foreign parts, was could, or might be made, before the passing of the said act of the twelfth year of his present Majesty's reign, (except in such cases as are otherwise therein provided for:) and whereas it may tend to the benefit and advantage of the trade of the said united company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, if the allowance of the drawback of the duties of customs upon all teas sold at the publick sales of the said united company, after the tenth day of May, one thousand seven hundred

1773.] Anno decimo tertio Georgii III. c. 44. 75

and seventy-three, and which shall be exported from this kingdom, as merchandise, to any of the British colonies or plantations in America, were to extend to the whole of the said duties of customs payable upon the importation of such teas; may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[After May 10, 1773, on all teas sold at publick sale, or imported by licences, and afterwards exported as merchandise to America, the whole duties of customs to be drawn back.]

That there shall be drawn back and allowed for all teas, which, from and after the tenth day of May, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, shall be sold at the publick sales of the said united company, or which shall be imported by licence, in pursuance of the said act made in the eighteenth year of the reign of his late majesty King George the Second, and which shall, at any time hereafter, be exported from this kingdom, as merchandise, to any of the British colonies or plantations in America, the whole of the duties of customs payable upon the importation of such teas; which drawback or allowance shall be made to the exporter in such manner, and under such rules, regulations, and securities, and subject to the like penalties and forfeitures, as the former drawback or allowance granted by the said recited act of the twelfth year of his present Majesty's reign, upon tea exported to the said British colonies and plantations in America was, might, or could be made, and was subject to by the said recited act, or any other act of parliament now in force, in as full and ample manner, to all intents and purposes, as if the several clauses relative thereto were again repeated and re-enacted in this present act.

[Act 18 Geo. 2. recited.]

II. And whereas by one other act made in the eighteenth year of the reign of his late majesty King George the Second, (intituled, An act for repealing the present inland duty of four shillings per pound weight upon all tea sold in Great Britain; and for granting to his Majesty certain other inland duties in lieu thereof; and for better securing the duty upon tea, and other duties of excise; and for pursuing offenders out of one county into another,) it is, amongst other things, enacted, That every person who shall, at any publick sale of tea made by the united company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, be declared to be the best bidder for any lot or lots of tea, shall, within three days after being so declared the best bidder or bidders for the same, deposit with the said united company, or such clerk or officer as the said company shall appoint to receive the same, forty shillings for every tub and for every chest of tea; and in case any such person or persons shall refuse or neglect to make such deposit within the time before limited, he, she, or they, shall forfeit and lose six times the value of such deposit directed to be made as aforesaid, to be recovered by action of debt, bill, plaint, or information, in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, in which no essoin, protection, or wager of law, or more than one imparlance, shall be allowed; one moiety of which forfeiture shall go to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, and the other moiety to such person as shall sue or prosecute for the same; and the sale

76 Anno decimo tertio Georgii III. c.44. [1773.

of all teas, for which such deposit shall be neglected to be made as aforesaid, is thereby declared to be null and void, and such teas shall be again put up by the said united company to publick sale, within fourteen days after the end of the sale of teas at which such teas were sold; and all and every buyer or buyers, who shall have neglected to make such deposit as aforesaid, shall be, and is and are thereby rendered incapable of bidding for or buying any teas at any future publick sale of the said united company: and whereas it is found to be expedient and necessary to increase the deposit to be made by any bidder or bidders for any lot or lots of bohea teas, at the publick sales of teas to be made by the said united company;

[Every person, after May 10, 1773, who shall be declared the highest bidder at any publick sale, shall deposit with the company 4l. for every tub or chest of bohea tea.]

be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every person who shall, after the tenth day of May, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, at any publick sale of tea to be made by the said united company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, be declared to be the best bidder or bidders for any lot or lots of bohea tea, shall, within three days after being so declared the best bidder or bidders for the same, deposit with the said united company, or such clerk or officer as the said united company shall appoint to receive the same, four pounds of lawful money of Great Britain for every tub and for every chest of bohea tea, under the same terms and conditions, and subject to the same forfeitures, penalties, and regulations, as are mentioned and contained in the said recited act of the eighteenth year of the reign of his said late Majesty.

[Commissioners of the treasury may grant licence to the East India Company to export to America any quantity of tea they shall think proper, without penalty.]

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for the commissioners of his Majesty's treasury, or any three or more of them, or for the high treasurer for the time being, upon application made to them by the said united company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies for that purpose, to grant a licence or licences to the said united company, to take out of their warehouses, without the same having been put up to sale, and to export to any of the British plantations in America, or to any parts beyond the seas, such quantity or quantities of tea as the said commissioners of his Majesty's treasury, or any three or more of them, or the high treasurer for the time being, shall think proper and expedient, without incurring any penalty or forfeiture for so doing; any thing in the said in part recited act, or any other law, to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Act Will. 3. recited.]

IV. And whereas by an act made in the ninth and tenth years of the reign of King William the Third, (intituled, An act for raising a sum not exceeding two millions, upon a fund, for payment of annuities, after the rate of eight pounds per centum per annum; and for settling the trade to the East Indies,) and by several other acts of parliament which are now in force, the said united company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies are obliged to give security, under their common seal, for payment of the duties of customs upon all unrated goods imported by them, so soon as the same shall be sold; and for exposing such goods to sale, openly and fairly, by way of auction, or by inch of candle, within the space of three years from the

1773.] Anno decimo tertio Georgii III. c. 44. 77

importation thereof: and whereas it is expedient that some provision should be made to permit the said company, in certain cases, to export tea, on their own account, to the British plantations in America, or to foreign parts, without exposing such tea, to sale here, or being charged with the payment of any duty for the same; be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[Treasury may grant licence to the company for any quantity of tea to be exported to America, discharged of customs.]

That from and after the passing of this act, it shall and may be lawful for the commissioners of his Majesty's treasury, or any three or more of them, or the high treasurer for the time being, to grant a licence or quantity of licences to the said united company, to take out of their warehouses such quantity or quantities of tea as the said commissioners of the treasury, or any three or more of them, or the high treasurer for the time being, shall think proper, without the same having been exposed to sale in this kingdom; and to export such tea to any of the British colonies or plantations in America, or to foreign parts, discharged from the payment of any customs or duties whatsoever; any thing in the said recited act, or any other act to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Entry to be made of all tea exported by licence, and shipped by the proper officer; and such tea is liable to the same rules, penalties, &c. not hereby altered, as before passing this act.]

V. Provided always, and it is hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That a due entry shall be made at the custom-house, of all such tea so exported by licence, as aforesaid, expressing the quantities thereof, at what time imported, and by what ship; and such tea shall be shipped for exportation by the proper officer for that purpose, and shall, in all other respects, not altered by this act, be liable to the same rules, regulations, restrictions, securities, penalties, and forfeitures, as tea exported to the like places was liable to before the passing this act:

[Officer's and collector's duty on exportation.]

and upon the proper officer's duty, certifying the shipping of such tea to the collector and comptroller of his Majesty's customs for the port of London, upon the back of the licence, and the exportation thereof, verified by the oath of the husband or agent for the said united company, to be wrote at the bottom of such certificate, and sworn before the said collector and comptroller of the customs, (which oath they are hereby impowered to administer,) it shall and may be lawful for such collector and comptroller to write off and discharge the quantity of tea so exported from the warrant of the respective ship in which such tea was imported.

[No licence to be granted, unless ten millions lb. wt. of tea be left in the warehouses.]

VI. Provided nevertheless, That no such licence shall be granted, unless it shall first be made to appear to the satisfaction of the commissioners of his Majesty's treasury, or any three or more of them, or the high treasurer for the time being, that at the time of taking out such teas, for the exportation of which licence or licences shall be granted, there will be left remaining in the warehouses of the said united company, a quantity of tea not less than ten millions of pounds weight; any thing herein, or in any other act of parliament, contained to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

carrying on of their affairs, from which it greatly imports the publick* as well as the said united company, that they Should, as speedily as possible, be relieyed: and whereas the said company, finding themselves under the necessity of applying to parliament for relief, did, by their petition to the house of commons, make application far the loan of one million five hundred thousand pounds, or so much as Should be Wanted to be advanced, and repaid in such manner, and to be attended with fitch other conditions and provisions as in their said petition is set forth, in consequence whereof the house of commons, came to several restations, fptcifying the terms upon which it might be expedient for the publick to advance to the said united company the fium of one million four hundred thousand pounds, and the several limitations which ought to accompany such loan: and whereas the said united company did, by a subsequent petition, declare their determination to depend on the laws of their country, and fiubmit to the temporary difficulties which may attend the present Jkuation of their affairs, rather than receive the loan offered to them upon the conditions prescribed: and whereas, in case the said company Should not be forthwith affijltd by the publick with the advance of a considerable sum of money, they would remain altogether unable to provide for the payment of their debts, same of which debts being due to the publick, and others to the governor and company of the bank England, the payment thereof could not long

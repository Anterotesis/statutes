by the a8i of parliament, and exchequer and privy council of Scotland, was not in the nature of a private but of a en-

couragement to trade, and as such was determined and at an end by the treaty of union \in respect to which it was agreed upon,

as an interim expedient, that the proprietors of the aforesaid manufactories shouldgrant bonds for the duties of the materials to be imparted by them, with condition to pay the case the parlia-

ment of Great Britain, or court of exchequer in Scotland, should adjudge the said materials liable to the payment of duties $ which agreement of taking such conditional bonds as aforesaid for tarried into execution, until the commijf of the customs at Edinburgh gave orders for levying the duties upon all such materials importedfor the use of the said mattufaflories as were by law chargeable with duties upon being imported for other purposes j whereupon the proprietors of the said manufatiories paid the duties but

under protest, that the rigbf of exemption claimed by them should not

thereby be hurt, nor themselves precluded from reclaiming such duties

as already had been, or afterwards should be, paid by them; and for

bringing the right of exemption so claimed by them to trial, the proprietors of the said rope work did, feme time ftnce, eause an

action in the court of exchequer at Edinburgh, at the suit of the said James Corbet, one of the said proprietors and assignee of the ref of those proprietors, agasnft Edward Burrow colletior of the customs at

barons of the said court, and the judges being equally divided in their opinion, the question remains hitherto; ftnce the time of

which bearing, certain propefitions have been offered by the proprietors

of both the said works, for accommodating the matter in and whereas tbs claim of exemption made h the proprietors of the fend manufa8ories would, on the one hand, ij be very

prejudicial to the publick interest,being capable to be exercised in an

unlimited extent with respe8to the commodities which are the subje# thereof, to the great diminution of the revenue, and the breach of that equality in trade which ought to have place in dU parts of the united kingdom: and whereas by means of the aforesaid treaty of , union, and the doubts and disputes thereupon in relation to toe right of exemption claimed as aforesaid, as well as by reason of the proceedings consequent upon such doubts and disputes, the proprietors of the said rope and soap works, who, in firm reliance of the publish

faith of the kingdom,bad laid out and employed a sum of

money towards carrying on the said works, have, on the other hand, suffered tonsiderable loft and inconveniency, the exemption from the

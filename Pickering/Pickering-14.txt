CAP. XVIII.

An act for better securing certain powers and privileges intended to be granted by his Majesty by two charters for assurance of ships and merchandizes at sea, and for lending money upon bottomry; and for restraining several extravagant and unwarrantable practices therein mentioned.

MOST gracious Sovereign, whereas it hath for many ages past been esteemed good policy, by all proper ways and means, to secure and encourage the trade of this realm, whereby the wealth and strength of the same, and particularly the shipping, navigation and public revenues thereof have been increased; and it hath been, time out of mind, a custonm or usage amongst merchants, as well of this realm as of foreign nations, when they make any adventures at sea (especially into remote or dangerous parts) to give a premium or consideration to particular persons, to have from such particular persons assurance of or upon ships, goods or merchandizes adventured, or some of them, at such rates or prices as the parties assurers and the parties assured can agree, which kind of contract or dealing is commonly called a policy of assurance, and several laws and statutes now in force have been made concerning the same assurances;

[43EI1Z. C. 12* 13 & 14 Car.2 c. 23.

notwithstanding which it is found by experience, that many particular persons, after they have received large premiums or consideration-momes for or towards the insuring ships, goods and merchandizes at feay have become bankrupts or otherwise failed in answering or complying with their policies of assurance, whereby they were particularly engaged to make good or contribute towards the kjfes which merchants or traders have sustained, to the ruin or impoverishment of many merchants and traders, and to the discouragement of adventurers at sea, and to the great diminution of the trade, wcatW, strength and publuk revenues of this kingdom: and whereas it is conceived, That if two several and dislinft corporations, with a competent joint stock to each of them belonging, and under proper conditions, refiric-tiens and regulations, were eroded an4 fftttbUJbei for ajfwrana sf 6 fifr*

[Persons taking bills, bonds, &c. payable at a future day for goods delivered to such as become bankrupt, shall be admitted to prove their bills, &c. and be intitled to a proportionable part of the bankrupt's estate.]

[discounting such securities after the rate of 5l. per cent. for what they receive.]

deducting only thereout a rebate of interest, and discounting such securities payable at future times, after the rate of five pounds per centum per annum for what he shall so receive, to be computed from the actual payment thereof to the time such debt, duty or sum of money Should or would have become due and payable in and by such securities, as aforesaid.

[Bankrupt's shall be discharged of such securities.]

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all and every person or persons, who now are or shall become bankrupts, shall be discharged of and from all and every such bond, note, or other security, as aforesaid, and shall have the benefit of the several Statutes now in force against bankrupts, in like manner, to all intents and purposes, as if such sum of money had been due and payable before the time of his becoming a bankrupt.

[No such creditor shall join in suing forth a commission, till such debt become due.]

III. Provided always, and it is hereby declared, That no such creditor shall be deemed or taken to be a sufficient creditor, for or in respect of such debt, to petition or join in any petition for the obtaining or suing forth any commission of bankruptcy, until such time as such debt shall become actually due and payable.

CAP. XXIV.

An Act for the more effectual suppressing of piracy.

WHEREAS the number of persons committing piracies, felonies and robberies upon the seas, is of late very much increased; and notwithstanding the laws already made and now in being, many idle and profligate persons have turned pirates, and betaken themselves to that wicked course of life, whereby the trade and navigation into remote parts will greatly suffer, unless some farther provision be speedily made for bringing such persons, and all others, who shall be any ways aiding and assisting, or in confederacy with them, to condign punishment; be it therefore declared and enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[After March 25, 1722 commanders of ships or others, trading with pirates, furnishing them with stores, corresponding with them, &c.]

That if any commander or master of any ship or vessel, or any other person or persons, shall from and after the twenty fifth day of March which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twenty two, any wise trade with any pirate, by truck, barter, exchange, or in any other manner, or shall furnish any pirate, felon or robber upon the seas, with any ammunition, provision or stores of any kind, or shall fit

out any ship or vessel knowingly, and with a design to trade with, or supply, or correspond with any pirate, felon or robber upon the seas, or if any person or persons shall any ways consult, combine, confederate or correspond with any pirate, felon or robber on the seas, knowing him to be guilty of any such piracy, felony or robbery, such offender and offenders and every of them,

[shall be adjudged guilty of piracy, &c. according to the 28. H. 8. c. 15 and 11 & 12 W. 3. c. 7. See 18 Geo. 2. c. 30.]

shall in each and every of the said cases be deemed, adjudged and taken to be guilty of piracy, felony and robbery, and he and they shall and may be inquired of, tried, heard and adjudged of and for all or any the matters aforesaid, according to the statute made in the twenty eighth year of King Henry the Eighth for pirates, and the Statute made in the eleventh and twelfth years of the reign of his late majesty King William the Third, intituled, An act for the more effectual suppressing of piracy, which by an act made in the sixth year of his present Majesty is made perpetual, and he and they being convicted of all or any the matters aforesaid, shall suffer such pains of death, loss of lands, goods and chattels, as pirates, felons and robbers upon the seas, ought to suffer;

[Persons belonging to any vessel, forcibly boarding any merchant-ship, and throwing any goods overboard, shall be punished as pirates.]

and in case any person or persons belonging to any ship or vessel whatsoever, upon meeting any merchant-ship or vessel on the high seas, or in any port, haven or creek whatsoever, shall forcibly board or enter into such ship or vessel, and though they do not seize and carry off such ship or vessel, shall throw over-board, or destroy any part of the goods or merchandizes belonging to such ship or vessel, the person or persons who shall be guilty thereof, shall in all respects be deemed and punished as pirates as aforesaid.

III. And whereas there are some defects in the laws for bringing persons, who are accessaries to piracy and robbery upon the seas, to condign punishment, if the principal who committed such piracy and robbery is not or cannot be apprehended and brought to justice;

[Persons declared accessaries to piracy by 11 & 12 W. 3. c. 7. shall be deemed principals, and after March 25, 1722. suffer as such.]

[Persons taking bills, bonds, &c. payable at a future day for goods delivered to such as become bankrupt, shall be admitted to prove their bills, &c. and be intitled to a proportionable part of the bankrupt's estate.]

[discounting such securities after the rate of 5l. per cent. for what they receive.]
deducting only thereout a rebate of interest, and discounting such securities payable at future times, after the rate of five pounds per centum per annum for what he shall so receive, to be computed from the actual payment thereof to the time such debt, duty or sum of money should or would have become due and payable in and by such securities, as aforesaid.

[Bankrupt's shall be discharged of such securities.]
II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all and every person or persons, who now are or shall become bankrupts, shall be discharged of and from all and every such bond, note, or other security, as aforesaid, and shall have the benefit of the several statutes now in force against bankrupts, in like manner, to all intents and purposes, as if such sum of money had been due and payable before the time of his becoming a bankrupt.

[No such creditor shall join in suing forth a commission, till such debt become due.]
III. Provided always, and it is hereby declared. That no such creditor shall be deemed or taken to be a sufficient creditor, for or in respect of such debt, to petition or join in any petition for the obtaining or suing forth any commission of bankruptcy, until such time as such debt shall become actually due and payable.

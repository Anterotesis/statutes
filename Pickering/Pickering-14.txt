An act for better securing certain powers and privileges intended to be granted by his Majesty by two charters far assurance of ships and merchandizes at feet, and for lending money upon bottomry \\ and for refraining federal extravagant and unwarrantable practices therein mentioned.

TV TOST gracious Sovereign, whereas it hath for many ages pafl 1V1 been ejleemed good policy, by all proper u>ays and means, to secure and encourage the trade of this realm, whereby the wealth and strength of the same, and particularly the shipping, navigation and public revenues thereof have been increased; and it hath been, time out of mind, a cvjlom or usage amongst merchants, as xoell of this realm as of foreign notions, when they make any adventures at fca (especially into remote or dangerous parts) to give a premium er consideration to particular persons, to have from such particular per-Jons assurance of or upon ships, goods or merchandizes adventured, or some of them, at such rates or prices as the parties ajfurers and the parties ajfured can agree, which kind of contra ft or dealing is commonly called a policy of assurance, and several laws and fiatuus new in force have been made concerning the same assurances; notwithstanding which it is found by experience, that many particular persons, after they have received large premiums or consideration-momes for or towards the insuring ships, goods and merchandizes at feay have become bankrupts or otherwise failed in answering or complying with their policies of assurance, whereby they were particularly engaged to make good or contribute towards the kjfes which merchants or traders have fujlained, to the ruin or impoverishment of many merchants and traders, and to the discouragement of adventurers at sea, and to the great diminution of the trade, wcatW, strength and publuk revenues of this kingdom: and whereas it is conceived, That if two several and dislinft corporations, with a competent joint stock to each of them belonging, and under proper conditions, refiric-tiens and regulations, were eroded an4 fftttbUJbei for ajfwrana sf 6 fifr*

in this as well as in other nations* for merchants or traders* who adventure their ships and merchandizes at sea* to borrow money to be repaid upon the return or arrival of such ships* which kind of borrowing is commonly called* taking up money on bottomry \ in which cases the lenders run a risque or hazard* more or less* oflofing their principal* and are therefore allowed to contrail Jor such interef or confederation- money for the ujt or forbearance of the principal* as tan be agreed upon between the borrowers and the lenders: and it is considered, That it may be a great advantage and encouragement to trade and navigation* if such merchants and traders might have it in their power* at their own elellion* either to have recourse to one of the corporations to be ere fled and established in pursuance of this all* or to private or particular persons* for borrowing money upon bottomry as aforesaid* at such rate or rates as shall be agreed upon between such borrowers and lenders respectively: and whereas the sole right and prerogative of granting charters of incorporation (not being such as are repugnant to any^ law orfeatuteof this realm) doth belong to your Majesty*and it is considered* That if your Majesty shall be graciously pleased to grant two such difeinll charters as afore-, fail* the members of ?ach corporation so to be erelled and established (for and in consideration of the advantages which may accrue to them respectively thereby* and for having reosonable powers and privileges Jecured to them in pursuance of this all) may be willing to pay to your Majesty's use suchfurns of money* at such times and by such proportions* as are herein after mentioned: be it therefore enacted by^*

the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice ana may-grant consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons, in charters to this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of thetwo diiUntt same. That it shall and may be lawful to and for his Majesty, by one charter or indenture under the great seal of Great Bri- ships, and for tain* to declare and grant, that such and so many persons (who lending mo-Shall be named therein, and of whose abilities and fitness hi$neyonbot-Majesty shall thereby declare himself to be well satisfied) andtomry» all and every such other person and persons as hereafter from time to time shall be duly admitted as members into their corporation, shall be one distin<ft and separate body politick and pprporate for the assurance of ships, goods and merchandizes

[Persons taking bills, bonds, &c. payable at a future day for goods delivered to such as become bankrupt, shall be admitted to prove their bills, &c. and be intitled to a proportionable part of the bankrupt's estate.]

[discounting such securities after the rate of 5l. per cent. for what they receive.]

deducting only thereout a rebate of interest, and discounting such securities payable at future times, after the rate of five pounds per centum per annum for what he shall so receive, to be computed from the actual payment thereof to the time such debt, duty or sum of money Should or would have become due and payable in and by such securities, as aforesaid.

[Bankrupt's shall be discharged of such securities.]

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all and every person or persons, who now are or shall become bankrupts, shall be discharged of and from all and every such bond, note, or other security, as aforesaid, and shall have the benefit of the several Statutes now in force against bankrupts, in like manner, to all intents and purposes, as if such sum of money had been due and payable before the time of his becoming a bankrupt.

[No such creditor shall join in suing forth a commission, till such debt become due.]

III. Provided always, and it is hereby declared. That no such creditor shall be deemed or taken to be a sufficient creditor, for or in respect of such debt, to petition or join in any petition for the obtaining or suing forth any commission of bankruptcy, until such time as such debt shall become actually due and payable.

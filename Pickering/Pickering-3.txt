ITEM, whereas in the time of the King’s noble progenitors. Ex edit Raft.

for the prosperity, profit, and wealth of the realm of England, Staple of Ca-and for the sustentation of the town of Calais, it hath been or- lais* dained by divers statutes and ordinances. That the staple should be wholly at the said town of Calais, and in none other place be-

?rond the sea, that is to fay. That all the wools, woolfels, leather, ead, and tin, and all other merchandises pafling out of the said realm, and out of the lands of Wales and Ireland, ought wholly to pass and repair to the said staple, and to none other place, upon pain of the forfeiture of the fame, except suchmerchandises, which in the said statutes and ordinances, be ex-prefled and exceped, as in the fame is more fully contained, the which statutes and ordinances, the ij. year of our sovereign lord *H.6. c.4* the King, that now is, were approved, affirmed, and ordained -duly to be executed. Neverthelefs as well under colour of exceptions in the said statutes, and ordinances contained, as by colour of licences granted by our sovereign lord the King to divers persons, a great quantity of wools, woolfels, leather, lead and tin, and many other merchandises have been continually from time to time, and yet be carried and and conveyed out of the realm, and of the said lands of Wales and Ireland, into Flandersj Holland,, Zealand, Brabant, and other parts, nqt resorting to the said staple, as they ought to do, wherefore our sovereign lord the King is defrauded of the customs and subsidies, which ought to amount to notable sums to his increase, if he thereof were duly answered and content: And moreover the King’s mint at Calais is like to be void, desolate, and destroyed, and the commodities also of the merchandises of the said realm, for the said causes, within (hort time to be greatly hindered, if remedy be not provided in this behalf: our sovereign lord the King considering the premisses, and willing in this case to provide a a remedy, of the advice and assent aforesaid, by the authority of the said parliament, hath ordained. That no person ship nordo to be (biped from henceforth no manner wools, woolfels, leather, lead, and tin, whole nor (hotten, nor the fame carry nor convey out of any parts of the; said realm, nor out of the lands of Wales nor Ireland, to none other parts beyond the sea, but only to the said staple of Calais, upon pain of forfeiture of the double value of the merchandise so carried or conveyed to any other parts than to the said staple of Calais, and also upon pain of imprisonment of his body for the space of two years, without bail or mainprife. And he which can spy any person from henceforth, which offending or doing in any wise contrary to this ordinance, and the fame offence do present to the treasurer of England for the time being, and the trefpaflbr thereof duly

And the presenter shall have for his labour the third part of the forfeiture of the merchan-difes carried or conveyed against this ordinance. Saving always that the merchants of  Genoa,Venice> , Florence,

and  Cataionia, may ship wools,  woolfels, leather, lead, and tin

in their {hips, gallies, carraks, and other vessels, and to bring the fame into their country towards the fVefl, in manner ac-cuftotned before this time. Saving alio to the burgesses of the Berwick. town of Berwick upon Tweed, the privileges and benefits to them before this time granted, as in divers natutes thereof made is folly contained, notwithstanding this ordinance.

First, That the ordinance and appointment of late made to the laid staple of Calais, upon wools, woolfels, and tin, be fiirely kept and observed in all these five points following, that is to fay. That the price of the said wools, woolfels, and tin, be not abated, but augmented and put to greater increase and advantage.

Item, That the whole payment be made in hand for the said wools, woolfels, arid tin, in gold and silver without subtilty or collufton.

That no mariner stranger nor other mariner, that is like-wife owner and matter of one ship or vessel, shall take nor receive within England^ fVales, nor Ireland, in his ship or vessel any manner of wools, woolfels, nor other merchandises of the staple, nor carry the fame out of the realm to any parts beyond the sea, but only to the staple of Calais^ except such which by the ordinance made, shall pass over the (freights of Marroky and that upon pain of forfeiture to the King of such ships and goods so found defective, as of the goods of the said mariners, being in the fame ships or vessels.

That certain persons continually, inhabiting in the town of Calais, with merchants aliens of their affinity and consent, for their singular lucre, do imagine by subtil means to diminilh the price of the commodities of this realm, which heretofore have been and yet be greatly used, in so much that when the merchants aliens ought to have repaired to the said town to buy wools and woolfels, they have been returned and withdrawn by the said inhabitants, so that the poor men have been let to fell their goods, and for great mischief they must of necessity fell their goods to the said inhabitants of Calais, which will not buy the fame but greatly within their price, to the great hurt and hinder-ance of the feliers, and abatement of the price of the laid commodities : the fame our sovereign lord the King, willing thereupon to provide remedy, for his profit and the avail of his realm, hath ordained by the said authority, That from henceforth no merchant continually inhabiting within the said town of Calais, shallbe suffered to buy beyond the sea, any manner of wools, woolfels, leather, lead, nor tin, nor other merchandise pertaining to the staple, upon pain of forfeiture of the fame, as often as it may be proved.

And , also for to avoid mureters, robberies, and adulteries that might by likelyhood happen, it is ordained. That no Huch person.

That

Satten-makers within the realm of England from that time forth, lould make no pattens nor clogs of timber called afp, upon pain to pay to the King C. s. for every default. And that every person, which would sue for the King should have the one naif of the pain so forfeit: so that the netchers throughout the realm, might fell their (hafts at more easy and reasonable price than they were wont to fell, as in the said statute more fully is contained. And though also that the said afp timber be the best and lighted timber, thereof to make pattens and dogs, mod easy for the wearing of all cstates, gentiles and other people, of any timber that groweth, and before the making of the said statute the said patten-makers were as free, and at as great liberty to buy all manner of afp timber, and thereof to make pattens and clogs, as they were at the same time, and at alf times have been, and yet be all manner people of the crafts and occupations of turners, carpenters* woodmongers, and cole-makers, which do occupy expend and waste yearly in their occupations a great quantity of all manner timber of afp, as well such afp timber as woula serve to make (hafts thereof, as that that would not serve for the fame, and no restraint is made for them or any of them to the contrary, and very much afp timber there is, which will in no wife serve the fletchers to make thereof lhafts, which is as sufficient able and convenient to be made in pattens and clogs, as is the remnant of the said timber to be made in (hafts : and the said patten-makers durst not occupy any part of the said timber, nor one nor other, for fear of forfeiture, of the said pain contained in the laid statute,

And that as often as any patten-maker, after the feast of Eajler%

which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1465. shall make

any pattens or clogs of such part of afp timber, that shall be

able and sufficient to be made in (hafts, shall forfeit for every

And hath sealed every piece thereof in the one end thereof, with the seal or mark especially to be or* dained for the fame, whereof the fame collectors have the one part: and the comptroller have the other part feveraUy in their custody. And if any such cloth of gold, of silver, bawdkin, velvet, damaflc, iatin, farcenet, tartaron, chamlet, and cloth of silk and of gold, be any time hereafter fet to sale not sealed, nor having such seal thereupon: that then he which setteth such merchandise to sale, shall forfeit the fame merchandise or the value thereof, whereof two parts shall be to the King, and the third part to the finder. Alio it is ordained by the fame authority, That the collectors of the fame subsidy and the (aid comptroller, shall at all times requisite, be ready to seal such merchandise: and to seal the fame at all times when they be required without delay, or taking any thing for the fame in any wise, upon pain of forfeiture to the owner thereof twenty shillings for every of the said collectors and comptrollers at any time that they refute to seal such merchandise after such request made, or take any thing for the sealing of any such merchandise. Alfo it is ordained by the authority aforesaid, That all manner of such cloths of gold, of silver, bawdkin, velvet, damaflc, fetin, farcenet, tartaron, chamlet, and every other cloth of silk, corse of gold and silk now being within this realm, and after the feast of Saint Michael the archangel next coming, offered to fell, shall be sealed with the said seals before the said feast, upon the pain before specified. Alfo whereas it is expressed in the said grant of the (aid subsidy, that if any concealment be found in the merchants in the payment of tne said duties. That they for such concealment shall pay only double subsidy without other pain or forfeiture therein, as in the same act is more fully contained.

The King confideringthatnotwithftanding the fame ordinance, merchants do not regard to defraud him of his duty of the fahi subsidy, in as much as they do nothing forfeit in that behalf, but only pay the double subsidy, by the advice assent and authority aforesaid hath ordained and eftabliftied. That the fame fta* tute in this behalf be void, and of no strength. And if any merchandises, which be to be brought to the parts beyond the sea, or to be carried out of this realm, whereof any subsidy is or shall be due or pertaining to the King, be hereafter (hipea to be carried beyond the sea, the collectors of the said subsidy not paid, or without agreement with the collectors of the said subsidy for the fame. That then the said merchandises or the value thereof, shall be forfeit to the King.

so packed cause to be carried by land from London and other places to other ports, as to Sandwich, Southampton and other pom, whereas the customers for the time being without due packing or fight of such cloths, upon the information of the merchants, do custom such cloths, as for coarse cloths, whereby the Kin^ is greatly deceived of his duties thereof, as well in the finefs of such cloths, as in the not knowing of the number of the cloths so packed. Therefore the King by the advice and afient afore-said, and by the fame authority doth ordain eftablifti and enact, That in every port within this realm of England, wherein any woolen cloths shall be packed after the first day of May next coming, in the presence of the collectors of the aforesaid customs | and subsidies, of the fame port for the time being, That all such customs and subsidies, due and pertaining to the King for the said cloths, shall be paid and contented to the fame collectors, where the said cloths be so paeked, or elfe sufficient surety shall be thereof to them found, before that the fame cloths be carried from the said port to any other port or place, upon pain of forfeiture of all the fame cloths, or the value thereof, to be had of the owner of the fame. And if any woolen cloths to be carried over the sea, be packed in any other manner, or under any o-therform, That then the collectors of the port where they befo packed or brought to be paeked, shall seise and there unpack all the said packs and fardels, and survey all the cloths therein, lb that our sovereign lord the King may be truly answered of his duty in this behalf, without any fraud or deceit. And if any cuftomcr or comptroller of any port or place be negligent or (lack in unpacking of the said cloths, or surveying of them in the form aforesaid. That then and as often every such cuftomcr and comptroller for every such default shall forfeit to our sovereign lord the King twenty shillings for every such cloth.

So always that the said aliens and Grangers be not evil entreated, nor otherwise charged by any manner ioaposition, other than the said Englijh goldsmiths be, shall be, and ought to be.

That the merchant strangers and aliens should fell their merchandises brought, within a quarter of a year after their coming into the feme, and that the money received in this realm should be employed upon the commodities of this land upon pain of forfeiture of the fame money. Contrary to which ordinance, the feme merchants and many other persons do convey and carry daily the fame money by them received out of the realm, to the great diminiihingof the fame money, and do not employ the fame in substance upon the commodities of this realm, whereby the King’s custom and subsidy Jbe greatly decayed.

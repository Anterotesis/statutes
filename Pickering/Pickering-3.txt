?rond the sea, that is to say. That all the wools, woolfels, leather, ead, and tin, and all other merchandises passing out of the said realm, and out of the lands of Wales and Ireland, ought wholly to pass and repair to the said staple, and to none other place, upon pain of the forfeiture of the same, except suchmerchandises, which in the said statutes and ordinances, be expressed and exceped, as in the same is more fully contained, the which statutes and ordinances, the ij. year of our sovereign lordH.6. c. 4* the King, that now is, were approved, affirmed, and ordained -duly to be executed. Nevertheless as well under colour of exceptions in the said statutes, and ordinances contained, as by colour of licences granted by our sovereign lord the King to divers persons, a great quantity of wools, woolfels, leather, lead and tin, and many other merchandises have been continually from time to time, and yet be carried and and conveyed out of the realm, and of the said lands of Wales and Ireland, into Flandersj Holland, Zealand, Brabant, and other parts, nqt resorting to the said staple, as they ought to do, wherefore our sovereign lord the King is defrauded of the customs and subsidies, which ought to amount to notable sums to his increase, if he thereof were duly answered and content: And moreover the King's mint at Calais is like to be void, desolate, and destroyed, and the commodities also of the merchandises of the said realm, for the said causes, within short time to be greatly hindered, if remedy be not provided in this behalf: our sovereign lord the King considering the premisses, and willing in this case to provide a a remedy, of the advice and assent aforesaid, by the authority of the said parliament, hath ordained. That no person ship nordo to be (biped from henceforth no manner wools, woolfels, leather, lead, and tin, whole nor (hotten, nor the same carry nor convey out of any parts of the; said realm, nor out of the lands of Wales nor Ireland, to none other parts beyond the sea, but only to the said staple of Calais, upon pain of forfeiture of the double value of the merchandise so carried or conveyed to any other parts than to the said staple of Calais, and also upon pain of imprisonment of his body for the space of two years, without bail or mainprise. And he which can spy any person from henceforth, which offending or doing in any wise contrary to this ordinance, and the same offence do present to the treasurer of England for the time being, and the trespassbr thereof duly

convi<ft, or if such trespassor confcfs before the treasurer and the baroos of the exchequer such trespasses by him done, That then he shall beconvid by his own confession. And the presenter shall have for his labour the third part of the forfeiture of the merchandises carried or conveyed against this ordinance. Saving always that the merchants of Genoa, Venice>, Florence,

and Cataionia, may ship wools, woolfels, leather, lead, and tin

in their {hips, gallies, carraks, and other vessels, and to bring the same into their country towards the West, in manner ac-custotned before this time.

And moreover in the said parliament, the said vj. day of March, a certain subsidy of wools and woolfels was granted to the King, that is to say, of every merchant denizen for the subsidy of every sack of wool xiiij. s. iiij. d. and of every CC. xl. woolfels xiiij. s. iiij. d. to have to him for term of his life natural, at the third day of April, as in the act of the grant thereof made in the same parliament more folly appeareth: wherefore the poor subjects merchants of the staple of Calais, shall be compelled after the said third day of Aprtl, to pay to the King of every sack of wool and of every CC. xl, woolfels X. s. more byway of subsidy than they have been accustomedto pay in any days of the reign of the said King: which charge being to them importable, is likely to be the Cause that they shall not be of power to buy or ship any great quantity of wools of this realm, to be had to the said staple, whereof shall ensue very excessive diminution and decrease of ?he price and value of wools and woolfels of this realm, and of the great annual revenues of the customs and subsidies, which should grow to the King of the shipping of such wools and woolfels, and to the abating of the payment of wages of the soldiers intending upon the safeguard of the town and marches of Calais, and also the poor growers of wools of this realm greatly impoverished.

Patten-makers may make pattens of such afp as is not fit for

Jhafts.

ITEM, The company of the mystery of patten-makers of the city of London, piteously complaining, shewed in the parliament, of the grievous hurt, loss and damage, which other persons in times past of the same occupation now dead, and they, long time have borne and sustained, and hereafter be likely to bear and sustain, by reason of a statute made in the time of Henry the Fifth, late king of England in deed and not of right, By authority of this parliament holden in the fourth year of his rtign, by which statute it was ordained and established. That

Satten-makers within the realm of England from that time forth, lould make no pattens nor clogs of timber called afp, upon pain to pay to the King C. s. for every default. And that every person, which would sue for the King should have the one naif of the pain so forfeit: so that the netchers throughout the realm, might fell their (hafts at more easy and reasonable price than they were wont to fell, as in the said statute more fully is contained. And though also that the said afp timber be the best and lighted timber, thereof to make pattens and dogs, most easy for the wearing of all estates, gentiles and other people, of any timber that groweth, and before the making of the said statute the said patten-makers were as free, and at as great liberty to buy all manner of afp timber, and thereof to make pattens and clogs, as they were at the same time, and at alf times have been, and yet be all manner people of the crafts and occupations of turners, carpenters* woodmongers, and cole-makers, which do occupy expend and waste yearly in their occupations a great quantity of all manner timber of afp, as well such afp timber as woula serve to make (hafts thereof, as that that would not serve for the same, and no restraint is made for them or any of them to the contrary, and very much afp timber there is, which will in no wife serve the fletchers to make thereof lhafts, which is as sufficient able and convenient to be made in pattens and clogs, as is the remnant of the said timber to be made in (hafts: and the said patten-makers durst not occupy any part of the said timber, nor one nor other, for fear of forfeiture, of the said pain contained in the said statute,

which is great damage to the said patten-makers, and none advantage to the said fletchers, and the common people throughout the realm thereby greatly diseased; Wherefore our sovereign lord the King, considering the premises, by the advice and assent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and at the request of the said commons, hath ordained that from henceforth at all times it shall be lawful to the patten-makers of this realm, to make pattens of such timber of afp, that is not apt, sufficient nor convenient to be made in (hafts, and that for the common wealth.

And that as often as any patten-maker, after the feast of Easter

which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1465. shall make any pattens or clogs of such part of afp timber, that shall be

able and sufficient to be made in (hafts, shall forfeit for every

time forty shillings, the one half thereof to the King, and the RePeal«d by

other half to him that will sue in this behalf. 1dC'*' c'2*'

Therefore our sovereign lord the King, by the aflept of the said lords spiritual and temporal, and the said commons in this parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, hath ordained established and pnacted, that from the feast of the nativity of Saint John Baptist next -coming, no merchant denizen or stranger shall set or fuller any cloth of gold, of silver, bawdkin, velvet, damalk, latin, tarta-

And hath sealed every piece thereof in the one end thereof, with the seal or mark especially to be or* dained for the same, whereof the same collectors have the one part: and the comptroller have the other part severally in their custody. And if any such cloth of gold, of silver, bawdkin, velvet, damaflc, iatin, farcenet, tartaron, chamlet, and cloth of silk and of gold, be any time hereafter set to sale not sealed, nor having such seal thereupon: that then he which setteth such merchandise to sale, shall forfeit the same merchandise or the value thereof, whereof two parts shall be to the King, and the third part to the finder.

Also whereas it is expressed in the said grant of the said subsidy, that if any concealment be found in the merchants in the payment of the said duties. That they for such concealment shall pay only double subsidy without other pain or forfeiture therein, as in the same act is more fully contained.

The King considering that notwithstanding the same ordinance, merchants do not regard to defraud him of his duty of the fahi subsidy, in as much as they do nothing forfeit in that behalf, but only pay the double subsidy, by the advice assent and authority aforesaid hath ordained and established. That the same fta* tute in this behalf be void, and of no strength. And if any merchandises, which be to be brought to the parts beyond the sea, or to be carried out of this realm, whereof any subsidy is or shall be due or pertaining to the King, be hereafter (hipea to be carried beyond the sea, the collectors of the said subsidy not paid, or without agreement with the collectors of the said subsidy for the same.

Therefore the King by the advice and afient aforesaid, and by the same authority doth ordain establish and enact, That in every port within this realm of England, wherein any woolen cloths shall be packed after the first day of May next coming, in the presence of the collectors of the aforesaid customs and subsidies, of the same port for the time being, That all such customs and subsidies, due and pertaining to the King for the said cloths, shall be paid and contented to the same collectors, where the said cloths be so paeked, or else sufficient surety shall be thereof to them found, before that the same cloths be carried from the said port to any other port or place, upon pain of forfeiture of all the same cloths, or the value thereof, to be had of the owner of the same. And if any woolen cloths to be carried over the sea, be packed in any other manner, or under any o-therform, That then the collectors of the port where they befo packed or brought to be paeked, shall seise and there unpack all the said packs and fardels, and survey all the cloths therein, lb that our sovereign lord the King may be truly answered of his duty in this behalf, without any fraud or deceit. And if any customer or comptroller of any port or place be negligent or (lack in unpacking of the said cloths, or surveying of them in the form aforesaid, That then and as often every such customer and comptroller for every such default shall forfeit to our sovereign lord the King twenty shillings for every such cloth. Moreover it is ordained by the advice and afient aforesaid, That every of the said collectors receiving any custom or subsidy for any of the said cloths or surety for the same, shall be thereof charged and chargeable to our sovereign lord the King upon his or their accompt.

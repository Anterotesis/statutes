And now cometh as much wools, or well nigh as much, to toe port of London, as do in all the other ftaples through the realm, and to fame of the other ftaples cometh as much of wools, as to two or three of the other ftaples, fo that to one ftaple cometh more, and to another lefts, fo that the mayor and conftables of fome places take too much, and in other places too little, and the people be very much charged to pay eight pence of a fack (as afore isfind) having regard to the ftum of the wools that pajjith over the fea. And all the time that the faid ftaple was abiding bey ond the fed, he that is cbofen mayor by the merchants of England, did take a certain by the sear. And alfo it were reafon that it Jhould be fo in England: and that in a reafonable manner, every man according to his travail, and that the people Jhould not be fo much charged: TVherefore it is ordained by the King and the great men, and by the advice of all the council.

That no more (hall be levied of a fack but four pence in no Fees for offi-part from the gule of Auguft laft paft hitherto, nor rrom hence- cm of the Forth. And that the four pence of the fack in every place where ftaple. the ftaple is, (hall be put in a box, and fealed witn the feals of the mayor and conftables, to the intent that the faid mayor and :onftables may be thereof paid of their certain, that they (hall take.

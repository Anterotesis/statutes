CAP. XXIX.

The ordinance of the several fees of the mayors and constables of the staple, in every city and town where the staple is ordained to be kept, and by what means the same shall be levied.

Forasmuch as the Jlaple is now oflatejordained to abide perpetually Exedit.RaftaL in England, and at the beginning the re was no evidence in certain, by which a man might assign- or limit in certain that, that the mayors and constables in the places, where the staples be oretained, ought to take by year in certain for their travail; but it was then assented by the lords and commons, That of every sack should be levied, eight pence for the first year, and delivered to the said mayor and constables in the places where the said staples be assigned, which fitft year pajfei out at the gule of August last past. And now cometh as much wools, or well nigh as much, to toe port of London, as do in all the other staples through the realm, and to same of the other staples cometh as much of wools, as to two or three of the other staples, so that to one staple cometh more, and to another lefts, so that the mayor and constables of some places take too much, and in other places too little, and the people be very much charged to pay eight pence of a sack (as afore isfind) having regard to the stum of the wools that pajjith over the sea. And all the time that the said staple was abiding bey ond the fed, he that is chosen mayor by the merchants of England, did take a certain by the sear. And also it were reason that it should be so in England: and that in a reasonable manner, every man according to his travail, and that the people should not be so much charged: TVherefore it is ordained by the King and the great men, and by the advice of all the council.

That no more shall be levied of a sack but four pence in no Fees for offi-part from the gule of August last past hitherto, nor rrom hence- cm of the Forth. And that the four pence of the sack in every place where staple. the staple is, shall be put in a box, and sealed with the seals of the mayor and constables, to the intent that the said mayor and: onstables may be thereof paid of their certain, that they shall take. And if at the end of the year, more be found in the box, than the fees of the said mayor and constables shall amount into, it shall be safely kept, to pay and perform the fees of the nayors and constables in other (taples, where the iHi. <L wiU lot thereto suffice. And if any thine remain in the said boxes, ifter the fees paid, the same sum residue shall be saved to the fommon profit of the merchants of the staple for the year to some, and for to pay for the weights made of new, and also or payments and other things necessary touching the staple.

\nd as much as is levied in all the places, where the staples be, rver die said sum of iiii. d. of the feck, after the said gule of fuguft last past, shall be rebailed and restored to the uses afone-Ud, And the fees of the mayor and constables be ordaiwedaxA

that the same person be at a certain day, comprised in the same writ, before the King's justices, there to answer to the plaintiff of his demand: and upon this writ returned by the said sheriff, that proclamation is made in the said form, if the said persons called, come not in proper person nor by attorney, judgement shall be given against them upon the principal for their default. And out of the same judgement execution shall be, made of their goods and lands, being out of the place privileged, as well that is to say, of those lands and goods so given by collusion, as of any other out of the same franchise, after that such collusion or fraud be duly found in the same manner as that ought to have been, if no devise had been thereof made, notwithstanding the same devise.

[Dy. 295. 23 Jac. 1. c. 28.]

But it is not the King's mind, that by virtue of this statute any man be barred of his suit against such debtors by the common course of the law, before this present statute used.

ITEM, Whereas the commons of the realm in this present parliament have shewed to our redoubted lord the King, grievously complaining,

[The remedy to recover presentments to benefices in the King's court, and the execution thereof is done by the bishop.]

That whereas the said our lord the King, and all his liege people, ought of right, and of old time were wont to sue in the King's court, to recover their presentments to churches, prebends, and other benefices of holy church, to the which they had right to present, the cognisance of plea, of which preferment belongeth only to the King's court of the old right of his crown, used and approved in the time of all his progenitors Kings of England;

(2) and when judgment shall be given in the same court upon such a plea and presentment, the archbishops, bishops, and other spiritual persons which have institution of such benefices

1392.] Anno decimo sexto RICHARDI II. 351

within their jurisdiction, be bound, and have made execution of such judgments by the King's commandments of all the time aforesaid without interruption (for another lay-person cannot make such execution) and also be bound of right to make execution of many other of the Kings commandments, of which right the crown of England hath been peaceably seised, as well in the time of our said lord the King that now is, as in the time of all his progenitors till this day:

[The pope awarded processes and sentences of excommunication against certain bishops for executing judgements given in the King's court.]

(3) but now of late divers processes be made by the bishop of Rome, and censures of excommunication upon certain bishops of England, because hey have made execution of such commandments, to the open dishersion of the said crown and destruction of our said lord the King, his law, and all his realm, if remedy be not provided.

[The pope's translation of prelates out of the realm, or from one spiritual living to another. 25 Ed. 3. stat. 6. de proves.]

(4) And also it is said, and a common clamour is made, that the said bishop of Rome hath ordained and purposed to translate some prelates of the same realm, some out of the realm, and some from one bishoprick into another within the same realm, without the King's assent and knowledge, and without the assent of the prelates, which so shall be translated, which prelates be much profitable and necessary to our said lord the King, and to all his realm;

(5) by which translations (if they should be suffered) the statutes of the realm should be defeated and made void; and his said liege sages of his council, without his assent, and against his will, carried away and gotten out of his realm, and the substance and treasure of the realm shall be carried away, and so the realm destitute as well of council as of substance, to the final destruction

352 Anno decimo sexto Richardi II. [1392.

of the same realm;

[The freedom of the crown of England, and that it is in subjection to no realm.]

(6) and so the crown of England, which hath been so free at all times, that it hath been in no earthly subjection, but immediately subject to God in all things touching the regalty of the same crown, and to none other, should be submitted to the pope, and the laws and statutes of the realm by him defeated and avoided at his will, in perpetual destruction of the sovereignty of the King our lord, his crown, his regalty, and of all his realm, which God defend.

[The promise of the commons to assist the King in defence of the liberties of his crown.]

II. And moreover, the commons aforesaid say, That the said things so attempted be clearly against the Kings crown and his regalty, used and approved of the time of all his progenitors; wherefore they and all the liege commons of the same realm will stand with our said lord the King, and his said crown and his regalty, in the cases aforesaid, and in all other cases attempted against him, his crown, and his regalty in all points, to live and to die.

(2) And moreover they pray the King, and him require by way of justice, that he would examine all the lords in the parliament, as well spiritual as temporal severally, and all the states of the parliament, how they think of the cases aforesaid, which be so openly against the King's crown, and in derogation of his regalty, and how they will stand the same cases with our lord the King, in upholding the rights of the said crown end regalty.

[The like promise of the lords temporal.]

(3) Whereupon the lords temporal sorting demanded, have answered every one by himself, that the cases aforesaid be clearly in derogation of the King's crown, and of his regalty, as it is well known, and hath been of a long time known, and that they will be with the same crown and regalty in these

1392.] Anno decimo sexto Richardi II. 353

cases specially. And in all other cases which shall be attempted against the same crown and regalty in all points with all their power.

(4) And moreover it was demanded of the lords spiritual there being, and the procurators of others being absent, their advice and will in all these cases; which lords, that is to say, the archbhops, bishops, and other prelates, being in the said parliament severally examined, making protestations, that it is not their mind to deny, nor affirm, that the bishop of Rome may not excommunicate bishops, nor that he may make translation of prelates after the law of holy church, answered and said, That if any executions of processes made in the Kings court as before be made by any, and censures of excommunications to be made against any bishops of England,

[The promise of the lords spiritual touching the commons petition.]

or any other of the King's liege people, for that they have made execution of such commandments; and that if any executions of such translations be made of any prelates of the same realm, which prelates be very profitable and necessary to our said lord the King, and to his said realm, or that the sage people of his council, without his assent, and against his will, be removed and carried out of the realm, so that the substance and treasure of the realm may be consumed, that the same is against the King and his crown, as it is contained in the petition before named.

[The promise of the procurators of the lords spiritual being absent.]

(5) And likewise the same procurators, every one by himself examined upon the said matters, have answered and said. in the name, and for their lords, as the said bishops have said and answered, and that the said lords spiritual will and ought to be with the King in these cases in lawfully maintaining of his crown,

Which questions and the answers of the same, as well before the King and the lords, as before the commons, were read and perceived, and it was demanded of all the states of the parliament, how they thought of the answers aforesaid, and they said.

That they thought, that the said justices made, and gave their answers auly and lawfully, as good and lawful liege people of the King ought to do. And in the same manner Sir Thomas, of Skelton learned in the law, and William Hankeford, and Wif- liam Brenchley, the King's serjeants demanded by the King of their advice in this behalf, laid that the answers were good and lawful. And that they would have given the same answers, if the jfaid questions had been demanded of them. And my lord William Thirning chief justice of the common bench, said that the declaration of treason not declared, belongeth to the parliament.

)But if he were a lord, or a peer of the parliament, if he had been demanded, he would have said in the same manner. And in like manner said my lord William Rikekyll, )\i{tice of the common place, and after the coming of my lord Walter Clopton, chief* justice, he said in likewise. Wherefore the said answers be judged and affirmed for good and sufficient in the said parliament.

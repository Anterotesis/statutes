[1 Leon. 292. 12 Co. 37, 40.]

ITEM, Whereas the commons of the realm in this present parliament have shewed to our redoubted lord the King, grievously complaining,

[The remedy to recover presentments to benefices in the King's court, and the execution thereof is done by the bishop.]

That whereas the said our lord the King, and all his liege people, ought of right, and of old time were wont to sue in the King's court, to recover their presentments to churches, prebends, and other benefices of holy church, to the which they had right to present, the cognisance of plea, of which preferment belongeth only to the King's court of the old right of his crown, used and approved in the time of all his progenitors Kings of England;

(2) and when judgment shall be given in the same court upon such a plea and presentment, the archbishops, bishops, and other spiritual persons which have institution of such benefices

1392.] Anno decimo sexto RICHARDI II. 351

within their jurisdiction, be bound, and have made execution of such judgments by the King's commandments of all the time aforesaid without interruption (for another lay-person cannot make such execution) and also be bound of right to make execution of many other of the Kings commandments, of which right the crown of England hath been peaceably seised, as well in the time of our said lord the King that now is, as in the time of all his progenitors till this day:

[The pope awarded processes and sentences of excommunication against certain bishops for executing judgements given in the King's court.]

(3) but now of late divers processes be made by the bishop of Rome, and censures of excommunication upon certain bishops of England, because hey have made execution of such commandments, to the open dishersion of the said crown and destruction of our said lord the King, his law, and all his realm, if remedy be not provided.

[The pope's translation of prelates out of the realm, or from one spiritual living to another. 25 Ed. 3. stat. 6. de proves.]

(4) And also it is said, and a common clamour is made, that the said bishop of Rome hath ordained and purposed to translate some prelates of the same realm, some out of the realm, and some from one bishoprick into another within the same realm, without the King's assent and knowledge, and without the assent of the prelates, which so shall be translated, which prelates be much profitable and necessary to our said lord the King, and to all his realm;

(5) by which translations (if they should be suffered) the statutes of the realm should be defeated and made void; and his said liege sages of his council, without his assent, and against his will, carried away and gotten out of his realm, and the substance and treasure of the realm shall be carried away, and so the realm destitute as well of council as of substance, to the final destruction

352 Anno decimo sexto Richardi II. [1392.

of the same realm;

[The freedom of the crown of England, and that it is in subjection to no realm.]

(6) and so the crown of England, which hath been so free at all times, that it hath been in no earthly subjection, but immediately subject to God in all things touching the regalty of the same crown, and to none other, should be submitted to the pope, and the laws and statutes of the realm by him defeated and avoided at his will, in perpetual destruction of the sovereignty of the King our lord, his crown, his regalty, and of all his realm, which God defend.

[The promise of the commons to assist the King in defence of the liberties of his crown.]

II. And moreover, the commons aforesaid say, That the said things so attempted be clearly against the Kings crown and his regalty, used and approved of the time of all his progenitors; wherefore they and all the liege commons of the same realm will stand with our said lord the King, and his said crown and his regalty, in the cases aforesaid, and in all other cases attempted against him, his crown, and his regalty in all points, to live and to die.

(2) And moreover they pray the King, and him require by way of justice, that he would examine all the lords in the parliament, as well spiritual as temporal severally, and all the states of the parliament, how they think of the cases aforesaid, which be so openly against the King's crown, and in derogation of his regalty, and how they will stand the same cases with our lord the King, in upholding the rights of the said crown end regalty.

[The like promise of the lords temporal.]

(3) Whereupon the lords temporal sorting demanded, have answered every one by himself, that the cases aforesaid be clearly in derogation of the King's crown, and of his regalty, as it is well known, and hath been of a long time known, and that they will be with the same crown and regalty in these

1392.] Anno decimo sexto Richardi II. 353

cases specially. And in all other cases which shall be attempted against the same crown and regalty in all points with all their power.

(4) And moreover it was demanded of the lords spiritual there being, and the procurators of others being absent, their advice and will in all these cases; which lords, that is to say, the archbhops, bishops, and other prelates, being in the said parliament severally examined, making protestations, that it is not their mind to deny, nor affirm, that the bishop of Rome may not excommunicate bishops, nor that he may make translation of prelates after the law of holy church, answered and said, That if any executions of processes made in the Kings court as before be made by any, and censures of excommunications to be made against any bishops of England,

[The promise of the lords spiritual touching the commons petition.]

or any other of the King's liege people, for that they have made execution of such commandments; and that if any executions of such translations be made of any prelates of the same realm, which prelates be very profitable and necessary to our said lord the King, and to his said realm, or that the sage people of his council, without his assent, and against his will, be removed and carried out of the realm, so that the substance and treasure of the realm may be consumed, that the same is against the King and his crown, as it is contained in the petition before named.

[The promise of the procurators of the lords spiritual being absent.]

(5) And likewise the same procurators, every one by himself examined upon the said matters, have answered and said. in the name, and for their lords, as the said bishops have said and answered, and that the said lords spiritual will and ought to be with the King in these cases in lawfully maintaining of his crown,

354. Anno decimo sexto RICHARDI II. [1392.

and in all other cases touching his crown and his regalty, as they be bound by their liegeance;

[Praemunire for purchasing of bulls or other instruments from Rome, or elsewhere. 27 Ed. 3. stat. 1. c. 1. 7 R. 2. c. 12.]

(6) whereupon our said lord the King, by the assent aforesaid, and at the request of his said commons, hath ordained and established, That if any purchase or pursue, or cause to be purchased or pursued in the court of Rome, or elsewhere, by any such translations, processes, and sentences of excommunications, bulls, instruments, or any other things whatsoever which touch the King, against him, his crown, and his regalty, or his realm, as is aforesaid, and they which bring within the realm, or them receive, or make thereof notification, or any other execution whatsoever within the same realm or without, that they, their notaries, procurators, maintainers, abettors, fautors, and counsellors, shall be put out of the King's protection,

(7) and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels, forfeit to our lord the King;

(8) and that they be attached by their bodies, if they may be found, and brought before the King and his council, there to answer to the cases aforesaid,

(9) or that process be made against them by Premunire facias, in manner as it is ordained in other statutes of provisors,

But our foverdgn lord the King, by advice of the said lords and commons, confident how the King for recovery and relief of his liege people, whicE were so judged or put out, and to make them to have restitution of their estates and lands, tenements, fees, advowsons, and other possessions aforesaid, hath had and supported great and exceffivt coils and expences, it seemeth to the King and to all the lords, that touching the said restitution it shall be a competent satisfaction to the said persons forejudged and put out, and to their heirs, tQhsvc restitution of their goods and chatels, or of the iflups and profits of the said lands and tenements taken in the mean time.

Ant that no protection be allowed in this case, nor no delay by nonage, nor restraint nor aidprayer, but by aidprayer of the King. And that the said keeper of the privy seal shall make thereof letters of Procedendo, without pursuing or speaking to the King* or other dejay, without doing walte or destruction in the mean time.

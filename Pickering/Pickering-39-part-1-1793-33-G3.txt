acted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That all sequestrations already awarded, or that Sequestrations shall at any time prior to the commencement of this adft be ^a[heredted awarded under the authority of the said two acts, or either of-acts to be fol-them, shall be carried on to a conclusion, and the estates thereby lowed out, uu-sequestrated shall be managed and divided in the manner, and less renewed according to the rules prescribed by the said acts, unless the court uncler this act', of session, upon cause shewn, shall order the sequestration to be renewed under this present ait, which shall commence from and immediately after the passing thereof.

II. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in all Act of Scot-actions and questions arising upon the construction and effect of Extended to an act of the parliament of Scotland, made in the year one thou- persons sand six hundred and ninety-six, chapter live, intituled, An aSl abroad, See. for declaring notour bankrupts, when the debtor is out of Scotland, or not liable to be imprisoned by reason of privilege, or personal protection, a charge of horning executed against him, together with either an arreftment of any of his effects not looted or discharged within fifteen days, or a poinding executed of any of his moveables, or a decree of adjudication of any part of his effate, for payment or security of debt, shall, when joined with insolvency, be sufficient proof of notour bankruptcy, and from and after the last step of such diligence, the said debtor, if insolvent, shall be holden and deemed a notour bankrupt; and every person, whether he be out of Scotland or not, whose effate shall be sequestrated under the authority of this present act, shall also be holden and deemed a notour bankrupt in all questions upon the said act of one thousand six hundred and ninety-six, from and after the date of the first deliverance on the petition to the court of session for awarding the sequestration.

III. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when Paripaflu pre-a debtor is made notour bankrupt in terms of the said act made -ference of ar-in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-six, as now ex- certTiTcafcs tended, all arreftments which shall have been used for attaching any effects of such bankrupt within sixty days prior to the bankruptcy, or within four calendar months thereafter, shall be ranked, pari pajfu, in the same manner as if such arreftments had been of the same date; and that in time coming, letters or precepts of arreftment bearing to be upon a depending action may be granted summarily, upon production of the libelled summons, and it shall be no objection to the pari pafjii preference hereby established, that the summons upon which any arreftment proceeds was not executed, or that the debt upon which it is founded was not liquidated at the date of the arreftment: providing always, That these and all other necessary steps are afterwards taken without any undue delay; and in case the first or any subsequent arrester shall in the meantime have obtained a decree of forthcoming or preference, and thereupon have recovered payment^ he shall nevertheless be accountable for the sum recovered

to those who, by virtue of this act, may be eventually found to have a pari pnffii preference thereon, and shall be liable to an action at their instance, for payment to them proportionally, after allowing out of the fund the expence of making it effectual; and further providing, that if there be any arreftments used for attaching the same effects after the period of four months subsequent to the bankruptcy, such arreftments shall not compete with those used prior to the period aforesaid, hut may rank with one another, according to the former law and practice.

IV. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That an ar-reftment executed at the market cross of Edinburgh, and pier and shore of Leith, to attach the effects of the debtor, as in the hands of a person out of Scotland, shall not be held to have inter-pelled such person from paying to the original creditor, unless proof be made that he or those having authority to act for him were previously in the knowledge of such arreftment having been so used.

V. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in future the messenger or other officer employed in executing a poinding for debt, shall leave in the hands of the debtor a schedule of the poinded goods, and note of the appraised values (one appraisement being in every case sufficient), and shall forthwith report his execution of poinding to the Sheriff, or other judge ordinary, who shall give directions for felling the goods poinded by publick roup, after such publication, and at such time and place as circumstances may require, any person who intromits with or carries off the goods in the meantime, in order to disappoint the poinding, being liable in double the appraised value thereof; and the net sum arising from the sale, after deduction of all charges, or the goods, in case no offerers appear, shall be delivered over to the poinding creditor, a note or minute of the transaction being kept by the clerk, to be made patent to all concerned, for a fee of one shilling.

VI And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when a person has been rendered notour bankrupt as aforesaid, no poinding of the moveables belonging to such bankrupt used within sixty days before the bankruptcy, or within four calendar months thereafter, shall give a preference to such poinder, but that every other creditor of the bankrupt, having liquidated grounds of debt, or decrees for payment, and summoning such poinder before the said four months are elapsed, shall be entitled to a proportional share of the price of the goods so poinded, effeiring to his debt, deducting always the expence of such poinding, together with ten per centum more on the said price or appraised value, which the poinder shall retain to account of his debt, in preference to the other creditors, the said debt being thereby so far diminished in the competition with them: and providing also, that all poindings after the four months shall have such preference as they were entitled to by former law and practice, saving always the landlord's right of hypothec for rents, or any other hypothec known in law* which shall be nowise hurt or

impaired by any thing contained in this act: and provided also, that in the case of a fequeflration under this act, the pan pajfu preference of arreftments and poindings shall be regulated as herein-after directed.

VII. And whereas an add of the parliament of Scotland, in the Acts of Scot-

year one thousand six hundred and eighty-one^ chapter seventeen, in- land of 1681 tituled, An act concerning the sale of bankrupt's lands, required [failed

certain forms of publication and citation, which in practice have*

been found to be expenfve and inconvenient; and another abt of the parliament of Scotland, in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-five, chapter fix, intituled, Act regulating the sale and payment of bankrupt's estate, made it lawful for purchasers of such

estates to consign the price after a certain time, in the hands of the magistrates and town council of Edinburgh, which method has been found inconvenient, and has fieldom been practised; and by an article in the regulations of the session established in the same year, one thousand six hundred and ninety-five, section twenty-six, it was provided, that the ranking of the creditors should proceed and be concluded by decree before the sale of the lands, which regulation has generally been prejudicial to the creditors; be it enacted, That the said in and repealed, part recited acts shall be, and the same are hereby in so far repealed; and the court of session {ball have full power to make Judicial sales acts of sederunt for abridging the forms of publication and cita- of elates, tion, and regulating the proceedings in processes of sale, ranking, and division, whether at the instance of creditors or of apparent heirs; and in every case of a sale under the authority of Purchasers the court of session, it shall be lawful to the purchaser at anyIesÂ°^the term of Whitsunday or Martinmas subsequent to the term of pay- bank, &c, ment of the price, to lodge the price, with the interest: due upon it, in the royal bank or bank of Scotland, at such interest: as can be procured for it, by doing which, and by giving notice thereof to the agent who carried on the sale, he shall be discharged of the said price; and further, the court of session, upon the application of any of the creditors, shall be impowered to make an order on the purchaser to lodge the price and interest: at any of the said terms, subsequent to the term of payment, in one or other of the said banks, fuf&cient intimation being always previously given both to the purchaser and to the common agent for the creditors, that such application is made, in order that all parties may have an opportunity to object; and in all cases of Sales may prejudicial sales, the lands or other heritable subjects may be brought cede ranking, to actual sale so soon as the necessary previous steps are taken, whether the ranking be concluded or not, unless the court, upon application of any party concerned, shall find sufficient cause to delay the sale.

VIII. And whereas doubts have arisen upon the corifirufiion of an act, made in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety, chapter twenty, intituled, Act anent the sale of bankrupt's lands, in so far as it requires that the common debtor be found bankrupt, and utterly

insolvent; be it enacted, That a judicial sale? at the instance of ^ofvenc0Â°ne^ creditors, may in all cases proceed where the interest of the debts cefTary^or U

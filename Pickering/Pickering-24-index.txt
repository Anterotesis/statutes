THE PREFACE

---

MANY things which are now accepted as antient common law, or the general custom of the realm, were undoubtedly, in their original, parliamentary constitutions, and are extant as such in the several collections of old laws: the, limitation of time of memory, according to legal lignification, being reduced by the Statute of Westminster the JirJi, to the beginning of the reign of King Richard I. so that whatever existed before that time was taken to be before time of memory, or without a known beginning, and what is since that time, is said, in a legal sense, to be within time of memory; it follows as a consequence in law, that all anterior Statutes, not pleadable as acts of parliament, but deriving their force from usage only, were naturally excluded the Statute book, which could not properly begin earlier than from the reign of King Richard I. The laws concerning aflifes and the forest, appear to have been improved under his reign, but those constitutions,

I fallen into disuse, or abrogated by others, and unwarranted by any authentic memorial of Statutes made in his life time, have not obtained the authority of acts of parliament} and the rather, as

THE PREFACE.

in the opinion of those times, subsequent laws, maHp on the same subject, and on confederation of former atts, were supposed to abrogate them, in all particulars varied or omitted; and accordingly, when the voice of the nation called upon Henry I. on his accession, for restitution of King Edward's laws, and the same was immediately granted by his charters, La regis Edwards voir: s reddo, -yet to preserve the laws relating to military tenures, was added, —— cum illis emenda-tionibus quibus earn pater meus emendavit. This charter was confirmed by King Stephen, and King Henry II. and moil likely by Richard I. but the violations of these charters, amongst other grievances of the times of King John, his absolute re-fufaj of the barons demands of a confirmation, and of redress, produced that confederacy, in consequence of which his charter was at length obtained at Runingmede: the copy of that charter and the charter of the forest, as contained in Mat. Paris, is observed to, differ from that in the Lambeth library, and in Di; . Wilkins's Anglo-Saxon laws, which was printed from the Red Book of the exchequer: this charter falls Short of the charter of Henry I; and yet is fuller than that we now have of Henry III. But though the charters of King John seem. to have been passed in a parliamentary way, yet it was in times of such con-fusion, that they were not deemed to have obtained a full settlement, till the time of King Henry III. when the Great Charters were enabled by a full and solemn parliament. That Prince afeended the throne in the tenth year of his agej and the firflfc year of his reign, King Johns charters, with occasional

aiterations, were confirmed in parliament; they were again confirmed in the second year of Henry III. and in a plea of the fifth of Henry III. the Great Charter is cited as a Statute. Fitzb. tit. Mortdaunc. 53. It was again confirmed in parliament, the eighth of Henry III. and in the ninth year of his reign, and about the nineteenth of his age, his charters were again foletnnly enacted in parliament, when the lords spiritual and temporal, knights* freeholders, and other subjects, gave the King a subsidy for his grant of those liberties.

The greatest authorities have condemned the councils by which that Prince, on his coming of age, caused the charters he had formerly granted, to be cancelled, as void by reason of his infancy, and being in ward, at the time of granting them; a pretence ineffectual to avoid laws confirmed in parliament, and which served only to lay the foundation of all his future troubles: nor could these charters be justly considered as extorting from the crown its lawful prerogative; for in effect they only restored to the people their antient laws, and it is a first principle, that the King in his royal and political character, especially in the highest act of royalty, that of assenting to laws, is nece-fiarily presumed to be above all compulsion or incapacity: these charters were again confirmed the twenty first of Henry III. the thirty eighth of'Henry III. and the forty ninth of Henry III. There seems greater weight in the objection, that the power of distraining the King, mentioned in King John's charter, and in that of the forty ninth of Henry III. implies a solecism in government, by

THE PREFACE.

creating imperium in imperio. But the voluntary confirmation in the fifty second year of Henry III. by the Statute of Marlebridg, Ch.V. after his son's victory over the earl of and his

party, at the battle of Evesham, destroys all pretence of constraint; besides confirmations in peaceable times, in the twenty fifth of Edward I. the twenty seventh of Edward I. the twenty eighth of Edward I. the twenty ninth of Edward I. the thirty fourth of Edward I. after the pope's absolu-tien of the King from all his former concessions; and repeated in above thirty atts of parliament: but the legal history of these chairters has been traced with so great accuracy and learning by Mr.

Jione in his introduction to the charters themselves, that nothing material can be added on that subject.

An inquiry into the origin and constitution of parliaments, particularly that of the house of commons; the different manner of passing bills, at different periods of time; how far Statutes paired in times of tumult, or by Kings whose title was deemed voidable, have the force of a law, has become a voluminous work, greatly exceeding the limits of a preface: but it may be affum-ed? that the concurrent consent of the three branches of the legislature, the King for the time being, the lords, and the commons, forms the supreme and absolute power of the state to make new laws, to alter, repeal, or enforce the old; and that without the concurrence of all those three parts, no such law can be made: but though many of the antient Statutes are variously penned, and fbmetimes as if the King alone had enacted

THE PREFACE.

them, yet if they are not so framed as to denote an exclusion of either of the other branches, and have been always allowed as acts of parliament, they shall be presumed to have passed originally by authority of parliament; before the time of Edward HI. they seldom had any preamble, or made any mention of either the lords or commons, though they appear, by writs of summons, to have been present: many Statutes, uniformly received as such, are extant only in antient books and memorials, and are not found of record in the Statute-roll; yet nevertheless have in all times had the reputation and authority of acts of parliament; for the courts take judicial notice of all general acts of parliament, within time of memory, which are not to be-tried by the record, but by the court, ex officio; though it is otherwise of particular or private acts of parliament.

Those in the time of I. seem as if

they were drawn up into the form of a law, in the first instance, and so assented to by the King and parliament j but from about the beginning of the reign of Edward III. they were not in the first instance drawn up in the form of acts of parliament, but in that of a petition, to which the King answered in those times, according to his pleasure, sometimes respiting the matter, sometimes alfenting to part only, sometimes absolutely, and sometimes with qualification; from these pe-titions, and the answer thereto, the act itself was drawn up, by advice of the judges and others of the King's council, and entered on the Statute-roll; and the tenor, affixed to proclamation, writs,

font to the ftieriffs of the fereral counties; in the second of Henry V. the commons exhibited a petition to the King for the purpose of asserting their right to have such acts drawn up conformably to their (en£b, without aiteration, and that they Should be engrafted before the end of parBament: and towards the end of the reign of Hairy VL the method was taken of introducing bills, in the first instance, in the form of an act of parliament, the ihdorfement thereon shewed their passing the several houses, and the royal afsent, which has ever since been given or denied, absolutely and entirely to the whole of all bills exhibited in parliament.

It wodld be equally tedious and useless in this place to enter into the detail of Statutes objetted to for want of full parliamentary authority; be-cause in many of them, it is apparent in the Statute itself, or in fbme other Statute where it is so declared, or the reader is referred to fomc authority where the matter is decided, as amongst other instances, in the ordinance of the twentieth of Edward I. Statute the second, commonly called Butler's, and the fifth of Richard II. Statute the second, cap. 5. the commons never aftenting, is pointed out in the marginal notes.

A critical revisal of Statutes could not be'brought within the compass of a preface, even supposing that the excellent observatiens on an-tient Statutes, by the honourable Mr.

had left any thing to be added by others on the ftibjett } the reader will there be enabled, according

THE PREFACE. vii

to a late noble writer's idea of a legislator, to' discover the spirit of those laws, to trace its progress from, the first rough sketches to the more perfect draughts > from the first causes or occasions that produced them, through all the consequences that they produced.

The reasons which induced other editors of the Statutes to adhere to the old transiation, were of too great weight to be departed from in the present edition, particularly the publick use fop ages, and actual recital of it in many subsequent acts of parliament: Some marginal corrections have been made, and also reference to some authorities that seemed to afford a commentary on the particular Statute: the inserting all the publick acts of parliament that were ever allowed as such, and in print, which was at first thought on, would have proved in experience, ufeless, and inconvenient; but many, though deemed antiquated, have been added in this edition, on account of either their publick or constitutional importance.

The editor humbly hopes that the publick will pardon the delay with which this work has been attended, he allures them that it was in no wife occasioned by negligence, but through unavoidable interruptions, and his great pains and labour to render the INDEX as full and accurate as it was in his power, for which purpose he has exerted his utmost endeavours, and relies on their known candour.

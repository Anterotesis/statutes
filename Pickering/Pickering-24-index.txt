THE PREFACE

MANY things which are now accepted as antient common law, or the general custom of the realm, were undoubtedly, in their original, parliamentary conftitutions, and are extant as fuch in the feveral collections of old laws: the , limitation of time of memory, according to legal lignification, being reduced by the ftatute of Wejlminfier the JirJi, to the beginning of the reign of King Richard I. fo that whatever exifted before that time was taken to be before time of memory, or without a known beginning, and what is fince that time, is faid, in a legal fenfe, to be within time of memory; it follows as a confequence in law, that all anterior ftatutes, not pleadable as afts of parliament, but deriving their force from ufage only, were naturally excluded the ftatute book, which could not properly begin earlier than from the reign of King Richard I. The laws concerning aflifes and the foreft, appear to have been improved under his reign *, but thofe conftitutions,

I	fallen into difufe, or abrogated by others, and unwarranted by any authentic memorial of ftatutes made in his life time, have not obtained the authority of afts of parliament} and the rather, as Vol. XXIV.	A	in

THE PREFACE.

in the opinion of thofe times, fubfequent laws, maHp on the fame fubjeft, and on confederation of former atts, were fuppofed to abrogate them, in all particulars varied or omitted; and accordingly, when the voice of the nation called upon Henry I. on his acceflion, for reftitution of King Edward’s laws, and the fame was immediately granted by his charters, La regis Edwards voir: s reddo,-yet to preferve the laws relating to military tenures, was added, —— cum illis emenda-tionibus quibus earn pater meus emendavit. This charter was confirmed by King Stephen, and King Henry II. and moil likely by Richard I. but the violations of thefe charters, amongft other grievances of the times of King John, his abfolute re-fufaj of the barons demands of a confirmation, and of redrefs, produced that confederacy, in con-fequence of which his charter was at length obtained at Runingmede: the copy of that charter and the charter of tfie foreft, as contained in Mat. Paris, is obferved to, differ from that in the Lambeth library, and in Di;. Wilkins's Anglo-Saxon laws, which was printed from the Red Book of the exchequer: this charter falls fhort of the charter of Henry I; and yet is fuller than that we now have of Henry III. But though the charters of King John feem. to have been paffed in a parliamentary way, yet it was in times of fuch con-fufion, that they were not deemed to have obtained a full fettlement, till the time of King Henry III. when the Great Charters were enabled by a full and folemn parliament. That Prince afeended the throne in the tenth year of his agej and the firflfc year of his reign, King Johns charters, with occasional

THE PREFACE.

alterations, were confirmed in parliament; they were again confirmed in the fecond year of Henry III. and in a plea of the fifth of Henry III. the Great Charter is cited as a ftatute. Fitzb. tit. Mortdaunc. 53. It was again confirmed in parliament, the eighth of Henry III. and in the ninth year of his reign, and about the nineteenth of bis age, his charters were again foletnnly enafted in parliament, when the lords fpiritual and temporal, knights* freeholders, and other fubjefts, gave the King a fubfidy for his grant of thole liberties.

The greateft authorities have condemned the councils by which that Prince, on his coming of age, caufed the charters he had formerly granted, to be cancelled, as void by reafon of his infancy, and being in ward, at the time of granting them; a pretence ineffeftual to avoid laws confirmed in parliament, and which ferved only to lay the foundation of all his future troubles : nor could thefe charters be juftly confidered as extorting from the crown its lawful prerogative; for in effect they only reftored to the people their antient laws, and it is a firft principle, that the King in his royal and political character, efpecially in the higheft aft of royalty, that of affenting to laws, is nece-fiarily prefumed to be above all compulfion or incapacity : thefe charters were again confirmed the twenty firft of Henry III. the thirty eighth of ' Henry III. and the forty ninth of Henry III. There feems greater weight in the objeftion, that the power of diftraining the King, mentioned in King John's charter, and in that of the forty ninth of Henry III. implies a folecifm in government, by

THE PREFACE.

creating imperium in imperio. But the voluntary confirmation in the fifty fecond year of Henry III. by the ftatute of Marlebridg, Ch.V. after his fon’s victory over the earl of	and his

party, at the battle of Evejham, deftroys all pretence of conftraint; befides confirmations in peaceable times, in the twenty fifth of Edward I. the twenty feventh of Edward I. the twenty eighth of Edward I. the twenty ninth of Edward I. the thirty fourth of Edward I. after the pope’s abfolu-tionof the King from all his former conceflions ; and repeated in above thirty atts of parliament: but the legal hiftory of thefe chairters has been traced with fo great accuracy and learning by Mr.

Jione in his introduction to the charters themfelves, that nothing material can be added on that fubjeCt.

An inquiry into the origin and conftitution of parliaments, particularly that of the houfe of commons; the different manner of paffing bills, at different periods of time; how far flatutes paired in times of tumult, or by Kings whofe title was deemed voidable, have the force of a law, has become a voluminous work, greatly exceeding the limits of a preface: but it may be affum-ed? that the concurrent confent of the three branches of the legiflature, the King for the time being, the lords, and the commons, forms the fupreme and abfolute power of the ftate to make new laws, to alter, repeal, or enforce the old; and that without the concurrence of all thofe three parts, no fuch law can be made: but though many of the antient flatutes are varioufly penned, and fbmetimes as if the King alone had enaCled

THE PREFACE.

them, yet if they are not fo framed as to denote an exclufion of either of the other branches, and have been always allowed as a£ts of parliament, they shall be prefumed to have palled originally by authority of parliament; before the time of Edward HI. they feldom had any preamble, or made any mention of either the lords or commons, though they appear, by writs of fummons, to have been prefent: many ftatutes, uniformly received as fuch, are extant only in antient books and memorials, and are not found of record in the ftatute-roll; yet neverthelefs have in all times had the reputation and authority of afts of parliament; fpr the courts take judicial notice of all general afts of parliament, within time of memory, which are not to be-tried by the record, but by the court, ex officio; though it is otherwife of particular or private a&s of parliament.

Those in the time of	I.	feem as if

they were drawn up into the form of a law, in the firft inftance, and fo alfented to by the King and parliament j but from about the beginning of the reign of Edward III. they were not in the firft inftance drawn up in the form of a&s of parliament, but in that of a petition, to which the King anfwered in thofe times, according to his pleafure, fometimes refpiting the matter, fome-times alfenting to part only, fometimes abfolutely, and fometimes with qualification; from thefe pe- * titions, and the anfwer thereto, the a<5t itfelf was drawn up, by advice of the judges and others of the King’s council, and entered on the ftatute-roll; and the tenor, affixed to proclamation, writs,

font to the ftieriffs of the fereral counties; in the fecond of Henry V. the commons exhibited a petition to the King for the purpofe of aflerting their right to have fuch afts drawn up conformably to their (en£b, without alteration, and that they ihould be engrafted before the end of parBament: and towards the end of the reign of Hairy VL the method was taken of introducing bills, in the firft inftance, in the form of an aft of parliament, the ihdorfement thereon fhewed their pafiing the feveral houfes, and the royal affent, which has ever fince been given or denied, abfolutely and entirely to the whole of all bills exhibited in parliament.

It wodld be equally tedious and ufelefs in this place to enter into the detail of ftatutes objetted to for want of full parliamentary authority ; be-caufe in many of them, it is apparent in the fta-tute itfelf, or in fbme other ftatute where it is fo declared, or the reader is referred to fomc authority where the matter is decided, as amongft other inftances, in the ordinance of the twentieth of Edward I. ftatute the fecond, commonly called Butler’s, and the fifth of Richard II. ftatute the fecond, cap. 5. the commons never aftenting, is pointed out in the marginal notes.

A critical revifal of ftatutes could not be ' brought within the compafs of a preface, even fuppofing that the excellent obfervatiens on an-tient ftatutes, by the honourable Mr.	,

had left any thing to be added by others on the ftibjett } the reader will there be enabled, according

THE PREFACE. vii

ing to a late noble writer’s idea of a legiflator, to' difcover the fpirit of thofe laws, to trace its pro-grefs from, the firft rough fketches to the more perfect draughts > from the firft caufes or occafions that produced them, through all the confequences that they produced.

The reafons which induced other editors of the ftatutes to adhere to the old tranfiation, were of too great weight to be departed from in the prefent edition, particularly the publick ufe fop ages, and adtual recital of it in many fubfequent a£ts of parliament: Some marginal corrections have been made, and alfo reference to fome authorities that feemed to afford a commentary on the particular ftatute: the inferting all the publick aCts of parliament that were ever allowed as fuch, and in print, which was at firft thought on, would have proved in experience, ufelefs, and inconvenient; but many, though deemed antiquated, have been added in this edition, on account of either their publick or conftitutional importance.

The editor humbly hopes that the publick will pardon the delay with which this work has been attended, he allures them that it was in no wife occafioned by negligence, but through unavoidable interruptions, and his great pains and labour to render the INDEX as full and accurate as it was in his power, for which purpofe he has exerted his utmoft endeavours, and relies on their known candour.

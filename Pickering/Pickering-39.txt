to those who, by virtue of this act, may be eventually found to have a pari pnffii preference thereon, and shall be liable to an action at their instance, for payment to them proportionally, after allowing out of the fund the expence of making it effectual; and further providing, that if there be any arreftments used for attaching the same effects after the period of four months subsequent to the bankruptcy, such arreftments shall not compete with those used prior to the period aforesaid, hut may rank with one another, according to the former law and practice.

IV. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That an ar-reftment executed at the market cross of Edinburgh, and pier and shore of Leith, to attach the effects of the debtor, as in the hands of a person out of Scotland, shall not be held to have inter-pelled such person from paying to the original creditor, unless proof be made that he or those having authority to act for him were previously in the knowledge of such arreftment having been so used.

V. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in future the messenger or other officer employed in executing a poinding for debt, shall leave in the hands of the debtor a schedule of the poinded goods, and note of the appraised values (one ap-praifement being in every case sufficient), and shall forthwith report his execution of poinding to the Sheriff, or other judge ordinary, who shall give directions for felling the goods poinded by publick roup, after such publication, and at such time and place as circumstances may require, any person who intromits with or carries off the goods in the meantime, in order to difap-point the poinding, being liable in double the appraised value thereof; and the net sum arising from the sale, after deduction of all charges, or the goods, in case no offerers appear, shall be delivered over to the poinding creditor, a note or minute of the transaction being kept by the clerk, to be made patent to all concerned, for a fee of one shilling.

VII. And whereas an add of the parliament of Scotland, in the AftsofScot-

year one thousand six hundred and eighty-one^ chapter seventeen, in- land of 1681 tituled, An act concerning the sale of bankrupt's lands, required [failed

certain forms of publication and citation, which in practice have**

been found to be expenfve and inconvenient; and another abt of the parliament 0/* Scotland, in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-five, chapter fix, intituled. Act regulating the sale and payment of bankrupt's estate, made it lawful for purchasers of such

estates to consign the price after a certain time, in the hands of the magistrates and town council of Edinburgh, which method has been found inconvenient, and has fieldom been practised; and by an article in the regulations of the session established in the same year, one thousand six hundred and ninety-five, section twenty-six, it was provided, that the ranking of the creditors should proceed and be concluded by decree before the sale of the lands, which regulation has generally been prejudicial to the creditors; be it enacted, That the said in and repealed, part recited acts shall be, and the same are hereby in so far repealed; and the court of session {ball have full power to make Judicial sales acts of sederunt for abridging the forms of publication and cita- of elates, tion, and regulating the proceedings in processes of sale, ranking, and division, whether at the instance of creditors or of apparent heirs; and in every case of a sale under the authority of Purchasers the court of session, it shall be lawful to the purchaser at anyIesÂ°^the term of Whitsunday or Martinmas subsequent to the term of pay- bank, &c, ment of the price, to lodge the price, with the interest: due upon it, in the royal bank or bank of Scotland, at such interest: as can be procured for it, by doing which, and by giving notice thereof to the agent who carried on the sale, he shall be discharged of the said price; and further, the court of session, upon the application of any of the creditors, shall be impowered to make an order on the purchaser to lodge the price and interest: at any of the said terms, subsequent to the term of payment, in one or other of the said banks, fuf&cient intimation being always pre-viously given both to the purchaser and to the common agent for the creditors, that such application is made, in order that all parties may have an opportunity to object; and in all cases of Sales may prejudicial sales, the lands or other heritable subjects may be brought cede ranking, to actual sale so soon as the necessary previous steps are taken, whether the ranking be concluded or not, unless the court, upon application of any party concerned, shall find sufficient cause to delay the sale.

VIII. And whereas doubts have arisen upon the corifirufiion of an act, made in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety, chapter twenty, intituled. Act anent the sale of bankrupt's lands, in so far as it requires that the common debtor be found bankrupt, and utterly

insolvent; be it enacted, That a judicial fale? at the instance of ^ofvenc0Â°ne^ creditors, may in all cases proceed where the interest of the debts cefTary^or U<>

and the other annual burdens exceed the yearly income of the subjecfts under sale^ or where a sequestration shall have taken place under this or any former statute, without other proof of bankruptcy or insolvency.

IX. And whereas by an act of the parliament ^Scotland, in the year one thousand five hundred and forty, chapter one hundred and six, concerning charges to enter heir, and another act in the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-one, chapter Huenty-seven, concerning apprf/ings against heirs, it was oretained, that charges against heirs unentered, which were to be the foundation of apprifmg against their predecessors lands, might proceed at the injlance of creditors commanding them to enter within forty days after the charge, but it has been doubted whether the same or a longer term is required zuhen the person charged is out a/'Scotland, and it is inexpedient that such Inducing should be of long duration; be it enacted by the authority

Adjudications aforesaid, That the Induct& of a charge to enter heir shall in no on charges to case exceed forty days, whether the person charged be within enter heir. the kingdom or out of it, and that after one such charge, wbe-* ther general or special, has been given at the- instance of any creditor, every subsequent charge, at the instance of the same* or of any other creditor, may be upon the Inducia of twenty days only; any law or practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

X. And, in order to lejfen the nu?nber of adjudications for debt, and consequently the expence to all parties, and to facilitate the pari paflu preference of creditors in Jimilar circumstances; be it enacted.

Different ere- That the lord ordinary officiating in the court of session, before

ditors maybe ^hom the first process of adjudication against any estate, for bay-^ toineci in one*j c % ^*j

adjudication. ment or security of debt is calied, shall ordain intimation thereof

to be made in the minute book, and on the wall, in order that any other creditors of the common debtor, who at the next calling of the cause can shew, that although they have not executed their summonses of adjudication, they are in other respects by the nature of their grounds .of debt, and steps taken by them, in condition to proceed in adjudging their debtor's estate, may produce the instrudfions of their debts, with summonses of adjudication, libelled and figneted, for the purpose of their being conjoined in the decree of adjudication, twenty sederunt days being allowed for such intimation, before the cause can be called a second time; and if any of these forms shall happen to be omitted, the said adjudication shall be null and void, without prejudice to the validity and order of ranking of posterior adjudications, ac-Agent or fac- cording to the rules of law; and further, that when the estate of for may ad- a debtor is brought into the court of session by a process of ju- ciitor^Tnffin* ^cia^ an^ ranking, and where no sequestration under this a1 judicia?a^> as herein-after mentioned, shall have taken place, the court shall have power, by regulations, to establish a mode of adjudging, in name of the common agent or faeftor, once or oftener, as occasion may require, for behoof of the creditors whose grounds of debt or interest are produced, and in the mean time to flop, adjudications at the inftan.ee of individual creditors, unless the same be necessary in order to come within yeajr and day of the

first:

1793.] Anno regni tricesimo tertio Georgii III. c. 74. 315

first effectual adjudication, or be found proper on any other account, it being always understood that the whole creditors conjoined in the same decree of adjudication shall be pari pa[fu, with one another, and that each creditor shall have the same benefit thereby as if he had adjudged for himseif; and it shall be lawful for him to extract that part of the decree which concerns his own debt, upon payment of the ordinary dues, without any ne-cefiity of extracting the whole.

XL And, in order to fix more clearly in time coming what diligence is necessary to make an adjudication effectual; be it enacted,

That the presenting a signature in exchequer, when the holding What dili-is of the crown, or the executing a general charge of horning Â°t

against superiors, at the market cross of Edinburgh, and pier and eff^ua] adju-fhore of Leith, when the holding is of a subject, and recording dications, an abstract of the said signature or the said charge in the register of abbreviates of adjudications, shall be held in all time coming as the proper diligence for the purpose aforesaid.

XII. And whereas by an act of the parliament Scotland in the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-six, chapter five, intituled,

Act for declaring notour bankrupts, it is inter alia declared. That any dispositions or other rights that shall be granted for hereafter for relief or security of debts to be contracted for the future, shall be of no force as to any such debts that shall be found to be contracted after the feifine or infeftment following on the find disposition or rights: and whereas cash accounts or credits granted by banks or bankers were not at that time in use, but have since proved very beneficial to commerce: and whereas it vjoidd tend not only to the further benefit of commerce, but aljo of agriculture and manufactures, if part of the before-recited act were repealed, Jo far as to make it lawful for persons possessed of lands and other heritable property to grant security thereon by infeftment for the payment of cash accounts or credits to be granted to them: therefore be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for any person or persons Part of the act possessed of lands, or other heritable subjects, . and deiiring to andl/curities* pledge the same in security of cash accounts or credits, to grant for ca(]1 ac. Securities upon their said lands or other heritable eslate, con- counts or taining procuratory of resignation and precept of feifine for in- credits may be fefting any bank or bankers, or other persons, who shall agree g^d-to give them such cash accounts or credits, provided the principal and interest, which may become due upon the said cash accounts or credits, shall be limited to a certain definite sum, to be fpeci-fied in the security: and it is hereby declared, That it shall and may be lawful to the person to whom the said cash account or credit is granted, to operate upon the same, by drawing out and paying in such sums from time to time as the parties shall settle between themselves, and that the feifines or infeftments taken upon the said heritable securities shall be equally valid and effectual as if the whole sums advanced upon the said credit had been paid prior to the date of the fafme or infeftment taken thereon, and that any such heritable security shall remain and subsist to the

extent of the sum limited.

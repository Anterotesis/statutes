[Oath.]

'I A.B. upon my corporal oath, in the presence of Almighty God, do solemnly swear, profess, and declare, That all and every person and persons whose name or names is or are inserted and contained in the list, by me now delivered in and subscribed, now are really and truly prisoners in my actual custody, in the prison of ___ and have, to the best of my knowledge and belief, continually so been ever since the respective days and times of their being committed to my custody, in such list mentioned;

1805.] Anno regni quadragesimo quinto Georgii III. c. 3. 547

and that it appears by the several returns and affidavits of the several gaoler or gaolers, keeper or keepers of prisons, in whose custody the said several persons have been previous to their being committed to my custody, and which several returns and affidavits are true to the best of my knowledge and belief, that they were really and truly prisoners in actual custody on the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and four, and have ever afterwards continued so to be until and at the respective days and times of their being committed to my custody, as in such list are mentioned.

So help me GOD.

Which said oath, and the words thereof, lists, and copies of lists, shall be entered, kept, and dealt with, in manner in the said act directed respecting the oath, lists, and copies of lists, therein mentioned.

[Indemnity for the discharge of prisoners in certain cases under recited act.]

1805.] Anno regni quadragesimo quinto Georgii III. c. 3. 547

and that it appears by the several returns and affidavits of the several gaoler or gaolers, keeper or keepers of prisons, in whose custody the said several persons have been previous to their being committed to my custody, and which several returns and affidavits are true to the best of my knowledge and belief, that they were really and truly prisoners in actual custody on the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and four, and have ever afterwards continued so to be until and at the respective days and times of their being committed to my custody, as in such list are mentioned.

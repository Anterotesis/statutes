[1 Lev. 296. 2 Keb. 686.]

At the parliament begun and holden at Westminster the eighth day of May, Anno Dom. one thousand six hundred and sixty-one, in the thirteenth year of the reign of our most gracious sovereign lord Charles the Second, by the grace of God, of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, King, defender of the faith, &c. And there continued until Tuesday the thirtieth of July one thousand six hundred sixty-one: and from that day the said parliament was adjourned unto the twentieth of November then next following: to the high pleasure of Almighty God, and to the weal publick of this realm, were enabled as followeth.

CAP. I.

An act for safety and preservation of his Majesty's person and government against treasonable and seditious practices and attempts.

[The grounds and inducements of this act.]

THE lords and commons assembled in parliament deeply weighing and considering the miseries and calamities of well nigh twenty years, before your Majesties happy return, and withal, reflecting upon the causes and occasions of so great and deplorable confusions, do in all humility and thankfulness acknowledge your Majesties incomparable grace and goodness to your people, in your free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion, by which your Majesty hath been pleased to deliver your subjects, not only from the punishment, but also from the reproach of their former miscarriages, which unexampled piety and clemency of your Majesty hath enflamed the hearts of us your subjects with an ardent desire to express all possible zeal and duty in the care and preservation of your Majesties person

2 Anno decimo tertio Caroli II. c.i.

[1661.

(in whose honour and happiness consists the good and welfare of your people) and in preventing (as much as may be) all treasonable and seditious practices and attempts for the time to come:

[Seditious sermons, pamphlets and speeches.]

(2) and because the growth and increase of the late troubles and disorders, did in a very great measure proceed from a multitude of seditious sermones, pamphlets and speeches, daily preached, printed and published, with a transcendent boldness, defaming the person and government of your Majesty and your royal father, wherein men were too much encouraged, and (above all) from a wilful mistake of the supream and lawful authority, whilst men were forward to cry up and maintain those orders and ordinances, oaths and covenants, to be acts legal and warrentable, which in themselves had not the least colour of law or justice to support them; from which kind of distempers, as the present age is not wholly freed, so posterity may be apt to relapse into them, if a timely remedy be not provided:

(3) we therefore the lords and commons in parliament assembled, having duly considered the premisses,

[13 Eliz. c. 1.]

and remembring that in the thirteenth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth of ever blessed memory, a right good and profitable law was made for preservation of her Majesties person, do most humbly beseech your most excellent Majesty, that it may be enacted,

[What shall be adjudged treason during the life of the King.]

(4) and enacted by the Kings most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That if any person or persons whatsoever, after the four and twentieth day of June, in the year of our Lord, one thousand six hundred sixty and one, during the natural life of our most gracious sovereign lord the King, (whom Almighty God preserve and bless with a long and prosperous reign) shall within the realm, or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend death or definition, or any bodily harm tending to death or definition, maim or wounding, imprisonment or restraint of the person of the same our sovereign lord the King,

(5) or to deprive or depose him from the stile, honour, or kingly name of the imperial crown of this realm, or of any other of his Majesties dominions or countries,

(6) or to levy war against his Majesty within this realm, or without,

(7) or to move, or stir any foreigner or strangers with force to invade this realm, or any other his Majesties dominions or countries, being under his Majesties obeisance:

[Being declared and proved by two witnesses.]

(8) and such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices or intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter or declare, by any printing, writing, preaching, or malicious and advised speaking, being legally convicted thereof upon the oaths of two lawful and credible witnesses, upon trial,

[Convicted by due course of law.]

or otherwise convicted or attainted by due course of law, then every such person and persons so as aforesaid, offending, shall be deemed, declared and adjudged to be traitors and shall suffer pains of death, and also lose and forfeit as in cases of high treason.

[Offences (during his Majesty's life) which disable persons to bear any office.]

II. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons at any time after the four and twentieth day of June, in the year of our Lord, one thousand

1661.] Anno decimo tertio Caroli II. c. 1. 3

six hundred sixty and one, during his Majesties life, shall maliciously and advisedly publish or affirm the King to be an heretick or a papist, or that he endeavours to introduce popery,

(2) or shall maliciously and advisedly, by writing, printing, preaching, or other speaking, express, publish, utter or declare any words, sentences, or other thing or things, to incite or stir up the people to hatred or dislike of the person of his Majesty, or the established government,

(3) then every such person and persons, being thereof legally convicted, shall be disabled to have or enjoy, and is hereby disabled and made incapable of having, holding, enjoying, or exercising any place, office, or promotion ecclesiastical, civil or military, or any other imployment in church or state,

[Peerage.]

other than that of his peerage, and shall likewise be liable to such further and other punishments as by the common laws or statutes of this realm may be inflicted in such cases:

[16 Car. c. 7. The parliament begun 3 of Nov. 1640 not in being. 12 Car. 2. c. 11.]

(4) and to the end that no man hereafter may be misled into any seditious or unquiet demeanor, out of an opinion that the parliament begun and held at Westminster upon the third day of November, in the year of our Lord, one thousand six hundred and forty, is yet in being, which is undoubtedly dissolved and determined, and so is hereby declared and adjudged to be fully dissolved and determined;

(5) or out of an opinion that there lies any obligation upon him from any oath covenant or engagement whatsoever, to endeavour a change of government, either in church or state;

[No legislative power in either or both houses of parliament without the King.]

(6) or out of an opinion, that both houses of parliament, or either of them, have a legislative power without the King,

(7) all which assertions have been seditiously maintained in some pamphlets lately printed, and are daily promoted by the active enemies of our peace and happiness:

III. Be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons at any time after the four and twentieth day of June, in the year of our Lord, one thousand six hundred sixty and one, shall maliciously and advisedly, by writing, printing, preaching, or other speaking, express, publish, utter, declare or affirm, That the parliament begun at Westminster upon the third day of November, in the year of our Lord, one thousand six hundred and forty, is not yet dissolved, or is not determined, or that it ought to be in being, or hath yet any continuance or existence,

(2) or that there lies any obligation upon him, or any other person, from any oath, covenant or engagement whatsoever, to endeavour a change of government, either in church or state,

(3) or that both houses of parliament or either house of parliament, have, or hath a legislative power without the King, or any other words to the same effect;

[Premunire.]

(4) that then every such person and persons so as aforesaid offending, shall incur the danger and penalty of a premunire mentioned in a statute made in the sixteenth year of the reign of King Richard the Second:

[The solemn league and covenant unlawful and illegally imposed.]

(5) and it is hereby also declared, That the oath usually called the Solemn League and Covenant, was in itself an unlawful oath, and imputed upon the subjects of this

4 Anno decimo tertio Caroli II. c. i.

[1661.

realm against the fundamental laws and liberties of this kingdom,

[Certain orders and ordinances of both or either houses of parliament declared void.]

(6) and that all orders and ordinances, or pretended orders and ordinances, of both or either houses of parliament, for imposing of oaths, covenants or engagements, levying of taxes, or raising of forces and arms, to which the royal assent, either in person or by commission, was not expresly had or given, were in the first creation and making, and still are, and so shall be taken to be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

[Proviso, the said orders &c. may be made use of according to the act of indemnity, 12 Car. 2. c. 11.]

(7) Provided nevertheless, That all and every person and persons, bodies politick and corporate, who have been, or shall at any time hereafter be questioned for any thing acted or done by colour of any the orders or ordinances herein before mentioned and declared to be null and void, and are indempnified by an act intituled, An act of free and general pardon, indempnity and oblivion, made in the twelfth year of his Majesty's reign that now is, or shall be indempnified by any act of parliament, shall and may make such use of the said orders and ordinances for their indempnity according to the true intent and meaning of the said act, and no other, as he or they might have done if this act had not been made; any thing in this act contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

CAP. XII.

An act for the better relief of the poor of this kingdom.

[The occasion of increase of poor.]

WHEREAS the necessity, number, and continual increase of the poor, not only within the cities of London and Westminster, with the liberties of each of them, but also through the whole kingdom of England and dominion of Wales, is very great and exceeding burthensome, being occasioned by reason of some defects in the law concerning the settling of the poor, and for want of a due provision of the regulations of relief and employment in such parishes or places where they are legally settled, which doth enforce many to turn incorrigible rogues, and others to perish for want, together with the neglect of the faithful execution of such laws and statutes as have formerly been made for the apprehending of rogues and vagabonds, and for the good of the poor

(2) for remedy whereof, and for the preventing the perishing of any of the poor, whether young or old, for want of such supplies as are necessary, may it please your most excellent majesty, that it may be enacted;

(3) and be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[Poor people going from one parish to another.]

that whereas by reason of some defects in the law, poor people are not restrained from going from one parish to another, and therefore do endeavour to settle themselves in those parishes where there is the best stock, the largest commons or wastes to build cottages, and the most woods for them to burn and destroy; and when they have consumed it, then to another parish, and at last become rogues and vagabonds, to the great discouragement of parishes to provide stocks, where it is liable to be devoured by strangers;

[How to be settled, coming to any tenement under ten pounds yearly value.]

(4) be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful, upon complaint made by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of any parish, to any justice of peace, within forty days after any such person or persons coming so to settle as aforesaid, in any tenement under the yearly value of ten pounds, for any two justices of the peace, whereof one to be of

the quorum,

[Altered and explained by 1 Jac. 2. C. 17. s. 3. 3 & 4 W. & M. c. 11 s. 3.]

of the division where any person or persons that are likely to be chargeable to the parish shall come to inhabit, by their warrant to remove and convey such person or persons to such parish where he or they were last legally settled, either as a native, housholder, sojourner, apprentice or servant, for the space of forty days at the least, unless he or they give sufficient security for the discharge of the said parish, to be allowed by the said justices.

[Persons grieved may appeal to the quarter sessions.]

II. Provided always, That all such persons who think themselves aggrieved by any such judgment of the said two justices, may appeal to the justices of the peace of the said county at their next quarter-sessions, who are hereby required to do them justice according to the merits of their cause.

Provided also, that (this act notwithstanding) it shall and may be lawful for any person or persons, to go into any county, parish or place, to work in time of harvest, or at any time to work at any other work, so that he or they carry with him or them a certificate from the minister of the parish and one of the churchwardens and one of the overseers for the poor for the said year, that he or they have a dwelling-house or place in which he or they inhabit, and hath lest wise and children, or some of them there, (or otherwise as the condition of the persons shall require) and is declared an inhabitant of inhabitants there:

(2) and in such case, if the person or persons shall not return to the place aforesaid, when his or their work is finished, or shall fall sick or impotent whilst he or they are in the said work, it shall not be accounted a settlement in the cases abovesaid, but that it shall and may be lawful for two justices of the peace to convey the said person or persons to the place of his or their habitation as aforesaid, under the pains and penalties in this act prescribed:

(3) and if such person or persons shall refuse to go, or shall not remain in such parish where they ought to be settled as aforesaid, but shall return of his own accord to the parish from whence he was removed, it shall and may be lawful for any justice of the peace of the city, county or town corporate where the said offence shall be committed, to send such person or persons offending to the house of correction, there to be punished as a vagabond, or to a publick work-house in this present act hereafter mentioned, there to be employed in work or labour:

(4) and if the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish to which he or they shall be removed, refuse to receive such person or persons, and to provide work for them, as other inhabitants of the parish, any justice of peace of that division may and shall thereupon bind any such officer or officers in whom there shall be default, to the assizes or sessions, there to be indicted for his or their contempt in that behalf.

WHEREAS by a late art of parliament a small part of the imposition upon coals imported in or near the city of London was given towards the rebuilding the cathedral church of St. Paul's wholly ruined by the dreadful fire of London, which (and all other supplies) carefully expended, have made some considerable advance in the said work, but so far short of finishing a fabrick of so large dimensions. That without further encouragement by a supply from the publics, the n said work in a little time must be left imperfect and useless, and consequently all the said former expence totally loft, to the dishonour of our established religion, and to the reproach of the said city: and whereas by the said late act the lord archbishop of Canterbury, the lord bishop of London, and the lord mayor of London for the time being, or any two of them were impowered to imploy and dispose part of the said imposition upon coals towards the building the said cathedral of St, Paurj; therefore for enabling of the said lord archbishop and lord bishop of London, and the lord mayor of London for the time being, or any two of them to finish so great and pious a work: be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That for all forts of coals which from and after the twenty-ninth day of September, one thousand six hundred eighty seven, and before the twenty-ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred shall be imported or brought into the port of the said city of London or the river of Thames within the liberty of the said city upon the same river, there shall be paid by way of imposition thereupon over and besides all other impositions and duties according to the rates hereafter mentioned, that is to say, for all such forts of coals or culm as

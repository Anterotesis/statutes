[Preamble.]

WHEREAS the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America, now in use within that part of Great Britain called England, by virtue of the several Statutes authorising such transportation, is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil courses: whereas, until some other more effectual provisions, in the place of transportation to his Majesty's Colonies and plantations in America, can be framed, such convicts, being males, might be employed with benefit to the public in raising sand, soil, and gravel from, and cleansing the river Thames; or being males unfit for so severe a labour, or being females, might be kept to hard labour of another kind within England; be it therefore enacted by the king's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[When any offender shall be ordered to hard labour, the clerk of the assize, &c. shall give a certificate to tge sheriff or gaoler,]

III.

[Preamble.]

WHEREAS the establishing of a general trade and commerce from these kingdoms to and with the coasts of Africa, and from thence to and with the several interior kingdoms and countries of that continent, would be highly beneficial to the manufactories and other trading interests of these kingdoms: and whereas the interior kingdoms and countries of the said continent have not hitherto been explored by Europeans, nor hath any regular trade ever been carried on therewith

from these kingdoms, nor can such undertakings be conveniently carried on and supported, unless a considerable capital joint stock is raised for that purpose: and whereas it is also necessary for the parties engaging therein, that they should have the sole and absolute possession of some district of land on the said coasts, where they may form a factory or settlement for their servants, a secure depository for their goods and merchandise, and a safe harbour for their shipping: and whereas several persons have already formed themselves into a society, and subscribed considerable sums of money for the purpose of establishing and carrying on such trade and commerce; but are apprehensive that difficulties may arise as well in recovering debts which may grow due to the joint stock, as in defending suits or actions which may be commenced or brought against the subscribers for any matter or thing relative to the society,

---

as by law all the several subscribers and proprietors to and in the society must in such case both sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded by their several and disiinfl names and descriptions; and it is expedient that the several subscribers and proprietors shall be protected from becoming liable to the payment of any sum or sums of moneys beyond their respective shares in such capital joint stock: and whereas many persons who are Hot now liable to become bankrupts, within the intent and meaning of any of the laws now in force concerning bankrupts, are likewifefear f ul of subscribing money to carry on the laudable purposes of the said society, by becoming subscribers to and part owners of the said capital joint stock, and by being engaged or concerned in the dealings to be carried on therewith, they may be liable to have commissions of bankrupt issued against them as traders: therefore, for the more eafly effecting. the purposes of the said society, and for avoiding the difficulties aforesaid, the said society are desirous of being incorporated, and having a common seal and name, by which they may be known and dislinguifked, sue and be sued, i tuple ad and be impleacted: may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the king's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

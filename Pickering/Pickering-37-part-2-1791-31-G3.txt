not any sufficient provision maae for the relief and setting on work of fans in gaol to poor and needy persons committed to the common gaol for felony and wor^> recited other misdemeanours, who many times perish before their trials and the poor there living idly and unemployed become debauched, and come forth injlrured in the practice of thievery and levjdness, it is enacted That the justices of the peace in their respective counties, at any of their general sessions, if they shall find it needful so to do, may provide a flock of such materials as they find convenient for the setting poor prisoners on work, in such manner and by such ways as other county charges may be levied and raised, and to pay and provide fit persons to oversee and feet such persons on work, and make such orders for accounts of and concerning the premtfes as shall by them be thought needful, and for punishment of neglects and other abuses, and for befiowing the profits arising by the labour of the prisoners sit on work for their relief which shall be duly observed, and may alter, reyoke, or amend such their orders from time to time, provided that no parish be rated above sixpence by the week towards the premises, having respect to the respective values of the several perijhcs: and whereas the provision of the said recitedjlatute is very fit to be executed with respect to such prisoners therein described as shall be confined in the gaols, with an extension thereof to all other prisoners inclined to take the benefit thereof and also an increase of the feum limited by the said act for defraying the expense of executing the same: be it therefore enacted, That the justices of the peace shall Justices may have authority to execute the said recited provision in the said execute the last mentioned act, for setting poor persons on work, as well in regard to such persons as are therein described, as in favour of all your all other prisoners within the said gaols, who may at any time be in prisoners will clined and willing to work; and for that purpose are hereby au ling to work, thorised, at a general or quarter session of the peace for the said county, or at any adjournment thereof, to direct the payment of such sums of money out of the county rate for the said county as they shall from time to time think fit to be expended in executing the provision of the said last mentioned act, according to the extension thereof hereby made.

CAP. XXI.

An act for improving the union of the two kingdoms.

Whereas nothing can more conduce to the improving the union of the two kingdoms, which by Her Majesty's great wisdom and goodness has been happily effected, than that the laws of both parts of Great Britain should agree as near as may be, especially those laws which relate to high treason and the proceedings thereupon, as to the nature of the crime, the method of prosecution and trial, and also the forfeitures and punishments of that offence, which are of the greatest concern both to the Crown and to the subjects: to the end therefore that the said union may be more effectually improved, be it enacted by the Queen's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and nine, such crimes and offences which are high treason or misprision of high treason within England, shall be construed, adjudged, and taken to be high treason and misprision of high treason within Scotland; and that from thenceforth no crimes or offences shall be high treason or misprision of high treason within Scotland, but those that are high treason or misprision of high treason in England;

of

and there

tried as in England.

Persons attainted of treason in Scotland, to

of high treason or misprision of high treason in Scotland, shall be subject and liable to the same corruption of blood, pains, penalties, and forfeitures, as persons convicted or attainted of high treason or misprision of high treason in England.

IV. Provided always, that where any person now is, or shall be, before the said first day of July, seized or any messuages, lands, seigniories, rents, tenements, or hereditaments in Scotland, of an estate tail, that is to say, an estate tailzie, affected with irritant and resolutive, or prohibitive clauses, and is, or before the said first day of July, shall be married, if any issue of that marriage be living, or there be possibility of such issue at the time of the high treason committed, that then in such case the said messuages, lands, seigniories, rents, tenements, and hereditaments, shall not be forfeited upon the attainder of such person for high treason, (but during the life of the person so attainted only) so that the issue and heirs in tail of such marriage shall inherit the same, the said attainder notwithstanding.

That Treasons

V. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all treasons and misprisions of treason, which from and after the said first day of July shall be done or committed by any native of Scotland upon the high sea, or in any place out of this realm of Great Britain, shall be enquired of, heard and determined before the said justice court, or before such commissioners of oyer and terminer, and in such shire, stewartry, or county of Great Britain, as shall be assigned by the Queen's commission, and by good and lawful men of the same shire, in like manner to all intents and purposes as if such treasons or misprisions of treason had been done or committed in the same shire where they shall be enquired of, heard, and determined, as aforesaid; and that from and after the said first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and nine, no person accused of any capital offence, or other crime in Scotland, shall suffer, or be subject or liable to any torture, provided that this act shall not extend to take away that judgement which is given in England against persons indicted of felony, who shall refuse to plead, or decline trial.

VII. And whereas the crimes after-mentioned are by several acts of Parliament in Scotland declared to be treason, and the committers thereof are appointed to be punished with the same pains and forfeitures as committers of treason, and that after the first day of July aforesaid,

in England.

5ia Anno septimo Annae. C. 21, [1708.

the *aforesaid act of Parliament in Scotland will have no force nor effect, seeing no facts nor offences are to be deemed treason within Scotland after that time, but such as are so by the acts and statutes now in force in England; be it therefore by the authority aforesaid further enacted, that theft in landed men, murder under trust, wilful fire-raising, firing coalheughs, and assassination, which were declared to be treason by particular statutes in Scotland, shall after the aforesaid time be only adjudged and deemed to be capital offences, and the committers thereof shall be only liable to such pains and punishments as by the law of Scotland are to be inflicted upon the committers of capital crimes and offences, and the persons committers thereof are to punished and tried in the same manner as by the laws of Scotland is provided in the cases of other capital crimes; anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding.

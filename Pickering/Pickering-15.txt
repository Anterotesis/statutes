ether allowances, /A01 rfrr therein mentioned and appointed: and whereas the time limited by the said act for the exportation of fish cured with foreign salt, Jo as to be entitled to the allowances then given, was too Short, in, respect that being the prime season of the Jalmon-fishing, considerable quantities of salmon and codfish were theh in the hands of several curers of fish in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, which they were under a necessity to cure with foreign salt) the duties whereof were either paid or secured to be pend: and whereas it may be just and reasonable, that the curers and proprietors of all such fish, actually and really in band on the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, legally and duly cured with foreign Jolt, according to the several acts of parliament in that behalf \ the duties of which salt were either paid or secured to be paid, should be paid the same allowances, and in the same manner, as if exported on or before the said twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, be it enacted and declared by the authority aforesaid, That the barons of his Majesty's court of exchequer in Scotland, upon receiving a satisfac-Relief for so- tory proof of what quantities of salmon and codfifli were actual-reign salt used ly and really in hand on the said twenty fourth dav of June one mon^cod- thousand seven hundred and nineteen, duly curea with foreign fish in Scotland and legally exported, the duties whereof have been either

licy of assurance under the respective common foals of the said corporations are different from the proceedings and pleadings in actions and suits commenced upon policies of assurance entred into by private infur-ersy or personi riot incorporated in manner as aforesaid \ and by reason of the nccejfity of pleading specially in such cases, the whole merit of the case in question cannot oftentimes come into confederation, and toe jury, by the rules of law, are often obliged to find a verdiU for the whole J'um of money ajfuredy though it be never Jo apparent, that in jufeice only a small part thereof is due to the assured by feuch policies of assurance; and the said corporations are thereby forced to seek relief in courts of equity, when the matter in question might be as well determined at once by a jury, as it is done in the case of private insurers, or persons not incorporated; for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty The insurance fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and twenty five, companies on all actions of debt to be sued or commenced against either of may the said corporations, upon any policies of afiiirance under the common seal of such corporation for the alluring of any ship or brought a-ships, goods or merchandizes at sea or going to sea, it shall or grim them, maybe lawful to and for the said respective corporations, in such adhon or suit, to plead generally, that they owe nothing to the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such suit or action; and that in all actions of covenant, which shall be sued or commenced against either of the said corporations upon any such policy of assurance under the common seal of such corporation for the alluring; any ship or ships, goods or merchandizes, at sea or going to (ea, it shall and may be lawful for the said respective corporations, in such action or suit, to plead generally, that they have not broke the covenant in such policy contained, or any of them, and if thereupon issue shall be joined, it shall and may be lawful for the jury, if they shall see cause, upon the trial of such issue, to find a verdict for the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such suit or action, and to give so much or such part only of the sum demanded, if it be an action of debt, or so much in damage, if it be an action of covenant, as it shall appear to them upon the evidence given upon such trial, such plaintiff or plaintiffs ought in justice to have, or is or are entitled unto; any law or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

XLIV. And whereas several persons have of late endeavoured to evade the payment of the stamp-duties on policies of assurance or insurance, by giving prmijfory notes instead of policies for the insuring goods, ships or merchandizes at sea, by which notes the insurer notifies or expresses the terms on which he would insure, to the great detriment and loss of his Majesty's revenue, be it therefore enacted by the au- xobe

thority aforesaid, That when any vessel, goods or merchandiz- on

es shall be insured, a policy duly stamped shall be issued, or at fors'emue of lead made out within the space of three days at furthest, and 1001. the insurer or insurers neglecting to make out such a policy or

CAP. XXIX.

An act to prevent frivolous and vexatious arrests.

[Explained and amended by 5 Geo. 2. c. 27.]

FOR the more effectual preventing frivolous and vexatious arrests, be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

[None to be held to special bail in a superior court under 10l.]

That from and after the twenty fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and twenty six, no person shall be held to special bail upon any process issuing out of any superior court, where the cause of action shall not amount to the sum of ten pounds or upwards;

[Nor in an inferior court, under 40s.]

nor out of any inferior court, where the cause of action shall not amount to the sum of forty shillings or upwards; and that in all cases, where the cause of action shall not amount to the sum of ten pounds or upwards in any such superior court, or to forty shillings or upwards in any such inferior court (and the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall proceed by the way of process against the person)

[But to be served personally with a copy of the process.]

he, she or they shall not arrest or cause to be arrested, the body of the defendant or defendants, but shall serve him, her or them personally, within the jurisdiction of the court, with a copy of the process;

[Not appearing, plaintiff may enter a common appearance, &c.]

and if such defendant or defendants shall not appear at the return of the process or within four days after such return, in such case it shall and may be lawful to and for the plaintiff or plaintiffs, upon affidavit being made, and filed in the proper court, of the personal service of such process as aforesaid (which said affidavit shall be filed gratis) to enter a common appearance or file common bail for the defendant or defendants, and to proceed thereon, as if such defendant or defendants had entred his, her or their appearance, or filed common bail; any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

III. Whereas the Statute made in the twenty first year of the reign of King James the First, for the more effectual preventing the delays and expences occasioned by the removal of small causes out of inferior courts, has been of late evaded and rendered ineffectual, by the contrivance of vexatious defendants, who by setting up a fictitious action against themselves, for a pretended demand of five pounds or upwards, by such their contrivance procure the smallest actions to be removed by writs of habeas corpus, out of the inferior into the superior courts, whereby the plaintiffs, in such small actions, which will not bear the expence of such superior courts, are necessitated to submit to the loss of their just demands; now for preventing such abuses, and rendring the said statute more effectual for the future, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,

[Judge of inferior courts may proceed in suits not exceeding 5l. though there may be other actions higher.]

That from and after the said twentieth day of June the judge or judges of such inferior courts, as are described in the said statute, shall or may proceed in such actions, bills, plaints, suits or causes as are therein specified, which appear or are laid, not to exceed the said sum of five pounds, although there may be other actions against such defendant or defendants, wherein the plaintiff or plaintiffs demands shall or may exceed the said sum of five pounds.

[Persons convicted of forgery, &c. practising as attornies, &c. offending against this act, to be transported.]

IV. And for avoiding the great mischiefs and abuses which arise from infamous and wicked persons already convicted of wilful perjury or forgery, practising as attornies or solicitors, in courts of law and equity; be it enacted, That if any person who hath been or who shall be convicted of forgery, or of wilful and corrupt perjury, or subornation of perjury, or common barretry, shall, after the said four and twentieth day of June, act or practise as an attorney, or solicitor or agent, in any suit or action, brought or to be brought in any court of law or equity, within that part of Great Britain called England, the judge or judges of the court, where such suit or action is or shall be brought, shall, upon complaint or information thereof, examine the matter in a summary way in open court; and if it shall appear

1725.] Anno duodecimo Georgii I. c. 30, 31. 333

to the satisfaction of such judge or judges, that the person complained of, or against whom such information shall be given, hath offended contrary to this act, such judge or judges shall cause such offender to be transported for seven years to some or one of his Majesty's colonies or plantations in America, by such ways, means and methods, and in such manner, and under such pains and penalties, as felons in other cases are by law to be transported.

[Not to extend to Scotland.]

V. Provided always, That this act or any thing herein contained, shall not extend to that part of Great Britain called Scotland.

VI. Provided also, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That this act shall continue in force for the term of five years, and from thence to the end of the next session of parliament, and no longer.

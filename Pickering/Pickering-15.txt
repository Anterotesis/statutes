licy of ajfurance under the refpeflive common foals of the said corporations are different from the proceedings and pleadings in actions and suits commenced upon policies of ajfurance entred into by private infur-ersy or personi riot incorporated in manner as aforesaid \ and by reason of the nccejfity of pleading specially in such cases, the whole merit of the case in quejlion cannot oftentimes come into confederation, and toe jury, by the rules of law, are often obliged to find a verdiU for the whole J'um of money ajfuredy though it be never Jo apparent, that in jufeice only a small part thereof is due to the ajjured by feuch policies of ajfurance; and the said corporations are thereby forced to seek relief in courts of equity, when the matter in quejlion might be as well determined at once by a jury, as it is done in the case of private infur-ers, or persons not incorporated; for remedy whereof, be it erupted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty The infuranee fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and twenty five, companies on all actions of debt to be sued or commenced against either of may the said corporations, upon any policies of afiiirance under the common seal of such corporation for the alluring of any ship or brought a-(hips, goods or merchandizes at sea or going to sea, it shall or grim them, maybe lawful to and for the said respective corporations, in such adhon or suit, to plead generally, that they owe nothing to the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such suit or action; and that in all actions of covenant, which shall be sued or commenced against either of the said corporations upon any such policy of assurance under the common seal of such corporation for the alluring; any ship or ships, goods or merchandizes, at sea or going to (ea, it shall and may be lawful for the said respective corporations, in such action or suit, to plead generally, that they have not broke the covenant in such policy contained, or any of them, and if thereupon issue shall be joined, it shall and may be lawful for the jury, if they shall fee cause, upon the trial of such issue, to find a verdict for the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such suit or action, and to give so much or such part only of the sum demanded, if it be an action of debt, or so much in damage, if it be an action of covenant, as it shall appear to them upon the evidence given upon such trial, such plaintiff or plaintiffs ought in justice to have, or is or are entitled unto; any law or custom to the con-trary notwithstanding.

XLIV. And whereas several persons have of late endeavoured to evade the payment of tbejlamp-duties on policies of ajfurance or in-furance, by giving prmijfory notes instead of policies for the insuring goods, ships or merchandizes at sea, by which notes the insurer notifies or exprejfes the terms on which he would insure, to the great detriment and loss of his Majesty's revenue, be it therefore enacted by the au- xobe

thority aforesaid. That when any vessel, goods or merchandiz- 0n

es shall be insured, a policy duly (lamped shall be issued, or at forf'emue of lead made out within the space of three days at furthest, and 1001. the insurer or insurers neglecting to make out such a policy or

Eolicies within the time aforesaid, shall forfeit the sum of one undred pounds for every fucti offence, to be sued for and reco-vered, and divided in the lame way and manner, as other penalties

[Under sheriffs and gaolers to make entries of all surrenders, &c.]

IV. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the under sheriff, and also the gaoler of every prison, into whose custody such debtors shall surrender, or be surrendered, as aforesaid, shall make entries of all such surrenders in a book to be kept by them respectively for that purpose; which book shall be open to the inspection of all persons requiring to examine the same; and if any under sheriff or gaoler shall make default therein, he shall be adjudged guilty of a contempt of the court out of which the process issued upon which such debtor or debtors was or were arrested; and shall and may be punished as in other cases of contempts of court.

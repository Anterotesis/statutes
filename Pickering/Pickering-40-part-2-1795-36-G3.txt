W. And whereas doubts have been lately entertained, whether the acceptance of such augmented churches, curacies, and chapels, has rendered voidable in law such other benefices as the incumbents possessed before their acceptance of the same: and whereas it is fit that many incumbents who have accepted such churches, curacies, and chapels, should be quieted in the possession of the benefices they enjoyed before Benefices held the acceptance of the same: it is hereby enabled and declared, That e^cureOtoOe benefices as were held in conjunction with augmented

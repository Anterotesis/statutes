That the said orders, and all proceedings duly had or to be had, according to and under the authority of the said orders, upon appeals from sentences given in the vice admiralty couris in the West Indies, or in the Bermuda or Bahama /funds, shall be, and be deemed and taken to be, and to have been respectively legal and valid in the law, to all intents and purposes: provided nevertheless, That in all cases in which appeals shall have been permitted under the authority of the said orders, or shall hereafter be permitted under the authority thereof, or of this act, to be interposed after the ordinary time or times of appealing, as the same were established

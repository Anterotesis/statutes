(4) And although the said branch of the said statute be needful and expedient to remain and continue for such bowyers as do dwell and inhabit in the country and other places out of the city of London, and the suburbs of the same; yet forasmuch as there be very few or no bows of elmy witchhafel or ajhy or of any other wood than only of yew, used or occupied by any person within the said city and suburbs of the same, therefore the said branch of the said act and statute before rehearfei was noty ne is needful to be had and made for the bwvyers dwelling within the said city and suburbs.

(4) And although the said branch of the said statute be needful and expedient to remain and continue for such bowyers as do dwell and inhabit in the country and other places out of the city of London, and the suburbs of the same; yet forasmuch as there be very few or no bows of elmy witchhafel or ashy or of any other wood than only of yew, used or occupied by any person within the said city and suburbs of the same, therefore the said branch of the said act and statute before rehearsei was noty ne is needful to be had and made for the bwvyers dwelling within the said city and suburbs.

II. And yet nevertheless your said subjects, for the avoiding of the danger and penalty contained in the said branch, are daily inforced to make such great number of bows of elm, witchhafel and ajfh, that they cannot in convenient time utter and fell the same, but are conjlrained to keep such bows by them so made, until they be putrified and not meet for any good use and purpose.

III. By reason whereof much of the said wood of elm, witchhafel and ash is daily wasted and consumed in making of the said bows*and your said subjects by such Losses as they daily fujlbih in making such bows greatly impoverished, and the commonwealth thereby nothing ad* vaneed, but rather hindered '

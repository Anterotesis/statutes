JtW Anno vicesimo secundo Georgii II. c. 21. [1749.

aforesaid sums; the expence whereof was to be recovered out of the respective debtors'estates, without arty abatement or mitigation; and incidental expences of the said trustees were not to exceed, in any one year, the sum of forty pounds: and whereas inconveniencies and difficulties have arisen in the execution of the said att, by reason that the ministers, heads, principals, and masters % ordained or admitted after the twenty fifth day of March, one thousand seven hundred and forty four, are allowed to withhold their declarations, touching their election of their annual rates, Jo late in the year as Candlemas; and the col-letter general cannot effectually levy and bring in the said rates, and other sums, under his management, between the terms appointed for the payment and distribution thereof \ by the means of an ordinary attion against the deficients \ and the expence of such attion becomes very heavy upon the deficient minister, bead, principal, or master: and whereas the number of benefices and offices in Scotland, subjettei to the said rates, have been found to be considerably less, and the number of widows and children to be provided for considerably greater than was supposed in the computation, upon which the proportion between the annual rates and the annuities and provisions mentioned in the said recited act was fixed$ and the annuities anaproviftons already become payable to the widows and children of ministers, heads, principals, and masters deceased, and those which may become due for several fucceeding years, will, in all probability, very much exceed what they were computed at; and the said deceased ministers, heads, principals, and masters, have contributed very little to the fund established by the said att; and there is great reason to apprehend, that the annual surplusfes, in the early years of collection of the rates and sums aforesaid, will not raise the intended capital, and that the said fund, if roifed, will not be sufficient for answering the design of the said att; by reason whereof, the widows and children of those ministers, heads, principals, and masters, who shall have contributed moll to the raising of the said fund, will be deprived of a great part of the annuities and provisions due to them, unless some deduttion shall be made from the annuity granted to the widow, or the provision made for the child or children of each minister, heads principal, or master, who shall not have contributed to the fund a sum equal to three years amount of the annuity correspondent to his annual rate, and unless a sum be (mowed annually for increasing the capital fund to a greater amount than is allowed by the said recited att: and whereas also it is equitable and just, that the widows, as well as children of contributors to the said capital fund, should have a Share of any benefit which may casually arise from the surplusfls thereof, after such capital shall be made up: therefore, and for removing the doubts and difficulties aforesaid, touching the execution of the said recited act, and for preserving a just and equal proportion, as much as is possible, between the contributions made to the said fund by any minister, head, principal, or mailer, and the sums to be drawn out of the lame by his widow and children, and between the widows and children of such contributors; your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal sub-jests, the trustees named and appointed in and by the said recited act for putting the same in execution, as specially warrant-

times mentioned in the said first recited act, he the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe did, in all humility, Shew to your Majesty, that being advised that your Majesty's estate and interest in the manors, Janas, and hereditaments, comprized in the said settlement, under the said acts, did determine on the death of the said Charles Radcliffe, be the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe did well hope, that the emmiuioners and governors of Greenwich Hospital would have admitted him to be intitled, from the time of the death of the said Charles Radcliffe, to the possession of the said last-mentioned manors, lands, and hereditaments, under the limitations contained in the said settlement of the twenty fourth of June, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, to the first and other fins of the said Charles Radcliffe in tail male; but that be found the said of and governors did not look on your Majesty's estate and interest in the said premisses to be determined, but did consider the said right, title, claim, and interest, which the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe pretended to under the said settlement of the twenty fourth day of June, one thousand fezten hundred and twelve, to be null and void, inasmuch as neither the trustees for preserving the contingent remainders under the said settlement, nor any other person for or on the behalf of the first and other fins of the said Charles Radcliffe, had made any claim before the of appointed by the said recited acts of the first and fourth years of his late Majesty, for the determining claims as aforesaid: and the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe did also shew to your Majesty, that be found it might be objected to him, that, as he was born within the dominions of the French King, in the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty five, and out of your Majesty's legiance, he was to be considered as an alien, and was to be exetuiei from all right and title to the said estates, although he was born of natural-born subjects, as before is mentioned \ and thereupon the fad James Bartholomew Radcliffe did most humbly reprefint it to your Majesty, that if heshould be found to be an alien under the said act of the fourth year of your Majesty's reign, it could not be of any avail to him tp litigate the queJHon touching the necessity there was, under the pfl of his late Majesty, to enter a claim in behalf of an unborn person; and as the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe was absolutely unable to bear the ixpence of such a litigation, he did therefore submit to your Majesty's confederation fiveral reafins and arguments in support of his right and title to the said estates, and whether he was to be considered as an alien, or not; and although he was to be consider ed as an alien, in which case he would be incapable to hold any tjlite against the crown, yet nevertheless be did contend, that be was capable for the benefit of the crown, to take such estate and interest as j

was limited to him by the said settlement; in regard whereof, and of the many singular hardfinps attending his case, he did humbly beseech your Majesty to extend your grace and favour to him, and to grant him such relief for his support, as the circumstances of his case should require: and whereas your Majesty, out of your princely tle-mency, and from those motives of goodness and compassion, which are inherent in your royal nature, hath been pleafid to signify to yot+r parliantent} That your Majesty W(U graciously inclined, that

form relief should be granted to the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe, Jo as the same should be confident with the Juft rights of Greenwich Hospital: and whereas the said of and governors of the said hospital are advised, that great doubts may arise, whether upon the construfiion of the true intent of the said act of the first year of the reign of his late majesty King George the First, and of the said other act of the fourth year of his reign, the use and estate in remainder limited by the said settlement of the twenty fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, to the first and other sons of the said Charles Radcliffe, was loft and defrayed, by reason that the same was not claimed before the of and trustees appointed by the said act, for and on the behalf of such first and other sons, within the time preftribed by the said acts; and it may also be doubted, whether the claim made in behalf of the said John Radcliffe of the precedent use and estate limited to him, and the allowance thereof by the court of delegates, in such manner as before is mentioned, did not reveft all the manors and hereditaments comprized in the said settlement of one thousand seven hundred and twelve, to the several uses limited in and by the find settlement, with such remainders as therein are expressed: and the said of and governors are also advised, That in case the said act should not extend to make the said use and estate in remainder, limited by the said settlement to the first and other sons of the said Charles Radcliffe (they not being born or in being at the time of the said acts, and therefore not being persons a finally having any estate and interest at that time) absolutely null and void, then the estate and interest of your Majesty, and consequently the right and title of the said hospital, which depends on the continuance thereof, may be considered as having determined on the death of the said Charles Radcliffe; and if the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe should be considered as an alien, then a new right might accrue to your Majesty, in virtue of your prerogative royal, so soon as an inquisition should be taken, finding the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe to be an alien accordingly: in regard of all which, and many other doubts and difficulties, the said of and governors are advised. That it will be for the interest and advantage of the said hospital to consent that the said manors, lands, and hereditaments shall stand charged with the raising such sum of money as herein after is mentioned 5 so as that the right and title of the said hospital to the said manors, lands, and hereditaments, may be fully established, and that the fee and inheritance thereof may be absolutely vested in trustees for the use and benefit of the fail hospital for ever, free and discharged from all the right, title, claim, and demand of the said James Bartholomew Radcliffe, and of his Majesty in his right, and of all Others claiming by or under any of the limitations contained in the said settlement, so dated the said twenty fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, as aforesaid 5 and so that the said of and governors of the said hospital may have and exercise full power to cut down and make sale of the timber on the premisses for the benefit of the said hospital, as they shall think fit, and to make such leaps of the same, and of the mines open or unopen, as they shall think proper; and whereas the

WHEREAS the proceedings upon writs of partition between Borough m coparceners by the common law or custom, joint tenants, and Northamp-tenants in common, are found by experience to be tedious, chargeable, and oftentimes ineffectual, by reason of the difficulty of discovering the persons and estates of the tenants of the manors, messuages, lands, 4

tenements, and hereditaments, to be divided, and the defective or dilatory executing and returning of the process of summons, attachment, and distress, and other impediments, in making and establishing of partitions, by reason of which divers persons having undivided parts or purparts are greatly oppressed and prejudiced, and the premisses are frequently wasted and destroyed, or lie uncultivated and unmanured, so that the profits of the same are totally or in a great measure loft: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the After process first day of May, one thousand six hundred ninety seven, after of Pone or at-process of Pone or attachment returned upon a writ of partition, tachment reaffidavit being made by any credible person of due notice given ^t arti-of the said writ of partition to the tenant or tenants to the ac- rion, ° P* tion, and a copy thereof left with the occupier, or tenant or tenants, or if they cannot be found, to the wife, son or daughter (being of the age of one and twenty years or upwards) of the tenant or tenants, or to the tenant in actual possession, by virtue of any estate of freehold, or for term of years, or uncertain interest, or at will, of the manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments, whereof the partition is demanded, (unless the said tenant in actual possession be demandant in the atftion) at lead forty days before the day of return of the said Pone or attachment, if the tenant or tenants to such writ, or any of them,

or the true tenant to the messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments as aforesaid, shall not in such case, within fifteen days after return of such writ of Pone or attachment, cause an appearance to be entred in such court where such writ of Pone or attachment shall be returnable, then in default of such appearance, the demandant having entred his declaration, the court may proceed to examine the demandant's title, and quantity of his part and purpart, and accordingly, as they shall find his right, part and purpart to be, they shall for so much give judgment by default, and award a writ to make partition, whereby such proportion, part and purpart may be set out severally; which writ being executed after eight days notice given to the occupier, or tenant or tenants of the premisses, and returned, and thereupon final judgment ensted, the same shall be good, and conclude all persons whatsoever after notice as aforesaid, whatever right or title they have, or may at any time claim to have in any of the manors, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments, mentioned in the said judgment and writ of partition, although all persons concerned are not named in any of the proceedings, nor the title of the tenants truly set forth.

An act for the more full and effectual charging of the duties upon rock salt.

Most gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's mqft dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of England in parliament assembled, taking notice that by divers acts of parliament now in force, whereof some are for terms of years yet unexpired, and others in perpetuity, are imposed upon all salt and rock salt made within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, or taken out of any pit or pits within the same, to be raised, disposed and applied to and for the several uses and purposes in the same, or by some other act or k

acts of parliament in (ibat behalf expressed and declared; and being sensible that rock salt, which in and by the said acts, or some of them, is chargeable with the said duties, after the rate of one hundred and twenty pounds weight to the bushel, may be and is used in kind for curing fish, fiejh and other purposes, without being refined into white salt, and all white salt made from brine, or otherwise, being chargeable with the said duties, after the rate of fifty six pounds weight to the bushel, and that one hundred and twenty pounds weight of rock salt, used in kind, will serve the use of almost two bushels of white salt, reckoned at fifty six pounds weight as aforesaid, whereby the makers of salt from brine have been and are extremely discouraged, and his Majesty's duties intended by the said acts have been and are very much impaired, have therefore resolved to increase your Ma-jefrv's duties upon all rock salt and salt rock, by reducing the bushel, according to which the duties thereof shall be paid for the future in the manner hereafter mentioned.

II. And be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That from and after the fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred ninety nine, every seventy five pounds weight of 75!. weight of rock salt, or salt rock, taken out of any pit or pits within the rock salt kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick deemed a.upon Tweed, shall be deemed and taken to be a Winchester bush- ^j^el and el, of eight gallons Winchester measure, and shall be entred, rated accordrated and taxed accordingly, to and for the several duties upon ingly. salt rock and rock salt, by the said several acts of parliament charged or made payable, instead of the bushel of one hundred and twenty pounds weight in the said acts or any of them mentioned, and greater or Jeffer quantities of the said salt rock, or rock salt, shall be reckoned proportionably; any thing in the said former acts, or any other law or ft^tute whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding.

Exchequer bills, in their hands undischarged, to compute the intereji thereupon, (which hath hitherto grown due after the rate of five pence a day for every one hundred pounds principal money contained therein, for such times only as they have not been in the publick receipts) because mofi of the said bills do contain very small sums, and have many endowments thereupon, according to which the said interqft is to be reckoned, and many of the said bills are so filled up already, that they are not capable of any further endowments, which should be made when they are brought into any of the said publici receipts; whereby divers persons have been, and are discouraged to accept such bills in payment: for remedy of which inconveniencies <pr the future, be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lord's spiritual and temporal, and the commons in this present parliament at- 1

sembled, and by the authority of the same, That when any of of the bills of credit, commonly called. Exchequer bills (being un, brought into cancelled, or undischarged) shall at any time or times be paid, the Exchequer lent, or brought into the receipt of his Majesty's Exchequer, to*caa-it shall and may be lawful to and for the coouflioners of his Ma-

II. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all the new bills to be made forth by virtue of this act, as aforesaid, shall bear an interest thereupon of four pence a day for everyone hundred pounds, and so proportionably for the lesser sums before mentioned; which interest shall be allowed, due and payable for such time or times only, as the said new bills shall not lye in the hands of any his Majesty's receivers or collectors, or A.in his Majesty's Exchequer, in like manner as the said higher and appropn- interest was allowable upon the said former bills; and the said a e to t e new bills^ma(je? in the receipt of his Majesty's Exchequer, be appropriated and applicable to the same ules or purposes ^hereunto such cancelled bills were appropriated and applicable, and under the same penalties, forfeitures and disabilities, to be inflicted for diverting or misapplying the same, as were by any law or statute provided for diverting or misapplying any of the monies for which such cancelled bills were taken respectively.

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said new bills shall in all respects have the like currency in all taxes, aids and revenues, and also at the Exchequer, and there shall be inflicted the same punishments for forging, or counterfeiting the same, and shall be subject to the same rules and methods, and such contracts for supporting the credit thereof shall and may be made, as by any former law or statute whatsoever were provided, authorized or enacted with regard to the bills by this act to be cancelled.

IV. Provided, That nothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to dissolve the present contract made between the lords of of his Majesty's treasury, and the subscribers for circulating Exchequer bills, and that the same shall remain and be in force to oblige the present trustees for circulating Exchequer bills, and the present subscribers for advancing of money to circulate the same, to change such hew bills as mall be made out by virtue of this act, as far as they would have been obliged to have changed the old bills, if this

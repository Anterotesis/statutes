And whereas great quantities of brown and muscovado sugars have formerly been refined here in England, and afterwards exported to foreign markets, whereby a great number of people have been employed, and a manufacture carried on very prof table to this kingdom j which trade of refitting sugars for exportation will be lofty unless a drawback be allowed, when such Jugars are exported, after they are refined here, suitable to the drawback allcived on the exportation of broivn and muscovado sugars, by reason foreign nations will be thereby enabled to refine them cheaper abroad than they can be done here at home; be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That for every hundred weight of sugar refined irv

Most gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's mqft dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of England in parliament assembled, taking notice that by divers acts of parliament now in force, whereof some are for terms of years yet unexpired, and others in perpetuity, are imposed upon all salt and rock salt made within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, or taken out of any pit or pits within the same, to be raised, disposed and applied to and for the several uses and purposes in the same, or by some other act or k

acts of parliament in (ibat behalf expressed and declared; and being sensible that rock salt, which in and by the said acts, or some of them, is chargeable with the said duties, after the rate of one hundred and twenty pounds weight to the bushel, may be and is used in kind for curing fish, fiejh and other purposes, without being refined into white salt, and all white salt made from brine, or otherwise, being chargeable with the said duties, after the rate of fifty six pounds weight to the bushel, and that one hundred and twenty pounds weight of rock salt, used in kind, will serve the use of almost two bushels of white salt, reckoned at fifty six pounds weight as aforesaid, whereby the makers of salt from brine have been and are extremely discouraged, and his Majesty's duties intended by the said acts have been and are very much impaired, have therefore resolved to increase your Ma-jefrv's duties upon all rock salt and salt rock, by reducing the bushel, according to which the duties thereof shall be paid for the future in the manner hereafter mentioned.

II. And be it enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That from and after the fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred ninety nine, every seventy five pounds weight of 75!. weight of rock salt, or salt rock, taken out of any pit or pits within the rock salt kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick deemed a.upon Tweed, shall be deemed and taken to be a Winchester bush- ^j^el and el, of eight gallons Winchester measure, and shall be entred, rated accordrated and taxed accordingly, to and for the several duties upon ingly. salt rock and rock salt, by the said several acts of parliament charged or made payable, instead of the bushel of one hundred and twenty pounds weight in the said acts or any of them mentioned, and greater or Jeffer quantities of the said salt rock, or rock salt, shall be reckoned proportionably; any thing in the said former acts, or any other law or ft^tute whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding.

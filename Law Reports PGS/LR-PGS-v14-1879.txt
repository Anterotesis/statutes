(1.) Saltash Floating Bridge. General Acts - 3, 700 0 0 485 18 9 3, 214 1 3 The sum was advanced in 1834 towards completing a bridge across the river Tamar. In the following year 185/. was repaid for principal. Afterwards the Commissioners took possession of the work, and sold it in 1839-40. The net proceeds of the sale amounted to 300/. 18s. 9rf. No interest has ever been paid.

In 1845 they transferred their mortgages to the Dundee Banking Company in consideration of a sum down. The result of this sale and of the receipts from tolls while the Commissioners were in possession was that the sum of 25,000l. was considered to be paid off with interest, and the sum of 7, 200/. was reduced to 1, 942/. Is. 4d. The Act 6 & 7 Vict. c. 84., regulating the property, expired in ' 1874.

(3.) Norwich and Lowestoft Navigation. General Acts - 54,000 0 0 10, 720 16 4 43, 279 3 8 The loan was advanced in 1832-35 towards completing the sea entrance at Lowestoft, and towards connecting the Rivers Tare and Waveney. The Commissioners took possession of the undertaking, and, in 1842, sold it. They also sued the directors for misapplying the loan. The sums recovered and the net proceeds of the sale were the only sums ever repaid. No interest has ever been paid. The loan was advanced for the repair of the church in 1840 on security of the church rate. During the next two years the instalments of principal were repaid, together with interest. The rate was then resisted on the ground of an informality in the mortgage deed, and the Commissioners were advised that they could not enforce the mortgage.

(6.) Minwere, Pembrokeshire. 5 Geo. 4. c. 36. 7 Geo. 4. c. 30. 600 0 0 Nil. 600 0 0 The sum was advanced in 1843 towards building the church. The interest charged was five per cent., in consequence of the interest to be charged by the Commissioners having been raised from four to five per cent, by 7 Geo. 4. c. 30. s. 2, but in consequence of 5 Geo. 4. c. 36. not having been recited in the later Act raising the interest it was considered that the Commissioners had no power to charge more than four per cent. It appears to have been considered that this prevented the Commissioners from recovering the principal, and no principal or interest has ever been paid.

(c.) Slebech, Pembrokeshire. 5 Geo. 4. c. 36. 7 Geo. 4. c. 30. 1, 250 0 0 187 10 0 1, 062 10 0 The loan was advanced in 1839 towards rebuilding the church. The instalments of principal were repaid for three years, after which the 6ame objection was taken as in the case of Minwere.

(</.) Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire. 5 Geo. 4. c. 36. 7 Geo. 4. c. 30. 400 0 0 151 3 11 248 16 1 The loan was advanced in 1831 in aid of the repairs of the church. The instalments of principal were repaid for 16 years, but in 1847 the same objection was taken as in the case of Minwere.

(c.) Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire. 5 Geo. 4. c. 36. 7 Geo. 4. c. 30. 300 0 0 30 0 0 270 0 0 The loan was advanced in 1843 for enlarging the church. A similar objection was taken to that in Minwere and only two instalments have been repaid.

(5.) Stranraer Harbour, Wigt on-shire. General Acts - 2, 0 CO 0 0 950 0 0 1, 050 0 0 The loan was advanced in 1817 towards the formation of a pier, and was secured on dues leviable under the authority of a royal charter of 1617 by the magistrates and council of the town. The instalments of principal were repaid for five years, after which the power of levying the dues was contested and decided in the sheriff court against the magistrates and council. The balance has remained outstanding ever since, and no interest has been paid upon it.

(6.) Southend Pier. General Acts - 16,000 0 0 15, 600 0 0 400 0 0 The loan was advanced between 1843-45 towards the construction of a pier at Southend. The Commissioners took possession of the pier and sold it in 1851, thereby recovering 14,000l. The balance had been privately guaranteed, and a sum of 1, 600/. was accepted as a composition for the amount due from the sureties.

(7.) Deal Fishery General Acts - 1, 500 0 0 836 18 6 663 1 6 The loan was advanced in 1818 to W. Fittock of Deal to assist him in catching and curing herrings. After repayment of some instalments he became bankrupt, and a portion only of the balance was recovered.

(9.) Hoads: (a.) Acle Yarmouth. 11 Geo. 4. c. 89. 2,000 0 0 1, 298 13 6 701 6 6 The loan was advanced in 1833 for making a turnpike road from Great Yarmouth to Acle on security of the tolls. During the first two or three years a sum of 300/. was repaid for principal, besides 287/. 16s. 5 for interest. In 1842 the Commissioners took possession, and collected the tolls, and ultimately sold them for 1,000l., the net proceeds amounting to 998/. 13a. 6

(6.) Shiand Loch Moidart. General Acts - 200 0 0 125 0 0 75 0 0 The loaD was advanced in 1847 to Mr. Coll McDonald for completing a road from the bridge of Shicl to the sea in Loch Moidart. No principal or interest has been received since 1852. Mr. McDonald’s estate was sold, and all trace of him lost.

(e.) Gatton and Povey Cross. 56 Geo. 3. c. 30. 5, 500 0 0 Nil. 5, 500 0 0 The loan was advanced in 1817-18 for making a new road between Gatton Lodge and Povey Cross in Surrey, so as to shorten the route between London and the sea coast, and was lent on the security of the tolls. In 1821 the Commissioners took possession, and applied the net balance of the tolls in part payment of the interest. In 1850 the Act was specially excepted from the Turnpikes Act Continuance Act, so that the tolls, the security for the loan, ceased.

(</.) Eccleshill and Bradford. 6 Geo. 4. c. 42. 3,000 0 0 Nil. 3,000 0 0 The'loan was advanced.in 1826 for making a turnpike road from Bradford to the neighbouring hamlet of Eccleshill, on security of the tolls. The road was expected to open out communication with some stone quarries, and to be a remunerative means of finding employment for the poor, who were in great distress owing to the state of the woollen trade. The tolls were insufficient to cover the current expenses, and in 1852 the Act authorising them was excepted from the Turnpikes Act Continuance Act, and consequently the tolls OCMM. No interest has ever been paid.

(e.) Doncaster and Selby. 1 & 2 Will. 4. c. 86. 14,000 0 0 8, 972 5 0 5, 027 15 0 The loan was advanced in 1832 for making a turnpike road between Doncaster and Selby, on the security of the tolls. The Commissioners took possession in 1841, and in 1852, with the permission of the Treasury, gave up charging interest, and the net receipts were applied in gradually liquidating the principal. In 1877, notwithstanding the objections of the Commissioners, the Act authorising the tolls was included, in the Schedule to 40 & 41 Vict. c. 64., among the Acts to expire on the following 1st of November. Consequently the tolls, the security’ for the loan, ceased. At that time 5, 392/. 14s. 3 remained unpaid, which has been reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of the toll-houses, viz., 364/. 19s. 8

(10.) Couktown Harbour. General Acts 17,000 0 0 11,000 0 0 6,000 0 0 Three loans were made between 1828 and 1838 for the improvement of the harbour. The second and third were secured collaterally by bonds of the principal land-owners, and were repaid, with interest, by the sureties. The first lonn of 6,000l. was secured solely on the tolls and dues, and is still outstanding. No interest has ever been paid upon it, and the average expenditure of the harbour exceeds the receipts.

50,000l. was advanced in 1868-9 to the company in aid of the construction of a line from Bagenalstown Station on the Great Southern and Western Railway to Machmine on the Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Railway, so as to effect a junction between the two southern railway systems, and a further sum of 10,000l. was advanced in 1870 to extend the undertaking. In 1875, 702/. having been paid in respect of principal and a very inadequate sum by way of interest, the Commissioners took possession, and put up the undertaking to auction. TTiere were no bidders, and they held the railway for a year, when it was sold for 40,000l., pursuant to the Act 39 & 40 Vict. c. xcviii. (Local), the net sum received being 34, 626/. 13s. 3d.

The loan was advanced in 1827 (on security of the tolls) for making a road from Cork to Ballyhooly, whence it was to be continued towards Dublin. One instalment of principal was repaid, and a sum of 480/. for interest. No other 6um has been received. The road is now maintained by the county, and no tolls are levied. The loan was collaterally secured by personal bonds from different landowners, but in 1842 the Government acquiesced in the Loan Commissioners not attempting to enforce those bonds, and lapse of time would appear to make it impossible now to do so.

In 1867 the Act 30 & 31 Vict. c. 57. was passed, authorising the grand juries of the counties of Cork and Waterford to takeover the bridge, 1 and providing for the composition of the debt for a sum of 2, 500/. 'Die grand juries refused to take over the bridge, and by 36 & 37 Vict. cc. 46 & 47, i the grand juries were authorised to take over the bridge on payment only of the 1 value of the materials and works of the bridge. They have agreed to do so, and | the value has been assessed at 222/. 2s. 3d.

The sum of 662/. Is. 8 d.was allocated to Mr. Scott for Cabercon. His estate was sold, bat the charge of the loan on his estate was informal, and the snm became therefore irrecoverable.

Lord Monteagle promised to contribute to Foynes Harbour a sum of 4, 250/. 2s. 6 d., for which he transferred 4, 500/. consols to the Commissioners. These consols were sold when the market was low, and consequently the amount realised by the sale was insufficient to pay the whole of the sum, and Lord Monteagle declined to pay the deficiency (153/. 7s. Id.) on the ground that the consols were sold without his concurrence.

The sum of 11, 821/. 4s. Id. was allocated for works on the Lower Shannon, which were not executed in consequence of the failure of localities and individuals to guarantee this portion of the cost, and the sum was appropriated, by permission of the Treasury, towards urgent works on the Upper Shannon, but could not be recovered from the counties in consequence of there being no power to increase the assessment upon the counties.

The larger part of the loan was advanced for reclaiming the slob lands (an area of about 300 acres), a work undertaken during the Irish famine. Difficulties arose in disposing of the land reclaimed, and in 1866 the Commissioners spent 660/. in fencing and improving the sluices. The property has been offered for sale to the adjacent proprietors and to the neighbouring tenantry, but no offer was obtained. The property has now been sold for 2,000l. There is no security for the rest of the loan.

Part Three.

Forged Certificate for an Exchequer Bill. — — — 14,000 0 0 The sum waa lost through the Assistant Secretary of the Commissioners m 1842 altering a certificate for an Exchequer Bill from 400/. to 14, 400/., and absconding with the 14,000l. The sum has been retained among outstanding balances, although it was not a loan and was never recoverable.

[11th August 1879.]

WHEREAS by divers Acts provisions differing from each other are made respecting the transmission to the Local Government Board and the laying before Parliament of annual returns of the receipts and expenditure on account of highways in parishes, certain urban sanitary districts, and highway districts:

And whereas it is expedient that one return only in each case should be required, and that such return should be made and laid before Parliament in like manner as other returns under the Local Taxation Returns Acts, 1860 and 1877, subject to being dispensed with in like manner as such other returns:

And whereas by the Highways Act, 1835, the surveyor of highways of every parish is required, among other matters, to verify his accounts before justices at special sessions, and the said verification of accounts has been rendered unnecessary by the Highways and Locomotives Amendment Act, 1878, which requires the accounts of the surveyors of highways to be audited by the district auditor, and it is expedient to dispense with such verification:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Highway Accounts Returns Act, 1879.

2. The Local Taxation Returns Acts, 1860 and 1877, shall apply to returns of rates, receipts, and expenditure as regards highways in like manner as if they were specifically mentioned in the said Acts, and highway boards and surveyors of highways were mentioned as local authorities in those Acts, and the surveyor of highways were an officer keeping the accounts of the rates, receipts, and expenditure within the meaning of those Acts.

Provided that a return under the said Acts may be dispensed with upon the delivery to the auditor of a financial statement of the said receipts and expenditure in like manner as in any other case.

3. The Acts specified in the Schedule to this Act are hereby repealed to the extent in the third column of that Schedule mentioned.

An Act to continue and amend the Petroleum Act, 1871.

[11th August 1879.]

BE it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may be cited as the Petroleum Act, 1879. Short title, and

This Act shall be construed as one with the Petroleum Act,

1871, and together with that Act may be cited as the Petroleum 84 & 85 Vict. Acts, 1871 and 1879. «• ios.

2. Whereas by the Petroleum Act, 1871, it is enacted that the Alteration of term “ petroleum to which this Act applies” means such of the petroleum defined by that Act as, when tested in manner set forth c-105 lct* in Schedule One to that Act, gives off an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than one hundred degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, and it is expedient to alter the said test: Be it therefore enacted that —

In the Petroleum Act, 1871, the term “ petroleum to which this J4 35 Vict* Act applies ” shall mean such of the petroleum defined by section c‘ three of that Act as, when tested in manner set forth in Schedule One to this Act, gives off an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than seventy-three degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.

Every reference in the Petroleum Act, 1871, to Schedule One 34 & 33 Vict. to that Act shall be construed to refer to Schedule One to this Act. c‘105 ’

FIRST SCHEDULE.

Mode of testing Petroleum so as to ascertain the Temperature at

WHICH IT WILL GIVE OFF INFLAMMABLE VAPOUR.

Specification of the Test Apparatus.

The following is a description of the details of the apparatus:

The oil cup consists of a cylindrical vessel 2" diameter, 2$/' height (internal), with outward projecting rim wide, f " from the top, and 1|" from the bottom of the cup. It is made of gun metal or brass (17 B.W.Gr.) tinned inside. A bracket, consisting of a short stout piece of wire bent upwards and terminating in a point, is fixed to the inside of the cup to serve as a gauge. The distance of the point from the bottom of the cup is 1^". The cup is provided with a close-fitting overlapping cover made of brass (22 B.W.G.), which carries the thermometer and test lamp. The latter is suspended from two supports from the side by means of trunnions upon which it may be made to oscillate, it is provided with a spout, the mouth of which is one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. The socket which is to hold the thermometer is fixed at such an angle and its length is so adjusted that the bulb of the thermometer when inserted to its full depth shall be 1£" below the centre of the lid.

The cover is provided with three square holes, one in the centre, tV7 by tV#* and two smaller ones, 1-\" by tV'> close to the sides and opposite* each other. These three holes may be closed and uncovered by means of a slide moving in grooves, and having perforations corresponding to those on the lid.

In moving the slide so as to uncover the holes, the oscillating lamp is caught by a pin fixed in the slide, and tilted in such a way as to bring the end of the spout just below the surface of the lid. Upon the slide being pushed back so as to cover the holes, the lamp returns to its original position.

TJpon the cover, in front of and in line with the mouth of the lamp, is fixed a white bead, the dimensions of which represent the size of the test flame to be used.

The bath or heated vessel consists of two flat-bottomed copper cylinders (24 B.W.G.), an inner one of 3" diameter and height, and an outer one of 5£" diameter and o$" height; they are soldered to a circular copper plate (20 B.W.G.) perforated in the centre, which forms the top of the bath, in such a manner as to enclose the space between die two cylinders, but leaving access to the inner cylinder. The top of the bath projects both outwards and inwards about; that is, its diameter is about greater than that of the body of the bath, while the diameter of the circular opening in the centre is about the same amount less than that of the inner copper cylinder. To the inner projection of the top is fastened, by six small screws, a flat ring of ebonite, the screws being sunk below the surface of the ebonite, to avoid metallic contact between the bath and the oil

Ch. 47.

1879. Petroleum Act, 1879.

cup. The exact distance between the sides and bottom of the bath and of the oil lamp is one-half of an inch. A split socket similar to that on the cover of the oil cup, but set at a right angle, allows a thermometer to be inserted into the space between the two cylinders. The bath is further provided with a funnel, an overflow pipe, and two loop handles.

The bath rests upon a cast-iron tripod stand, to the ring of which is attached a copper cylinder or jacket (24 B.W.G.) flanged at the top, and of such dimensions that the bath, while firmly resting on the iron ring, just touches with its projecting top the inward-turned flange. The diameter of this outer jacket is 6£". One of the three legs of the stand serves as support for the spirit lamp attached to it by means of a small swing bracket. The distance of the wick holder from the bottom of the bath is 1".

Two thermometers are provided with the apparatus, the one for ascertaining the temperature of the bath, the other for determining the flashing point. The thermometer for ascertaining the temperature of the water has a long bulb and a space at the top. Its range is from about 90° to 190° Fahrenheit. The scale (in degrees of Fahrenheit) is marked on an ivory back fastened to the tube in the usual way. It is fitted with a metal collar, fitting the socket, and the part of the tube below the scale should have a length of about 3J" measured from the lower end of the scale to the end of the bulb. The thermometer for ascertaining the temperature of the oil is fitted with collar and ivory scale in a similar manner to the one described. It has a round bulb, a space at the top, and ranges from about 55° F. to 150° F.; it measures from end of ivory back to bulb 2^".

Note. — A model apparatus is deposited at the Weights and Measures Department of the Board of Trade.

Directions for applying the Flashing Test.

1. The test apparatus is to be placed for use in a position where it is not exposed to currents of air or draughts.

2. The heating vessel or water bath is filled by pouring water into the funnel until it begins to flow out at the spout of the vessel. The temperature of the water at the commencement of the test is to be 130° Fahrenheit, and this is attained in the first instance cither by mixing hot and cold water in the bath, or in a vessel from which the bath is filled, until the thermometer which is provided for testing the temperature of the water gives the proper indication; or by heating the water with the spirit lamp (which is attached to the stand of the apparatus) until the required temperature is indicated.

If the water has been heated too highly, it is easily reduced to 130° by pouring in cold water little by little (to replace a portion of the warm water) until the thermometer gives the proper reading.

When a test has been completed, this water bath is again raised to 130° by placing the lamp underneath, and the result is readily obtained while the petroleum cup is being emptied, cooled, and refilled with a fresh sample to be tested. The lamp is then turned on its swivel from under the apparatus, and the next test is proceeded with.

3. The test lamp is prepared for use by fitting it with a piece of flat plaited candlewick, and filling it with colza or rape oil up to the lower edge of the opening of the spout or wick tube. The lamp is trimmed so that when lighted it gives a flame of about 0*15 of an inch diameter, and this size of flame which is represented by the projecting white bead on the cover of the oil cup is readily maintained by simple manipulation from time to time with a small wire trimmer.

When gas is available it may be conveniently used in place of the little oil lamp, and for this purpose a test-flame arrangement for use with gas may be substituted for the lamp.

4. The bath having been raised to the proper temperature, the oil to be tested is introduced into the petroleum cup, being poured in slowly until the level of the liquid just-reaches the point of the gauge which is fixed in the cup. In warm weather the temperature of the room in which the samples to be tested have been kept should be observed in the first instance, and if it exceeds 65° the samples to be tested should be cooled down (to jtbout 60°) by immersing the bottles containing them in cold water, or by any other convenient method. The lid of the cup, with the slide closed, is then put on, and the cup is placed into the bath or heating vessel. The thermometer in the lid of the cup has been adjusted so as to have its bulb just immersed in the liquid, and its position is not under

234 Ch. 47, 48. Petroleum Act, 1879. 42 & 43 Vict.

any circumstances to be altered. When the cap has been placed In the proper position, the scale of the thermometer faces the operator.

5. The test lamp is then placed in position upon the lid of the cup, the lead line or pendulum, which has been fixed in a convenient position in front of the operator, is set in motion, and the rise of the thermometer in the petroleum cup is watched. When the temperature has reached about 66° the operation of testing is to be commenced, the test-flame being applied once for every rise of one degree, in the following manner: —

The slide is Blowly drawn open while the pendulum performs three oscillations, and is closed during the fourth oscillation.

Note. — If it is desired to employ the test apparatus to determine the flashing points of oils of very low volatility, the mode of proceeding is to be modified as follows: —

The air-chamber which surrounds the cup is filled with cold water, to a depth of 1^ inches, and the heating vessel or water bath is filled as usual, but also with cold water. The lamp is then placed under the apparatus and kept there during the entire operation. If a very heavy oil is being dealt with, the operation may be commenced with water previously heated to 120°, instead of with cold water.

Subject as in this Act mentioned, and notwithstanding any enactment to the contrary, where a court of summary jurisdiction has authority under this Act, or under any other Act, whether past or future, to impose imprisonment or to impose a fine for an offence punishable on summary conviction, that court may, in the case of imprisonment, impose the same without hard labour, and reduce the prescribed period thereof, or do either of such acts; and in the case of a fine, if it be imposed as in respect of a first offence, may reduce the prescribed amount thereof.

And where in the case either of imprisonment or a fine there is prescribed a requirement for the offender to enter into his recognizance and to find sureties for keeping the peace, and observing some other condition, or to do any of such things, the court may dispense with any such requirement or any part thereof.

And where a court of summary jurisdiction has authority under an Act of Parliament other than this Act, whether past or future, to impose imprisonment for an offence punishable on summary conviction, and has not authority to impose a fine for that offence, that court when adjudicating on such offence may, notwithstanding, if the court think that the justice of the case will be better met by a fine than by imprisonment, impose a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds, and not being of such an amount as will subject the offender under the provisions of this Act, in default of payment of the fine, to any greater term of imprisonment than that to which he is liable under the Act authorising the said imprisonment.

5. The period of imprisonment imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction under this Act, or under any other Act, whether past or future, in respect of the nonpayment of any sum of money adjudged to be paid by a conviction, or in res|>ect of the default of a sufficient distress to satisfy any such sum, shall, notwithstanding

Does not exceed ten shillings Exceeds ten shillings but does not exceed one pound -Exceeds one pound but does not exceed five pounds -

Exceeds five pounds but does not exceed twenty pounds -Exceeds twenty pounds -And such imprisonment shall be without hard labour, except where hard labour is authorised by the Act on which the conviction is founded, in which case the imprisonment may, if the court thinks the justice of the case requires it, be with hard labour, so that the term of hard labour awarded do not exceed the term authorised by the said Act.

6. Where under any Act, whether past or future, a sum of money claimed to be due is recoverable on complaint to a court of summary jurisdiction, and not on information, such sum shall be deemed -to be a civil debt, and if recovered before a court of summary jurisdiction shall be recovered in the manner in which a sum declared by this Act to be a civil debt recoverable summarily is recoverable under this Act, and not otherwise; and the payment of any costs ordered to be paid by the complainant or defendant in the case of any such complaint shall be enforced in like manner as such civil debt, and not otherwise.

Where a sum is directed to be paid by instalments and default is made in the payment of any one instalment, the same proceedings may be taken as if default had been made in payment of all the instalments then remaining unpaid.

Every bill of sale to which this Act applies shall be duly attested and shall be registered under this Act, within seven days after the making or giving thereof, and shall set forth the consideration for which such bill of sale was given, otherwise such bill of sale, as against all trustees or assignees of the estate of the person whose chattels, or any of them, are comprised in such bill of sale under the law relating to bankruptcy, arrangement with creditors, or liquidation, or under any assignment for the benefit of the creditors of such person, and also as against all sheriffs officers and other persons seizing any chattels comprised in such bill of sale, in the execution of any process of any court authorising the seizure of the chattels of the person by whom or of whose chattels such bill has been made, and also as against every person on whose behalf such process shall have been issued, shall be deemed fraudulent and void so far as regards the property in or right to the possession of any chattels comprised in such bill of sale which, at or after the time of filing the petition for bankruptcy, arrangement, or liquidation, or of the execution of such assignment, or of executing such process (as the case may be), and after the expiration of such seven days are in the possession or apparent possession of the person making such bill of sale (or of any person against whom the process has issued under or in the execution of which such bill has been made or given, as the case may be).

9. Where a subsequent bill of sale is executed within or on the expiration of seven days after the execution of a prior unregistered bill of sale, and comprises all or any part of the personal chattels comprised in such prior bill of sale, then, if such subsequent bill of sale is given as a security for the same debt as is secured by the prior bill of sale, or for any part of such debt, it shall, to the extent to which it is a security for the same debt or part thereof, and so far as respects the personal chattels or part thereof comprised in the prior bill, be absolutely void unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the court having cognizance of the case that the subsequent bill of sale was bona fide given for the purpose of correcting some material error in the prior bill of sale, and not for the purpose of evading this Act.

The registration of a bill of sale, whether executed before or after the commencement of this Act, must be renewed once at least every five years, and if a period of five years elapses from the registration or renewed registration of a bill of sale without a renewal or further renewal (as the case may be), the registration shall become void: Provided, that where a period of five years from the original registration of any bill of sale has expired before the first day of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty, such bill of 3ale shall be as valid to all intents and purposes as it would have been if this Act had not been passed, if such registration be renewed in the manner prescribed by this Act before the first day of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty.

The renewal of a registration shall be effected by filing with the registrar an affidavit stating the date of the bill of sale and of the last registration thereof, and the names, residences, and occupations of the parties thereto as stated therein, and that the bill of sale is still a subsisting security.

Every such affidavit may be in the form set forth in the Schedule (A.) to this Act annexed.

A renewal of registration shall not become necessary by reason only of a transfer or assignment of a bill of sale.

12.

[15th August 1879.]

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WE, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, towards making good the supply which we have cheerfully granted to Your Majesty in this session of Parliament, have resolved to grant unto Your Majesty the sum herein-after mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Grant out of Consolidated Fund.

1. The Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury for the time Issue of being may issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United t^con Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and apply towards making TOlhUtedVmd" good the supply granted to Her Majesty for the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the sum of thirty-four million nine hundred and eighty-six thousand six hundred and twenty-one pounds.

2. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may borrow from time to time on the credit of the said sum of thirty-four million nine hundred and eighty-six thousand six hundred and twenty-one pounds, any sum or sums of equal or less amount in the whole, and shall repay the moneys so borrowed, with interest not exceeding five pounds per centum per annum, out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund at any period not later than the next succeeding quarter to that in which the said moneys were borrowed.

Any moneys so borrowed shall be placed to the credit of the account of Her Majesty's Exchequer, and shall form part of the said Consolidated Fund, and bp available in any manner in which such fund is available.

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

4. If a necessity arise for incurring expenditure not provided for in the sums appropriated to naval and military services by this Act, and which it may be detrimental to the public service to postpone until provision can be made for it by Parliament in the usual course, each of the departments entrusted with the control over the said services shall forthwith make application in writing to the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury for their authority to defray temporarily such expenditure out of any surpluses which may have been or which may be effected by the saving of expenditure upon votes within the same department, and in such application the department shall represent to the Commissioners of the Treasury the circumstances which may render such additional expenditure necessary, and thereupon the said Commissioners may authorise the expenditure unprovided for as aforesaid to be temporarily defrayed out of any surpluses which may have been or which may be effected as aforesaid upon votes within the same department; and a statement showing all cases in which the naval and military departments have obtained the sanction of the said Commissioners to any expenditure not provided for in the respective votes aforesaid, accompanied by copies of the representations made to them by the said departments, shall be laid before the House of Commons with the appropriation accounts of navy and army services for the year, in order that such proceedings may be submitted for the sanction of Parliament, and that provision may be made for the deficiencies

upon the several votes for the said services in such manner as Parliament may determine.

The Commissioners of the Treasury shall not authorise any expenditure which may cause an excess upon the aggregate sums appropriated by this Act for naval services and for army services respectively.

5. Whereas the Commissioners of the Treasury, under the powers vested in them by the Act of the session held in the fortieth and forty-first years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter sixty-one, have authorised expenditure not provided for in the sums appropriated by the said Act to certain votes for naval and military services for the year ended on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, to be in part temporarily defrayed out of the balances unexpended in respect of the sums appropriated to certain other votes for naval and military services for the said year; viz.,

1st. Expenditure for certain navy services unprovided for, temporally defrayed to the extent of one hundred and fourteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-three pounds four shillings and elevenpence, out of the unexpended balances of certain other votes for navy services:

2d. Expenditure for certain army services unprovided for, temporarily defrayed to the extent of two hundred and fifty-eight thousand seven hundred and seventy-four pounds eight shillings and fourpence, out of the unexpended balances of certain other votes for army services, and out of the sum realised in excess of the estimated appropriations in aid:

It is enacted, that the application of the said sums is hereby sanctioned.

6. A person shall not receive any part of a grant which may be made in pursuance of this Act for half pay or army, navy, or civil non-effective services until he has subscribed such declaration as may from time to time be prescribed by a warrant of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury before one of the persons prescribed by such warrant.

Provided that, whenever any such payment is made at more frequent intervals than once in a quarter, the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury may dispense with the production of more than one declaration in respect of each quarter.

Any person who makes a declaration for the purpose of this section knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

7. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Appropriation Act, 1879.

Parish Boundaries.

4. Where part of a parish is on one side while the residue of the parish is on the other side of the boundary of a municipal borough or county, or of a river, estuary, or branch of the sea, or where part of a parish is so situate as to be nearly detached from the residue of the parish, or is otherwise so situate as to render the administration of the relief of the poor in or the local government of such part in conjunction with the residue of the parish inconvenient, the said parish shall be deemed to be a divided parish within the meaning of section one of the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 1876, and the provisions of that Act shall apply accordingly in like manner as if the said part were isolated as mentioned m that section.

5. Whereas by section one of the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 1876, an order may be made “ for constituting “ separate parishes out of the divided parish, or for amalgamating “ some of the parts thereof with the parish or parishes in which the “ same may be locally included, or to which they may be annexed and doubts have arisen with respect to the construction of the said provision, and it is expedient to remove such doubts: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

An order under the said Act may deal with several divided parishes at the same time, and may constitute separate parishes out of any of such divided parishes or out of parts of several divided parishes, and may unite any parts of a divided parish or of several divided parishes with each other, and amalgamate the parts 60 united with any adjoining parish, and may amalgamate any part of a divided parish or parts of several divided parishes with an adjoining parish or adjoining parishes.

6. Where a parish was at the time of the passing of the Act of the twentieth year of Her present Majesty, chapter nineteen, intituled “An Act to provide for the relief of the Poor in extraparochial places, ” an extra-parochial place, and a representation is made to the Local Government Board that, by reason of the relative size and shape of such parish, and its position in respect to other parishes, the relief of the poor could be better administered

1879.

287

Poor Law Act, 1879. Ch. 54.

if the same, or any part or parts thereof, were amalgamated with the adjoining parish or parishes, an order may be made in pursuance of the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 1876, in 39 & 40 Vict, relation to such parish, in like manner as if the said parish were a c* 6l* divided parish.

7. Whereas by section five of the Divided Parishes and Poor Removing Law Amendment Act, 1876, provision is made for dealing with a

parish included in a highway district, and doubts have arisen as order under to the effect of an order under the said Act so far as regards 89 & 40 Vict, highways, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:Be it there- c' 6L 8' 5‘ fore enacted as follows:

Where a parish is a place separately maintaining its own highways, an order made either before or after the commencement of this Act under the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 39 & 40 Vict. 1876, shall be deemed to have dealt with that parish for highway c- 61* as well as for poor law purposes.

Where a parish is not a place separately maintaining its own highways, an order under the Divided Parishes and Poor Law 39 & 40 Vict. Amendment Act, 1876, dealing with such poor law parish or any c- 61-part thereof, may deal with any area affected by the order for highway purposes in like manner as it deals with the same for poor law purposes.

Where any such order has been made before the passing of this Act, a supplemental order may be made under the said Act for the purposes of dealing with the area so far as regards highways.

For the purposes of this section, any parish, township, or place separately maintaining its own highways or entitled to return a separate waywarden to a highway board under the Highway Acts shall be deemed to be a place separately maintaining its own highways.

Miscellaneous Amendments of Law.

8. Where on any representation it appears to the Local Govern- Combination of ment Board that the combination of two or more unions not in the “he^metropoHn. metropolis for any purpose connected with the administration of the

relief of the poor would tend to diminish expense, or would otherwise be of public or local advantage, the Board may, with the consent of the guardians of the unions to be combined, make an order for combining such unions for the purposes named therein, and for constituting for the execution of such purposes a joint committee of the guardians of each of the combined unions.

The order shall define the powers, rights, duties, liabilities, and obligations of the joint committee, and regulate the election, meetings, and officers of the joint committee, the mode of defraying the expenses of the joint committee, and any other matter or thing (including the adjustment of present and future liabilities and property) which it appears necessary or proper to regulate for the better carrying into effect the order.

10. Whereas by section four of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1851, guardians are authorised, with such consent as is therein mentioned, to subscribe towards the support and maintenance of any public hospital or infirmary as therein mentioned, and it is expedient to extend the said section:Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The provisions of the said section shall extend to authorise the guardians, with such consent as is therein mentioned, to subscribe towards any asylum or institution for blind persons, or for deaf and dumb persons, or for persons suffering from any permanent or natural infirmity, or towards any association or society for aiding such persons, or for providing nurses, or for aiding girls or boys in service, or towards any other asylum or institution which appears to the guardians, with such consent as aforesaid, to be calculated to render useful aid in the administration of the relief of the poor.

Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall authorise any subscription to any asylum or institution unless the Local Government Board be satisfied that the paupers under the guardians have or could have assistance therein in case of necessity.

11. The guardians of any union, for the purpose of fitting up and furnishing any workhouse under their control, may borrow money in accordance with the provisions of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, and the Acts amending the same, including this Act.

12. Whereas section five of the Union Loans Act, 1869, provides that any sum or sums of money borrowed by guardians may be repaid either by thirty equal annual payments of the principal, or by such equal annual payments as will repay the sum borrowed within thirty years, and it is expedient to authorise the repayment of any sum or sums in manner herein-after mentioned:Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Section five of the Union Loans Act, 1869, shall be construed as if there were substituted for the thirty equal annual payments and the thirty years therein mentioned such number of equal annual payments not exceeding thirty, and such number of years not exceeding thirty, as the guardians, with the consent of the Local Government Board, may in each case determine.

13. The provisions of the Union Loans Act, 1869, shall be deemed to have applied, and as amended by this Act shall apply, to the managers of district schools and to the managers of districts constituted under the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, in like manner as if they were guardians.

14. If it appear to the guardians of any union desirable that any hospital or building vested in them as guardians under the Acts

1879.

Poor Law Act, 1879.

Ch. 54.

relating to the relief of the poor should be vested in them as the rural sanitary authority of such union, for the reception of persons suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, the guardians may, by resolution, to be confirmed by an order of the Local Government Board, transfer such hospital or building accordingly; and from and after the date named in the order such hospital or building shall be deemed to be vested in the guardians as the rural sanitary authority of the' union, for the use of the inhabitants of the union or part thereof named in the resolution and order.

If the same is to be for the use of the inhabitants of any part of the union comprised in an urban sanitary district the order may determine the contribution to be made by the urban sanitary authority of such district towards the maintenance of the hospital or building.

Where an urban sanitary district comprises part of the union, and the said hospital or building is not to be for the use of the inhabitants of that part, the order may determine the value of the interest of that part of the union in such hospital or building, and the manner in which such value is to be paid to that part by the residue of the union for whose use the hospital or building is to be kept and the application of the sum so paid.

15. The Metropolitan Asylums Board may from time to time, with the approval of the Local Government Board, contract with any local authority in the metropolis acting in the execution of the Nuisances Removal Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, for the reception and maintenance in any hospital belonging to or under the management of such board of any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder within the district of any such local authority, and any person received into an hospital by virtue of any such contract under this section shall be deemed to be maintained in such hospital by the local authority with whom the contract is made.

Any expenses incurred by a local authority for the maintenance of any person under this section shall be deemed to be due from such person to the local authority, and may be recovered by the local authority from him, or from his representatives, at any time within six months after his discharge from such hospital.

16. The Metropolitan Asylums Board may from time to time provide and maintain carriages suitable for the conveyance of persons suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, and shall cause the same to be from time to time properly cleansed and disinfected, and may provide and maintain such buildings and horses, and employ such persons, and do such other things as are necessary or proper for the purposes of such conveyance.

All expenses incurred by the Metropolitan Asylums Board in the execution of this section to such extent as the Local Government Board may sanction shall be paid out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.

17. Where a rate is levied by the overseers of a parish over part of the parish only, the officers ordinarily employed in the collection of the poor rate shall, if required by the overseers, collect such first-mentioned rate, and shall receive out of the same such remuneration for the additional duty as the overseers, with the consent of the vestry, may determine.

An Act to authorise the Metropolitan Board of Works to defray expenses incurred in relation to the promotion of certain Bills in Parliament relating to the supply of water to the Metropolis.

[15th August 1879.]

WHEREAS the Metropolitan Board of Works did, during the last session of Parliament, in good faith, but beyond the powers conferred upon them by Parliament, promote two Bills, which were respectively intituled “ A Bill for the supply of water “ for certain purposes to the Metropolis by the Metropolitan Board “ of Works; for the construction of waterworks by the said Board; “ and for other purposes ”; and “ A Bill to make provision for the “ purchase by the Metropolitan Board of Works of the undertakings “ of the several water companies supplying water to the Metropolis, “ and to certain places in the neighbourhood thereof; and for the “ supply of water by the said Board to the Metropolis and to such “ places, and for other purposes relating thereto ”:

And whereas the said Bills were respectively read a first time in the House of Commons, but were subsequently withdrawn:

And whereas the Metropolitan Board of Works in the preparation and promotion of the said Bills, and preliminary and incidental thereto, incurred certain expenses, which have been disallowed by the auditor:

And whereas the said Bills were promoted and the said expenses were incurred by the Metropolitan Board of Works in good faith and in the belief that in promoting the said Bills they were acting within their legal powers, and it is therefore expedient that, notwithstanding such disallowment as aforesaid, provision should be made as in this Act contained for enabling the Metropolitan Board of Works to defray such expenses:

WHEREAS by the Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1875 (in this Act referred to as “the Act of 1875 ”), the raising of money by the Metropolitan Board of Works (in this Act referred to as “ the Board *) for the purposes therein specified was regulated, and provision was made requiring that the borrowing powers granted to the Board by Parliament for the purposes therein named should for the future be limited both in time and amount: And whereas by the Metropolitan Board of Works (Money) Act, 1878 (in this Act referred to as the “Act of 1878 ”), the Board were empowered to raise certain sums of money for the purposes in the said Act mentioned, and limits of time and amount within which the powers by the said Act granted might be exercised were fixed:

And whereas the powers for the raising of money by the Act of 1878, conferred upon the Board, have beeh partially exercised, but it is expedient that the Board should have power to raise certain further sums of money for the purposes, upon the terms, and subject to the limitations herein-after mentioned, and that the Act of 1878 should be amended:

And whereas it is expedient that the Board should be empowered to raise any of the moneys which they are by this Act authorised to raise, and which it may be convenient to raise for a temporary period, by the issue of bills, with the consent of the Treasury, for not less than three and not more than twelve months, to be repaid out of moneys raised by the creation of consolidated stock under this Act:

III. Repayment of Premiums.

17. If a teacher is dismissed or quits the service otherwise than by death or retirement on a pension, or retirement on receipt of a gratuity in lieu of pension, he shall forfeit all claim to pension or gratuity, but the amount deducted from salary from time to time for premiums shall be returned to him, either at the time of withdrawal from the service, or at any time thereafter, on proof of identity.

18. In the event of a teacher, who is dismissed or quits the service, re-entering for further service, he or she shall again pay any sum which may have been repaid, and also any premiums for the quarter years during which he or she may have been out of the service. These sums while unpaid shall bear compound interest at the rate of three per cent, per annum. They may be paid at once on re-entering the service, or the payments may be spread by deductions from salary over one or two years, as the Commissioners shall determine.

19. A teacher degraded from a higher class shall receive back any premiums paid as a consequence of service in such higher class, and shall only have a claim to the pension of the class for which he shall afterwards pay the premiums.

CHAPTER 77.

An Act to amend the Acts relating to the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and to grant money for the purpose of Loans by the said Commissioners; and for other purposes in relation thereto.

[15th August 1879.]

WHEREAS it is expedient to amend the Acts relating to the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and to grant money for the purpose of loans by those Commissioners:

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may be cited as the Public Works Loans Act, 1879. Short title.

Part I.

Amendment of Acts.

2. Where a loan is granted by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, or by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and the rate of interest for such loan, fixed by the special Act which authorises the Commissioners to grant the loan, is a special rate less than five per cent., such loan shall, notwithstanding anything in the special Act, bear interest at a rate not less than the rate in the special Act, and such other rate as may be necessary, in the judgment of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, in order to enable the loans to be made without loss to the Exchequer.

3. The advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, or by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, under any one Act, in any one financial year to one borrower (notwithstanding anything in the Act authorising such loan) shall not exceed in the aggregate one hundred thousand pounds.

4. Nothing in this Act shall apply to any loan granted before the passing of this Act, nor to any instalments subsequently advanced in respect of such loan, nor to any advance which the Public Works Loan Commissioners are authorised to make, by sections four and five of the Public Works Loans Money Act, 1876, and the Acts in those sections mentioned, to the Port Patrick and Belfast and County Down Railway Companies, and for* improving the harbour of Colombo, nor to any advance under the Irish Land Act, 1870, or any Act authorising loans for the improvement, drainage, or purchase of lands in Ireland.

Provided, that where though a loan has not been actually granted before the passing of this Act, negotiations for the same have proceeded so far as to make it in the opinion of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury inequitable for Such loan to be subject to the provisions of this Act or any of them, such loan shall, for the purposes of those provisions, be deemed to be a loan granted before the passing of this Act.

5. Whereas certain persons (in this Act referred to as the Peabody trustees) received certain sums from the late George Peabody upon trust to expend the same for constructing or improving dwellings for the labouring classes in London, and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, although empowered to lend money to associations established for the like purposes, have no power to lend to such trustees, and it is expedient to confer such power: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may lend to the Peabody trustees, and the Peabody trustees may borrow any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole three hundred thousand pounds, to be applied by the said trustees towards the construction of dwellings suitable for the labouring classes in accordance with their trust and towards the purchase of land for that purpose.

Every sum so advanced shall be repaid within a period not exceeding fifteen years from the time of the advance, with interest thereon at such rate, not less than three and a half per centum per annum, as may be agreed upon between the said Commissioners and trustees.

Every sum so advanced shall be advanced in accordance with the Public Works Loan Commissioners Act, 1875, and the Peabody trustees shall have full power to give such security as the Commissioners may require in pursuance of that Act, and to mortgage the estates vested in them to the Commissioners.

6. The Public Works Loan Commissioners may lend to any company, society, or association established for the purpose of constructing or improving dwellings for the labouring classes, any sum or sums to be applied towards the construction of dwellings suitable for the labouring classes, and towards the purchase of land for that purpose.

Every sum so lent shall be repaid within a period not exceeding fifteen years from the time of the advance, with interest thereon at such rate not less than three-and-a-half per centum per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Commissioners and the borrower.

Every sum so advanced shall be advanced in accordance with the Public Works Loan Commissioners Act, 1875.

7. If the Act granting money for the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners authorises the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt to advance money for such purpose, those Commissioners may, out of moneys in their hands on account of savings banks or Post Office savings banks, advance to the Public Works Loan Commissioners any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole the amount named in the said Act, during the period named in the said Act, or, if no period is named, during the financial year for which such Act was passed.

Every sum so advanced shall be placed to the account to which money issued by the Treasury to the National Debt Commissioners for the purpose of loans under the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, is, for the time being, required to be placed, and shall be held and disposed of accordingly.

Every sum so advanced shall be repaid with interest at such rate, not exceeding five per cent, per annum, within such number

1879.

of years, not exceeding thirty, as may be agreed on, with the approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, between the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt.

Every sum so advanced shall be repaid, and the interest from time to time accruing thereon shall be paid, out of the sums paid or applicable in or towards the discharge of the principal or interest of any loan granted by the Public Works Loan Commissioners whether before or after the passing of this Act, and whether before or after the advance of the said sum, and, if such sums are insufficient, shall be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.

For the purpose of such repayment a sufficient portion of the sums so paid or applicable as aforesaid shall, under the direction of the Public Works Loan Commissioners, be paid to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, and not into the receipt of the Exchequer.

The security for every sum advanced in pursuance of this section shall be given in such form and manner as may be from time to time directed by the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, and may be given and executed by the secretary to the Public Works Loan Commissioners in the name of himself and his successors on behalf of the Commissioners.

This section shall apply in the case of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland in like manner as if it were re-enacted, with the substitution of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland ” for “ the Public Works Ijoan Commissioners, ” and of Part II. of the Public Works Loans (Ireland) Act, 1877, for the Public Works Loans Act, 1875.

8. For the purpose of the provisions of the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, relating to the grant of money for the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, all money advanced by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt in pursuance of this Act shall be deemed to be money granted by Parliament for the purpose of the said loans.

Composition of Debt.

9. Whereas in pursuance of the Harbours and Passing Tolls, &c. Act, 1861, and the Isle of Man Harbours Act, 1863, and the Isle of Man Harbours Amendment Act, 1864, the Public Works Loan Commissioners advanced to the Harbour Commissioners of the Isle of Man, for the purpose of works at Port Erin in the Isle of Man, sums amounting in the aggregate to fifty-eight thousand two hundred pounds on the security of the dues leviable at Port Erin under the Isle of Man Harbours Act, 1863, and on the collateral security of a sum not exceeding one thousand six hundred pounds in any one year payable out of any surplus of the customs revenues of the Isle of Man:

And whereas by the Isle of Man Customs, Harbours, and Public Purposes Act, 1866, the said annual sum of one thousand six hundred pounds was made payable out of the sum of ten thousand pounds payable as therein mentioned out of the customs of the Isle of Man into Her Majesty’s Exchequer:

And whereas the dues leviable at Port Erin, and the said annual sum of one thousand six hundred pounds (being the security for the said loan) have proved insufficient to meet the payments in respect of principal and interest of the said loan from time to time due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and a sum of fifty-three thousand nine hundred and ninety-two pounds fifteen shillings and tenpence, besides arrears of interest, amounting on the thirty-first of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine to the sum of six thousand and eighty pounds twelve shillings and tenpence, remains due to those Commissioners:

And whereas the government of the Isle of Man, on behalf of the Isle of Man Harbour Commissioners, have offered to compound the said loan by the immediate payment of twenty thousand pounds, and it is expedient to authorise the Commissioners to accept such composition:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may compound the debt due to them from the Isle of Man Harbour Commissioners in respect of the above-mentioned loan (including therein all arrears of interest), for the sum of twenty thousand pounds, and on the payment of that sum to the Public Works Loan Commissioners the residue of the said debt shall be extinguished, and shall be considered as a free grant from Parliament, and the Acts mentioned in the schedule to this Act shall be repealed to the extent in the third column of that schedule mentioned.

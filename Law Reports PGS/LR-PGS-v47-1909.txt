(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several focal loans specified in the Schedule to this Act should, to the extent specified in the last column of that Schedule, not be reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887; therefore, the principal of the said loans shall to that extent be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay that loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

Section 2.

for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees, ” as-defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the “ surplus herring-brand fees ” of any one year should only be applicable to the-repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the* repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees ” so pledged as aforesaid, was in the year ending the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and eight, insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of one hundred and fifty-one pounds seventeen shillings and twopence, with interest amounting to one hundred and thirteen pounds seventeen shillings and elevenpence, now-remains unpaid and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable:

Therefore the said principal sum of one hundred and fifty-one pounds seventeen shillings and twopence shall be extinguished and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and thirteen pounds seventeen shillings and elevenpence shall be remitted.

this Act, be one-eightieth instead of one-sixtieth, and accordingly section two of the Superannuation Act, 1859, shall, as respects such civil servants, have effect as if for the words “sixtieth” and “sixtieths, ” wherever they occur, there were substituted the words “eightieth ” and “ eightieths.”

(2) The Treasury may grant by way of additional allowance to any such civil servant who retires after having served for not less than two years, in addition to the superannuation allowance (if any) to which he may become entitled or the gratuity (if any) which may be granted to him under section six of the Superannuation Act, 1859, a lump sum equal to one-thirtieth of the annual salary and emoluments of his office multiplied by the number of completed years he has served, so, however, that the additional allowance shall in no case exceed one and a half times the amount of such salary and emoluments:

Provided that, if a civil servant retires from the service after attaining the age of sixty-five years, there shall be deducted from the amount of the additional allowance which would otherwise be payable to him one-twentieth of that amount for every completed year he has served after attaining that age.

2. — (1) Where a male civil servant who enters the service after the passing of this Act dies, after he has served five years or upwards, whilst still employed in the service, the Treasury may grant to his legal personal representatives a gratuity equal to the annual salary and emoluments of his office:

Provided that, if he dies after attaining the age of sixty-five years, the amount of the gratuity which may be so granted shall be reduced by one-twentieth of that amount for every completed year he has served after attaining that age.

(2) Where any such civil servant having become entitled to a superannuation allowance dies after he has retired from the service, and the sums actually received by him at the time of his death on account of such superannuation allowance, together with the sum received by him by way of additional allowance, are less than the amount of the annual salary and emoluments of his office, the Treasury may grant to his legal personal representatives a gratuity equal to the deficiency.

3. — (1) Subject to regulations made by the Treasury, the Treasury may allow any male civil servant who has entered the service before the date of the passing of this Act, and who at that date is under sixty years of age, to adopt the provisions of this Act, and in such case there may be granted to him or his legal personal representatives such superannuation and other allowances and gratuity as might have been granted had he entered the service after the passing of this Act, except that the amount of the additional allowance payable on retirement shall be increased by one-half per cent, in respect of each completed year he had served at the passing of this Act.

(2) Nothing in this Act shall affect the right to superannuation allowance or gratuity of a civil servant who has entered the

5. A warrant framed by the Treasury under section one of Power to re-the Superannuation Act, 1887, with respect to the grant of ^armn”sunder gratuities and allowances to civil servants injured in the dis- so & 51 Vict. charge of their duty may be revoked or from time to time varied c*67- »•

by a fresh warrant, and every such warrant shall be laid before Parliament.

6. — (1) It shall be lawful for the Treasury to grant to any Compensation person retiring or removed from the public service in con- Ration sequence of the abolition of his office, or for the purpose of of 0 ce‘ facilitating improvements in the organisation of the department

to which he belonged, by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected, such special allowance or allowances by way of compensation as on a full consideration of the circumstances of the case seem to the Treasury to be a reasonable and just compensation for the loss of office, but not exceeding in any case the amount which a civil servant would be entitled to, or which might be granted to a civil servant, if he retired on the ground of ill-health.

(2) The foregoing provision shall apply only to persons entering the service after the date of the passing of this Act, and shall apply to those persons in substitution for section seven of the Superannuation Act, 1859.

Nothing herein contained shall affect the application of the said section seven of the Superannuation Act, 1859, to persons who have entered the service before that date or the practice of the Treasury thereunder.

7. — (1) The Treasury may from time to time make rules for Buies, the purpose of carrying this Act into effect and for making such adaptations and modifications of the provisions of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1892, and other enactments relating to superannuation allowances and pensions of persons who have served partly in the civil service and partly in some other service entitling them to a pension as, may be necessary for adapting those provisions to the provisions of this Act, and for altering

the rules made by the Treasury under the Superannuation Act,

1892.

(2) Before any rules made under this section come into force, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for

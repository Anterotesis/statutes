(6.) The proviso in section two of the Act for the valuation of lauds and heritages in Scotland passed in the session of the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter ninety-one, and section fifteen of the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act, 1868, shall be repealed:Provided that in any county in Scotland the commissioners of supply,

(7.) In Ireland where the owner of a dwelling-house is rated instead of the occupier, the occupier shall nevertheless be entitled to be registered as a voter, and to vote under the same conditions under which an occupier of a dwelling-house in England is entitled in pursuance of the Poor Kate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869, and the Acts amending the same, to be registered as a voter, and to vote where the owner is rated, and the enactments referred to in the First Schedule to this Act shall apply to Ireland accordingly, with the modifications in that schedule mentioned.

(8.)

(9.) (In any part of the United Kingdom where a man inhabits a dwelling-house in respect of which no person is rated by reason of such dwelling-house belonging to or being occupied on behalf of the Crown, or by reason of any other ground of exemption, such person shall not be disentitled to be registered as a voter, and to vote by reason only that no one is rated in respect of such dwelling-house, and that no rates are paid in respect of the same, and it shall be the duty of the persons making out the rate book or valuation roll to enter any such dwelling-house as last aforesaid in the rate book or valuation roll, together with the name of the inhabitant occupier thereof., J.

10. Nothing in this Act shall deprive any person (who at the date of the passing of this Act is registered in respect of any qualification to vote for any county or borough,) of his right to be from time to time registered and to vote for such county or borough in respect of such qualification in like manner as if this Act had not passed.

Provided that where a man is so registered in respect of the county or borough occupation franchise by virtue of a qualification

WHEREAS with a view to the speedy completion of a railway in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope between Hopetown, on the Orange River, and Kimberley, in pursuance of Act number thirty-six of 1884 of the Legislature of the said Colony (the short title of which is the Orange River and Kimberley Railway Act, 1884), it is expedient to authorise a temporary advance out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, to the Government of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope:

And whereas the said Government has undertaken to submit to the Legislature of the said Colony at the first opportunity a law for securing the repayment of the said advance and the payment of the interest thereon, and for the appropriation of the advance to the completion of the said railway, and for the raising of the further funds (if any) which that completion requires, and for the other matters necessary for carrying into effect the arrangement between the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury (in this Act referred to as the Treasury) and the Government of the said Colony regarding the said advance, and the said Government have undertaken to promote the passing of such law by the said Legislature:

And whereas the said Government has undertaken to make arrangements for completing the said railway within a period of eight months from the date of the passing of this Act:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Cape of Good Hope (Advance) Act, 1885.

2. (1.) For the purpose of assisting the Government of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope to make a railway from Hope-town, on the Orange River, to Kimberley, in the said Colony, the Treasury may from time to time during the twelve months ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, upon such evidence of the progress of the said railway works and of the money expended thereon as the Treasury from time to time require, advance to the said Government on the security herein-after mentioned, any Rum or sums not exceeding in the whole four hundred thousand pounds, to be applied by the said Government in making the said railway.

3. (1.) An advance shall not be made in pursuance of this Act until the Government of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope him deposited, in such manner as the Treasury require, such number of the debentures herein-after mentioned as in nominal amount are equal to the amount of the said advance with an addition of one sixteenth of the amount of such advance.

(2.)

(3.) If the Legislature of the said Colony do not within a reasonable time pass a law providing to the satisfaction of the Treasury for securing the repayment of the advances under this Act and the payment of the interest thereon and for the appropriation of the advances to the completion of the said railway, and for the raising of the further funds (if any) which such completion requires, and for the other matters necessary for carrying into effect the arrangement between the Treasury and the Government of the said Colony regarding the said advance, or if through any cause within the control of the said Government the said railway be not completed within the period of eight months from the date of the passing of this Act the Treasury may refuse to make any further advance in pursuance of this Act, and the said Government shall pay interest at the rate of five instead of three and a half per cent, per annum on the advances already made, from the dates on which they were first made until they are repaid.

4.

In filling up the return it must be recollected that, under the Representation of the People Acts, —

(a.) In the case of a man who inhabits by reason of any office, service, or employment, if the same house is inhabited by any person under whom such man serves in his office, service, or employment, such man is not considered a separate inhabitant occupier; for example, a butler occupying rooms in his master's house is not such an occupier, although, if he occupied rooms over a detached building, such as a laundry, he might be such an occupier;

(5.) The head of the family alone is considered to be the occupier.

Instructions in the case of a Home let in separate Tenements,

The dwelling-house in the second column may be any room or rooms in the house which are separately occupied as a dwelling.

Insert in the second column the position of the room or rooms occupied; for example, “ first floor, front room.”

In the third column insert, opposite to the description of the room or rooms in the second column, the name of the man who now inhabits it or them, and has so inhabited since the fifteenth day of July last.

If any room or rooms have not been so inhabited state so, or omit the room or rooms from the second column.

In filling up the return it must be recollected that, under the Representation of the People Acts, —

(a.) A man who occupies separately any room or rooms in a house must be entered, although he is entitled to the joint use of some other part of the house; for example, a man occupying separately the first floor front rooms, and having joint use of a wash-house, must be entered: (5.) The head of the family alone is considered to be the occupier.

If the landlord of a house let out in separate tenements lives in the house, he must not return the names of the occupiers of tenements in that house.

(a.) where the parish or township is situate both in a municipal and

also in a parliamentary borough by the town clerk of the municipal borough; and

(5.) where the parish or township is situate in a municipal borough, wholly or partly comprised in the area of a parliamentary borough which after the dissolution of the Parliament existing in January one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five ceases to be a parliamentary borough, by the town clerk of such municipal borough; and

(c.) where a parish or township is situate in a parliamentary but not in a municipal borough, then by the person acting under the Parliamentary Registration Acts as town clerk of such parliamentary borough.

2. Where a parish or township is situate partly within and partly without the boundary of a parliamentary borough, or any such municipal borough wholly or partly comprised in the area of a former parliamentary borough as above mentioned, each such part of a parish is deemed to be a separate parish for the purposes of these instructions and the following forms; and the town clerk must add to his precept to the overseers of such parish or township a note to the effect that his precept applies only to that portion of the parish or township which} is situate within the said boundary, and that the lists of all the voters for that portion must be made out separately, and that any reference in the precept to the parish or township means only that portion of the parish or township which is situate within the said boundary.

3. Where a parish or township is situate within a parliamentary but not within a municipal borough, the town clerk will omit from his precept, and from the forms sent to the overseers of such parish or township, so much as relates to burgesses; that is to say, in the precept paragraphs two, eight, and fifteen, and so much of the heading and of paragraphs twelve, fourteen, sixteen, twenty-two, twenty-seven, thirty, thirty-five, and thirty-six as is placed between asterisks.

If there is no corrupt and illegal practices list, the town clerk will omit from the precept and Forms all parts relating to it.

In the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, the town clerk will inform the overseers that any corrupt and illegal practices list made with reference to any voters disqualified by any Act passed during the present Session does not apply to burgess lists, and will omit so much of the precept as relates to the old lodgers list, and the Forms relating to that list, in every case where the parish was not, in one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, in a Parliamentary borough.

4. Where a parish or township is not situate within a parliamentary

borough, the town clerk must substitute in his precept for the expression “parliamentary borough, ” the expression “[division of the]

county of , ” and make the necessary consequential substi-

tution in the precept and forms of “ division ” or “ county ” for “ borough, ” and must make the alterations mentioned in the marginal notes to this precept, and must add the following paragraphs (i. to v.):—

property.

General qualifications.

12. The nature of the qualification should be entered as nearly as possible in accordance with the words of the statute conferring the franchise; for instance: —

(a.) The nature of the ten pounds occupation qualification of a person should be stated thus: — “tenement* or “ land, '' or “land and tenement, '* or in the case of a joint occupation “ tenement (joint), *' or “ land (joint), ” or in the case of a successive occupation “ tenement (successive) or “ land (successive).

(5.) Where a parish is situate in a municipal borough and the ten pounds qualification is also a qualification for a burgess, the nature of the qualification should be stated by a description of the tenement thus: — “ house, “ shop, ” “ warehouse, ” or “ building, ” or “ chambers, ” or as the case may be, or in the case of a joint occupation “ house (joint), “ shop (joint), ” “ warehouse, joint, ” or as the case may be, or in the. case of a successive occupation “ shop (successive), ” or as the case may be.

(c.) The nAture of a household qualification should be stated thus, “ dwelling-house, ” or in the case of successive occupation “ dwelling-house (successive).' *

(</.) *Thc nature of a qualification for a burgess only should be stated thus, “ house, ” “ warehouse, ” “ counting-house, ” “ chambers, ” or as the case may be, with the addition of “joint” or “successive* if necessary.

Where the same property constitutes both a ten pounds occupation qualification and a household qualification, the nature of the qualification should be entered as “ dwelling-house, ”* and that statement will suffice although the property also qualifies for a burgess.

If the description indicates the nature of the qualification, as, for instance, if a ten pounds occupation qualification consists of a house and is entered as a dwelling-house, such description will be sufficient.

Any description of the nature of the qualification further than that above mentioned is superfluous and should not be given.

13. The description of any qualifying property should specify the name and situation of that property, and for that purpose should either state the name (if any) of the street, lane, or other locality, and the number (if any) in such street, lane, or other locality of such property, or the name of the occupying tenant, and the description of the qualifying property should in all cases be such as will afford full and sufficient means of identifying such property.

14. Where several qualifications are possessed by the same person, the particulars respecting each qualification should be stated in the list; *and in the case of a list made out in divisions, where a person is entered in division one in respect of one qualification for parliamentary purposes, and

1885.

67

Registration, 1885. Ch. 15.

in respect of another qualification for municipal purposes, each such qualification should be distinguished in the list by a note to the effect that the qualification is for parliamentary purposes only, or for municipal purposes only, as the case may be.

15. If your parish [or township] is situate in a municipal borough the occupiers list (mentioned hereafter in paragraph thirty sub-paragraph (a)) is to be made out in three divisions:

Division one is to comprise the names of the persons entitled both to be registered as parliamentary voters in respect of a ten pounds occupation or household qualification, and to be enrolled as burgesses.

Division two is to comprise the names of the persons entitled to be registered as parliamentary voters in respect of a ten pounds occupation or household qualification, but not to be enrolled os burgesses. Division three is to comprise the names of the persons entitled to be enrolled as burgesses, but not to be registered as parliamentary voters in respect of a ten pounds occupation or household qualification.

16. You should omit from any list of parliamentary voters (other than the old lodgers list) *and from any list of burgesses* the name of any person —

(a) whom from the returns furnished by the registrar of births and deaths, or from your own knowledge, you know to be dead; or (5) who is not qualified by reason of the nonpayment of rates; or (c) who is disqualified by reason of having received parochial relief; or (d)twhose name is entered in the corrupt and illegal practices list.f

17. In making out the old lodgers list (mentioned hereafter in paragraph thirty, sub-paragraph (c)), if you have reason to believe that any person whose name is entered on that list is dead, or is not entitled to be registered, you should make a note to that effect in the margin of the list.

18. The1 registrars of births and deaths are required to send to you, periodically, returns of the names and residences of all male persons of full age dying within your parish [or township], and you must examine those returns to see whether any person who otherwise would appear in the list of voters is dead, and yon are to pay the registrars, as part of your expenses ^connected with registration, a fee of twopence for each return, and a further fee of twopence for every death entered in such returns.

In the months of April and May, or one of them, you are to inquire or ascertain with respect to all property in your parish [or township] which comprises any dwelling-house (including under the term any part of a house separately occupied as a dwelling), whether any man, other than the owner or other person rated or liable, to be rated in respect of such property, is entitled to be registered as a voter in respect of a household qualification by reason of his being an inhabitant occupier of such dwelling-house, and you are to enter in the rate book, in a separate column added for the purpose, the name of every man so entitled and the situation or description of the dwelling-house in respect of which he is entitled.

If any property, whether by reason of belonging to the Crown or otherwise, is not rated, you must act under this paragraph in the same manner as if it were rated.

4. Where, on the revision of the list or lists of voters for any count}-, city, town, or borough in Ireland, the matter stated in a list or claim, or proved to the revising barrister in relation to any alleged right to be on any list, is, in the judgment of the revising barrister, insufficient in law to constitute a qualification of the nature or description stated or claimed, but sufficient in law to constitute a qualification of some other nature or description, the revising barrister, if the name is entered in a list for which such true qualification in law is appropriate, shall correct such entry by inserting such qualification accordingly, and in any other case shall insert the name with such qualification in the appropriate list, and shall expunge it from the other list, if any, in which it is entered, except as herein provided; and whether any person is objected to or not, no evidence shall be given of any other qualification than that which is described in the list or claim, as the case may be, nor shall the revising barrister be at liberty to change the description of

An objection made under this Act by a clerk of union, collector-general, town clerk, or clerk of the peace shall be deemed to cast upon the person objected to the burden of proving his right to be on the list:

The prim ft facie proof shall be deemed to be given by the objector if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court by evidence, repute, or otherwise that there is reasonable ground for believing that the objection is well founded, and that by reason of the person objected to not being present for examination, or for some other reason, the objector is prevented from discovering or proving the truth respecting the entry objected to:

(10.) If such proof is given by the objector as herein prescribed, or if the objection is by a clerk of union, collector-general, town clerk, or clerk of the peace, then unless the person objected to appears by himself or by some person on his behalf, and proves that he was entitled on the twentieth day of July then next preceding to have his name inserted in the list in respect of the qualification described in such list, the court of revision shall expunge the name of the person objected to.

East India Unclaimed Stock Act, 1885.

And whereas no distribution can at present be made of such unclaimed annuities, and it is expedient to authorise the Secretary of State to suspend payment of a portion of the annuity equal in amount to such unclaimed annuities:

And whereas it is also expedient to provide for the repayment by the Company to the Secretary of State of any annuities other than the said unclaimed annuities representing the said unclaimed capital stock already received by the Company which may remain in the hands of the Company unclaimed for ten years, and further to authorise the Secretary of State to suspend payment of a portion of the annuity equal in amount to such annuities so remaining unclaimed:

And whereas by section eighteen of the Purchase Act the Board of Directors of the Company were directed to divide the annuitants into two classes to be called respectively Class A and Class B, and provision was made by section twenty-three of the said Act for the creation of a sinking fund attached to annuities of Class B derived from the investment of certain deductions to be made from annuities of that class as thereby provided, and it is expedient that so much of the accumulations of the said sinking fund as may be attributable to unclaimed annuities should be repaid to the Secretary of State when the sinking fund shall be distributed according to the provisions of section twenty-five of the said Act:

And whereas it is expedient that the Purchase Act should be amended:It is hereby enacted as follows:

(1.) Nothing in this section contained shall alter or affect the liability of the Company under the Purchase Act with regard to the moneys before the passing of this Act received by them in respect of the said unclaimed annuities representing the said sum of twenty-three thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds unclaimed capital stock of the Company.

(2.) The Secretary of State may henceforth suspend payment to the Company of a portion of the annuity equal in amount to the said unclaimed annuities representing the said sum of twenty-three thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds.

(3.) If and whenever any annuities (other than annuities before the passing of this Act paid by the Secretary of State to the Company in respect of the said unclaimed capital stock of the Company) shall have remained or shall remain after payment by the Secretary of State to the Company in the hands of the Company unclaimed for a period of ten years, such annuities shall be repaid to the Secretary of State by the Company less any sum by the Purchase Act authorised to be deducted by the Board of Directors of the Company in respect of the said sinking fund attached to annuities of the said Class B and in respect of expenses in relation to annuities of either class.

(4.) The Secretary of State may, after any such repayment, suspend payment to the Company of a portion of the annuity equal in amount to the annuities which have so remained unclaimed for such period of ten years: Provided that if there be comprised in any such unclaimed annuities any annuities of the said Class B, the Secretary of State shall, at the times and in the manner by the Purchase Act prescribed for payment

220

Ch. 25. East India Unclaimed Stock Act, 1885. 48 & 49 Vict.

(6.) The Board of Directors of the Company, when the time for division of the moneys representing the accumulations of the said sinking fund shall arrive, shall pay to the Secretary of State such part of such accumulations as may be represented by any annuities of the said Class B at that time unclaimed.

(7.) The Secretary of State shall hold any moneys representing unclaimed annuities at any time repaid to him by the Company and any moneys paid to him by the Board of Directors on the eventual division of the said sinking fund, and any annuities his obligation to pay which is under this Act at any time suspended, subject to the claim of any person who may at any time, in manner by this Act provided, establish his claim thereto, and subject to such claims the Secretary of State may apply such moneys as part of the revenues of India, or otherwise as he may think fit.

(8.) The Secretary of State shall be bound to indemnify the Company against all claims in respect of any moneys representing unclaimed annuities at any time repaid to him by the Company, and of any moneys paid to him by the Board of Directors of the Company, on the eventual division of the said sinking fund, and of any annuities his obligation to pay which is under this Act at any time suspended; and the remedy of any person claiming to be entitled to any such moneys or annuities shall be against the Secretary of State in manner by this Act provided, and not against the Company.

(9.) If and whenever any person claiming to be entitled to any moneys representing unclaimed annuities at any time repaid to the Secretary of State by the Company, or to any moneys paid to the Secretary of State by the Board of Directors of the Company on the eventual division of the said sinking fund, or to any unclaimed annuities the payment of which has under any provision of this Act been suspended, establishes his right thereto respectively to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall forthwith, free of all expense to the claimant, pay to such person the moneys to which he has so established his claim, and shall, if the claim be in respect of unclaimed annuities, give notice in writing to the Board of Directors of the Company that such claim has been so established, and thereupon the said Board shall enter the name of such claimant in the proper register

The Secretary of State shall require the applicant to give such public notice as the Secretary of State thinks fit by advertisement in one or more newspapers circulating in London and elsewhere, and such notice shall contain such particulars as the case requires and as the Secretary of State directs.

(11.)

The said sums so repaid to the Secretary of State may be applied by him as part of the revenues of India or otherwise as the Secretary of State may think fit, subject to the claims of the parties entitled thereto.

19. Where any person claims to be entitled to any sum repaid to the Secretary of State under the last preceding section, the Secretary of State may, on such person showing his right thereto to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State, pay such sum to such person; but in case the Secretary of State is not satisfied of the right of such person, then the person claiming to be entitled to any sum repaid to the Secretary of State may state and verify his claim by petition in the Chancery Division of the High Court in England in a summary way in manner provided by this Act with respect to petitions for stock or dividends; and the provisions of this Act with regard to such petitions and the proceedings consequent thereon shall, with any necessary modifications, apply to claims under this section.

Miscellaneous.

2L No stamp duty shall be paid or chargeable in respect of the transfer of any stock or annuity to or from the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of this Act.

22. Whereas provision ha9 been made for the appointment of a Government director by the Secretary of State on the Boards of certain Indian railway companies; and in some cases the Secretary of State is empowered to appoint a person to represent the Government director at Board meetings and otherwise; and it is expedient that in all cases the Secretary of State should have such power:It is hereby enacted as follows:

It shall be lawful for the Secretary of State, in the case of any Indian railway company, where under his contract with that company he has the power to appoint a Government director but not a person to represent him, from time to time to appoint a person to represent the Government director in his absence at the Board of any such Indian railway company, and any deputy so appointed shall have and may exercise (subject to any regulations of the Secretary of State) all or any of the powers of the Government director.

23. (1.) Notwithstanding any provision in any Act of Parliament or deed of settlement or other instrument founding or regulating a company to the contrary, it shall be lawful for any Indian railway company, from time to time, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, and subject to such regulations and conditions as he may think fit to impose, —

(a.) to issue debenture bonds payable to bearer, which shall be negotiable by delivery;

(b.) to issue debenture bonds payable to order, which shall be negotiable by indorsement of the holder;

(c.) to issue debenture bonds payable in rupee currency;

(d.)to make provision for the exchange of debenture bonds on the application of the holder for debenture bonds of any other form or kind issued by the company.

And whereas under certain contracts made with divers Indian railway companies before the passing of the Redemption Act, the Secretary of State is enabled on terms therein specified to purchase their undertakings either for a capital sum or by means of the creation and grant of an annuity; and whereas the power to create such annuities constitutes a liability contingently chargeable, though not actually charged, on the revenues of India at the date of the passing of the said Act; and whereas it is expedient that. the provisions of the Redemption Act should apply to such annuities as and when created:It is hereby enacted as follows:

(1.) When the Secretary of State redeems any annuities of the said Class B, he shall be liable in respect of his holding from time to time to contribute rateably with other annuitants to the sinking fund attached to annuities of the said Class B; and in other respects he shall be liable to, and shall have the benefit of the provisions of sections forty-nine and fifty of the Purchase Act, and on the distribution of the sinking fund attached to annuities of the said Class B, he shall be entitled to receive such share of the sum then distributed as may be attributable to any annuities so redeemed; and any sums which he may contribute to the sinking fund created by the Purchase Act which may be attributable to any annuities redeemed by him

CHAPTER 38.

An Act to amend the Law relating to School Boards so far as affected by the incorporation of a Municipal Borough and as respects the divisions of the Metropolis.

[31st July 1885.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. Whereas by sub-section one of section two hundred and thirteen of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, it is enacted as follows:

“ Where a petition for a charter is referred to the Committee “ of Council, and it is proposed by the charter to extend the “ Municipal Corporation Acts to the municipal borough to be “ created by the charter, the Committee of Council may settle a “ scheme for the adjustment of the powers, rights, privileges, “ franchises, duties, property, and liabilities of any then existing “ local authority whose district comprises the whole or part of the area of that borough, either with or without any adjoining “ or other place, and also of any officer of that authority

And whereas sub-section six of the same section two hundred and thirteen provides that a local authority for the purposes of the above enactment shall mean the authorities therein mentioned, “ and “ any other authority not in this section excepted and not being “ a school board, and having powers of local government and of “ rating for public purposes: *

And whereas difficulties have arisen respecting the effect of the creation by a charter of a municipal borough, where the whole or part of the area of such borough is comprised in the district of a school board, and it is expedient to authorize the removal of such difficulties by a scheme under the said Act:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

(1.) The words “ and not being a school board ” in sub-section six of section two hundred and thirteen of the Municipal Corporations Act are hereby repealed;

A scheme under that section if affecting a school board —

(a) shall before being settled by the Committee of Council be referred to the consideration of the Education Department; and

(h) shall not place the new borough under more than one school board; and

(c) may provide for the continuance of any byelaws in force at the date of the scheme.

(2.) Where within seven years before the passing of this Act a charter has extended the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, or the Acts thereby consolidated to the municipal borough created by the charter, any scheme relating to a school board which might have been made under the said Acts if this Act had passed at the date of the said charter may be made after the passing of this Act, and Part Eleven of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, shall apply accordingly: Provided that —

(a) such scheme may be made on the petition either of the council of the said borough or of the persons who composed the school board, or any of them; and

(b) the council of the borough may petition against such scheme in accordance with sub-section four of section two hundred and thirteen of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882; and

(c) any such scheme may validate any acts done by the Education Department or the school board or the council of the borough or any justice since the date of the charter.

(3.) This section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any powers in relation to school boards for the time being vested in the Committee of the Lords of the Privy Council on Education (who are in this section referred to as the Education Department).

2. Whereas by the Elementary Education Act, 1870, it was enacted that the School Board for London should consist of such number of members elected by the divisions of the metropolis specified in the Fifth Schedule to that Act as the Education Department might by order fix, and power was given to the Education Department from time to time to alter by way of increase or decrease the number of members of any of the said divisions, but no power was given to alter the said divisions, and it is expedient to divide the Lambeth division into two divisions;

Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

(1.) The Lambeth division of the metropolis for the purpose of the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 and 1873, shall be divided into two divisions, named East Lambeth and West Lambeth, and the Fifth Schedule to the Elementary Education Act, 1870, shall be construed as if for “ Lambeth ” there were substituted “ East Lambeth ” and “ West Lambeth/ '

(2.) The Education Department shall, so soon as maybe after the passing of this Act, by order determine the boundaries of the divisions of East Lambeth and West Lambeth for the purposes aforesaid and the number of members to be elected by each of such divisions, subject nevertheless to any subsequent alteration of the number of members in pursuance of the said Acts.

(3.) At the first election of the School Board for London which is held after the passing of this Act, members shall be elected for the two divisions constituted by this Act; but nothing in this Act shall affeyt the School Board for London until such members come into office.

3. This Act may be cited as the School Boards Act, 1885.

This Act, so far as relates to school boards on the incorporation of a municipal borough, shall be construed as one with the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and together with that Act may be cited as the Municipal Corporation Acts, 1882 and 1885.

This Act, so far as regards the divisions of the metropolis, shall be construed as one with the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 and 1873, and may be cited together with those Acts as the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 to 1885.

the credit of the Greenwich Hospital Income Account.

If in any year the money standing to the credit of that account should prove inadequate to meet the expenditure chargeable on it, it shall be the duty of Her Majesty's Paymaster-General from time to time, under the direction of the Admiralty, to carry over from the Greenwich Hospital Capital Account such sums as may be required to make good any such deficiency.

Earldom of Mar Restitution Act, 1885.

VICTORIA R.

CHAPTER 48.

An Act for restitution of the ancient dignity and title of Earl of Mar.

[6th August 1885.]

WHEREAS Isabella Countess of Mar in the peerage of Scotland, being by lawful descent from her ancestors entitled to the ancient territorial earldom of Mar, did, on the ninth day of December one thousand four hundred and four, intermarry with Alexander Stewart, and by a Charter of the same date (which was afterwards confirmed by a Charter of Robert the Third, King of the Scots), granted to the said Alexander Stewart the earldom of Mar and the lands therein mentioned, to hold to him and the heirs between him and herself begotten, whom failing, to her lawful heirs on either side:

And whereas the said Isabella Countess of Mar died in or soon after the year one thousand four hundred and seven without having had any issue; and during the interval between her death and the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-five the succession and inheritance to the said earldom which she had so inherited as aforesaid was treated by successive Kings of the Scots as if the same had been lawfully surrendered or merged in the Crown:

And whereas in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-five, John, then Lord Erskine, was the lawful heir general of the said Countess Isabella who, if the said ancient territorial earldom of Mar, and the dignity of Earl of Mar in the peerage of Scotland, had not been by any lawful means extinguished, was then entitled thereto:

And whereas by a Charter bearing date the twenty-third day of June one thousand five hundred and sixty-five, after reciting that Isabella Countess of Mar was the hereditary proprietor of the earldom of Mar and of the lordship and regality of Garioch, and that the said John Lord Erskine had then the undoubted hereditary right of the said earldom, lordship, and regality, notwithstanding that his predecessors were kept out of the same partly by reason of the quarrels occurring at the time, and partly by the unjust refutations and hindrances made by obstinate and partial rulers and officers, refusing the reasonable prayers and petitions made by the predecessors of the said John Lord Erskine often and earnestly praying and soliciting their entry to the hereditary possession of the same, Mary, Queen of the Scots, did, for those and other considerations therein mentioned, and also as being moved by conscience to restore the lawful heirs to their just inheritances, give and grant to the said John Lord Erskine, his heirs and assigns hereditarily, all and whole the said earldom of Mar containing the lands therein mentioned, and all and singular the lands of the said lordship and regality of Garioch:

And whereas on and after the first day of August one thousand five hundred and sixty-five the said John Lord Erskine sat as Earl of Mar in the Privy Council of Scotland, and between that date and the time of the union between the Crowns of England and Scotland

280

Ch. 48. Earldom of Mar Restitution Act, 1885. 48 & 49 Vict.

he and his successors in the direct male line sat as Earls of Mar in the Parliament of Scotland:

And whereas from the time of the said union till the nineteenth day of January one thousand seven hundred and fifteen the descendants of the said John Lord Erskine in the direct male line continued to hold and to enjoy the title and dignity of Earls of Mar in the peerage of Scotland:

And whereas by an Act passed in the first year of King George the First, John, then Earl of Mar, was, as from the nineteenth day of January one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, attainted of high treason:

And whereas by another Act passed in the fifth year of .King George the Fourth, after reciting that John Francis Erskine, Esquire, of Mar, was the grandson and lineal representative of the said John Earl of Mar, it was enacted that the said John Francis Erskine, and all other persons who would be entitled after him to succeed to the honours, dignities, and titles of Earl of Mar, in case the said Act of the first year of King George the First had not been made, should be and they were thereby restored to the honours, dignities, and titles of Earl of Mar, with all rights, privileges, and pre-eminences thereunto belonging, as fully, amply, and honourably as if the said Act had never been made, notwithstanding the said Act, or corruption of blood thereupon ensuing:

And whereas after the passing of the said last-mentioned Act the earldom of Mar thereby restored, descended successively to the son and grandson of the said John Francis Erskine; and, upon the death of his grandson John Francis Miller, Earl of Mar, without issue in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, the right of succession to the ancient honour and dignity of Earl of Mar was claimed by his nephew and heir general, John Francis Erskine Goodeve Erskine (who is now the lawful heir general of the said Isabella Countess of Mar and of the said John Lord Erskine respectively):

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven Walter Coningsby Earl of. Kellie, a grandson and then heir of the aforesaid John Francis Earl of Mar, the grandfather of the said John Francis Miller Earl of Mar (who was himself heir in the direct male line of the said John Lord Erskine), presented his petition to Her Majesty, claiming to be entitled to the honour and dignity of Earl of Mar, which petition was in the usual manner referred to the House of Lords, and was considered and heard by the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords:

And whereas on such hearing and consideration the said Committee of Privileges was of opinion that the said Charter of restitution of Mary Queen of the Scots did not operate or extend to restore to John, then Lord Erskine, the ancient honour, dignity, and title of peerage of Earl of Mar, but only to restore to and re-vest in him the lands belonging to the said ancient territorial earldom; and that in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-five a new honour, dignity, and title of peerage as Earl of Mar, descendible to the heirs male of his body, was created by Mary Queen of the Scots in favour of the said John Lord Erskine:

1885.

281

Earldom of Mar Restitution Act, 1885. Ch. 48.

And whereas upon the twenty-sixth day of February one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five the House of Lords, upon the report of the said Committee of Privileges, resolved that Walter Henry Earl of Kellie (to whom, by the death of his father the said Walter Coningsby Earl of Kellie, the right and title of his said father had then descended) had made out his claim to the honour and dignity of Earl of Mar in the peerage of Scotland created in one thousand five hundred and sixty-five, and the right of the said Walter Henry Earl of Kellie to such last-mentioned honour and dignity was thereby established:

And whereas doubts may exist whether the said ancient honour, dignity, and title of peerage of Earl of Mar, which so descended to the said Isabella Countess of Mar as aforesaid, was or was not, previously to the said year one thousand five hundred and sixty-five, by any lawful means surrendered or merged in the Crown:

And whereas until the decision of the House of Lords upon the claim of the said Earl of Kellie the said ancient honour, dignity, and title of peerage of Earl of Mar was commonly reputed to be still subsisting, and to have been enjoyed and possessed by the said John Lord Erskine, his heirs and successors:

And whereas the said John Francis Erskine Goodeve Erskine hath upon all occasions conducted himself loyally and dutifully towards Your Majesty, and it is expedient that he should be placed by the authority of Parliament in the same position as if the honours, dignities, and titles of peerage which anciently belonged to the said territorial earldom of Mar had not been treated as if they had been surrendered or merged in the Crown, or had been by the said Charter of restitution of Mary Queen of the Scots expressly and effectually restored to the said John Lord Erskine:

May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. The said John Francis'Erskine Goodeve Erskine, and all other persons who would be entitled after him to succeed to the honours, dignities, and titles of peerage anciently belonging to or enjoyed and held with the territorial earldom of Mar, which so descended to Isabella Countess of Mar as aforesaid, in case the said honours, dignities, and titles had never been by any lawful means forfeited or surrendered, or in case (being so forfeited or surrendered) they had been expressly and effectually restored to the said John Lord Erskine and his lawful heirs general by the herein-before recited Charter of Mary Queen of the Scots, shall be, and they are hereby restored to the said ancient honours, dignities, and titles of peerage, as fully and effectually to all intents and purposes as if the same had, without any impediment, descended to the said John Lord Erskine, or had been duly expressly and effectually restored to the said John Lord Erskine and his lawful heirs general by the said Charter of Mary Queen of the Scots, or by other means effectual in law.

2. Nothing herein contained shall affect or in any manner prejudice the right or title of Walter Henry now Earl of Mar and Kellie, his heirs and successors, or other the heirs for the time being in the

3. From and after the passing of this Act the earldom of Mar hereby restored shall be called at all elections of representative Peers for Scotland next after the Earldom of Sutherland; and the earldom of Mar now vested in the said Walter Henry Earl of Mar and Kellie shall be called at all such elections in the place and order properly belonging to an earldom created in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-five; anything in the Decreet of Ranking made on the fifth day of March one thousand six hundred and six, under the Commission issued by James the Sixth, then King of the Scots, to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

And whereas it is expedient to reduce the said amount, and also to make further provisions with respect to the charges of returning officers in Scotland, and otherwise to amend the above Acts:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act shall be construed, so far as regards England and Ireland, as one with the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers) Act, 1875, and together with that Act may be cited as the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers) Acts, 1875 and 1885, and this Act shall be construed, so far as regards Scotland, as one with the Parliamentary Elections Returning Officers Expenses (Scotland) Act, 1878, and, together with that Act, may be cited as the Parliamentary Elections Returning Officers (Scotland) Acts, 1878 and 1885, and this Act may be cited separately as the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers) Act, 1885.

2. In the Third Schedule to the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers) Act, 1875, “ twenty-five pounds ” shall be substituted for “ one fifth of the maximum according to the above scale ” in the portion thereof (above recited) relating to elections where not more candidates stand nominated than there are vacancies to be filled up.

3. In the schedule to the Parliamentary Elections Returning Officers Expenses (Scotland) Act, 1878, “ twenty-five pounds ” shall be substituted for “ one fifth of the maximum, according to the above scale, ” in the portion thereof (above recited) relating to elections where not more candidates stand nominated than there are vacancies to be filled up.

A complete specification may be left and accepted within such extended times, not exceeding one month and three months respectively after the said nine and twelve months respectively as the comptroller may on payment of the prescribed fee allow, and where such extension of time has been allowed, a further extension of four months after the said fifteen months shall be allowed for the sealing of the patent; and the principal Act shall have effect as if any time so allowed were added to the said periods specified in the principal Act.

4. Where an application for a patent has been abandoned, or become void, the specification or specifications and drawings (if any) accompanying or left in connexion with such application, shall not at any time be open to public inspection or be published by the comptroller.

5. Whereas doubts have arisen whether under the principal Act a patent may lawfully be granted to several persons jointly, some or one of whom only are or is the true and first inventors or inventor; be it therefore enacted and declared that it has been and is lawful under the principal Act to grant such a patent.

6. In subsection one of section one hundred and three of the principal Act, the words “date of the application ” shall be substituted for the words “date of the protection obtained.”

351

Public Works Loam Act, 1885. Ch. 65.

the Lough Swilly Railway Act, 1853, bj' two instalments, the sum of thirteen thousand pounds, on the security of the railway and works of such company, to be repaid within the period of fifteen years from the dates of the securities for such instalments, and bearing interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum:

And whereas in pursuance of a Treasury warrant, dated the sixth day of July one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, the said loan is to be repaid within twenty-two years from that date:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four the rate of interest on loans advanced to Irish railway companies by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland was reduced to four per cent, per annum, and it is expedient to authorise the same reduction in the case of the said loan from the Public Works Loan Commissioners: Be it therefore enacted as follows: The Public Works Loan Commissioners, with the approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, may reduce the interest payable on the balance outstanding of the loan of thirteen thousand pounds to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company to the rate of four per cent per annum as from the first day of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three.

7. Whereas by an Act of the first year of the reign of King George the Fourth, chapter eighty-four (local and personal), intituled “An Act for making and maintaining certain roads and “ bridges in the counties of Lanark and Dumbarton, ” the predecessors of the Public Works Loan Commissioners were required to advance, and accordingly advanced, in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty, to the Commissioners of Highland Roads and Bridges fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty pounds for the purpose of making and completing certain roads in the said counties; and the sum of two thousand four hundred and twenty pounds five shillings and threepence, being unexpended, was afterwards repaid, leaving a net sum of forty-nine thousand and twenty-nine pounds fourteen shillings and ninepence due in respect of the loan:

And whereas the said net sum due was in pursuance of the Acts in that behalf apportioned as follows: —

(a.) The sum of thirty-two thousand three hundred and ninety-six pounds twelve shillings and tenpence was apportioned as a debt due from the trustees of the North and South Lanarkshire roads; and (6.) The sum of sixteen thousand six hundred and thirty* three pounds one shilling and elevenpence was apportioned as a debt due from the trustees of the East and West Lanarkshire roads: And the said sums, with interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum from the twenty-second day of August one thousand eight hundred and twenty, were made payable by the said trustees respectively, and two thirds of the net surplus tolls of the respective road trusts were charged with the repayment of the said debts:

And whereas no part of the principal of either of the said debts has been repaid, and the arrears of interest due amounted to eighty-six thousand five hundred and twenty-three pounds nineteen shillings and threepence in respect of the North and South Lanarkshire roads up to the twenty-sixth day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and to the sum of forty thousand five hundred and

Ch. 65. P.vblic Works Loans Act, 1885. 48 & 49 Vict.

forty-nine pounds thirteen shillings up to the seventeenth day of February one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five in respect of the East and West Lanarkshire roads:

And whereas by the Roads and Bridges (Scotland) Act, 1878, the said roads and tolls are vested in the road trustees of the counties in which such roads are situated, and such trustees are empowered in the event of any debt on such tolls not being adjusted in conjunction with the creditor to tender to such creditor a statement of the value of such debt, which statement is to determine the value of such debt unless such creditor appeals within one month to the Debt Commissioners mentioned in the said Act, and the debt when valued is a charge on the road trustees and the local authorities of the burghs, and the assessments to be imposed under the said Act, and is to bear interest at the rate of four per centum per annum, and any debt not so valued is extinguished:

And whereas in pursuance of the said Act the road trustees have tendered to the Public Works Loan Commissioners statements of the value of the debt due from the North and South Lanarkshire road trustees, as on the fifteenth day of May one thousand eight hundred and eighty, to be six thousand two hundred and eighty-seven pounds three shillings and sevenpence, and of the debt due from the East and West Lanarkshire road trustees, as on the fifteenth day of May one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, to be four thousand five hundred and forty-nine pounds and ten shillings, and such values have been calculated on the basis of a twenty years purchase of the average annual sums received by the Public Works Loan Commissioners from the tolls of the said roads respectively during the seven years preceding the dates of such valuations:

And whereas it is expedient to authorise the Public Works Loan Commissioners to remit all sums due in respect of the said debts over and above the said values, and the interest thereon, at the rate of four per centum per annum until payment Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

The Public Works Loan Commissioners, with the approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, may remit all principal and interest due in respect of the said loans to the North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Lanarkshire road trustees which may be due over and above the sum of six thousand two hundred and eighty-seven pounds three shillings and seven-pence, and the interest thereon, in respect of the debt of the North and South Lanarkshire road trustees, and over and above the sum of four thousand five hundred and forty-nine pounds and ten shillings, and the interest thereon, in respect of the debt of the East and West Lanarkshire road trustees.

All sums so remitted shall be deemed to have been a free grant by Parliament.

8. Whereas the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, under the Labouring Classes Lodging-Houses and Dwellings Act (Ireland), 1866, advanced in the years one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, to Timothy Moore, on the security of a mortgage, dated twenty-third June one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, of certain premises situate on the North Strand, in

1885.

353

Public Works Loam Act, 1885. Ch. 65, 66.

the parish of Saint Thomas, in the city of Dublin, various sums amounting to four hundred and twenty-four pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence, to be repaid, with interest at the rate of four pounds per centum per annum, within forty years:

And whereas such sums were advanced for the purpose of the erection of buildings to be used as dwellings for the labouring classes, and were expended in such erection:

And whereas on account of the said loan there remained due in the month of November one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three a sum of four hundred and seventeen pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence in respect of principal, and twenty-two pounds four shillings and eightpence in respect of arrears of interest, and no sum has since been received:

And whereas the said mortgaged premises were held under a lease subject to the yearly rent of eighty-four pounds, and the lessor on such rent falling into arrear obtained in the month of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, judgment of ejectment for nonpayment of the said rent against the said Timothy Moore: And whereas the value of the premises was such that it was not prudent for the said Commissioners to redeem on such ejectment by paying the rent in arrear, and therefore the security of the said premises was lost to the said Commissioners, and it is considered to be impracticable to otherwise recover the said debt from the said Timothy Moore: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland may remit all principal and interest due from the said Timothy Moore under the said mortgage of the twenty-third June one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and the amount so remitted shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

CHAPTER 66.

Ch. 67. Indian Army Pension Deficiency Act, 1885. 48 & 49 Vict.

CHAPTER 67.

An Act to provide for the discharge of the liability of the Consolidated Fund in respect of certain Indian Army Pensions.

[14th August 1885.]

WHEREAS pensions and other retiring allowances (in this Act referred to as pensions) granted to persons in respect of service in Her Majesty's military forces, are paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and where such persons have served in India, a part of such pensions (in this Act referred to as Indian Army pensions) proportionate to their period of service in India ought to be repaid out of the revenues of India;

And whereas under an arrangement with the Government of India in respect of Indian Army pensions, which first came into course of payment before the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and seventy, no sum has been since the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy, or will be so repaid except as herein-after mentioned, whereby a large annual sum has become charged on and payable out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom;

And whereas in respect of the Indian Army pensions granted to men serving in regiments of the East India Company and transferred to Her Majesty's army, which first came into course of payment before the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and seventy, a sum was repaid out of the revenues of India, on account of the capital value thereof, but such sum is insufficient to cover the amount of such pensions, and thereby the deficiency has become charged on and is payable out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom;

And whereas under an arrangement with the Government of India as to repayments out of the revenues of India in respect of the Indian Army pensions which first came into course of payment during the period beginning on the first day of April one thousand 'eight hundred and seventy, the capital value thereof was to be ascertained and paid out of the revenues of India, but such arrangement in consequence of entailing a loss upon the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom has been determined and applies only to Indian Army pensions which first came into course of payment before the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four;

And whereas a portion of the capital value due under the said arrangement, has been ascertained and paid out of the revenues of India, and the remainder thereof is in course of being ascertained, and, when ascertained, will be paid out of the revenues of India;

And whereas in several years ending on the thirty-first day of March (in this Act referred to as financial year) the whole amount so paid out of the revenues of India in respect of the said capital value of Indian Army pensions was paid into the Exchequer and Applied as part of the annual revenue of the Consolidated Fund, although a portion thereof represented the capital value of the said pensions, and, by reason of such application, the Consolidated Fund is liable in future years to the payment of the said pensions without any further payment in respect thereof from the revenues of India;

188-3. Indian Army Pension Deficiency Act, 1885. Ch. 67. 355

And whereas in other financial years a portion of the amount so paid out of the revenues of India in respect of the said capital value of Indian Army pensions was paid into the Exchequer, and carried to the Consolidated Fund, and the residue thereof was paid into the Bank of England in the name of Her Majesty's Paymaster-General, and carried in his books to an account intituled “ The Indian Army Non-effective Arrears”;

And whereas the net liability of the Consolidated Fund on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four resulting from the causes above mentioned, after deducting the sums standing to the said “ Indian Army Non-effective Arrears ” account, and the sums which will be payable out of the revenues of India in respect of the capital value of Indian Army pensions has been estimated at a sum of four million two hundred thousand pounds or thereabouts;

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the gradual discharge of such liability:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Indian Army Pension Deficiency Short title. Act, 1885.

2. There shall be paid to the Commissioners for the Reduction Establishment

(b.) all sums from time to time paid out of the revenues of India to Her Majesty's Paymaster-General, in respect of the Indian Army pensions which first came into course of payment before the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, or in respect of any other Indian Army pensions mentioned in this Act; and

(c.) the annuity created by this Act.

Such moneys are in this Act referred to as the Indian Army Pension Deficiency Fund.

3. — (1.) The National Debt Commissioners shall pay out of the Application of Indian Army Pension Deficiency Fund such sums as may from time p1en, ^rmy to time be certified, by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of Deficiency State, to be estimated to be required to repay the charge payable Fund.

in any financial year in respect of Indian Army pensions which first came into course of payment during the period beginning on the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and ending on the thirty-first of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, and in respect of the Indian Army pensions which were granted to men serving in regiments of the East India Company and transferred to Her Majesty's Army, and which first came into course of payment before the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and seventy.

All money arising from the income or sale of such securities shall be carried to and form part of the Indian Army Pension Deficiency Fund, and may be invested and applied accordingly.

(2.) The National Debt Commissioners may from time to time lend to the Indian Army Pension Deficiency Fund, on the security of that fund, any moneys held by them on account of savings banks or otherwise, which they have power to invest in Government securities, and any sum so lent shall be a charge on the Indian Army Pension Deficiency Fund, and be repaid out of that fund by an annuity of such amount, and for such term as may be certified by the Comptroller or Assistant Comptroller, and the Actuary of the National Debt Office, to be sufficient to repay the sum borrowed with interest at three and a quarter per cent, per annum.

(3.) Such accounts of the Indian Army Pension Deficiency Fund shall annually be laid before Parliament as the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may direct.

(c) for any urban sanitary district by the urban sanitary authority of such district in accordance with section ten of the Public Health Act, 1875; and

(d) for any rural sanitary district, by the sanitary authority of the district upon such certificate published by the Local Government Board, and after such delay as herein-after mentioned.

(2.) A rural sanitary authority in any district desiring to adopt the said Acts may apply to the Local Government Board for the certificate required for such adoption, and shall specify in such application the area in which they consider that accommodation is necessary for the housing of the labouring classes, and thereupon the Local Government Board shall direct a local inquiry to be held by one of their inspectors, and if after such local inquiry the inspector shall certify that accommodation is necessary in such area for the housing of the labouring classes, and that there is no probability that such accommodation will be provided without the execution of the said Acts, and that having regard to the liability which will be incurred by the rates, it is under all the circumstances prudent for the said authority to undertake the provision of the said accommodation under the powers of the said Acts, the Local Government Board may if they think fit publish that certificate in the “ London Gazette, ” and thereupon the sanitary authority may adopt the said Acts: Provided that —

(a) unless the Local Government Board state in publishing such certificate that, by reason of the date of the next ordinary election of members of such authority or otherwise, an emergency renders it necessary to adopt the Acts immediately, such adoption in pursuance of the certificate shall not take place before the ordinary election of members of such authority which is held next after the date of the local inquiry; and

(b) after the end of twelve months from the date of the certificate the Acts shall not be adopted without a fresh certificate; and

The provisions of this enactment with respect to the burden of the expenses shall apply upon every application for a fresh certificate.

(4.) When the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses Acts, 1851 to 1867, have been adopted by the Metropolitan Board of Works, or by any sanitary authority, or by the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, then

(b) all expenses incurred by such board or authority in the execution of the said Acts shall be defrayed —

(i.) in the case of the Metropolitan Board of Works, out of the Dwelling House Improvement Fund under the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875;

(ii.) in the case of an urban sanitary authority, as part of the general expenses of their execution of the Public Health Act, 1875; and (iii.) in the case of a rural sanitary authority, as special expenses incurred in the execution of the Public Health Act, 1875, and, save where the burden of such expenses is by order of the Local Government Board to be borne by one contributory place only, shall be deemed to be incurred for the common benefit of all the contributory places liable to bear such expenses: Provided that if on the application of the rural sanitary authority it is so declared at the time of the publication of the certificate by the Local Government Board, then the said expenses of the rural sanitary authority shall be defrayed as general expenses of the said authority in the execution of the

CHAPTER 73.

An Act to provide greater facilities for the Sale of Land to occupying Tenants in Ireland.

[14th August 1885.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.] 1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885.

Advances to tenants under this Act.

44 & 45 Vict. c.49.

Deposit of money as guarantee fund.

Advances by the Land Commission.

2. For enabling tenants to purchase their holdings, either from the Land Commission or from the landlords of such holdings, the Land Commission may make advances under this Act out of any funds at their disposal.

With respect to advances under this Act, the provisions of Part Five of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, shall be amended as follows; that is to say,

(a.) The Land Commission may, if the repayment of the advance is secured by a deposit under this Act (herein-after referred to as a guarantee deposit), and if the Land Commission are satisfied with the security in other respects, make an advance to a tenant who is purchasing his holding of the whole principal sum or price payable by the tenant, instead of the three fourths thereof mentioned in Part Five of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881.

(5.) In making advances under this Act the Land Commission shall prefer applications for the purchase of holdings upon which the tenants reside, or which are reasonable adjuncts to holdings upon which such tenants reside.

(c.) It shall not be lawful for the Land Commission to make advances under this Act exceeding in all the sum of five million pounds.

3. Any person willing to secure the repayment of an advance made by the Land Commission to a tenant who is purchasing his holding either from the Land Commission or from the landlord of

1885.

381

Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885. Ch. 73.

such holding may deposit with the Land Commission such Bum, as a guarantee deposit, not being less than one fifth of the advance, as may be agreed on between him and the Land Commission.

If the person willing to secure the repayment of such advance is a landlord entitled to be paid by the Land Commission, or out of moneys provided by the Land Commission, any sum for the purchase money of any land sold by him, he may provide such guarantee deposit by permitting the Land Commission to retain the same out of such sum so payable for purchase money.

The Land Commission shall pay interest on the guarantee deposit at the rate of three per cent, per annum.

Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the Land Commission shall retain the guarantee deposit until they ascertain and by order declare that the person liable for the repayment of the advance has repaid on account of principal money a sum equal to the guarantee deposit, and shall then pay over the guarantee deposit to the person entitled thereto.

If at any time during the period for which the Land Commission are authorized to retain the guarantee deposit any sum due to the Land Commission in respect of an advance secured by a guarantee deposit under this Act is declared by them, by order, to be an irrecoverable debt, the Land Commission may apply the guarantee deposit in discharge or reduction of such irrecoverable debt.

Such order shall not be made, unless the Land Commission, having exercised any power of sale of the holding which they legally may exercise, have failed to realise by means of such sale the sum due to them secured on the holding, or unless it appears by the order of the Land Commission that they have attempted to exercise such power of sale and have been unable to do so.

Whenever it appears by such order that the Land Commission have attempted to exercise their power of sale and have been unable to do so, and the Land Commission thereupon apply a guarantee deposit or any part of it in discharge or reduction of any sum charged upon a holding, it shall be lawful for the Land Commission, by order, to declare that the interest in the holding of the person liable to pay such |sum shall be charged in favour of the person entitled to the guarantee deposit with the amount of the guarantee deposit, or so much thereof as has been so applied by the Land Commission as aforesaid, with interest thereon at the rate of three per centum per annum until such charge is realised.

Trustees entitled to receive the purchase money produced by the sale of any settled land may, and shall if required by the tenant for life of the settled land, or the person having the powers of a tenant for life within the meaning of the Settled Land Act, 1882, secure, by a guarantee deposit, the repayment of an advance made for the purchase of any holding being or forming part of such settled land, and may apply or permit the Land Commission to retain so mueh of the purchase money as the trustees or such tenant for life or other person may think fit for that purpose.

4, With respect to advances to be made under this Act, or to be Term* of remade under the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, or the Svaoce* Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, and also with respect to advances 88 & 84 Vict. to be made to tenants under Part Two of the Tramways and Public c*46 *

(a.) Every such advance shall be repaid by an annuity in favour of the Land Commission for forty-nine years, of four pounds for every hundred pounds of such advance, and so in proportion for any less sum, instead of by the annuity mentioned in the said Act.

(b) Every such annuity, or any portion of it at any time outstanding, may be redeemed in whole or in part by the person liable to pay such annuity, by payment to the Land Commission of a sum equivalent to the then value of such annuity or of such portion of it as is sought to be redeemed; such value to be calculated according to the table in the Schedule to this Act.

(c.) The repayment of every advance under this Act shall be secured to the Land Commission by deed. It shall be the duty of the Land Commission to exercise the power conferred upon

* mortgagees by the first sub-section of the nineteenth section of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881, or any power for the same purpose contained in such deed.

(d.) Subject to the amendments contained in this Act, the provisions of Part Five of the said Act shall apply to all advances under this Act.

Where a holding is sold by the Land Judges to the tenant of that holding, the sale may, for the purpose of advances under this Act, and of guarantee deposits under this Act, be deemed to be a sale by a landlord to a tenant.

Sales of Land.

5. The Irish Land Commission, if they have reasonably satisfied themselves that a resale can be effected without loss, may purchase any estate for the purpose of reselling to the tenants of the lands comprised in such estate their respective holdings, and may purchase any holding for the purpose of reselling it to the tenant thereof. Provided that such purchase of an estate shall only be made if the Land Commission are reasonably satisfied that holdings to the extent of not less than four-fifths in value and number of the estate will be purchased by the tenants thereof. This condition may be relaxed on special grounds with the consent of the Treasury, but so that in all cases the Land Commission are reasonably satisfied that holdings to the extent of not less than three-fourths in value and number of the estate will be purchased by the tenants thereof, and in every such transaction of the purchase of an estate the Land Commission shall retain not less than one-fifth of the purchase money to satisfy the purpose of a guarantee deposit as defined by section three of this Act.

The tenant of any holding may purchase such holding, and before or after completing the agreement for such purchase may apply to the Land Commission for an advance.

If the vendor of such estate or holding is a tenant for life, or has the powers of a tenant for life, and the land proposed to be sold is settled land, within the meaning of those expressions as used in the Settled Land Act, 1882, he shall have all the powers con-

ferred upon tenants for life under that Act, subject to the amendments thereof herein contained and to the other provisions of this Act; and the purchase money arising from Such sale may be invested or applied as if it were capital money arising under the said Act.

6. Where a landlord of a holding is a tenant for life, or has the Power to powers of a tenant for life within the meaning of those expressions Jo^Sve^'art of as used in the Settled Land Act, 1882, and is selling such holding parchaseP

to the tenant thereof, he may exercise, to the same extent as if he money out-were an absolute owner, the power of permitting any sum not exceeding one fourth of the purchase money to remain as a charge c. 38. upon such holding secured by a mortgage; and in case any advance is made by the Land Commission to the tenant for the purchase of such holding, any such mortgage shall be subject to any charge in favour of the Land Commission for securing such advance; and any such mortgage shall be deemed to be part of the purchase money payable in respect of such holding, and the money secured thereby when paid shall be dealt with as if it were capital money arising under the Settled Land Act, 1882, or purchase money other- 45 & 46 ' ict-wise payable under this Act. c‘ 38‘

This section shall apply to the trustees of any settlement in the same manner as it applies to a tenant for life.

7. Where the Land Commission have purchased an estate, they Sales of resi-may sell any parcels which they can not sell to the tenants thereof, dues-

in such manner as they think fit.

The Land Commission may advance to any purchaser of a parcel under this section, on the security of such parcel, one half of the principal sum paid as the price.

Subject to that limitation on the amount of the advance, all the provisions of this Act relative to sales and advances to tenants by the Land Commission shall apply to the sale of a parcel in pursuance of this section in like manner as if the parcel had been a holding and the purchaser had been tenant thereof at the time of his making his purchase.

8. When a holding has been sold by the Land Commission to a Vesting order tenant or other person, also when a holding has been sold by a mlieuofcon-landlord to a tenant, and it has been agreed between the Land Commission and the landlord and the tenant that such sale shall

be carried into effect by means of a vesting order of the Land Commission under this Act, it shall be lawful for the Land Commission, if they think fit, after due investigation of title and being satisfied therewith, to make an order under their seal and signed by a Commissioner vesting the holding, or the interest of any person or of the Land Commission in such holding, in the purchaser, freed from all charges if the vesting order so declares, or subject to such charges as may be specified in such order; or, if the vesting order so declares, subject to such charges as may lawfully affect such holding.

Every order purporting to vest a holding or interest in a purchaser which purports to be made by the Land Commission in exercise of the powers conferred on them by this Act shall be binding upon all persons claiming any estate or interest in the land comprised in the holding, including Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, and shall be as effectual in all respects, save as herein-

after provided, as if it were a conveyance or assignment executed by one of the Land Judges of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland under the Landed Estates Court Act: Provided, that where the purchaser of a holding is also tenant of the holding the interest vested in him by such order shall, subject to any charges, rights, or easement set out in the order, be deemed to be a graft upon the previous interest of the tenant in the holding, and be subject to any rights or equities arising from its being such graft.

10.

(2.) A provisional order of the Local Government Board for confirming an improvement scheme under the said Act or under this Act shall become absolute and shall take effect, unless:

(a.) The order authorises the purchase of any land otherwise than by agreement, or the taking of any land for a term of years otherwise than by agreement, and a petition against the order, signed by an owner or occupier of land proposed to be purchased or taken otherwise than by agreement, is lodged with the Local Government Board; or,

(b) A petition against the order, signed by not less than twelve ratepayers liable to pay rates in respect of property situate within the area declared by such order to be chargeable, is lodged with the Local Government Board.

Petitions under this section may be lodged within such time, not less than one month after the making and publication of the provisional order, as the Board may from time to time by regulation prescribe.

(3.) Whenever a petition is lodged against any order, the Local Government Board may make application to the Lord Lieutenant, acting with the advice of the Privy Council in Ireland, for an Order in Council confirming the order, and shall inform the sanitary authority who obtained the provisional order that a petition against it has been lodged and an application made to the Lord Lieutenant in Council to confirm the order.

Such declaration may be made by provisional order, in this Act referred to as an amending provisional order.

The provisions of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, requiring certain matters and things to be done before the Local Government Board make any provisional order, shall not apply to an amending provisional order under this Act.

The sanitary authority shall serve a copy of an amending provisional order in the manner and upon the persons in which and upon whom the provisional order thereby amended was served.

An amending provisional order against which a petition is lodged shall be dealt with in the same manner as other opposed provisional orders are directed to be dealt with under this Act.

An amending provisional order may alter sites and otherwise vary the original order.

14. When a sanitary authority has not obtained and applied a Treasury loan in pursuance of a provisional order made and confirmed by Parliament before the passing of this Act, and have not entered into possession of any land authorised to be taken by them under such order, such order may be allowed to lapse, and such sanitary authority may avail itself of the provisions of this Act in

And whereas it is expedient to put an end to the management and maintenance of the said roads by such trustees, and to the levying of tolls thereon, and to provide for the management and maintenance of the said roads by the inhabitants of the parishes within which they are respectively situate:

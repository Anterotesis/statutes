(2.) If the Act authorising such advance of money fixes a period during which the money is to be issued, the said money shall be issued by the National Debt Commissioners during that period and not subsequently.

(3.) For the purpose of passing an annual Act of Parliament authorizing advances under this section, the National Debt Commissioners shall not less than two months before the commencement of every financial year send to the Treasury an estimate of the sums required to be issued for local loans in that year for the advance of which an annual Act is necessary.

(4.) The enactments for the time being in force for the regulation of the said Commissioners and Board, and the money at their disposal, and their securities and the proceedings thereon shall, so far as they are consistent with this Act, respectively apply in the case of money issued to those Commissioners and Board in pursuance of this Act.

(3.) Accounts shall be kept distinguishing the receipts and expenditure of the Local Loans Fund in respect of capital and in respect of income.

8. — (1.) For the purposes of this Act, and subject to the Constitution of limitations thereof, the Treasury may from time to time create a Loau* new class of capital stock consisting of perpetual annuities yielding dividends at the rate of three per cent, per annum on the nominal amount of the capital (which stock is in this Act referred to as Local Loans stock).

(2.) Such annuities shall be payable by equal quarterly dividends at such times in each year as may be fixed by the warrant creating the first portion of Local Loans stock, and shall be paid out of the Local Loans Fund, and if such fund is insufficient shall to the extent of such insufficiency be charged on and issued out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof, and any sum so issued out of the Consolidated Fund shall be repaid to the Consolidated Fund in manner provided by this Act.

(4.) Such notice shall be a resolution of the House of Commons, signified by the Speaker in writing, and printed in the " London Gazette, " and the portion of stock redeemed at one time shall not be less than five million pounds capital stock, but, subject as aforesaid, the mode of redemption shall be determined by an Act to be hereafter passed.

(5.) The Local Loans stock created from time to time shall be consolidated with the like stock previously created, and all Local Loans stock shall be transferable in the books of the Banks of England and Ireland in like manner as other stocks of three per cent, perpetual annuities, and shall be subject to the enactments relating to those stocks so far as is consistent with the tenor of those enactments and this Act, so, however, that the said enactments shall not create any further charge on the Consolidated Fund than is created by this Act.

All persons and bodies of persons, including the National Debt Commissioners, having power, whether subject or not to any restrictions or conditions, to invest in any other stock of three per cent, perpetual annuities, shall have power, subject to the same restrictions and conditions (if any), to invest in Local Loans stock.

9. Whereas of the sums which have been issued by the Treasury and the National Debt Commissioners for the purpose of Local Loans, the amount outstanding and not repaid or written off is estimated to amount to thirty-seven million two hundred thousand pounds, and it is expedient to provide that such amount should bo represented by the like amount of Local Loans stock created in pursuance of this Act, be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) The Treasury shall give to the National Debt Commissioners Local Loans stock in exchange for securities held by the said Commissioners on account of trustee savings banks or post office savings banks to an aggregate capital value equivalent to the nominal amount of such Local Loans stock; and the amount of Local Loans stock so given in exchange shall be such nominal amount not exceeding in the whole thirty-seven million two hundred thousand pounds, as may be determined by the Treasury at the time of the exchange to be the amount outstanding in respect of sums issued for Local Loans, and not repaid or written off:

(2.) The National Debt Commissioners shall hold the Local Loans stock given to them in exchange, for the same purposes, and subject to the same provisions, for and Subject to which they held the securities received from them in exchange.

10. The National Debt Commissioners may from time to time give Local Loans stock to any persons or bodies of persons in exchange for other three per cent, perpetual annuities, upon such terms and in such manner as may be from time to time provided by those Commissioners.

1L Whereas a sum estimated at twelve million pounds or thereabouts has been lost to the Exchequer through the non-repayment by local authorities and individuals of the principal of Local Loans, and it is expedient that part of that sum amounting to six million five hundred thousand pounds or thereabouts, should be treated as a grant by Parliament, and that towards the restitution of the

S3

residue of the sum so lost and such further sums as may hereafter be lost by reason of the like non-repayment, an annual sum should be applied out of the sums receivable for interest on outstanding Local Loans, be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) For the purpose of the restitution of the residue of the said sum so lost, and any further losses in respect of Local Loans, an annual sum of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds shall be paid in quarterly instalments out of the Local Loans Fund at such times as the National Debt Commissioners from time to time direct, and shall be carried by the National Debt Commissioners to a separate fund, in this Act referred to as the Restitution Fund:

(2.) All sums from time to time paid to the Restitution Fund shall be applied by the National Debt Commissioners in the reduction of the National Debt in like manner as if such sums were a portion of the new sinking fund under the Sinking 38 & 39 Vict. Fund Act, 1875: «•

(3.) The Treasury shall from time to time lay before Parliament a statement of all losses which the Exchequer suffers by reason of Local Loans, in consequence of an issue out of the Exchequer whether made in respect of the principal of any such loan written off by direction of Parliament, or made for the purpose of paying the dividends on Local Loans stock, or meeting a deficiency in the income account of the Local Loans Fund.

(3.) The income account of the Local Loans Fund shall be charged with the payments under this Act in respect of the annual sum payable to the Restitution Fund, and in respect of the dividends on Local Loans stock (whether such latter payments were made directly or by way of repayment to the Consolidated Fund), and with such expenses connected with Local Loans stock as the Treasury from time to time direct.

(4.) If it is shown by the income account of the Local Loans Fund for any financial year that the income is in excess of the expenditure, the excess shall be applied in the payment of such sum in respect of expenses in connexion with Local Loans as the Treasury from time to time direct, and subject to that application, shall be credited in account to the capital of the Local Loans Fund.

(5.) If it is shown by the income account of the Local Loans Fund for any financial year that the income is less than the expenditure, a sum equal to the deficiency shown by the account shall, so far as the same has not been paid out of the Consolidated Fund, be charged on and issued out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof.

(3.) The said sinking fund may be from time to time applied for the purpose of the purchase or redemption of Local Loans stock, and Local Loans stock so purchased or redeemed shall be forthwith cancelled.

(4.) If at any time there is no part of the said sinking fund which the Commissioners think fit to invest in an advance for Local Loans, and the money otherwise standing to the account of the Local Loans Fund is insufficient to meet the money authorised by Parliament to be advanced for the purpose of Local Loans, and for the time being required for that purpose, the National Debt Commissioners shall certify the same to the Treasury; and thereupon the Treasury shall create such amount of Local Loans stock as appears to them to be required; so, however, that such stock shall not be created in any financial year for raising sums exceeding in the aggregate the amount authorised by Parliament to be advanced during that financial year, after deducting the amount of the said sinking fund which the National Debt Commissioners think fit to invest in advances for Local Loans.

(5.) Instead of creating Local Loans Btock as aforesaid, the Treasury may authorise the National Debt Commissioners to borrow temporarily on such terms as may be approved by the Treasury from the Bank of England or Bank of Ireland, or out of any cash balances in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners, available for investment under the Acts relating to trustee or post office savings banks or any other Act, the sum required as above mentioned for the purpose of Local Loans, so, however, that the sum so borrowed shall not increase the total amount authorised to be raised by the National Debt Commissioners in any financial year, and either the amount so borrowed shall be repaid out of the moneys standing to the capital account of the Local Loans Fund or the nominal amount of Local Loans stock authorised to be created under this section shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the sum so borrowed and not repaid, but Local Loans stock may be created for the purpose of such repayment.

(6.) Where any sum so temporarily borrowed in any financial year has not been repaid, the Treasury may, in any subsequent financial year, in addition to any amount of Local Loans stock

otherwise authorised to be created, create Local Loans stock to such amount as is required to repay the amount so borrowed.

15. — (1.) Where the whole or any part of the principal of any Local Loan is by reason of the same not being likely to be recovered directed by Parliament to be written off from the account of assets of the Local Loans Fund, the amount of such principal shall be treated as a loss to the Exchequer, to be made good by means of the Restitution Fund under this Act, but nothing in this section shall alter the liability of any person or body corporate to pay the principal of or interest on any Local Loan, or any part thereof.

(2.) Any amount so directed to be written off after the expiration of the current financial year, shall be paid to the National Debt Commissioners out of moneys provided by Parliament, and any sums afterwards recovered, whether for principal or interest in respect of the amount so written off, shall be paid into the Exchequer.

Any sums so paid to the National Debt Commissioners shall be carried to the Local Loans Fund, and be placed to the capital account of that fund and treated as a sum paid on account of the principal of a Local Loan; but if any sums so paid are paid in respect of a terminable annuity, so much thereof as represents interest shall be placed to the income account of the Loans

Where the purchase money or any part of it is not immediately distributable, or the persons entitled thereto are not ascertained, or where from any other cause the Land Commission think it expedient for the protection of the rights of the persons interested, then the Land Commission shall, as the case requires, either retain the same

' under their control or deal with the same in the manner provided by the Settled Land Act, 1882, with respect to capital money arising under that Act, and may by order declare the trusts affecting such money or share, so far as the Land Commission have ascertained the same, or state the facts or matters found by them in relation to the rights and interests therein; and the Land Commission may from time to time make such orders in relation to any purchase money or share and the investment or application thereof, or the payment thereof, or the annual income thereof to the persons interested, as the circumstances of the case may require.

(2.) The Land Commission may at or after the time of making such order as above mentioned, and notwithstanding that it may have been agreed that the sale shall be carried into effect by means of a conveyance, exercise the powers contained in section nine, subsection five, of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885.

(3.) Any person in occupation of and paying rent for a holding which is held under a contract of tenancy, shall have power to enter into an agreement for the purchase thereof Where a holding shall be conveyed to or vested in any such person, the interest thereby assigned to him shall be deemed to be a graft upon the previous interest of the tenant in such holding, and shall be subject to any rights or equities arising from its being such graft.

15. — (1.) When any land sold under the Land Law (Ireland) Acts is subject with other lands to any Crown rent, quitrent, or tithe rentcharge, the Land Commission may, if they think it expedient, apportion such Crown rent, quitrent, or tithe rentcharge, between the land sold and the other land, in such manner as to them seems equitable; and when any such land is subject with other lands to any land improvement charge or drainage charge, the Commissioners of Public Works, on the requisition of the Land Commission, may apportion the same between the land sold and other lands, and may issue a certificate setting forth such apportionment.

Upon any apportionment being made under this section, such portion of the rent or rentcharge or charge as is apportioned to the land sold shall alone be deemed to be the Crown rent, quit-rent, tithe rentcharge, or drainage charge chargeable on the land sold.

16. — (1.) When any land sold under the Land Law (Ireland) Acts is subject with other lands to any annuity or rentcharge, the Land Commission may, if they think it expedient, by order apportion the same as between such land and the other lands subject thereto, and thereupon such part of the annuity or rentcharge as is apportioned on the land to be sold shall alone be deemed to be the annuity or rentcharge chargeable on such land.

(2.) When the Land Commission exercise the power of apportionment conferred on them by this section, and also when the Land Commission exercise the power of apportionment of rent conferred on them by the seventy-second section of the Landed Estates Court Act as extended by the tenth section of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, then the part of an annuity, rent-charge, or rent which is apportioned upon any land sold shall cease to be a charge upon the land, and shall be transferred to the purchase money thereof; the last-mentioned power of apportionment may be exercised in any case notwithstanding that it may have been agreed that the sale shall be carried into effect by means of a conveyance.

(3.) The Land Commission shall, on the application of the person entitled to a part of an annuity, rentcharge, or rent, which part shall have been apportioned by them upon land sold, and may, if they think it expedient, without such application, order the redemption of such annuity, rentcharge, or rent, or of an apportioned part thereof, and may, notwithstanding the fact that no apportionment

Every advance made by the Land Commission under the Land Law (Ireland) Acts shall be secured by an order of the Land Commission declaring the land upon which such advance is made to be charged with the repayment of the advance with interest in such manner as the order may direct. In case any interest or instalment mentioned in such order, or in any order made by a land judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland, under the provisions of the Land Law (Ireland) Acts, shall be in arrear for the space of forty days after the time the same might be paid, it shall be lawful for the Land Commission to exercise the powers of sale and other powers conferred upon mortgagees by sections nineteen, twenty-one, and twenty-two of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881, so far as the same is applicable.

a holding under the Land Law (Ireland) Acts, shall be a charge on the holding subject thereto, having priority over all existing and future estates, interests, and incumbrances created either by the landlord or the tenant, or their respective predecessors in title, and whether before or after the making of the advance, with the exception of quitrent and other charges incident to the tenure, rent-charges in lieu of tithes, and any charges created under any Acts authorising advance of public money, or under any Act creating charges in respect of improvements on lands and passed before this Act, and with the exception also (in cases where lands are subject to a fee-farm rent or held under a lease reserving rent) of such fee-farm rent or rent reserved as aforesaid. Every such annuity payable to the Land Commission shall be payable in equal half-yearly payments on the first day of May and the first day of November in each year. The first half-yearly payment of any such annuity shall, where the advance is not made on one of the said gale days, be due and paid on the second of such gale days after the date of the advance, and together with such first half-yearly payment there shall be due and paid an additional sum for interest on the advance at the rate of three and one eighth per centum per annum from tho date of the advance until the first gale day next after that date. A certificate purporting to be under the seal of the Land Commission, or the Commissioners of Public Works, as the case may be, shall be evidence that the amount of any annuity or arrears of annuity stated therein to be due under any of the said Acts in respect of any holding named therein, is due to the Land Commission or the Commissioners of Public Works, as the case may be, in respect of such holding.

21. When any holding is sold by or at the suit of the Land Commission, the Land Commission may, on the application of any purchaser, issue an order to the sheriff to put such purchaser in possession of the holding, or part thereof, purchased by him, and such order shall be executed by the sheriff in like manner as a writ fur the delivery of possession.

22. When either before or after the passing of this Act a sale of a holding has been agreed to be made by a landlord to a tenant, and an application for an advance to enable the tenant to buy the holding has been sanctioned by the Land Commission, either party to the agreement for sale may apply in a summary manner to the Land Commission to decree the specific performance of the agreement; and the Land Commission shall have all such jurisdiction and authority to decide upon such application and to make a decree for specific performance as are vested in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland, for the like purposes, subject to the like appeal as in the case of other orders made by the Land Commission.

24. Whereas by section forty-four and section forty-five of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, and by sub section three of section one of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (in this Act referred to as the Commissioners of Works) were authorised to agree to advance to a tenant purchasing his holding a sum not exceeding two-thirds of the value of the holding, and such advance is to be repaid by a charge made by virtue of the said sections, or by a security from the tenant of an annuity of five pounds for every hundred pounds of such advance, payable to the Commissioners of Works for thirty-five years;

And whereas in calculating such annuity, interest was reckoned at the rate of three and one-half per centum per annum, and it is expedient to reduce the annual amount of the annuity by reducing the rate of interest and extending the term of the annuity: Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

(1.) As from the gale day next after the passing of this Act, any annuity charged on a holding under section forty-four or section forty-five of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, or section one of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872, shall (save as herein-after mentioned) be reduced from five per centum to four per centum on the amount of the advance; and shall be payable for such term as the Commissioners of Works may by order declare to be necessary for the repayment, with interest at three and one-eighth per centum per annum, of so much of the advance as has not accrued due for payment on the said gale day, and the order shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, be made and notified by post or otherwise, in manner directed by the said Commissioners, to the person appearing to them to be the person paying the annuity;

. (2.) Provided that the said Commissioners may in any case in which they think the special circumstances justify so doing, grant such extension of the term as they think just, so that the term shall Dot in any case exceed forty-nine years from the date of the advance, and shall adjust the annuity and vary the order accordingly.

(3.) Where on the gale day next after the passing of this Act there are unpaid arrears of instalments of the annuity in excess of the instalment due on the said gale day, this section shall not apply to such annuity except upon such order of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury (in this Act referred to as "the Treasury ") as herein-after mentioned.

(4.) Where the Treasury are satisfied upon the report of the Commissioners of Works that in the case of the purchaser of a holding whose instalments are so in arrear, the special circumstances are such that it is equitable to apply the provisions of this section to such purchaser, and to make such provision as herein-after mentioned for the arrears, the Treasury may, if they think fit, order that on payment within the time limited

1887.

Ch. 33.

113

Land Law (Ireland), 1887.

by the order of a portion of the arrears, not being less than the amount of the instalments of the annuity for six months, if so much be due, the remainder of the arrears shall be repayable by such addition to the amount of the annuity for repaying the advance as will repay the said remainder with interest at the rate of three and one-eighth per centum per annum within the period at which the last-mentioned annuity will, by virtue of this Act or otherwise, terminate, and upon such order being made and portion of arrears paid this section shall apply, and the Commissioners of Works shall make an order accordingly, and by such order charge the holding with the addition to the annuity for the repayment of arrears, and such charge shall have the same priority as the charge on the holding of the annuity in arrear.

(5.) An order of the Commissioners of Works under this section shall be deemed, according as the case requires, to form part of the order under section forty-four or section forty-five of the recited Act, or of the security or deed charging the annuity.

25. Whereas in pursuance of section fifty-two of the Irish Church Act, 1869, the Commissioners acting under that Act credited the purchasers of land, or interests in land, with part of the purchase money on having security for payment of the same, and the sums so credited to purchasers, or many of them, are now mortgage debts due to the Irish Land Commission as the successors of the Commissioners acting under that Act, and are secured in some cases by a simple mortgage, and in other cases by an instalment mortgage providing for the payment of the principal sum with interest by instalments extending over a term of years (which instalments with the interest are in this section referred to as the instalments);

And whereas the rate of interest on such mortgages was calculated at not less than four per centum per annum, but has been in some cases reduced to three and one-eighth per centum per annum by an order of the Irish Land Commission, under section twenty-three of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, and it is expedient to provide in other cases for the like reduction in manner provided by this section: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) As from the gale day next after the passing of this Act, or any later date specified in an order under this section, the annual amount payable to the Irish Land Commission in respect of any such instalment mortgage as above-mentioned shall, save as herein-after mentioned, be reduced by such amount as is necessary to reduce the rate of interest from four to three and one-eighth per centum per annum, and the term may be extended by the Irish Land Commission, so that it do not exceed forty-nine years from the date of the mortgage.

(2.) As from the gale day next after the passing of this Act, or any later date specified in the order herein-after mentioned, the annual amount payable to the Irish Land Commission in Tespect of any such simple mortgage as above mentioned, shall, s*ve as herein-after mentioned, be at the rate for interest of three and one-eighth per centum, and for repayment of prin-

Redaction of interest paid on mortgages held by the Irish Land Commission as successors of the Commissioners under 32 & 33 Vict c. 42, and the Church Temporalities Commissioners.

114

Ch. 33. Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887. 50 & 51 Vict.

cipal of seven-eighths per centum on the amount of principal due under such mortgage on the said day, and such amount shall be payable by half-yearly payments on the days on which the interest in the said mortgage is payable, and for forty-nine years from the said day, and the mortgage shall then, except for the purpose of recovering arrears, determine.

(3.) An order of the Irish Land Commission fixing the annual amount and the term of years shall, as soon aa may be after the passing of this Act, be made and notified by post, or otherwise in manner directed by the Irish Land Commission, to the person for the time being paying the interest on any simple, or the instalment on any instalment mortgage, or otherwise appearing to the Commission to be liable to pay the same:

(4.) Provided that the Irish Land Commission may in any case in which they think the special circumstances justify so doing, grant such variation of the term as they think just, and may vary the order accordingly, so that the term shall not in any case exceed forty-nine years from the date of the mortgage.

(5.) Where on the gale day next after the passing of this Act there are unpaid arrears in respect of interest under any simple mortgage, or instalments under an instalment mortgage, over and above half-yearly payments due on the said galo day, this section shall not apply to such mortgage except that if the Treasury on the report of the Land Commission are satisfied that it is equitable to apply this section to any such mortgage — (a) The Treasury may order that on payment within a period fixed by the order and notified in like manner as above provided of a portion of the said arrears, being not less than the amount of interest or instalments due for six months, if so much be due, the remainder of the arrears shall be repaid by such addition to the periodical instalments as will bo sufficient to pay the said remainder with interest at the rate of three and one-eighth per centum per annum by the expiration of the period at which the mortgage, by virtue of this Act or otherwise, will cease; and

(b.) Upon such order being made and portion of arrears paid, this section shall apply, and the Irish Land Commission shall make an order under this section with reference to such mortgage as if all arrears of interest and instalments required to be paid before the making of the order were paid, and such order shall also provide for such additions to the mortgage as above mentioned.

(G.) Any order of the Irish Land Commission under this section, also any order purporting to be made by such Commission in pursuance of section twenty-three of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, whether before or after the passing of this Act, shall have effect as if the mortgage referred to in the order were modified in the manner provided by the order, and if the order provides for an addition to the debt in pursuance of this section as if the mortgage included that addition, apd an addition so made shall have the same priority as the debt created by the mortgage, and any such order shall be binding

1S87. Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887. Ch. 33. 115

on all persons interested in the equity of redemption of such mortgage.

(7.) Nothing in this section shall apply to a mortgage as to which an order has been made under section twenty-three of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, before the passing of this Act.

(8.) Nothing in this section shall apply to the purchasers of perpetuity rents.

26. Whenever a holding has, either before or after the passing Release of for-

of this Act, become forfeited to the Commissioners of Works, under bTpSchaserto section forty-four or forty-five of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) whom money Act, 1870, and a legal proceeding in respect of such forfeiture has advanced, either not been taken by the said Commissioners, or if taken, has 334* 44ct‘

been abandoned, they may, with the consent of the Treasury, if it 45.

seem fit, after notice to all persons appearing to the Commissioners of Works to be concerned, order that the holding shall be released from the forfeiture as from the date at which it accrued, and shall vest in the person named in the order discharged from all claims on account of the alienation, subletting, or other act, on account of which the forfeiture was incurred.

Such order shall have full effect and be binding on all persons interested in the holding; and the holding, after the date thereof, shall cease to be subject to the conditions imposed by the sections above in this section mentioned, and shall be subject to the conditions imposed by section thirty of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland)

Act, 1881, and that section shall apply with the substitution of the Commissioner of Works for the Land Commission.

27. Whereas under the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, Reduction of 1870, and the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872, as Joan^under amended by section thirty-five of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 44 & 45 Vict.

1S81, and under section twenty-four and under section twenty-six c. 49.

of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, the Irish Land Commission were authorised to advance to a tenant purchasing his holding a sum not exceeding such proportion of the purchase-money as is therein mentioned, and such advance is to be repaid by a charge made by virtue of the said sections, or by a security from the tenant of an annuity of five pounds for every hundred pounds of such advance, payable to the Irish Land Commission for thirty-five years;

And whereas, in calculating such annuity, interest was reckoned at the rate of three and one-half per centum per annum, and it is expedient to reduce the annual amount of the annuity by reducing the rate of interest and extending the term of the annuity, be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) As from the first gale day next after the passing of this Act any annuity charged on a holding for the repayment of an advance made in pursuance of section thirty-five of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, or the Acts in that section mentioned or made in pursuance of section twenty-four or section twenty-six of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, shall (save as herein-after mentioned) be reduced from five per centum to four per centum on the amount of the advance; and shall be payable for such term as the Irish Land Com-

mission may by order declare to be necessary for the repayment, with interest at three and one-eighth per centum per annum, of so much of the advance as has not accrued due for payment on the said gale day; and the order shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, be made and notified, by post or otherwise, in manner directed by the said Commissioners to the person appearing to them to be the person paying the annuity:

(2.) Provided that the said Commission may, in any case in which they think the special circumstances justify so doing, grant such extension of the term as they think just, so that the term shall not in any case exceed forty-nine years from the date of the advance, and shall adjust the annuity and vary the order accordingly.

(3.) Where on the gale day next after the passing of this Act there are unpaid arrears of instalments of the annuity in excess of the instalment due on the said gale day, this section shall not apply to such annuity except upon such order of the Treasury as herein-after mentioned.

(4.) Where the Treasury are satisfied upon the report of the Irish Land Commission that in the case of the purchaser of a holding whose instalments are so in arrear the special circumstances are such that it is equitable to apply the provisions of this section to such purchaser, and to make such provision as herein-after mentioned for the arrears, the Treasury may, if they think fit, order that on payment, within the time limited by the order, of a portion of the arrears, not being less than the amount of the instalments of the annuity for six months if so much be due, the remainder of the arrears shall be repayable by such addition to the amount of the annuity for repaying the advance as will repay the said remainder with interest at the rate of three and one-eighth per centum per annum within the period at which the last-mentioned annuity will by virtue of this Act or otherwise terminate; and upon such order being made, and portion of arrears being paid, this section shall apply, and the Irish Land Commission shall make an order accordingly, and by such order charge the holding with the addition to the annuity for the repayment of arrears, and such charge shall have the same priority as the charge on the holding of the annuity in arrear.

(5.) An order of the Irish Land Commission under this section shall be deemed, according as the case requires, to form part of the order under the sections of the recited Acts, or of the security or deed charging the annuity.

28. Where any sum is due to the Irish Land Commission or to the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of any advance made to, or purchase money due from, the purchaser of any land or interest in land, and is unpaid fov the space of not less than six months after the same has become due, the Irish Land Commission or Commissioners of Public Works, as the case may be, may give a certificate of the amount so due, and such certificate shall be evidence in the same manner as a certificate under section forty-nine of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870.

is bounded on three sides by land vested or about to be vested in Snnon’jBow.10 the police receiver, and is believed to be vested in the Board of Works for the Westminster district, and is not required for the purposes for which that board is authorised to hold land, but doubts have been entertained whether that board has power to transfer the said piece of land to the police receiver and to extinguish the rights (if any) of the public over the same, and it is expedient to remove those doubts; be it therefore enacted that the said board may by agreement transfer the said piece of land to the police receiver, and thereupon all public rights (if any) over the said piece of land shall be extinguished.

Whereas the Summary Jurisdiction Acts provide for the imprisonment of a person for the nonpayment in certain cases of a sura of money adjudged to be paid by the conviction or order of a court of summary jurisdiction, and it is expedient to repeal so much of any enactment as provides the punishment of whipping or any punishment other than imprisonment, with or without hard labour, provided for such nonpayment: Be it therefore enacted that —

So much of any Act as enacts that a person on nonpayment of a sum of money adjudged to be paid by the conviction or order of a

77

1884. Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1884. Ch. 43.

court of summary'jurisdiction in England shall be liable to be whipped or to any other punishment than imprisonment, with or without hard labour, is hereby repealed.

4. The Acts contained in the schedule to this Act are hereby repealed to the extent in the third column of that schedule mentioned.

Provided that —

(1.) Where an enactment extends beyond England that enact-. ment shall be repealed only as regards England; and

(2.) The expression in the said “ schedule conviction or order of a court of summary jurisdiction ” shall mean a conviction or order made in pursuance of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts; and

(3.) This repeal shall not revive any enactment repealed by any of the repealed Acts, nor shall it affect —

(a.) Anything duly done or suffered before the commencement of this Act under any enactment hereby repealed; or

(b.) Any legal proceeding or appeal commenced, or any writ, warrant, or instrument made or issued before the commencement of this Act; and any such legal proceeding, appeal, writ, warrant, and instrument may be carried on and executed as if this Act had not passed.

A reference in any Act of Parliament or other document to any enactment repealed by this Act, whether incorporating or applying such enactment or otherwise, shall be construed to refer to the corresponding enactment in the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, and so far as there is no such corresponding enactment shall be repealed.

5. Whereas doubts may arise as to whether the Summary Jurisdiction Acts apply, or will, after the repeal enacted by this Act takes effect, apply to the proceedings before justices referred to in the sections mentioned in the third column of the schedule to this Act, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:Be it therefore enacted that —

The repeal enacted by this Act shall not take away any jurisdiction of any justices to act summarily in any matter referred to in an enactment hereby repealed, and the Summary Jurisdiction Acts shall, so far as is consistent with the tenor thereof, apply to every proceeding before justices as to which the procedure is wholly or partly repealed by this Act in substitution for the procedure so repealed.

And for the further removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where by virtue of the repeal enacted by this Act or otherwise any statute authorising the infliction by any justice or justices of a penalty or fine, either as a sole punishment or as an alternative punishment for imprisonment, provides no method for the recovery of such penalty or fine, sections nineteen and twenty-one of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1848, as amended by section twenty-one of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, shall apply to the recovery of such penalty or fine.

made in pursuance of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, or from the refusal to make any conviction or order in pursuance of those Acts, to a court of general or quarter sessions, he shall after the passing of this Act appeal to such court subject to the conditions and regulations contained in the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, with respect to an appeal to a court of general or quarter sessions.

7. Whereas by section fifty of the Summary Jurisdiction’Act, 1879, it is enacted that the expression “court of summary jurisdiction ” shall in that Act and any future Act mean “ any justice “ or justices of the peace or other magistrate by whatever name called “ to whom jurisdiction is given by or who is or are authorised to “ act under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts or any of such Acts.”

And whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the said section extends to such justice, justices, or magistrate when acting under some Act other than the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, and it is expedient to remove such doubts: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

It is hereby declared that the above recited definition of court of summary jurisdiction in section fifty of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, includes such justice, justices, or magistrate as therein mentioned, whether acting under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, or any of them, or under any other Act, or by virtue of his or their commission or by the common law.

8. Whereas doubts have arisen whether under the thirtieth section of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, the justices or council therein mentioned have power to provide more than one petty sessional court-house, and it is expedient that such doubts should be removed: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

It is hereby declared that the power of the thirtieth section of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, given to the justices or council therein mentioned to provide a petty sessional court-house shall be deemed to extend to providing more than one such petty sessional court-house if the justices or council shall think it necessary or expedient so to do.

And for the further removal of doubts it is hereby declared that a petty sessional court-house or occasional court-house for the use of the justices of any county may be outside the limits of the petty sessional division for which such court-house is provided or appointed, and may be either in the said county, or in any adjoining county or borough, and for the purpose of the jurisdiction of any justices acting in such court-house the same shall be deemed to be within the county and the petty sessional division for which such justices act.

9. Nothing in section two hundred and twenty-seven of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, shall be taken to have repealed section thirty-eight of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879.

10. Nothing in this Act shall alter the procedure for the recovery of or any remedy for the nonpayment of any poor rate, or of any rate or sum the payment of which is not adjudged by the conviction or order of a court of summary jurisdiction.

11. The payment of any sum certified by a district auditor to be due in accordance with the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1844, and the Acts amending the same, or with any other Act may, together

with the costs of the proceedings for the recovery thereof, he enforced in like manner as if it were a sum due in respect of the poor rate.

12. Whereas by section twenty-nine of the Summary Jurisdiction Effect of Act, 1879, the Lord Chancellor is authorised from time to time to forms, make rules in relation to the forms to be used under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts or any of them, and to annul and to add to forms in relation to summary proceedings contained in other Acts, and doubts have arisen with respect to the effect of the forms altered by such rules, and it is expedient to remove such doubts: Be it therefore enacted that —

A form authorised by any rules for the time being in force in pursuance of the said section shall be of the same effect as if it were contained in the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1848, or in any other u & 12 Vict. Act to which the form is made applicable. c*48 *

[7th August 1884.]

WHEREAS in pursuance of the Act of the session of the nineteenth and twentieth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter fifteen, intituled “ An Act for further regulating “ the Payment of the Out-Pensioners of Greenwich and Chelsea " Hospitals, ” one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State makes regulations for the management and payment of the Greenwich out-pensioners and pays the pensions of those pensioners, but in other respects those pensioners are subject to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (in this Act referred to as the Admiralty):

And whereas the Greenwich Hospital Act, 1865, provided that 28 & 29 Vict, the said pensions should be called naval pensions:c-89-

And whereas the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions Act, 1865, 28 & 29 Vict, made provisions with respect to the pensions of seamen and marines c- 73. subject to the enactment in section ten thereof that nothing in that Act should take away or abridge any power vested in one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State relative to naval pensions:

Act, 1865, to a pension or a naval pension, or to money payable by the Admiralty, shall be construed to include a naval pension and a Greenwich Hospital pension, gratuity, and allowance, within the meaning of the Greenwich Hospital Acts, 1865 to 1883, and any sum due on account of such a pension, gratuity, or allowance.

3. A provision of any Order in Council made in pursuance of the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions Act, 1865, or of the Greenwich Hospital Acts, 1865 to 1883, respecting the restoration in whole or in part of any forfeited pension shall have effect notwithstanding

(2.) The Secretary of State, in lieu of building, may by such declaration as herein-after mentioned, appropriate as a prison any suitable building or part of a building vested in him or under his control, including any prison for convicts under the superintendence of the directors of convict prisons which is situate in England.

(3.) The Secretary of State may from time to time declare that any building or part of a building built for or appropriated as a prison in pursuance of this Act shall, and the same accordingly shall, be a prison under the Prison Act, 1865, and the Prison Act, 1877, and be within the jurisdiction of the Prison Commissioners, and be a prison for the county and prison jurisdiction named in the declaration; such declaration may be at any time revoked by the Secretary of State, but while in force shall have full effect.

An Act to declare the Law relating to the Incorporation of Chartered Companies.

[14th August 1884.]

WHEREAS by an Act of the first year of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter seventy-three, entitled “ An Act for " better enabling Her Majesty to confer certain powers and im-" inunities on trading and other companies, ” it was enacted that it should be lawful for Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, in any charter of incorporation to be thereafter granted to limit the duration thereof for any term or number of years, or for any other period whatsoever:

And whereas provision has in many charters of incorporation been made for the cessation of the privileges conferred by such charters after a limited time:

And whereas with a view of preventing the cessation of such privileges, supplemental charters and warrants and documents under the sign manual of Her Majesty have from time to time been granted, continuing for a further limited time the privileges granted by the said charters, or some of such privileges, and it is expedient to remove doubts with respect to such charters, warrants, and other documents:

Be it declared and enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. The enactment contained in the twenty-ninth section of the rene^Tterms of sa*d ^e first year of Her Majesty, chapter seventy-three,

charters. shall be construed as from the date thereof to have authorised and to authorise Her Majesty, by charter or by warrant or other writing under her sign-manual, from time to time, and whensoever to Her Majesty may have seemed or seem expedient, to extend or renew conditionally or unconditionally any term or number of years- or — -other period: fui which &tiy charter of incorporation granted by Her Majesty, or any privileges of such charter may for the time being be limited to endure.

An Act to extend certain Powers given by the Superannuation Act Amendment Act, 1873.

WHEREAS by the Superannuation Act, 1859, it is enacted that for the purposes of that Act no person thereafter to be appointed shall be deemed to have served in the Permanent Civil Service of the State unless such person holds his appointment directly from the Crown, or has been admitted into the Civil Service with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners:

And whereas it appears that in several public departments of the State persons have been appointed since the passing of the said Act to established situations in the Civil Service not held directly from

161

the Crown, but that through inadvertence on the part of the heads of such departments, and without any default on the part of the persons so appointed, no steps were taken before their appointment to procure for them certificates from the Civil Service Commissioners: And whereas with a view of relieving such persons from loss of the superannuation allowance or gratuities which they were led to expect when they entered the Civil Service, provision was made by the Superannuation Act Amendment Act, 1873, enabling the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, on applications by the heads of such departments, by order or warrant, to place such persons in the same position as regards their claim to a superannuation allowance or gratuity as they would have been in if they had been admitted into the Civil Service with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners:

And whereas a further provision to the like effect was made by the Superannuation (Post Office and War Office) Act, 1876, and the Superannuation Act, 1881:

And whereas the orders or warrants under the said Acts were required to be made before the terms therein mentioned which have now passed:

And whereas notwithstanding that most of the said persons have been relieved by orders or warrants made under the said Acts, some of them still remain for whom, owing to the failure of the heads of departments to make application within the time limited by the said Acts, or owing to other causes beyond their own control, relief has not been provided:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may be cited as the Superannuation Act, 1884.

2. (1.) The Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury may, if they think fit, at any time on application being made to them by the head of any public department of the State, declare by grder_or warrant that a person who has been appointed after the date of the Superannuation Act, 1859, and before the passing of this Act, to a situation in such department entitling persons appointed thereto with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners to superannuation allowance was appointed thereto without such a certificate through inadvertence on the part of the head of such department, and without any default on the part of the person so appointed, and every person with respect to whom such order or warrant is issued shall be in the same position as regards his claim to allowances under the Superannuation Act, 1859, as he would have been in if he had been appointed with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioners.

(2.) Every order or warrant made in pursuance of this Act shall be laid before Parliament in manner provided by the thirteenth section of the said Superannuation Act, 1859.

3. Where the regulations respecting an office which entitles or would, if he had continued to hold it, have entitled the holder to Teceive an allowance under the Superannuation Act, 1859, provide that a person appointed to such office must have held a professional

PART IIL

Miscellaneous.

13. Whereas under the Government Annuities Acts, 1853, and 1864, and under the Greenwich Hospital Act, 1872, applying the first-mentioned Acts, fees are authorised to be charged which are applicable to meet the expenses of granting and managing Government annuities granted under the said Acts:

And whereas in the estimate submitted to the House of Commons for the expenses of granting and managing the said annuities, a note has been inserted to the effect that the amount expended for the said purpose would be repaid to the Exchequer out of fees:

1884. Revenue Act, 1884. Ch. 62, 63.

And whereas the fees so taken have been insufficient to meet the said expenses, and consequently a sum is due from the Post Office to the Exchequer in respect of the said expenses, and it is expedient that the said sum should be written off: Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

The Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury may direct to be written off the claim of the Exchequer for any sum due in account from the Post Office in respect of the excess of the expenses of granting and managing Government annuities over and above the fees received in respect of such annuities.

14. Whereas under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is directed to ascertain whether the payments are supported by vouchers or proofs of payment:

And whereas it is expedient to define the nature of the documents which in certain cases are to constitute vouchers or proofs of payment. Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

Where payment out of money granted by Parliament for army services or navy services is made in respect of pay, wages, pensions, or allowances to persons who are serving or have served Her Majesty’s naval or military forces, or are. or have been employed in any of Her Majesty’s naval or military establishments, such payments may be made and witnessed in manner for the time being prescribed by regulations approved by the Treasury; and any pay sheet, list, certificate, or document showing any such payment when attested by the persons whose duty it is under the said regulations to make and witness that payment shall be a voucher or proof of payment for the purposes of section twenty-seven of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.

Any reference in any enactment, whether past or future, to the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall, unless anything in such enactment is inconsistent therewith, be deemed to refer to the Comptroller-General of the receipt and issue of Her Majesty’s Exchequer and Auditor-General of public accounts appointed in- pursuance of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.

This section shall be construed as part of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.

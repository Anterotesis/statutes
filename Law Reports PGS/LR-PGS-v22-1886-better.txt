CHAPTER 9.

An Act to amend the Prisons Act of 1877, so far as regards the Superannuation of Prison Officers.

[16th April 18SG.]

WHEREAS the sections of the Prison Acts of 1877 mentioned ▼ * in the Schedule to this Act provide that where an existing officer of a prison, that is to say, an officer attached to a prison on the first clay of April one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight has been in the prison service for not less than twenty years, and otherwise fulfils the conditions in those sections mentioned, the Treasury may grant to such officer, having regard to his length of prison service, an annuity by way of superannuation allowance

1886.

11

Prison {Officers Sapcrannnation) Act, 1880. Oh. 0.

or a gratuity of the amount and subject to the conditions in those sections mentioned, and that any such annuity or gratuity is to be apportioned between the period of service before the said first day of April and the period of service after that day, and the former amount so apportioned is to be paid by the local authority, and the latter amount so apportioned is to be paid by the Treasury:

And whereas the Array Act, 1879, and the Army Act, 1881, require a difference to be made in the treatment of military prisoners convicted of breaches of discipline, and those convicted of immoral or other criminal offences, and in order to meet such requirement, certain of the prisons transferred by the Prison Acts of 1877, or portions of those prisons were set apart for the reception of military or naval prisoner’s, and became military or naval prisons under the Army Act, 1879, or the Army Act, 1881, and the Naval Discipline Act respectively, but the existing officers of such prisons continued to serve therein:

And whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the service of such officers after the said first day of April in the prisons or the portions thereof so set apart is prison service within the meaning of the said sections of the Prison Acts of 1877, and for the purpose of enabling annuities by way of superannuation allowance or gratuities to be granted to such officers, it is expedient to remove such doubts:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. It is hereby declared that in the Prison Acts of 1877 mentioned in the Schedule to this Act, the expression “ prison service ” includes as respects the period after the first day of April one thousand eight himdred and seventy-eight, service in a military prison under the Army Act, 1879, or the Army Act, 1881, and service in a naval piison under the Naval Discipline Act, and annuities by way of superannuation allowance and gratuities may accordingly be granted to any officer of a prison, and apportioned in manner provided by the said Prison Acts.

2. This Act may be cited as the Prison (Officers’ Superannuation) Act, 1886.

This Act so far as it affects any of the Acts mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall be construed as one with that Act.

This Act and the Prison (Officers’ Superannuation) Act, 1878,—

(a.) so far as they relate to England may lie cite.l together with the Prison Act, 1877, as the Prison Acts, 1877 to 1886, and

(2.) The police receiver, before putting in force any of the powers of the Lands Clauses Acts with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement, shall—

(a.) publish, once at the least during three consecutive weeks in the months of September, October, and November, or any of them, in some one and the same newspaper circulating in the locality, an advertisement describing shortly the object for which the land is proposed to be taken, naming a place in the neighbourhood of the land proposed to be taken, where a plan of such land may be seen at all reasonable hours, and stating the quantity of such land, and shall further,

(v.) Where a notice is served by post it shall be deemed to have been served at the time when the letter containing the same would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, and in proving such service it shall be sufficient to prove that the letter containing the same was properly addressed and put into the post.

Most Gracious Sovereign, '

E, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, towards making good the supply which we have cheerfully granted to Your Majesty in this session of Parliament, have resolved to grant unto Your Majesty the sum herein-after mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

2. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may borrow from time to time, on the credit of the said sum of twenty-six million nine hundred and ninety-three thousand six hundred and fifty-two pounds, any sum or sums of equal or less amount in the whole, and shall repay the moneys so borrowed, with interest not exceeding five pounds per centum per annum, out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund at any period not later than the next succeeding quarter to that in which the said moneys were borrowed.

(3.) In the event of guardians being unable to agree upon a question affecting the welfare of an infant, any of them may apply to the court for its direction, and the court may make such order or orders regarding the matters in difference as it shall think proper.

5. The court may, upon the application of the mother of any infant (who may apply without next friend), make such order as it may think fit regarding the custody of such infant and the right of access thereto of either parent, having regard to the welfare of the infant, and to the conduct of the parents, and to the wishes as. well of the mother as of the father, and may alter, vary, or discharge such order on the application of either parent, or, after the death of either parent, of any guardian under this Act, and in every case , may make such order respecting the costs of the mother and the ' liability of the father for the same or otherwise as to costs as it may think just.

6. In England and Ireland the High Court of Justice, in any division thereof, and in Scotland either division of the Court o£ Session, may, in their discretion, on being satisfied that it is for the f welfare of the infant, remove from his office any testamentary f guardian, or any guardian appointed or acting by virtue of this \ Act, and may also, if they shall deem it to be for the welfare of | the infant, appoint another guardian in place of the guardian so * removed.

landlords refuse to let on reasonable terms ; that is to say, on such terms as are usually obtained in the letting of land of the like quality, and similarly situated in the same district, for other purposes than that of a deer forest, or of a grouse moor, or other sporting purpose.

CHAPTER 36.

An Act to provide for the determination of the Acts respecting the Sale and Transfer of Incumbered Estates in the West Indies.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1854, authorised the appointment of Commissioners (in this Act referred to as the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners) with the powers in the said Act mentioned for the purpose of the sale and transfer of incumbered estates in the colonies (in the West Indies) named in the schedule to the said Act, and made provisions for the disposal of the moneys arising from any such sale and for the payment of such moneys in certain cases to some officer or into some court either in England or the colony; and further enacted as follows:—“ Her Majesty may from time to time by “ Order in Council direet this Act to come into operation in any “ of the said scheduled colonies, and thereupon, but not otherwise, “ the same shall have the force of law in the colony or colonies “ named in any such Order, but no such Order in Council shall be “ made in respect of any colony until the legislature of such colony “ has presented an Address to Her Majesty, praying Her Majesty “ to issue such Order, and has also, to the satisfaction of Her “ Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, made “ provision for the payment of the salaries of the local commissioners, and of all such assistants, secretaries, clerks, messengers, “ and officers as may be appointed under this Act in such colony, “ and of such other expenses of carrying this Act into execution as “ are herein-before directed to be provided for by the legislature of “ the colony ” :

And whereas the said Act has been amended by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1858, by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1862, and by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1864:

And whereas Commissioners were appointed under the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1854, and divers Orders in Council were made applying that Act and the Acts amending the same to sundry of the said colonies:

And whereas under the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1854, the remuneration of the West Indian Incumbered Estates

Ch. 36.

West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1886.

Commissioners and their officers, and their expenses, if incurred in England, were directed to be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and the remuneration of the local commissioners and other officers in the colony, and the expenses incurred in a colony, were directed to be defrayed out of moneys provided for the purpose by the legislature of the colony:

And whereas the office and jurisdiction of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners were limited to expire at the end of six years from the date at which the said Act of 1854 took effect, but were subsequently continued by various Acts until the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two:

And whereas by the Act of the session of the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter nine, intituled “An Act to continue the appointment and jurisdiction 35&36Viet. “ of the Commissioners for the Sale of Incumbered Estates in the c. 9.

“ West Indies,” the office and jurisdiction of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners were continued until Parliament should otherwise determine, but it was enacted that no moneys provided by Parliament should be applicable to the payment of the said Commissioners, or of any persons connected with them, and by reason of that Act and of the proceedings of the governments of various colonies the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners receive at present no remuneration, except any surplus of the fees which may remain after payment of expenses:

And whereas the legislative councils of some of the colonies in which the said Acts are in force have passed resolutions in favour of the abolition of the jurisdiction in those colonies of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners, and there is no power to abolish such jurisdiction without the authority of Parliament, and it is expedient to confer such power:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the West Indian Incumbered Estates short title. Act, 1886.

The above-recited Acts are in this Act referred to as the West Indian Incumbered Estates Acts, 1854 to 1872, and those Acts, together with this Act, may be cited as the West Indian Incumbered Estates Acts, 1854 to 1886.

2. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty from time to time by Order in Council to direct that the West Indian Incumbered Estates Acts, 1854 to 1872, shall cease to be in operation in the colony as from the date mentioned in the Order, and such Order in Council shall have effect as if enacted by this Act.

Before such Order is made in respect of any eolony, an Address from the legislature of the colony praying for the Order shall be presented to Her Majesty.

3. (1.) Every Order in Council under this Act shall contain such provisions as to Her Majesty may seem expedient for all or any of the following purposes ; namely.

Power to the Queen in Council to abolish West Indian In-cumbered Kstates Commission as regards any colony.

(b) for the continuance, either by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners, or by a court in England or the colony, or otherwise, of all proceedings pending at the date of the Order coming into operation;

(c) for the disposal of all moneys which are under the control of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners, or are by virtue of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Acts, 1856 to 1872, under the control of any court or officer either in England or the colony, including the disposal of all unclaimed moneys; and

(d) all such matters as seem to Her Majesty necessary or proper for giving full effect to the Order, and for preserving the interests of all persons affected by any sales or other transactions of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners.

(2.) If it appears to Her Majesty that as respects any colony any Act or Ordinance of the legislature of the colony is necessary for the purpose of securing or better carrying into effect any of the above provisions, or for the purpose of protecting any interests, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty to refuse to make an Order in Council under this Act as respects that colony until the legislature of the colony has passed such Act or Ordinance as so appears necessary.

CHAPTER 37.

An Act to remove certain doubts respecting the construction of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, so far as respects the drawings by which specifications are required to be accompanied, and as respects exhibitions.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS by section five of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 188:5, specifications, whether provisional or complete, must be accompanied by drawings if required, and doubts have arisen as to whether it is sufficient that a complete specification refers to the drawings by which the provisional specification was accompanied, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Patents Act, 188G, and shall be construed as one with the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Acts, 1883 and 1885, and, together with those Acts, may be cited as the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Acts, 1883 to 1886.

2. The requirement of sub-section four of section five of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, as to drawings shall

1886.

89

Patents Act, 1886. Ch. 37, 38.

not be deemed to bo insufficiently complied with by reason only both specifica-that instead of being accompanied by drawings the complete speci- tions* lication refers to the drawings which accompanied the provisional specification. And no patent heretofore sealed shall be invalid by reason only that the complete specification was not accompanied by drawings but referred to those which accompanied the provisional specification.

3. Whereas by section thirty-nine of the Patents, Designs, and Protection of Trade Marks Act, 1883, as respects patents, and by section fifty- patents and seven of the same Act as respects designs, provision is made that eSStited at the exhibition of an invention or design at an industrial or inter- international national exhibition, certified as such by the Board of Trade, shall exhibitions, not prejudice the rights of the inventor or proprietor thereof, subject to the conditions therein mentioned, one of which is that the exhibitor must, before exhibiting the invention, design, or article, or publishing a description of the design, give the Controller the prescribed notice of his intention to do so:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the extension of the said sections to industrial and international exhibitions held out of the United Kingdom, be it therefore enacted as follows:

It shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, from time to time to declare that sections thirty-nine and fifty-seven of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, or either of those sections, shall apply to any exhibition mentioned in the Order in like manner as if it were an industrial or international exhibition certified by the Board of Trade, and to provide that the exhibitor shall be relieved from the conditions, specified in the said sections, of giving notice to the Controller of his intention to exhibit, and shall be so relieved either absolutely or upon such terms and conditions as to Her Majesty in Council may seem fit.

CHAPTER 38.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS by law the inhabitants of the hundred or other area in which property is damaged by persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together are liable in certain cases to pay compensation for such damage, and it is expedient to make other provision respecting such compensation and the mode of recovering the same:

BE it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

And further, in all cases where a check weigher has been appointed by the majority of the colliers working in any mine and has acted as such, he may recover from any collier working in such mine his proportion of the check weighers wages or recompense notwithstanding that any colliers or collier may have left the colliery or others have entered the same since the check weighers appointment, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.

And further, it may be lawful for the owner or manager of any mine to retain the agreed contribution of the colliers for the check weigher, notwithstanding the provisions of the Acts relating to truck, and to pay and account for the same to the said check weigher.

2. Whereas by section fifty of the Principal Act provisions are made with respect to holding coroners inquests on the bodies of persons whose deaths may have been caused by explosions or accidents in mines to which that Act applies, and amongst other things

Provision as to certain Loans and amendment of Acts.

6. Whereas by the Dunbar Harbour Loan Act, 1857, the Public Works Loan Commissioners were required to advance, and accordingly advanced, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight, to the magistrates and town council of Dunbar, as trustees for putting into execution the Act relating to Victoria Harbour at Dunbar, the sum of twenty thousand pounds in aid of the expense of repairing the sea wall and extending the accommodation of the Victoria Harbour, and such loan was to be repaid within thirty years from the date of the advance thereof with interest thereon at the rate of three per cent, per annum, and was advanced on the security of a mortgage of the rates and duties leviable in respect of the said harbour, and of the teind duties in respect of fish to which the said trustees were entitled, and of

117

J886. Public Works Loans , 1886. Ch. 45.

moneys to accrue from the grant of licenses in lieu of any such duties:

And whereas, in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, for the purpose of completing the works for which the said loan was raised, a sum of two thousand five hundred pounds was granted by the Fishery Board for Scotland, and another sum of two thousand five hundred pounds was advanced by the said Fishery Board by way of loan out of funds at their disposal, and was so advanced on the security of a bond from the said trustees, and with the consent of the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the Treasury, the loan secured by such bond had priority over the said loan of twenty thousand pounds due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners:

And whereas up to the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy the receipts from the said rates, duties, teind duties, and moneys after paying expenses did not exceed on an average ninety pounds a year, and since the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy there has been a small annual deficiency in the said receipts to meet the expenses, and thereby the said loans are practically irrecoverable:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners, as respects the said loam of twenty thousand pounds for Victoria Harbour at Dunbar, and the'

And whereas the interest has been duly paid up to the fifth day of May last, but the principal has not been paid:

And whereas under the Belfast Central Railway (Sale) Act, 1885, the undertaking of the Belfast Central Railway Company has become vested in the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland), subject to the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas it is proposed that the said loan should be repaid to the Commissioners by the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland), by five annual instalments of twenty thousand pounds each and that interest should continue to be paid by the Company on so much of the loan as is for the time being unpaid, but that ii the said instalments and interest are punctually paid the said interest should be reduced from five to four per centum per annum; and the first of the said instalments has already been paid:

security of a mortgage dated the fifteenth day of November one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, of certain premises situate at Lecarrow, otherwise Strandhill, in the parish of Innismagrath, barony of Dromahaire and county of Leitrim, various sums amounting to two hundred and twenty pounds, to be repaid with interest at the rate of four pounds per centum per annum within forty years:

And whereas such sums were advanced for the purpose of the erection of buildings to be used as dwellings for the labouring classes and were expended in such erection:

And whereas on account of the said loan there remained due in the month of November one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five a sum of two hundred and seventeen pounds fifteen shillings and ninepence in respect of principal, and thirty-eight pounds six shillings and threepence in respect of arrears of interest, and no sum has since been received:

And whereas the value of the premises was such that it was not prudent for the said Commissioners to redeem on such ejectment by paying the rent in arrear, and therefore the security of the said premises was lost to the said Commissioners, and it is considered to be impracticable otherwise to recover the said debt from the said Lough Allen Clayworks, Limited: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, with the approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, may remit all principal and interest due from the said Lough Allen Clayworks, Limited, under the said mortgage of the fifteenth of November one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, and the amount so remitted shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

CHAPTER 51.

An Act to make provision for the borrowing of Money by Parochial Boards, and for other purposes relating to the Relief of the Poor in Scotland.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the eighth and ninth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, intituled “ An Act for “ the amendment and better administration of the laws relating “ to the relief of the poor in Scotland ” :

188G. Poor Law Loans and Relief (Scotland) Act, 1880. Ch. 51. 141

And whereas an Act was passed in the nineteenth and twentieth 19 & 20 Vict, years of the reign of Her present Majesty, intituled “An Act to c*117* tf amend the law relating to the relief of the poor in Scotland ” :

And whereas in the case of some of the larger parishes in Scotland the mode of borrowing money prescribed by the sixty-second section of the first-recited Act, as amended by the third section of the second-recited Act, has been found to be costly and inconvenient, and the restriction contained in the last proviso to the said sixty-second section has also been attended with great inconvenience:

And whereas it is expedient that the first-recited Act should be amended:

And whereas it is expedient to make provision regarding moneys to which a pauper or pauper lunatic may be entitled as a member of a friendly or benefit society:

And whereas also it is expedient to make provision concerning the chargeability of persons born in poorhouses in Scotland:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. The parochial board in any parish or combination the popu- Power to lation of which exceeds one hundred thousand may, for the purposes specified in the sixty-second section of the first-recited Act, borrow borrow on the such sum or sums of money as they shall from time to time find to security of the be requisite, and may assign the assessments, present and future, leviable by them for the relief of the poor in such parish or com- exercising bination in security of the money so borrowed and the interest power, thereon ; and the bonds to be granted on such borrowing and transferences or assignations and discharges thereof may be in or near to the forms contained in the schedule hereto annexed; and such bonds shall be signed by three members of the parochial board to be appointed for that purpose, of whom the chairman shall be one, and shall constitute a lien over the assessments thereby assigned, and shall entitle the creditors therein to recover the sums thereby due from the parochial board out of the first and readiest of the said assessments ; but no member or officer of the parochial board shall be personally liable for the repayment of such money so borrowed, and all such obligations shall be deemed and taken to be granted on the sole security of the assessments assigned, and the money so borrowed shall be repayable either in one sum or by instalments as may be arranged between the parochial board and the lender, but so that the same shall be wholly repaid, together with the accruing interest, within thirty years from the date of the loan ; but the amount of every such loan, including interest, shall form a charge against the assessments of the years intervening between the date of such loan and the date of full repayment in equal proportions : Provided always, that the total of the principal sum or sums so to be borrowed, together with the amount remaining unpaid of any prior loan or loans, shall not at any time exceed three times the amount of the assessment raised for the relief of the poor during the year immediately preceding that in which any money is so borrowed.

142

Partial repeal of provisions in8& 9 Vict, c. 83.

Parochial board to have no recourse against moneys to which a pauper or pauper lunatic may be entitled as a member of a friendly or benefit society.

Chargeability of child born in a poorhouse.

2. The provision ftt the end of the said sixty-second section of the first-recited Act, “ That no further or other sum shall be “ borrowed or chargeable on the poor assessment for the purposes “ aforesaid until the whole of the money last borrowed, with “ interest on the same, shall have been paid off/’ is hereby repealed in so far as relates to parishes or combinations having a population exceeding one hundred thousand.

3. Before any parochial board shall borrow any sum of money under this Act they shall procure a certificate from the board of supervision acting in the execution of the first-recited Act (which certificate that board shall be bound to grant on being satisfied that the fact stated therein is true) certifying that such parochial board has duly charged or made provision for charging the assessments for the relief of the poor leviable by such parochial board with the proper proportion of principal and interest of any former sum or sums borrowed by such parochial board under this Act, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the lender of the fact stated therein.

4. Any power exercised or claimed by parochial boards to take possession of any property of any one to whom they have given relief shall not apply to any moneys which a pauper or pauper lunatic, having a wife or other relative dependent upon him for maintenance, may be entitled to receive as a member of any friendly or benefit society, but such moneys shall, subject to any deductions for keeping up his membership required by the rules of such society, or any branch thereof, from which such pauper or pauper lunatic is entitled to receive such moneys, be paid or applied by the trustees, committee, or other officers of such society or branch to or for the maintenance of such wife or relative.

5. A child born in a combination poorhouse shall so far as regards any question of liability for maintenance be deemed and held to have been bom within the parish by which the mother of the said child was sent.

CHAPTER 54.

An Act to amend the Tithe Commutation Acts as to Extraordinary Tithe Rentcharge on hop grounds, orchards, fruit plantations, and market gardens, and to provide for fixing the capital value thereof and the redemption of the same.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS by the Acts relating to the commutation of tithes in England and Wales power is given to impose an extraordinary charge and an additional rentcharge by way of extraordinary charge (both which charges are herein-after included under the

149

188b*. Extraordinary Tithe Redemption , 1886. Ch. 54.

expression “ extraordinary charge ”) on hop grounds, orchards, fruit plantations, and market gardens:

And whereas the extraordinary charge levied under these Acts is an impediment to agriculture, and it is expedient that the same be limited in manner herein-after appearing, and that power be given to redeem the same in the manner and upon the terms herein-after mentioned:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows

1. From the date of the passing of this Act no extraordinary charge shall be charged or levied under the Tithe Commutation Acts on any hop ground, orchard, fruit plantation, or market garden, newly cultivated as such after the passing of this Act.

2. The Land Commissioners for England, herein-after referred to as “ the Commissioners,” shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act ascertain in each parish in England and Wales and certify the capital value of the extraordinary charge on each farm, or where not a farm on each parcel of land, in respect of which the said charge is payable at the date of the passing of this Act.i

3. For the purpose of estimating the capital value of the said charge the Commissioners shall take into consideration the net annual value of the same after allowing for the expenses of collection, rates, taxes (except income tax) and other outgoings, the value of the land subject to the said charge, the length of time during which the said charge has been paid, the prospect of the continuance or discontinuance of the special cultivation in respect of which the said charge is imposed, the right of the cultivator to discontinue such special cultivation at any time and thereby to cause the suspension of the said charge, the prospect of the substitution of other land on the same farm for such cultivation, notwithstanding the provisions of the first section of this Act, and any other special circumstances applicable to the farm or parcel of land under consideration, and shall, if so advised or requested, hear evidence on behalf of the landowner, the tithe payer, and the tithe owner. The Commissioners shall then determine and certify under their seal the capital value of the said charge, and the value so certified shall, for the purposes of this Act, be the capital value of the charge : Provided that where the tithe owner is absolutely entitled to the charge in fee simple in possession, or is empowered to dispose thereof absolutely, or to give an absolute discharge for the capital value thereof, the Commissioners may, on the joint application of the tithe owner, the tithe payer, and the landowner, or of the tithe owner and the landowner in cases where the last named is also the tithe payer, certify such amount as may be agreed on between them to be" the capital value of the charge included in such application.

4. (1.) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the redemption of charges, land in respect of which at the date of the passing of this Act extraordinary charge is payable shall, so soon as the capital value of the said charge shall have been certified under the provisions of this Act, be charged with the payment of an annual rentcharge equal to four per centum on such capital value,

in lieu of the extraordinary charge which shall cease on the half-yearly day of payment thereof which shall immediately precede the date of the said certificate, such rentcharge to be a charge upon the particular farm or parcel of land in respect of which the same has been assessed.

(2.) Provided that the Commissioners may from time to time, if they think fit, on application by or on behalf of any person interested in land so charged, by order under their seal exonerate from the charge the whole or any part of that land, and may, if necessary, substitute other land for the land so exonerated, provided that the value of the land charged with the payment of the rent-charge shall be in their opinion equal to at least three times the capital value of the rentcharge and that such land is held under the same title, and subject to the same limitations as the land so exonerated.

(3.) The rentcharge shall be payable half-yearly on the days on which the extraordinary charge in the parish has hitherto been payable, and the first payment thereof shall be made on the one of the said two days which shall first occur after the capital value shall have been certified as aforesaid, the first payment to be a full half-yearly payment. The rentcharge shall have priority over all existing and future estates, interests, and incumbrances whatever.

(4.) The rentcharge shall be payable to the person who would but for this Act have been for the time being entitled to receive the extraordinary charge, and shall be held on the trusts and subject to the provisions and conditions (if any) applicable to that charge.

(5.) If default is made in payment of any instalment of the rentcharge it may be recovered by action in Her Majesty's High Court of Justice, or a county court, or in the same way that rent-charge in lieu of ordinary tithe is recoverable and subject to like conditions, or by entry upon and perception of the rents and profits of the land subject to such rentcharge. The sa.id rentcharge shall not be subject to any parochial, county, or other rate, charge, or assessment.

Redemption of 5. (1.) The owner of or any person interested in any land charge. subject either to an extraordinary charge or to a rentcharge substituted therefor under this Act may at any time redeem the charge in manner by this section provided.

(2.) Where the person entitled to the charge is the incumbent of a benefice, the owner or any person interested in the land may pay the amount of the capital value of the extraordinary charge to the Governors of Queen Anne’s Bounty (the receipt of whose treasurer shall be a sufficient discharge for the same), to be held or applied for the benefit of the incumbent for the time being, as if the same were money paid in redemption of ordinary rentcharge.

(3.) Where the person entitled to the charge is absolutely entitled thereto in fee simple in possession, or is empowered to dispose thereof absolutely, or to give an absolute discharge for the capital value thereof, the owner of or any person interested in the land may, after giving one month’s notice to the person entitled to the charge, pay or tender to him the amount of the capital value of the extraordinary charge or any less sum which may be agreed on.

(4.) In any other case the owner of or any person interested in the land may pay the amount of the capital value of the extraordinary charge into the Bank of England, to be placed to the account of the Paymaster-General, in the matter of the landowner and the tithe owner (naming them), and in the matter of this Act; and the money so paid shall be applicable to the like purposes and may he dealt with in like manner as if it were money paid into the bank under the Tithe Commutation Acts.

(5.) On proof to the Commissioners that payment or tender has been made as by this section provided in respect of any extraordinary charge or substituted rentcharge, they shall certify that the charge is redeemed, and that certificate shall be final and conclusive, and the land shall be thereby absolutely freed and discharged from the charge from the date of the next half-yearly payment.

6. (1.) Money applicable to the purchase of land to be settled Redemption in to or on any uses or trusts shall be applicable in or towards the of redemption of an extraordinary charge or a rentcharge under this Act on land settled to or on the like uses or trusts.

(2.)

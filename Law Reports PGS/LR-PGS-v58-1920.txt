lord or a’ former landlord, and the dwelling-house was let to him in consequence of that employment and he has ceased to be in that employment; or

(5) An order or judgment against a tenant for the recovery of possession of any dwelling-house or ejectment therefrom under this section shall not affect the right of any sub-tenant to whom the premises or any part thereof have been lawfully sublet before proceedings for recovery of possession or ejectment were commenced, to retain possession under this section, or be in any way operative against any such sub-tenant.

(6) Where a landlord has obtained an order or judgment for possession or ejectment under this section on the ground that he requires a dwelling-house for his own occupation, and it is subsequently made to appear to the court that the order was obtained by misrepresentation or the concealment of material facts, the court may order the landlord to pay to the former tenant such sum as appears sufficient as compensation for damage or loss sustained by that tenant as the result of the order or judgment.

(6) In any other case the rate at which relief is to be given shall be one-half of the appropriate rate of United Kingdom tax.

For the purpose of this section, the expression “the appropriate rate of United Kingdom tax” means the rate at which the claimant for the year to which the claim relates has borne or is liable to bear United Kingdom income tax, and where the claimant is liable to United Kingdom super-tax the expression “the appropriate rate of United Kingdom tax” means a rate equal to the sum of the rates at which he has borne or is liable to bear United Kingdom income tax and super-tax respectively for that year.

(3) Where by reason of the allowance of relief under this section the rate of United Kingdom income tax deducted from or paid in respect of any part of the income of any individual is less than the standard rate, and the rate of the relief so allowed is greater than the rate appropriate to the case of that individual, such an adjustment shall be made in allowing to that individual any relief to which he may be entitled under the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to the rate of tax on the first two hundred and twenty-five pounds of taxable income as may be necessary to secure that the amount of United Kingdom income tax finally paid or borne by him shall be equal to the amount which would have been paid or borne if the relief under this section had in the first instance been given at the rate appropriate to his case.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in the Rules applicable to Case IV. or Case V. of Schedule D. or in any other provision of the Income Tax Acts, no deduction shall be made on account of the payment of Dominion income tax in estimating income for the purposes of United Kingdom income tax, and where income tax has been paid or is payable in any Dominion either on the income out of which income subject to United Kingdom income tax arises or is received, or as a direct charge in respect of that income, the income so subject to United Kingdom income tax shall be deemed to be income arising or received after deduction of Dominion income tax and an addition shall, in estimating income for the purposes of the United Kingdom income tax, be made to that income of the proportionate part of the income tax paid or payable in the Dominion in respect of the income out of which that income arises or is received together with the full amount of any Dominion income tax directly charged or chargeable in the Dominion in respect of that income:

(b) where under the laws in force in any Dominion no

provision is made for the allowance of relief from Dominion income tax in respect of the payment of United Kingdom income tax, then in assessing or charging income tax in the United Kingdom in respect of income assessed or charged to income tax in that Dominion a deduction shall be allowed in estimating income for the purpose of United Kingdom income tax of an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the Dominion income tax paid or payable in respect of the income and the total amount of the relief granted from the United Kingdom income tax in respect of the Dominion income tax for the period on the income of which the assessment or charge to United Kingdom income tax is computed.

In this subsection the expression “dividends ” includes any interest, annuities, dividends, shares of annuities, pensions, or other annual payments or sums in respect of which tax is charged under the Rules applicable to Schedule C. or under Rule VII. of the Miscellaneous Rules applicable to Schedule D.

(6) Where under the law in force in any Dominion provision is made for the allowance of relief from Dominion income tax in respect of the payment of United Kingdom income tax, the obligation as to secrecy imposed by the Income Tax Acts upon persons employed in relation to Inland Revenue shall not prevent the disclosure to the authorised officer of the Govern* ment of the Dominion of such facts as may be necessary to enable the proper relief to be given in cases where relief is claimed

For the purposes of this section, the rate of United Kingdom income tax shall be ascertained by dividing by the amount of the taxable income of the person concerned the amount of tax payable by that person on that income before deduction of any relief granted in respect of life assurance premiums or any relief granted under the provisions of this section, and the rate of United Kingdom super-tax shall be ascertained by dividing the amount of

Provided that —

(a) Where the undertakers are commissioners or any other authority or public body of persons carrying on otherwise than for purposes of private profit any such undertaking, no modification in the statutory provisions regulating the charges to be made by the undertakers shall be authorised which is more than sufficient, so far as can be estimated, to enable the undertaking to be carried on without loss; and

(6) In any other case, no such modification shall be authorised which is more than sufficient to provide, with due care and management, for interest on loan capital and for a reasonable return on share capital, regard being had to the pre-war financial condition of the undertaking and its prospective development.

(2) Before making an order in pursuance of the powers conferred by this Act, the Minister shall refer the matter to the rates advisory committee constituted under section twenty-one of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, for their consideration and 9 & io Geo. 5. report: Provided that, if it appears to the Minister that there c* 60. is ground for making an order, and that the case is one of urgency, he may, without any such reference and without any such notices as are hereinafter required, make an interim order increasing the statutory maximum charges by such amount and subject to such conditions as he thinks proper; but an interim

(2) An order under this section may provide for modifying the statutory or other provisions affecting the charges which may be made by the undertakers, by substituting for the standard or maximum price authorised under those provisions a standard or maximum price for each hundred thousand British thermal units (in this Act referred to as “ a therm ”).

(3) The standard or maximum price per therm fixed by the order shall be a price corresponding as nearly as may be to that fixed by those provisions for each thousand cubic feet, but with such addition as appears to the Board reasonably required in order to meet the increases (if any) due to circumstances beyond the control of, or which could not reasonably have been avoided by, the undertakers, which have occurred since the thirtieth day of June nineteen hundred and fourteen in the costs and charges of and incidental to the production and supply of gas by the undertakers; and the order may make such modifications of any provisions whereby the rate of dividend payable by the undertakers or any other payment is dependent on the price of gas supplied as appear to the Board to be necessary:

Provided that, if at any time it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade that the costs and charges of and incidental to the production and supply of gas have substantially altered from circumstances beyond the control of, or which could not reasonably have been avoided by the undertakers, the Board may, if they think fit, on the application of the undertakers or of the local authority, or, where the local authority are the undertakers, of twenty consumers, make an amending order correspondingly revising the powers of charging authorised by the original order.

(4) An order under this section —

(a) shall prescribe the time when and the manner in which

the undertakers are to give notice of the calorific value of the gas which they intend to supply (in this Act referred to as the declared calorific value), and shall require that such notice shall at the same time be published in the London, or Edinburgh, or Dublin Gazette; and

(b) shall require the undertakers, in the case of alteration

in the declared calorific value, to take at their own expense such steps as may be necessary to alter, adjust, or replace the burners in consumers’ appliances in such manner as to secure that the gas can be burned with safety and efficiency, except in the case of any consumer who objects to such alteration, adjustment, or replacement by the undertakers; and (c) may prescribe, subject to such conditions as the Board may think necessary, the additional charge M

Ch. 28.

Oas Regulation Act, 1920.

per therm which the undertakers may make in respect of gas supplied by means of prepayment meters; and P

(d) may make such supplemental and consequential pro-

visions as appear necessary to give full effect to the order; and

(e) shall come into operation on such date as may be

fixed by the order; and (/) shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.

(5) If within two years after the passing of this Act any undertakers have not applied to the Board of Trade for an order under this section, the Board of Trade may, after giving not less than three months’ notice to the undertakers, make an order applying to those undertakings, which shall have the same effect as an order made on the application of the undertakers.

(6) Before making any order under this section, the Board of Trade shall, where the order is made on the application of undertakers, require the undertakers to give, and in any other case shall themselves give public notice in the London or Edinburgh or Dublin Gazette as the case may be and in such other manner as the Board may consider best adapted for informing persons affected, of the application for or proposal to make an order, and of the maximum or standard price per therm proposed, and as to the manner in which and time within which objections may be made, and shall consider any objection which may be duly made, and shall, where they think it expedient to do so, cause an inquiry to be held. The notice to be given under this section shall include notice to the local authority.

(7) The calorific value of gas means, for the purposes of this Act, the number of British thermal units (gross) produced by the combustion of one cubic foot of the gas measured at sixty degrees Fahrenheit under a pressure of thirty inches of mercury and saturated with water vapour.

2. — (1) Where an order under this Act has been made affecting any undertakers, the gas supplied by those undertakers, in addition to conforming to the conditions prescribed in the order, shall comply with the following conditions, that is to say: —

(i) it shall not contain any trace of sulphuretted hydrogen

when tested in accordance with this Act;

(ii) it shall be supplied at not less than the minimum permissible

pressure:

Provided that the foregoing requirements shall not apply as respects a separate supply of gas by any undertakers for industrial purposes only, but an order may impose such other conditions with regard to gas supplied by those undertakers dor those purposes as appear necessary to the Board of Trade.

(2) The minimum permissible pressure shall be such pressure in any main, or in any pipe laid between the main and the meter having an internal diameter of two inches and upwards, as to

1920.

Gas Regulation, 1920.

Provided that the Minister shall not make or continue an arrangement with a society or other association under this section:—

(a) Unless he is of opinion that the payments authorised

by the rules of the society or other association to be made to its members when unemployed (inclusive of any payments in respect of which a refund may be made to the society or other association under this section) represent a provision for unemployment as respects such of its members as are employed persons which during the period between the commencement of this Act and the thirty-first day of July nineteen hundred and twenty-one exceeds the provision represented by unemployment benefit at the rate payable under this Act by an amount which is equal to at least one-third of the provision represented by unemployment benefit at the rate payable before the commencement of the National Insurance (Unemployment) Act, 1919, and which thereafter is at least one-third greater than the provision represented by unemployment benefit at the rate payable under this Act:

ascertaining the wages and conditions prevailing in every employment within the meaning of this Act in which its members are engaged and of obtaining from employers notification of vacancies for employment and giving notice thereof to its members when unemployed as is in the opinion of the Minister reasonably effective for securing that unemployed persons competent to undertake the particular class of work required, shall, with all practicable speed, be brought into communication with employers having vacancies to fill.

1920. Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. Ch. 30. 203

section four of the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy (Ireland) 52 & 53 Vict. Act, 1889, are, in the distribution of the property of a bankrupt 0-60* or arranging debtor, to be paid in priority to all other debts, all contributions payable under this Act by the bankrupt or arranging debtor in respect of employed persons during the four months before the date of the order of adjudication in the case of a bankrupt or the filing of the petition for arrangement in the case of an arranging debtor, and that Act shall have effect accordingly, and formal proof of the debts to which priority is given under this subsection shall not be required except in cases where it may otherwise be provided by general orders made under the said Act.

the general provisions of this Act, subject, in the case of the 1^k1^3urance

employed person’s contributions, to the deduction of any amount

received by him in respect of unemployment benefit to which

5. — (I) So long as the aggregate expenditure on naval and air services respectively is not made to exceed the aggregate sums appropriated by this Act for those services respectively, any surplus arising on any vote for those services, either by an excess of the sum realised on account of appropriations in aid of the vote over the sum which may be applied under this Act as appropriations in aid of that vote, or by saving of expenditure on that vote, may, with the sanction of the Treasury, be temporarily applied either in making up any deficiency in the sums realised on account of appropriations in aid of any other vote in the same department, or in defraying expenditure in the same department which is not provided for in the sums appropriated to the service of the department by this Act, and which it may be detrimental to the public service to postpone until provision can be made for it by Parliament in the usual course.

(2) A statement showing all cases in which the sanction of the Treasury has been given to the temporary application of a surplus under this section, and showing the circumstances under which the sanction of the Treasury has been given, shall be laid before the House of Commons with the appropriation accounts of the naval and air services for the year, in order that any temporary application of any surplus sanctioned by the Treasury under this section may be submitted for the sanction of Parliament.

It is enacted that the application of those surpluses as shown in the said accounts is hereby sanctioned.

7. A person shall not receive any part of a grant which may be made in pursuance of this Act for half-pay or army, navy, air force, or civil non-effective services, until he has subscribed such declaration as may from time to time be prescribed by a warrant of the Treasury before one of the persons prescribed by such warrant:

Provided that, whenever any such payment is made at more frequent intervals than once in a quarter, the Treasury may dispense with the production of more than one declaration in respect of each quarter.

Any person who makes a declaration for the purpose of this section, knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

8. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Appropriation Act, 1920.

Treasury may, in certain cases of exiffonoy, authorise expenditure unprovided for; provided that the aggregate grants for the navy services and for the air services respectively be not exceeded.

1. — (1) Where a maintenance order has, whether before or after the passing of this Act, been made against any person by any court in any part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom to which this Act extends, and a certified copy of the order has been transmitted by the governor of that part of His Majesty’s dominions to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall send a copy of the order to the prescribed officer of a court in England or Ireland for registration; and on receipt thereof the order shall be registered in the prescribed manner, and shall, from the date of such registration, be of the same force and effect, and, subject to the provisions of this Act, all proceedings may be taken on such order as if it had been an order originally obtained in the court in which it is so registered, and that court shall have power to enforce the order accordingly.

(2) The court in which an order is to be so registered as aforesaid shall, if the court by which the order was made was a court of superior jurisdiction, be the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, or in Ireland the King’s Bench Division (Matrimonial) of the High Court of Justice in

Ireland, and, if the court was not a court of superior jurisdiction, be a court of summary jurisdiction.

2. Where a court in England or Ireland has, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, made a maintenance order against any person, and it is proved to that court that the person against whom the order was made is resident in some part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom to which this Act extends, the court shall send to the Secretary of State for transmission to the governor of that part of His Majesty’s dominions a certified copy of the order.

3. — (1) Where an application is made to a court of summary jurisdiction in England or Ireland for a maintenance order against any person, and it is proved that that person is resident in a part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom to which this Act extends, the court may, in the absence of that person, if after hearing the evidence it is satisfied of the justice of the application, make any such order as it might have made if a summons had been duly served on that person and he had failed to appear at the hearing, but in such case the order shall be provisional only, and shall have no effect unless and until confirmed by a competent court in such part of His Majesty’s dominions as aforesaid.

(2) The evidence of any witness who is examined on any such application shall be put into writing, and such deposition shall be read over to and signed by him.

(3) Where such an order is made, the court shall send to the Secretary of State for transmission to the governor of the part of His Majesty’s dominions in which the person against whom the order is made is alleged to reside the depositions so taken and a certified copy of the order, together with a statement of the grounds on which the making of the order might have been opposed if the person against whom the order is made had been duly served with a summons and had appeared at the hearing, and such information as the court possesses for facilitating the identification of that person, and ascertaining his whereabouts.

(4) Where any such provisional order has come before a court in a part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom to which this Act extends for confirmation, and the order has by that court been remitted to the court of summary jurisdiction which made the order for the purpose of taking further evidence, that court or any other court of summary jurisdiction sitting and acting for the same place shall, after giving the prescribed notice, proceed to take the evidence in like manner and subject to the like conditions as the evidence in support of the original application.

Enforcement), 1920.

If upon the hearing of such evidence it appears to the court that the order ought not to have been made, the court may rescind the order, but in any other case the depositions shall be sent to the Secretary of State and dealt with in like manner as the original depositions.

(5) The confirmation of an order made under this section shall not affect any power of a court of summary jurisdiction to vary or rescind that order: Provided that on the making of a varying or rescinding order the court shall send a certified copy thereof to the Secretary of State for transmission to the governor of the part of His Majesty’s dominions in which the original order was confirmed, and that in the case of an order varying the original order the order shall not have any effect unless and until confirmed in like manner as the original order.

(6) The applicant shall have the same right of appeal, if any, against a refusal to make a provisional order as he would have had against a refusal to make the order had a summons been duly served on the person against whom the order is sought to be made.

4. — (1) Where a maintenance order has been made by a court in a part of His Majesty’s dominions outside the United Kingdom to which this Act extends, and the order is provisional only and has no effect unless and until confirmed by a court of summary jurisdiction in England or Ireland, and a certified copy of the order, together with the depositions of witnesses and a statement of the grounds on which the order might have been opposed has been transmitted to the Secretary of State, and it appears to the Secretary of State that the person against whom the order was made is resident in England or Ireland, the Secretary of State may send the said documents to the prescribed officer of a court of summary jurisdiction, with a requisition that a summons be issued calling upon the person to show cause why that order should not be confirmed, and upon receipt of such documents and requisition the court shall issue such a summons and cause it to be served upon such person.

(2) A summons so issued may be served in England or Ireland in the same manner as if it had been originally issued or subsequently endorsed by a court of summary jurisdiction having jurisdiction in the place where the person happens to be.

(3) At the hearing it shall be open to the person on whom the summons was served to raise any defence which he might have raised in the original proceedings had he been a party thereto, but no other defence, and the certificate from the court which made the provisional order stating the grounds on which the making of the order might have been opposed if the person against whom the order was made had been a party to the proceedings shall be conclusive evidence that those grounds are grounds on which objection may be taken.

(4) If at the hearing the person served with the summons does not appear or, on appearing, fails to satisfy the court that the order ought not to be confirmed, the court may confirm the order either without modification or with such modifications as to the court after hearing the evidence may seem just.

(5) If the person against whom the summons was issued appears at the hearing and satisfies the court that for the purpose of any defence it is necessary to remit the case to the court which made the provisional order for the taking of any further evidence, the court may so remit the case and adjourn the proceedings for the purpose.

(6) Where a provisional order has been confirmed under this section, it may be varied or rescinded in like manner as if it had originally been made by the confirming court, and where on an application for rescission or variation the court is satisfied that it is necessary to remit the case to the court which made the order for the purpose of taking any further evidence, the court may so remit the case and adjourn the proceedings for the purpose.

(7) Where an order has been so confirmed, the person bound thereby shall have the same right of appeal, if any, against the confirmation of the order as he would have had against the making of the order had the order been an order made by the court confirming the order.

u0W“f0s»ateto The Secretary of State may make regulations as to the

maL°regu- manner in which a case can be remitted by a court authorised to confirm a provisional order to the court which made the uoa^iSwwn provisional order, and generally for facilitating communications oourta. between such courts.

Provided that, if the order is of such a nature that if made by the court in which it is so registered, or by which it is so confirmed, it would be enforceable in like manner as an order of affiliation, the order shall be so enforceable.

(3) A warrant of distress or commitment issued by a court of summary jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing any order so registered or confirmed may be executed in any part of the

(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation, and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 50* 51 Vict. 1887. c< 16

3. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local loans specified in the tables contained in Part I., Part II., and Part III. respectively of the Schedule to this Act should, to the extent specified in the last column of those tables, not be reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887:

Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the extent aforesaid and the said sums shall be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

4. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the~ Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees, as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees, so pledged as aforesaid, was in the year ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty, insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of two hundred pounds, with interest amounting to one hundred and fifty-one pounds seven shillings,

Now, therefore, the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and fifty-one pounds seven shillings shall be remitted.

5. — (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Public Works Loan Commissioners may advance out of the Local Loans Fund to local authorities within the meaning of the Housing Acts, 1890 to 1919, and on the like security as sums borrowed for the purposes of those Acts, any sums which those authorities have power to borrow for those purposes:

Provided that —

not exceed such sum as may be approved by the Treasury and the Minister of Health in that behalf; and

(b) the amount advanced shall be repaid by the local

authority to the Local Loans Fund within a period of twelve months from the date of the advance.

(2) Interest on advances under this section shall be payable at such a rate as the Treasury may from time to time fix or, if at any time and so long as the rate originally fixed by the Treasury in the case of any advance is less than the bank rate for the time being in force, at the bank rate.

(3) A local authority to whom an advance has been made under this section may, without the consent of the Minister of Health, borrow any money required for the purpose of repaying the advance.

(4) The power to make advances under this section shall not be exercised after the thirtieth day of September, nineteen hundred and twenty-one.

A local authority shall not under this Act acquire land for allotments save at such price or rent that in the opinion of the local authority all expenses, except such expenses as are incurred in making roads to be used by the public, incurred by the local authority in acquiring the land and otherwise in relation to the allotments may reasonably be expected to be recouped out of the rents obtained in respect thereof.

For the purpose of this section, the expression “reasonable rent,” means the rent, exclusive of rates and taxes, which a person taking an allotment might reasonably be expected to pay, taking one year with another, to a landlord, having regard to the value of similar land in the neighbourhood, to the extent and situation of the allotment, to the expenses of adapting the land to the purposes of the allotment, and to the repairs and other outgoings payable by the landlord, and to the cost and risk of collecting the rents of, and otherwise managing, allotments.

(2.) A duplicate of every appointment shall be sent to the said council and be kept among the records of the county or borough, as the case may be.

(3.) A deputy may act for the coroner during his illness or during his absence for any lawful or reasonable cause, or at any inquest which the coroner is disqualified for holding, but not otherwise. In the case of a borough coroner the necessity of his so acting shall be certified on each occasion by a justice of the peace, and such certificate shall state the cause of absence of the coroner, be openly read to every inquest jury summoned by the deputy coroner, and.be conclusive evidence of the jurisdiction of the deputy to act.

(5.) For the purpose of an inquest or act which a deputy of a coroner is authorised to hold or do, he shall be deemed to be that coroner, and have the same jurisdiction and powers and be subject to the same obligations, liabilities, and disqualifications as that coroner, and he shall generally be subject to the provisions of the Coroners Act, 1887, and to the Jaw relating to coronets in like manner as that coroner.

(6.) A council may postpone the appointment of a coroner to fill a vacancy, either generally or in any particular case, for a period not exceeding three months from the date at which that vacancy occurs.

(7.) For the purposes of this section the council who appointed a coroner shall —

(a)where the coroner was, in pursuance of any section of the Local Government Act, 1888, appointed by or on the recommendation of a joint committee, be deemed to be any of the councils who appointed any members of that committee; and

(6) where a coroner for a district of a county is, in pursuance of subsection four of section thirty-four of the Local Government Act, 1888, appointed by the council of any county borough, be deemed to be that council.

(8.) In the case of a county coroner who has been elected before the date on which the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888, as to the appointment of coroners came into force, the council of any county or county borough, in which the district of the coroner is wholly or partially situated, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be the council who appointed the coroner.

6 — (1) Where any street or part of a street is not sewered, levelled, paved, metalled, flagged, channelled, made good, and lighted to the satisfaction of the urban authority, the urban authority may'from time to time resolve with respect to such street or part of a street to do any one or more of the following works (in this Act called private street works); that is to say, to sewer, level, pave, metal, flag, channel, or make good, or to provide proper means for lighting such street or part of a street; and the expenses incurred by the urban authority in executing private street works shall be apportioned (subject as in this Act mentioned) on the premises fronting, adjoining, or abutting on such street or part of a street. Any such resolution may include several streets or parts of streets, or may be limited to any part or parts of a street.

(2.) The surveyor shall prepare, as respects each street or part of a street, —

(a.) A specification of the private street works referred to in the resolution, with plans and sections (if applicable);

(b.) An estimate of the probable expenses of the works ;

(c.) A provisional apportionment of the estimated expenses among the premises liable to be charged therewith under this Act.

Such specification, plans, sections, estimate, and provisional apportionment shall comprise the particulars prescribed in Part I. of the Schedule to this Act, and shall be submitted to the urban authority, who may by resolution approve the same respectively with or without modification or addition as they think fit.

(3.) The resolution npproving the specifications, plans, and sections (if any), estimates, and provisional apportionments, shall be published in the manner prescribed in Part II. of the Schedule to this Act, and copies thereof shall be served on the owners of the premises shown as liable to be charged in the provisional apportionment within seven days after the date of the first publication. During one month from the date of the fir»t publication the approved specifications, plans, and sections (if any), estimates, and provisional apportionments (or copies (hereof certified by the surveyor), shall be kept deposited at the urban authority offices, and shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times.

7. During the said month any owner of any premises shown in a provisional apportionment as liable to be charged with any part of the expenses of executing the works may, by written notice served on the urban authority, object to the proposals of the urban authority on any of the following grounds; (that is to say,)

(a.) That an alleged street or pari of a street is not or does not form part of a street within the meaning of this Act;

(5.) That a street or pari of a street is (in whole or in part) a highway repairable by the inhabitants at large ;

(c.) That there has been some material informality, defect, or error in or in respect of the resolution, notice, plans, sections, or estimate;

(d.) That the proposed works are insufficient or unreasonable, or that the estimated expenses are excessive ;

1892.

Private Street Works Act, 1892.

Ch. 57.

575

(e.) That any premises ought to be excluded from or inserted in the provisional apportionment;

(/.) That the provisional apportionment is incorrect in respect of some matter of fact to be specified in the object ion or (where the provisional apportionment is made with regard to other considerations than frontage as herein-after provided) in respect of the degree of benefit to be derived by any persons, or the amount or value of any work already done by the owner or occupier of any premises.

For the purposes of this Act joint tenants or tenants in common may object through one of their number authorised in writing under the hands of the majority of such joint tenants or tenants in common.

The urban authority at any time after the expiration of the said month may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction to appoint a time for determining the matter of all objections made as in this Act mentioned, and shall publish a notice of the time and place appointed, and copies of such notice shall be served upon the objectors; and at the time and place so appointed any such court may proceed to hear and determine the matter of all such objections in the same manner as nearly as may be, and with the same powers and subject to the same provisions with respect to stating a case, as if the urban authority were proceeding summarily against the objectors to enforce payment of a sum of money summarily recoverable. The corn t may quash in whole or in part or may amend the resolution, plans, sections, estimates, and provisional apportionments, or any of them, on the application either of any objector or of the urban authority. The court may also, if it thinks fit, adjourn the hearing and direct any further notices to be given.

(2.) No objection which could be made under ihis Act shall be otherwise made or allowed in any court proceeding or manner whatsoever.

(3.) The costs of any proceedings before a court of summary jurisdiction in relation to objections under this Act shall be in the discretion of the court, and the court shall have power, if it thinks fit, to direct that the whole or any part of such costs ordered to be paid by an objector or objectors shall be paid in the first instance by the urban authority, and charged as part of the expenses of the works on the premises of the objector or objectors in such proportions as may appear just.

9. — (1.) The urban authority may include in any works ta> be done under this Act with respect to any street or part of a street any works which they think necessary for bringing the street or part of a street, as regards sewerage, drainage, level, or other matters, into conformity with any other streets (whether repairable or not by the inhabitants at large), including the provision of separate sewers for the reception of sewage and of surface water respectively.

pounds per centum (in addition to the estimated actual cost) in respect of surveys, superintendence, and notices, and such commission when received shall be carried to the credit of the district fund.

10. In a provisional apportionment of expenses of private street works the apportionment of expenses against the premises fronting, adjoining, or abutting on the street or part of a street in respect of which the expenses are to be incurred shall, unless the urban authority otherwise resolve, be apportioned according to the frontage of the respective premises; but the urban authority may, if they think just, resolve that in settling the apportionment regard shall be had to the following considerations; (that is to say,)

(a.) The greater or less degree of benefit to be derived by any premises from such works;

(5.) The amount and value of any work already done by the owners or occupiers of any such premises.

They may also, if they think just, include any premises which do not front, adjoin, or abut on the street or part of a street, but access to which is obtained from the street through a court, passage, or otherwise, and which in their opinion will be benefited by the works, and may fix the sum or proportion to be charged against any such premises accordingly.

11. The urban authority may from time to time amend the specifications, plans, and sections (if any), estimates, and provisional apportionments for any private street works, but if the total amount of the estimate in respect of any street or part of a street is increased, such estimate and the provisional apportionment shall be published in the manner prescribed in Part II. of the Schedule to this Act, and shall be open to inspection at the urban authority offices at all reasonable times, and copies thereof shall be served on the owners of the premises affected thereby; and objections may be made to the increase and apportionment, and if made shall be dealt with and determined in like manner as objections to the original estimate and apportionment.

12. — (1.) When any private street works have been completed, and the expenses thereof ascertained, the surveyor shall make a final apportionment by dividing the expenses in £he same proportions in which the estimated expenses were divided in the original or amended provisional apportionment (as the case may be), and such final apportionment shall be conclusive for all purposes; and notice of such final apportionment shall be served upon the owners of the premises affected thereby; and the sums apportioned thereby shall be recoverable in manner provided by this Act, or in the same manner as private improvement expenses are recoverable under the Public Health Act, 1875, including the power to declare any such expenses to be payable by instalments.

(2.) Within one month after such notice the owner of any premises charged with any expenses under such apportionment may, by a written notice to the urban authority, object to such final apportionment on the following grounds, or any of them : —

1892.

Ch. 57.

577

(a.) That the actual expenses have without sufficient reason exceeded the estimated expenses by more than fifteen per cent.

(6.) That the final apportionment has not been made in accordance with this section.

(c.) That there has been an unreasonable departure from the specification, plans, and sections.

(3.) Objections under this section shall be determined in the same manner as objections to the provisional apportionment.

13. — (1.) Any premises included in the final apportionment, and Charge on all estates and interests from time to time therein, shall stand and Premi8e9-remain charged (to the like extent and effect as under section two hundred and fifty-seven of the Public Health Act, 1875) with the

sum finally apportioned on them, or if objection has been made against the final apportionment with the sum determined to be due as from the date of the final apportionment, with interest at the rate of four pounds per centum per annum, and the urban authority shall, for the recovery of such sum and interest, have all the same powers and remedies Under the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881, and otherwise as if they were mortgagees having powers of sale and lease and of appointing a receiver.

(2.) The urban authority shall keep a register of charges under this Act and of the payments made in satisfaction thereof, and the register shall be open to inspection to all persons at all reasonable times on payment of not exceeding one shilling in respect of each name or property searched for, and the urban authority shall furnish copies of any part of such register to any person applying for the same on payment of such reasonable sum as may be fixed by the urban authority.

14. The urban authority, if they think fit, may from time to time Recovery (in addition and without prejudice to any other remedy) recover of expend* summarily in a court of summary jurisdiction, or as a simple con- ^actionf of tract debt by action in any court of competent jurisdiction, from the

owner for the time being of- any premises in respect of which any sum is due for expenses of private street works the whole or any portion of such sum, together with interest at a rate not exceeding four pounds per centum per annum, from the date of the final apportionment till payment thereof.

15. The urban authority, if they think fit, may at any time Contribution

resolve to contribute the whole or a portion of the expenses of any to

private street works, and may pay the same out of the district fund expend. ° or general district rate or other rate out of which the general expenses incurred under the Public Health Act, 1875, are payable.

16. The incumbent or minister or trustee of any church, chapel, or place appropriated to public religious worship, which is for the time being by law exempt from rates for the relief of the poor, shall not be liable to any expenses of private street works as the owner of such church, chapel, or place, or of any churchyard or burial ground attached thereto, nor shall any such expenses be

12. — (1.) When any private street works have been completed, and the expenses thereof ascertained, the surveyor shall make a final apportionment by dividing the expenses in £he same proportions in which the estimated expenses were divided in the original or amended provisional apportionment (as the case may be), and such final apportionment shall be conclusive for all purposes; and notice of such final apportionment shall be served upon the owners of the premises affected thereby; and the sums apportioned thereby shall be recoverable in manner provided by this Act, or in the same manner as private improvement expenses are recoverable under the Public Health Act, 1875, including the power to declare any such expenses to be payable by instalments.

15. The urban authority, if they think fit, may at any time resolve to contribute the whole or a portion of the expenses of any private street works, and may pay the same out of the district fund or general district rate or other rate out of which the general expenses incurred under the Public Health Act, 1875, are payable.

16. The incumbent or minister or trustee of any church, chapel, or place appropriated to public religious worship, which is for the time being by law exempt from rates for the relief of the poor, shall not be liable to any expenses of private street works as the owner of such church, chapel, or place, or of any churchyard or burial ground attached thereto, nor shall any such expenses be

An Act to render valid Marriages heretofore solemnized at the Ellerker Cliapel-of-Ease, Brantingham. and at the Churches of Saint Mark, Marske-in-Cleveland, All Saints> Bright waltham (otherwise Brightwalton) and Saint Mary, Great Ilford, and at the Old Baptist Union Chapel, Grays Thurrock, and Marriages solemnized after banns published at the Mission Boom in the parish of Marrick.

[14th August 1903.]

WHEREAS the Ellerker Chapel-of-Ease, in the parish of Brantingham, in the county and diocese of York, was rebuilt and consecrated for the performance of divine service in the year eighteen hundred and forty-four, but does not appear to have been licensed by the bishop of the said diocese or otherwise for the publication of banns and the solemnization of marriages therein:

And whereas the church of Saint Mark, in the parish of Marske-in-Cleveland, in the county and diocese of York, was built and consecrated in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and the church of All Saints in the parish of Brightwaltham (otherwise Brightwalton), in the county of Berkshire and diocese of Oxford, was built and consecrated in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-three, and in each case the church so built was intended to be substituted for the ancient parish church of the parish, but it does not appear that any deed of substitution was executed at the time:

And whereas, by a deed of substitution dated the twenty-fourth of April nineteen hundred and two, the church of Saint Clement, Great Ilford, in the county of Essex and diocese of Saint Alban’s, was substituted as the parish church for the old parish church of Saint Mary, and the latter church thereby ceased to be-one in which marriages could legally be solemnized, until again licensed by the bishop:

And whereas divers marriages have nevertheless been solemnized in the said chapel and churches respectively:

And whereas in the years nineteen hundred and one and nineteen hundred and two certain marriages were solemnized in the Old Baptist Union Chapel at Grays Thurrock, in the district of Orsett, in the county of Essex, and the said chapel was not registered by the Registrar-General pursuant to the Marriages 6 & 7 Will. 4. Act, 1836:c. 85.

And whereas, since the month of September in the 3~ear eighteen hundred and ninety-three, certain banns have been published in the Mission Room of the parish of Marrick, in the North Riding of the county of York and in the diocese of Ripon, and certain marriages have been solemnized after those banns, but that Mission Room was not licensed for the publication of banns:

And whereas it is expedient under the circumstances aforesaid to remove all doubts touching the validity of the marriages so solemnized:

(2) All marriages solemnized in the said Old Baptist Union Chapel at Grays Thurrock, in the district of Orsett, in the county of Essex, during the years aforesaid, shall be as valid as if the said chapel had been duly registered in accordance with the provisions of the above recited Act before the solemnization of those marriages.

(3) All banns published in the said Mission Room in the parish of Mai rick since the month of September in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and all marriages solemnized after those banns, shall be as valid as if the Mission Room had been duly licensed for the publication of banns.

(5) The register of the marriages so solemnized, or copies of the register, shall be received in all courts as evidence of those marriages in the same manner as registers of marriages duly solemnized, or copies thereof, are by law receivable in evidence.

(4) Every Act or ordinance of the Legislature of the Transvaal which in any way impairs the validity or priority of any such charge shall, so far as it impairs the same, be void, unless the consent of the Treasury and the Secretary of State has been previously obtained.

(5) Any sums required by the Treasury for fulfilling their guarantee, given under this Act, shall be charged on and issued out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof, and any sums paid on account of the repayment of any amount so issued out of the Consolidated Fund shall be paid into the Exchequer.

(6) The Treasury shall lay before both Houses of Parliament a statement of any guarantee, given under this Act, and an account of any sums issued out of the Consolidated Fund for the purpose of any such guarantee, as soon as may be after any guarantee is so given or any sum is so issued.

An Act to grant Money for the purpose of certain Local Loans out of the Local Loans Fund and for other purposes relating to Local Loans.

[14th August 1903.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. — (1) For the purpose of local loans there may be issued by Grants for the National Debt Commissioners the following sums, namely: — public works.

(a) For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of seven million pounds;

(b) For the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of nine hundred thousand pounds.

(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887. ^3

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the sevelj local loans specified in the schedule to this Act should, to tfffi extent specified in the last column of that schedule, not be reckoned ^et^oHocai as assets of the local loans fund established under the National loans fund. Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887; therefore the principal of the 51 Vict-

said loans shall, to that extent, be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners in the year Remission of eighteen hundred and eighty-two advanced to the Port Seton ce^*lgt pJ13 Harbour Commissioners, on the security of the harbour revenues, gfton Harbour undertaking and property, sums amounting to seven thousand Commissioners, pounds towards defraying the cost of works authorised by the Port Seton Harbour Order, 1878, the said loan being repayable with interest at four pounds five shillings per cent, per annum in a period expiring on the eleventh day of November nineteen hundred and thirty-one:

And whereas the interest and instalments of principal, due in respect of the loan, were duly paid until the eleventh of November eighteen hundred and ninety-three, since which date the income of the harbour has proved insufficient to meet the pay?nents, and there are now due to the Loan Commissioners arrears of interest which amounted on the thirty-first day of March last to one thousand seven hundred and eleven pounds, seventeen shillings and a penny, while the principal outstanding amounts to five thousand five hundred and nine pounds, sixteen shillings and a penny:

And whereas repairs and improvements to the harbour are needed in order to render the accommodation adequate and safe, and the Harbour Commissioners are unable to raise the money for carrying out such works as long as the said debt remains, and it is therefore expedient that such debt should be remitted:

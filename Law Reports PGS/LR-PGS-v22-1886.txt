[16th April 1886.]

WHEREAS the sections of the Prison Acts of 1877 menti 1 in the Schedule to this Act provide that where an exi officer of a prison, that is to say, an officer attached to a prise the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and sev< eight has been in the prison service for not less than twenty y and otherwise fulfils the conditions in those sections mentii the Treasury may grant to such officer, having regard to his le of prison service, an annuity by way of superannuation alloy

And whereas the Army Act, 1879, and the Anny Act, 1881, require a difference to be made in the treatment of military prisoners convicted of breaches of discipline, and those convicted of immoral or other criminal offences, and in order to meet such requirement, certain of the prisons transferred by the Prison Acts of 1877, or portions of those prisons were set apart for the reception of military or naval prisoners, and became military or naval prisons under the Army Act, 1879, or the Army Act, 1881, and the Naval Discipline Act respectively, but the existing officers of such prisons continued to serve therein:

And whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the service of such officers after the said first day of April in the prisons or the portions thereof so set apart is prison service within the meaning of the said sections of the Prison Acts of 1877, and for the purpose of enabling annuities by way of superannuation allowance or gratuities to be granted to such officers, it is expedient to remove such doubts:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. It is hereby declared that in the Prison Acts of 1877 mentioned in the Schedule to this Act, the expression "prison service " includes as respects the period after the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, service in a military prison under the Army Act, 1879, or the Army Act, 1881, and service in a naval prison under the Naval Discipline Act, and annuities by way of superannuation allowance and gratuities may accordingly be granted to any officer of a prison, and apportioned in manner provided by the said Prison Acts.

2. This Act may be cited as the Prison (Officers' Superannuation) Act, 1886.

This Act so far as it affects any of the Acts mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall be construed as one with that Act.

This Act and the Prison (Officers' Superannuation) Act, 1878, — (a.)so far as they relate to England may be cited together with the Prison Act, 1877, as the Prison Acts, 1877 to 1886, and

And whereas the power conferred by the Metropolitan Police Act, 1857, on the police receiver to borrow on the security of the rates raised for the purposes of the metropolitan police force has never been exercised, and by reason of the time fixed for the repayment of the loan cannot now be exercised; and it is expedient to confer a power to borrow:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Metropolitan Police Act, 1886. The Acts mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act may be cited by the short titles respectively in that schedule mentioned.

(2.) The police receiver, before putting in force any of the powers of the Lands Clauses Acts with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement, shall —

(a.) publish, once at the least during three consecutive weeks in the months of September, October, and November, or any of them, in some one and the same newspaper circulating in the locality, an advertisement describing shortly the object for which the land is proposed to be taken, naming a place in the neighbourhood of the land proposed to be taken, where a plan of such land may be seen at all reasonable hours, and stating the quantity of such land, and shall further,

(b.) during the month next following the month in which such advertisements are published, serve a notice in manner mentioned in this section on every owner or reputed owner, lessee, or reputed lessee, and occupier of such land, so far as such owners, lessees, and occupiers can be reasonably ascertained, defining in each case the land intended to be taken, and requiring an answer stating whether the person so served assents, dissents, or is neuter in respect of taking such land; and

(iv.) A notice required to be served on a number of persons having any right in common, in, over, or on land may be served on any three or more of such persons on behalf of all of such persons.

(v.) Where a notice is served by post it shall be deemed to have been served at the time when the letter containing the same would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, and in proving such service it shall be sufficient to prove that the letter containing the same was properly addressed and put into the post.

(3.) Upon compliance as respects any land with the provisions contained in this section with respect to advertisements and notices, the police receiver may, if he think fit, present a petition to the Secretary of State; the petition shall describe the said land, and 3tate the purposes for which it is required, and the names of the owners and lessees, or reputed owners and lessees, and occupiers of land who have assented, dissented, or are neuter in respect of the taking of such land, or who have returned no answer to the notice, and shall pray for an order authorising the police receiver with reference to such land to put in force the powers of the Lands Clauses Acts with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement, and the petition shall be supported by such evidence as the Secretary of State may require.

ftnd upon whom notices in respect of the land to which the order relates are required by this Act to be served.

(6.) An order so made shall not be of any validity unless the same has been confirmed by Act of Parliament; and it shall be lawful for the Secretary of State, as soon as conveniently may be, to obtain such confirmation. If while the Bill confirming such order is pending in either House of Parliament a petition is presented against the order, the Bill, so far as it relates to such order, may be referred to a Select Committee, and the petitioner shall be allowed to appear and oppose, as in the case of private Bills, and the Act confirming such order shall be deemed to be a public general Act of Parliament.

(7.) An order made in pursuance of this section, when confirmed by Parliament with such modifications as seem fit to Parliament, shall have full effect.

(8.) A Secretary of State, in case of refusing or modifying the order prayed for, may make such order as he thinks fit for the allowance of the reasonable costs, charges, and expenses which any person whose land was proposed to be taken has properly incurred in opposing the order.

(11.) The provisions of this Act with respect to the purchase of land by the police receiver shall extend to the purchase of land of which such receiver is lessee or occupier in like manner as if another person were for the time being lessee or occupier of such land, save that the provisions with respect to the notices to, and the assent or dissent of, and the sendee of a copy of the order on, lessees and occupiers shall not apply so far as respects the police receiver, and save that after an order under this section for purchasing such land is confirmed by Parliament, the police receiver may give notice to and purchase the estate, light, or interest of some one or more only of the parties interested in the land, but in that case he shall, if any other of such parties, by notice in writing, so requires him, purchase the estate, right, or interest in the land of such party.

Grant out of Consolidated Fund.

1. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for the time being may issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and apply towards making good the supply granted to Her Majesty for the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and

2. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may borrow from time to time, on the credit of the said sum of twenty-six million nine hundred and ninety-three thousand six hundred and fifty-two pounds, any sum or sums of equal or less amount in the whole, and shall repay the moneys so borrowed, with interest not exceeding five pounds per centum per annum, out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund at any period not later than the next succeeding quarter to that in which the said moneys were borrowed.

Any moneys so borrowed shall be placed to the credit of the account of Her Majesty's Exchequer, and shall form part of the said Consolidated Fund, and be available in any manner in which such fund is available.

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

4. If a necessity arise for incurring expenditure not provided for in the sums appropriated to naval and military services by this Act, and which it may be detrimental to the public service to postpone until provision can be made for it by Parliament in the usual course, each of the departments entrusted with the control over the said services shall forthwith make application in writing to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for their authority to defray temporarily such expenditure out of any surpluses which may have been or which may be effected by the saving of expenditure upon votes within the same department, and in such application the department shall represent to the Commissioners of the Treasury the circumstances which may render such additional expenditure necessary, and thereupon the said Commissioners may authorise the expenditure unprovided for as aforesaid to be temporarily defrayed out of any surpluses which may have been or which may be effected as aforesaid upon votes within the same department; and a statement showing all cases in which the naval and military departments have obtained the sanction of the said Commissioners to any expenditure not provided for in the respective votes aforesaid, accompanied by copies of the representations made to them by

the said departments, shall be laid before the House of Commons with the appropriation accounts of navy and army services for the year, in order that such proceedings may be submitted for the sanction of Parliament, and that provision may be made for the deficiencies upon the several votes for the said services in such manner as Parliament may determine.

1st. A gross sum of eighty-two thousand three hundred and thirty-seven pounds ten shillings and fourpence (in part of one hundred and forty thousand one hundred and seventy-six pounds eleven shillings and ninepence) for certain navy services unprovided for, temporarily defrayed out of the unexpended balances of certain votes for navy services, aided by the sum realised in excess of the estimated appropriations in aid:

2nd. A gross sum of three hundred and thirty-eight thousand five hundred and forty-three pounds seventeen shillings and twopence for certain army services unprovided for, temporarily defrayed out of the unexpended balances of certain votes for army services, aided by the sum realised in excess of the estimated appropriations in aid:

It is enacted that the application of the said sums is hereby sanctioned.

6. A person shall not receive any part of a grant which may be made in pursuance of this Act for half pay, or army, navy, or civil non-effective services until he has subscribed such declaration as may from time to time be prescribed by a warrant of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury before one of the persons prescribed by such warrant.

Provided that, whenever any such payment is made at more frequent intervals than once in a quarter, the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may dispense with the production of more than one declaration in respect of each quarter.

landlords refuse to let on reasonable terms; that is to say, on such terms as are usually obtained in the letting of land of the like quality, and similarly situated in the same district, for other purposes than that of a deer forest, or of a grouse moor, or other sporting purpose.

12.

(3.) It shall not be competent for the Crofters Commission to assign land for the enlargement of the crofters holdings —

(a.) If the land forms part of any garden, policy, park, plantation, or other wood; or (b.)

(c.) If the land forms part of an existing farm or other holding, unless the rent or annual letting value of such farm or holding shall exceed one hundred pounds;

(d.) If the land is arable or improved pasture in the immediate vicinity of a residence or farm steading, or is land which could not be assigned for the enlargement of the crofters holdings without substantially impairing the amenity of such residence or farm steading;

(e.) If the land form part of a deer forest, and if the assignation of such land for the purposes of this Act would seriously impair the use of the remainder as a deer forest, and would act injuriously on the prosperity of the inhabitants generally of the district in which such deer forest is situated.

(4.) The aggregate value of the land assigned for the enlargement of th9 crofters holdings shall not exceed one third of the rent or annual letting value of the farm or other holding from which it is taken, when the annual value of the holding is between one hundred pounds and one hundred and fifty pounds, or one half when the annual value is above one hundred and fifty pounds and below three hundred pounds, or two thirds when the annual value of the holding is above three hundred pounds.

And whereas the said Act has been amended by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1858, by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1862, and by the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1864:

And whereas Commissioners were appointed under the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1854, and divers Orders in Council were made applying (that Act and the Acts amending the same to sundry of the said colonies:

And whereas under the West Indian Incumbered Estates Act, 1854, the remuneration of the West Indian Incumbered Estates

West Indian Incumbered Estates, 1886.

Commissioners and their officers, and their expenses, if incurred in England, were directed to be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and the remuneration of the local commissioners and other officers in the colony, and the expenses incurred in a colony, were directed to be defrayed out of moneys provided for the pur- . pose by the legislature of the colony:

And whereas the office and jurisdiction of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners were limited to expire at the end of six years from the date at which the said Act of 1854 took effect, but were subsequently continued by various Acts until the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two:

And whereas by the Act of the session of the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter nine, intituled " An Act to continue the appointment and jurisdiction 35 & 36 Vict. " of the Commissioners for the Sale of incumbered Estates in the c* 9 *

" West Indies, " the office and jurisdiction of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners were continued until Parliament should otherwise determine, but it. was enacted that no moneys provided by Parliament should be applicable to the payment of the said Commissioners, or of any persons connected with them, and by reason of that Act and of the proceedings of the governments of various colonies the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners receive at present no remuneration, except any surplus of the fees which may remain after payment of expenses:

And whereas the legislative councils of some of the colonies in which the said Acts are in force have passed resolutions in favour of the abolition of the jurisdiction in those colonies of the West Indian Incumbered Estates Commissioners, and there is no power to abolish such jurisdiction without the authority of Parliament, and it is expedient to confer such power:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the' Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the West Indian Incumbered Estates short title. Act, 1886.

The above-recited Acts are in this Act referred to as the West Indian Incumbered Estates Acts, 1854 to 1872, and those Acts, together with this Act, may be cited as the West Indian Incumbered Estates Acts, 1854 to 1886.

2. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty from time to time by Power to the Order in Council to direct that the West Indian Incumbered Estates

CHAPTER 37.

An Act to remove certain doubts respecting the construction of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, so far as respects the drawings by which specifications are required to be accompanied, and as respects exhibitions.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS by section five of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, specifications, whether provisional or complete, must be accompanied by drawings if required, and doubts have arisen as to whether it is sufficient that a complete specification refers to the drawings by which the provisional specification was accompanied, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Patents Act, 1886, and shall be construed as one with the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Acts, 1883 and 1885, and, together with those Acts, may be cited as the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Acts, 1883 to 1886.

2. The requirement of sub-section four of section five of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, as to drawings shall

1886.

Patents Act, 1886. Ch. 37, 38. 89

not be deemed to be insufficiently complied with by reason only both specifica-that instead of being accompanied by drawings the complete speci- tions-fication refers to the drawings which accompanied the provisional specification. And no patent heretofore sealed shall be invalid by reason only that the complete specification was not accompanied by drawings but referred to those which accompanied the provisional specification.

3. Whereas by section thirty-nine of the Patents, Designs, and Protection of Trade Marks Act, 1883, as respects patents, and by section fifty- patents and seven of the same Act as respects designs, provision is made that Sbited at the exhibition of an invention or design at an industrial or inter- international national exhibition, certified as such by the Board of Trade, shall exhibitions, not prejudice the rights of the inventor or proprietor thereof, subject to the conditions therein mentioned, one of which is that the exhibitor must, before exhibiting the invention, design, or article, or publishing a description of the design, give the Controller the prescribed notice of his intention to do so:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the extension of the said sections to industrial and international exhibitions held out of the United Kingdom, be it therefore enacted as follows:

It shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, from time to time to declare that sections thirty-nine and fifty-seven of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, 1883, or either of those sections, shall apply to any exhibition mentioned in the Order in like manner as if it were an industrial or international exhibition certified by the Board of Trade, and to provide that the exhibitor shall be relieved from the conditions, specified in the said sections, of giving notice to the Controller of his intention to exhibit, and shall be so relieved either absolutely or upon such terms and conditions as to Her Majesty in Council may seem fit.

CHAPTER 38.

[25th June 1886.]

WHEREAS by law the inhabitants of the hundred or other area in which property is damaged by persons riotously iind tumultuously assembled together are liable in certain cases to pay compensation for such damage, and it is expedient to make other provision respecting such compensation and the mode of recovering the same:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.]

mentioned shall be paid out of the police rate of such district to any person who has sustained loss by such injury, stealing, or destruction; but in fixing the amount of such compensation regard shall be had to the conduct of the said person, whether as respects the precautions taken by him or as respects his being a party or accessory to such riotous or tumultuous assembly, or as regards any provocation offered to the persons assembled or otherwise.

(2.) Where any person having sustained such loss as aforesaid has received, by way of insurance or otherwise, any sum to recoup him, in whole or in part, for such loss, the compensation otherwise payable to him under this Act shall, if exceeding such sum, be reduced by the amount thereof, and in any other case shall not be paid to him, and the payer of such sum shall be entitled to compensation under this Act in respect of the sum so paid in like manner as if he had sustained the said loss, and any policy of insurance given by such payer shall continue in force as it* he had made no such payment* and where such person was recouped as aforesaid otherwise than by payment of a sum, this enactment shall apply as if the value of such recoupment were a sum paid.

3. — (1.) Claims for compensation under this Act shall be made to the police authority of the district in which the injury, stealing, or destruction took place, and such police authority shall inquire into the truth thereof, and shall, if satisfied, fix such compensation as appears to them just

Such regulations may also provide for the particulars to be stated in any claim, and for the verification of any claim, and of any facts incidental thereto, by statutory declarations, production of books, vouchers, and documents, entry of premises, and otherwise, and may also provide for any matter which under this Act can be prescribed, and for the police authority obtaining information and assistance for determining the said claims.

(3.) The said regulations shall be published in the London Gazette, and every police authority shall cause the same to be published in their police district, and copies thereof to be at all times sold to any applicant at a price not exceeding sixpence for each copy.

4. — (1.) Where a claim to compensation has been made in accordance with the regulations, and the claimant is aggrieved by the refusal or failure of the police authority to fix compensation upon such claim, or by the amount of compensation fixed, he may bring an action against the police authority to recover compensation in respect of all or any of the matters mentioned in such claim and to an amount not exceeding that mentioned therein, but if in such action he fails to recover any compensation or an amount exceeding that fixed by the police authority, he shall pay the costs of the police authority as between solicitor and client.

(2.) If the amount of compensation for which such action is brought does not exceed one hundred pounds, the action shall be

brought in the county court for any district in which any part of the police district is situate.

5. — (1.) Where any compensation under this Act has been fixed by or recovered in an action against the police authority, that authority shall, on the prescribed conditions having been complied with, pay in the prescribed manner the amount of such compensation out of moneys held by them or their treasurer on account of their police force, and shall also pay out of the said moneys, all costs and expenses payable by them in or incidental to the execution of this Act; and the amount required to meet the said payments (in this Act referred to as riot expenses), shall be raised as part of the police rate.

(3.) Where the police forces of a borough and a county have been consolidated, riot expenses shall be paid by the county and borough respectively in such proportions as may have been agreed upon by the police authority for the county and the council of the borough, and if no agreement is made, in such proportions as a Secretary of State may from time to time determine; and such agreement may from time to time be made in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an agreement to consolidate the said police forces.

(4.) Where the police rate is limited, an addition to that rate shall, if necessary, be levied for the purpose of raising the sum required to pay riot expenses under this Act.

6. This Act shall apply —

(a) in the case of the plundering, damage, or destruction of any ship or boat stranded or in distress on or near the shore of any sea or tidal water, or of any part of the cargo or apparel of such ship or boat, by persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together, whether on shore or afloat; and

An Act to amend the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1872.

[25th June 1886.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. There shall be repealed so much of the eighteenth section of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1872 (in this Act referred to as the Principal Act), as provides that the check weigher shall be one of the persons employed either in the mine at which he is so stationed, or in another mine belonging to the owner of that mine.

And further, in all cases where a check weigher has been appointed by the majority of the colliers working in any mine and has acted as such, he may recover from any collier working in such mine his proportion of the check weighers wages or recompense notwithstanding that any colliers or collier may have left the colliery or others have entered the same since the check weighers appointment, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.

And further, it may be lawful for the owner or manager of any mine to retain the agreed contribution of the colliers for the check weigher, notwithstanding the provisions of the Acts relating to truck, and to pay and account for the same to the said check weigher.

2. Whereas by section fifty of the Principal Act provisions are made with respect to holding coroners inquests on the bodies of persons whose deaths may have been caused by explosions or accidents in mines to which that Act applies, and amongst other things

1886.

97

Coal Mines Act, 1886. Ch. 40.

it is provided that an inspector shall be at liberty at any such inquest to examine any witness, subject nevertheless to the order of the coroner:

And whereas doubts are entertained as to the effect of the said enactment as respects the attendance of other persons: Be it therefore enacted, that where an inquest is held on the body of any person whose death has been caused by an explosion or accident of which notice is required by the Principal Act to be given to the inspector of the district, it shall be lawful for any relative of such person to attend in person or by agent, and to examine any witness, subject nevertheless to the order of the coroner.

3. Where it appears to a Secretary of State that a formal Formal ininvestigation of any explosion or accident and of its causes and circumstances is expedient, the Secretary of State may direct such accident!1011 °T investigation to be held, and with respect to any such investigation the following provisions shall have effect:

(1.) The Secretary of State may appoint an inspector to hold such investigation, and may appoint any person or persons possessing legal or special knowledge to assist him in holding such investigation.

(2.) The inspector and any person or persons so appointed (hereinafter called the court) shall (unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of State) hold the investigation in open court, in such manner and under such conditions as they may think most effectual for ascertaining the causes and circumstances of the explosion or accident, and enabling them to make the report in this section mentioned.

(3.) The court shall have for the purpose of such investigation all the powers of a court of summary jurisdiction when acting as a court in hearing informations for offences against this Act, and all the powers of an inspector under the Principal Act, and in addition the following powers; namely,

(a.) They may enter and inspect any place or building the entry or inspection whereof appears to them requisite for the said purpose:

(b.) They may, by summons under their hands, require the attendance of all such persons as they think fit to call before them and examine for the said purpose, and may for such purpose require answers or returns to such inquiries as they think fit to make:

(c.) They may require the production of all books, papers, and documents which they consider important for the said purpose:

(d.) They may administer an oath, and require any person examined to make and sign a declaration of the truth of the statements made by him in his examination:

(e.) Persons attending as witnesses before the court shall be allowed such expenses as would be allowed to witnesses attending before a court of record; and in case of dispute as to the amount to be allowed, the same shall be referred by the court to a master of one of Her Majesty's superior courts, who, on request, under the hand of the inspector,

118 Ch. 45. Public Works Loans Act, 1886. 49 & 50 Vict.

the arrears of interest on the said loan; Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners, with the approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may, upon payment of the principal sum of eight thousand four hundred pounds due from the Newry, Warrenpoint, and Rostrevor Railway Company, remit all interest due in respect of that loan, and (he amount so remitted shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

3. For the purpose of estimating the capital value of the said Manner in charge the Commissioners shall take into consideration the net ktobe annual value of the same after allowing for the expenses of collection, ascertained.6 rates, taxes (except income tax) and other outgoings, the value of the land subject to the said charge, the length of time during which the said charge has been paid, the prospect of the continuance or discontinuance of the special cultivation in respect of which the said charge is imposed, the right of the cultivator to discontinue such special cultivation at any time and thereb}T to cause the suspension of the said charge, the prospect of the substitution of other land on the same farm for such cultivation, notwithstanding the provisions of the first section of this Act, and any other special circumstances applicable to the farm or parcel of land under consideration, and shall, if so advised or requested, hear evidence on behalf of the landowner, the tithe payer, and the tithe owner.

The Commissioners shall then determine and certify under their seal the capital value of the said charge, and the value so certified shall, for the purposes of this Act, be the capital value of the charge:

Provided that where the tithe owner is absolutely entitled to the charge in fee simple in possession, or is empowered to dispose thereof absolutely, or to give an absolute discharge for the capital value thereof, the Commissioners may, on the joint application of the tithe owner, the tithe payer, and the landowner, or of the tithe owner and the landowner in cases where the last named is also the tithe payer, certify such amount as may be agreed on between them to be the capital value of the charge included in such application.

4. (1.) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the interest on redemption of charges, land in respect of which at the date of the capitalised passing of this Act extraordinary charge is payable shall, so soon ^a^extra" as the capital value of the said charge shall have been certified chargetobe under the provisions of this Act, be charged with the payment of until redemp-an annual rentcharge equal co four per centum on such capital value, charge on land.

(3.) The rentcharge shall be payable half-yearly on the days on which the extraordinary charge in the parish has hitherto been payable, and the first payment thereof shall be made on the one of the said two days which shall first occur after the capital value shall have been certified as aforesaid, the first payment to be a full half-yearly payment.

(3.) Where the person entitled to the charge is absolutely entitled thereto in fee simple in possession, or is empowered to dispose thereof absolutely, or to give an absolute discharge for the capital value thereof, the owner of or any person interested in the land may, after giving one month's notice to the person entitled to the charge, pay or tender to him the amount of the capital value of the extraordinary charge or any leas sum which may be agreed on.

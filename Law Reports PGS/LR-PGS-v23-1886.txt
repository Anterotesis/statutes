CHAPTER 1.

An Act to apply a sum out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, and to appropriate the Supplies granted in this Session of Parliament.

[25th September 1886.]

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WE, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, towards making good the supply which we have cheerfully granted to Your Majesty in this session of Parliament, have resolved to grant unto Your Majesty the sum hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Grant out of Consolidated Fund.

[Issue of 20,089,689l. out of the Consolidated Fund.]

1. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for the time being may issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and apply towards making good the supply granted to Her Majesty for the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, the sum of twenty million eighty-nine thousand six hundred and eighty-nine pounds.

[Power for the Treasury to borrow.]

2. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may borrow from time to time, on the credit of the said sum of twenty million eighty-nine thousand six hundred and eighty-nine pounds, any sum or sums of equal or less amount in the whole, and shall repay the moneys so borrowed, with interest not exceeding five pounds per centum per annum, out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund at any period not later than the next succeeding quarter to that in which the said moneys were borrowed.

Any moneys so borrowed shall be placed to the credit of the account of Her Majesty's Exchequer, and shall form part of the said Consolidated Fund, and be available in any manner in which such fund is available.

2 Ch. 1. Appropriation Act, 1886, Session 2. 50 Vict.

Appropriation of Grants.

[Appropriation of sums voted for supply services.]

3. All sums granted by this Act out of the said Consolidated Fund towards making good the supply granted to Her Majesty, amounting, as appears in the Schedule (A.) annexed to this Act, to the sum of twenty million eighty-nine thousand six hundred and eighty-nine pounds, are appropriated for the purposes and services expressed in Schedule (B.) annexed hereto.

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

[Treasury may, in certain cases of exigency, authorise expenditure unprovided for; provided that the aggregate grants for the navy services and for the army services respectively be not exceeded.]

4. If a necessity arise for incurring expenditure not provided for in the sums appropriated to naval and military services by this Act, and which it may be detrimental to the public service to postpone until provision can be made for it by Parliament in the usual course, each of the departments entrusted with the control over the said services shall forthwith make application in writing to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for their authority to defray temporarily such expenditure out of any surpluses which may have been or which may be effected by the saving of expenditure upon votes within the same department, and in such application the department shall represent to the Commissioners of the Treasury the circumstances which may render such additional expenditure necessary, and thereupon the said Commissioners may authorise the expenditure unprovided for as aforesaid to be temporarily defrayed out of any surpluses which may have been or which may be effected as aforesaid upon votes within the same department; and a statement showing all cases in which the naval and military departments have obtained the sanction of the said Commissioners to any expenditure not provided for in the respective votes aforesaid, accompanied by copies of the representations made to them by the said departments, shall be laid before the House of Commons with the appropriation accounts of navy and army services for the year, in order that such proceedings may be submitted for the sanction of Parliament, and that provision may be made for the deficiencies upon the several votes for the said services in such manner as Parliament may determine.

The Commissioners of the Treasury shall not authorise any expenditure which may cause an excess upon the aggregate sums appropriated by this Act for naval services and for army services respectively.

[Declaration required in certain cases before receipt of sums appropriated.]

5. A person shall not receive any part of a grant which may be made in pursuance of this Act for half-pay or army, navy, or civil non-effective services until he has subscribed such declaration as may from time to time be prescribed by a warrant of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury before one of the persons prescribed by such warrant.

Provided that, whenever any such payment is made at more frequent intervals than once in a quarter, the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury may dispense with the production of more than one declaration in respect of each quarter.

1886. Appropriation Act, 1886, Session 2. Ch. 1. 3

Any person who makes a declaration for the purpose of this section, knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular, shall he guilty of a misdemeanor.

[Short title of Act.]

6. This Act may he cited for all purposes as the Appropriation Act. 1886, Session 2.

CHAPTER 2.

An Act to repeal the enactments authorising the issue out of the Consolidated Fund of money for Secret Service within the United Kingdom.

[25th September 1886.]

WHEREAS the Act first named in the schedule to this Act prohibits the issue from the Civil List revenues for the purposes of Secret Service within the kingdom of any sum exceeding ten thousand pounds in any one year:

And whereas the Act secondly mentioned in the schedule to this Act authorises the Commissioners of the Treasury to issue the sum of ten thousand pounds in every year, to be applied to the same purposes and under the same authority as the sum of ten thousand pounds per annum formerly charged upon the fourth class of the Civil List for Home Secret Service has heretofore been applied:

And whereas it is expedient to repeal the provision for the issue of the said sum:

1886. Secret Service Money (Repeal) Act, 1886. Ch. 2, 3. 11

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.]

1. This Act may he cited as the Secret Service Money (Repeal) Act, 1886.

[Repeal of parts of 22 Geo. 3. c. 82. and 1 & 2 Vict.c. 2.]

2. The Acts set forth in the schedule to this Act are hereby repealed to the extent in the third column of that schedule mentioned, without prejudice to anything heretofore done in pursuance thereof.

CHAPTER 3.

An Act to amend the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885.

[25th September 1886.]

WHERE AS the delegates of the States, parties to the convention of the fourteenth day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, mentioned in the schedule to the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885, have recommended for adoption by their respective States a declaration respecting the interpretation of such convention, and it is expedient to provide for giving effect to such declaration when adopted:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title and construction. 48 & 49 Vict. c. 49.]

1. This Act shall be construed as one with the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885, and that Act and this Act may be cited together as the Submarine Telegraph Acts, 1885 and 1886, and this Act may be cited separately as the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1886.

[Confirmation of declaration.]

2. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty in Council at any time after the passing of this Act to order that the declaration mentioned in the schedule to this Act, as set forth in that schedule, shall be

12 Ch. 3, 4. Submarine Telegraph Act, 1886. 50 Vict.

of the same force, and the same shall accordingly be of the same force, as the articles of the convention set forth in the schedule to the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885.

[Repeal of 48 & 49 Vict. c. 49. s. 4.]

3. Section four of the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885, is hereby repealed.]

SCHEDULE.

Submarine Telegraph Declaration.

Certain doubts having been raised as to the meaning of the word “wilfully” used in article two of the convention of the fourteenth of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, it is understood that the provision in respect of penal responsibility contained in the said article does not apply to cases of breakage or injury caused accidentally or of necessity in the repair of a cable when all precautions have been taken to avoid such breakage or injury.

It is equally understood that article four of the convention had no other object, and is to have no other effect, than to empower the competent tribunals of each country to decide in conformity with their laws and according to the circumstances the question of the civil responsibility of the owner of a cable who in laying or repairing his own cable breaks or injures another cable, as well as the consequences of such responsibility if it is recognised as existing.

CHAPTER 4.

[25th September 1886.]

WHEREAS a Commission has been issued by the Lords Justices of Ireland, dated the twenty-fifth day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, whereby Major-General Sir Edward Gascoigne Bulwer, Frederick le Poer Trench, Esquire, Richard Adams, Esquire, and Wallis MacHardy, Esquire, have been authorised and directed to hold a Court of Inquiry, and to inquire into the origin and circumstances of certain riots and disturbances that in the months of June, July, and August in this year have taken place in the town of Belfast, and the cause of their continuance, the existing local arrangements for the preservation of the peace of the town of Belfast, the magisterial jurisdiction exercised within it, and the amount and constitution and efficiency of the police force usually available there, and the proceedings and action taken by the magistrates, stipendiary and local, and other authorities, and the police force on the occasion of the said riots and disturbances, and whether these authorities and the existing police force are adequate to the future maintenance of order and tranquility within the town, and whether any and what steps ought to be taken in the local magisterial and police jurisdiction arrangements and establishment with a view to the better preservation of the public peace and the prevention or prompt suppression of riot and disorder; and whereas the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland intends by warrant under his hand to nominate Sir John Charles Day, one of the judges of the Queen's

1886. Belfast Commission Act, 1886. Ch. 4, 5. 13

Bench Division of the High Court, as an additional member of the said Commission; and whereas the powers for the effectual conducting of such inquiry cannot be conferred without the authority of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.]

1. This Act may be cited as the Belfast Commission Act, 1886.

[Commission to have powers herein named.]

(2.) The compelling the production of documents;

(3.) The punishing persons guilty of contempt; and a summons under the hand or hands of one or more of the said Commissioners may be substituted for and shall be equivalent to any form of process capable of being issued at law in any action or suit for enforcing the attendance of witnesses or compelling the production of documents.

[Penalty for false swearing.]

3. Every person who upon examination upon oath or affirmation in the said inquiry wilfully gives false evidence shall be liable to the penalties of perjury.

[Powers of the Commission not to be affected.]

4. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to abridge, lessen, or affect the powers of the said Commissioners under and by virtue of the said Commission of the Lords Justices.

CHAPTER 5.

An Act to continue various expiring Laws.

[25th September 1886.]

WHEREAS the several Acts mentioned in column one of the schedule to this Act are, to the extent specified in column two of that schedule, limited to expire on the thirty-first day of December one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the continuance as in this Act mentioned of such Acts, and of the enactments amending the same:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

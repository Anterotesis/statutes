In the cases where the original site value has been finally settled before the passing of this Act, an application may be made, notwithstanding anything in subsection (3) of section two of the principal Act, under that subsection, for the purpose of giving effect to this provision within three months after the date of the passing of this Act, and the Commissioners shall, in •such a case, alter the original site value as finally settled in such manner (if any) as may be necessary to give effect to the amendment made by this provision, and, in cases where any amount has been paid on account of duty, the Commissioners shall make such repayment as may be necessary to adjust the amount paid to any alteration of value made in pursuance of this provision.

For the purposes of this provision the full duty means the duty (if any) which would have become payable if the lease had not determined until the expiration of the term for which it was granted, and, if the total value of the land were at that time the same, as it is when the lease actually determines.

CHAPTER 13.

An Act to make provision with respect to the powers of the House of Lords in relation to those of the House of Commons, and to limit the duration of Parliament.

[18th August 1911.]

T \TI1EREAS it is expedient that provision should be made ’ * for regulating the relations between the two Houses of Parliament :

And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation :

And whereas provision will require hereafter to be made by Parliament in a measure- effecting such substitution for limiting and defining the powers of the new Second Chamber, but it is expedient to make such provision as in this Act appears for restricting the existing powers of the House of Lords :

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :

1. — (1) If a Money Bill, having been passed by the House of Commons, and sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, is not passed by the House of Lords without amendment within one month after it is so sent up to that House, the Bill shall, unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill.

(2) A Money Bill means a Public Bill which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply ; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them. In this subsection the expressions “taxation,” “public money,” and “loan” respectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.

(3) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is sent up to the House of Lords and when it is presented to His Majesty for assent the certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons signed by him that it is a Money Bill.

Before- giving his certificate, the Speaker shall consult, if practicable, two members to be appointed from the Chairmen’s Panel at the beginning of each Session by the Committee of Selection.

2. — (1) If any Public Bill (other than a Money Bill or a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years) is passed by the House of Commons in three successive sessions (whether of the same Parliament or not), and, having been sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, is rejected by the House of Lords in each of those sessions, that Bill shall, on its rejection for the third time by the House of Lords, unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified thereto, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill: Provided that this provision shall not take effect unless two years have elapsed between the date of the second reading in the first of those sessions of the Bill in the House of Commons and the date on which it passes the House of Commons in the third of those sessions.

(2) When a Bill is presented to His Majesty for assent in pursuance of the provisions of this section, there shall be endorsed on the Bill the certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons signed by him that the provisions of this section have been duly complied with.

(3) A Bill shall be deemed to be rejected by the House of Lords if it is not passed by the House of Lords either without amendment or with such amendments only as may be agreed to by both Houses.

(4) A Bill shall be deemed to be the same Bill as a former Bill sent up to the House of Lords in the preceding session if, when it is sent up to the House of Lords, it is identical with the former Bill or contains only such alterations as are certified by the Speaker of the House of Commons to be necessary owing to the time which has elapsed since the date of the former Bill, or to represent any amendments which have been made by the House of Lords in the former Bill in the preceding session, and any amendments which are certified by the Speaker to have been made by the House of Ix>rds in the third session and agreed to by the House of Commons shall be inserted in the Bill as presented for Royal Assent in pursuance of this section:

Provided that the House of Commons may, if they think fit, on the passage of such a Bill through the House in the second or third session, suggest any further amendments without inserting the amendments in the Bill, and any such suggested amendments shall be considered by the House of Lords, and, if agreed to by that House, shall be treated as amendments made by the House of Lords and agreed to by the House of Commons ; but the exercise of this power by the House of Commons shall

(2) Two years shall be substituted for ten years as the further period of disqualification under subsection (2) of section three of the principal Act, both as respects persons convicted before the passing of this Act, and, as respects persons convicted after the passing of this Act, in cases where the term for which a person has been ordered to be imprisoned without the option of a fine does not exceed six weeks.

(3) Any person in receipt of an old age pension who is convicted of any offence which is mentioned in or deemed to be mentioned or included in the First Schedule to the Inebriates Act, 1898, shall, if not subject to disqualification under the principal Act, be disqualified for receiving or continuing to receive an old age pension for a period of six months after the date of his conviction, unless the court before whom he is convicted direct to the contrary.

rate the pension, if any, should have been paid ; and

(c) whether a person who is in receipt of a pension at a

certain rate is, having regard to his means, entitled to a pension at a higher or a lower rate, and, if so, at what rate the pension (if any) should be paid ; and that an application may be made at any time to alter or revoke a provisional allowance of a claim for a pension.

8. The provisions of this Act modifying the statutory conditions for the receipt of an old age pension shall not operate —

(a) so as to disentitle any person who is in receipt of such a

pension at the time of the commencement of this Act to continue to receive his pension; or

An Act to grant Money for the purpose of certain Local Loans out of the Local Loans Fund, and for other purposes relating to Local Loans. [18th August 1911.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. — (1) For the purpose of local loans, there may be issued by the National Debt Commissioners the following sums, namely: —

(a) For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of five million pounds :

(b) For the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of five hundred thousand pounds.

(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887 ; therefore, the principal of the said loans shall to that extent be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

Remission of 3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in the year principal and eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds interest in was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the

respect of Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour

Harbour loan, revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas under an arrangement confirmed by section 1 Edw. 7.C.35. three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan has been extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay that loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan :

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees,” as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the “surplus herring brand fees ” of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees ” so pledged as aforesaid, was in the year ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and eleven, insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of two hundred pounds, with interest amounting to two hundred and eight pounds four shillings and sixpence, now remains unpaid and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable :

Therefore the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to two hundred and eight pounds four shillings and sixpence shall be remitted.

Amendment of 4. In section eleven of the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, £s&Ti>Vict. as amended by section five of the Public Works Loans Act, c. 89 to term 1898, fPty years shall be substituted for thirty years as the

(i) the person who, at the commencement of this Act, is

the owner of such original plate shall be the first owner of such copyright; and

ferring copyright in any such contrivance if the making thereof would have infringed copyright in some other such contrivance, if this provision had been in force at the time of the making of the first-mentioned contrivance.

(2) If the Secretary of State certifies by notice published in the London Gazette that any self-governing dominion has passed legislation under which works, the authors whereof were at the date of the making of the works British subjects resident elsewhere than in the dominion or (not being British subjects) were resident in the parts of His Majesty’s dominions to which this Act extends, enjoy within the dominion rights substantially identical with those conferred by this Act, then, whilst such legislation continues in force, the dominion shall, for the purposes of the rights conferred by this Act, be treated as if it were a dominion to which this Act extends ; and it shall be lawful for the Secretary of State to give such a certificate as aforesaid, notwithstanding that the remedies for enforcing the rights, or the restrictions on the importation of copies of works, manufactured in a foreign country, under the law of the dominion, differ from those under this Act.

Provided that, if the person appointed to be manager of a mine, by reason of death, resignation, or otherwise, ceases to be manager, nothing in this section shall prevent the mine being worked (for a period not exceeding four months) until a new manager is appointed, if in the meantime a competent person holding a first-class or second-class certificate of competency under this Act is temporarily appointed to perform the duties and exercise the powers of manager.

(3) A small mine shall be exempt from the provisions of this section, unless the inspector of the division, by notice in writing served on the owner or agent of the mine, requires that it be under the control of a manager, and in any mine so exempt in which a manager has not been appointed the powers and duties conferred or imposed on the manager shall be exercised and performed by the owner or agent, and anything by or under this Act required to be done by or to the manager shall be done by or to the owner or agent.

(4) The owner or agent of a mine required to be under the control of a manager shall not take any part in the technical management of the mine unless he is qualified to be a manager.

if any, or by a person not under the age of twenty-five years and holding a first or second-class certificate of competency under this Act, appointed in writing by the owner or agent;

(б) in the absence of the under-manager, in the case

of a mine for which a separate under-manager is required by this Act to be appointed, by a person not under the age of twenty-five years and holding a first or second-class certificate of competency under this Act appointed as aforesaid:

If the owner, agent, or manager of the mine disputes the reasonableness of the order, the matter shall be settled in manner provided by this Act for settling disputes.

(h) A scheme made under this section shall not affect any

person who becomes a member of the society or branch after the date as at which the valuation was made, or any member over seventy years of age:

(i) Any insured person who, having been a member of

the society or branch at the date as at which the valuation disclosing the deficiency was made, is transferred to another society or to another branch of the same or any other society before the deficiency is made good, shall be liable to any levy or reduction of benefits which has been or may be made in respect of such deficiency in like manner in all respects as if he had not ceased to be a member, and if the transfer took place before the scheme imposing the levy or reduction of benefits was sanctioned, such adjustment in the amount of any transfer value paid in respect of him shall be made as the circumstances require.

(2) In the case of masters, seamen, and apprentices serving

on foreign-going ships or ships engaged in regular trade on foreign stations, the employed rate and the employer’s contributions shall each be reduced by one penny a week, and every four weekly contributions paid in any calendar year by a master, seaman, or apprentice whilst serving on such a ship shall, for the purposes of determining the number of contributions to be paid by him in that year and for the purposes of calculating arrears, be treated as five such contributions :

If the workman fails or refuses either to avail himself of the offer, or to produce satisfactory evidence of his competence, or if as a result of the test the insurance officer considers that the skill or knowledge of the workman is defective, and that there is no reasonable prospect of such defects being remedied, such facts shall be taken into consideration in determining what is suitable employment for the workman.

If in any case as a result of the test the insurance officer considers that the skill or knowledge of the workman is defective, but that there is a reasonable prospect of the defects being remedied by technical instruction, the insurance officer may, subject to any directions given by the Board of Trade, pay out of the unemployment fund all or any of the expenses incidental to the provision of the instruction, if he is of opinion that the charge on the unemployment fund in respect of the workman is likely to be decreased by the provision of the instruction.

such modifications of rates of contribution or rates or periods of benefit as may be contained in the order, and, on any such order being made, this Part of this Act shall, subject to the modifications (if any) contained in the order, apply as if the trade mentioned in the order were an insured trade, or as if the definition of “ workman ” were varied in accordance with the order, as the case may be, and as if the rates of contribution and the rates and periods of benefit mentioned in the order were the rates of contribution and the rates and periods of benefit provided by this Part of this Act in respect of such trade:

and, on any such order being made, the occupation to which the order relates shall not be treated as employment in an insured trade for the purposes of this Part of this Act.

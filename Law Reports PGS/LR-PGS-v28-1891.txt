(c) The county percentage shall continue to be at the rate of five shillings per cent per annum on such advances ;

expedient, save that where it appears to him, on the repre- Part /.

sentation of the Local Government Board, that the whole or

any part of such residue applicable to any county cannot with wc e‘

advantage be so applied, he may order the same to be applied

as if it were the share of the county in the Irish probate duty

grant.

(3.) The money paid to the cash portion of the Guarantee Fund shall from time to time during every financial year, so far as not required to meet charges on the fund already accrued, be forthwith paid to the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account.

Account, or, so far as the deficiency has been paid out of the Consolidated Fund, to that Fund.

(2.) If the cash portion of the Guarantee Fund is at any time insufficient to pay all such charge, the Treasury shall send to the Lord Lieutenant a notice stating the sum required to meet the remainder of the charge and the date for its payment, and if the Lord Lieutenant before that date, or such later date as on his application the Treasury may allow, does not pay to the Guarantee Fund from the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account, the said sum, with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum, or such other rate as the Treasury may fix, from the date of the notice, the Treasury shall order such sum and interest to be paid to the Guarantee Fund out of the local taxation (customs and excise) duties and local grants forming the contingent portion of the Fund, and, subject to such subsequent adjustment of charge between the several counties as herein-after mentioned, such sum and interest shall be deducted from the said duties and grants, and the Treasury by their order shall make such provision as seems to them necessary or proper for carrying the order into effect, and the order shall be duly observed.

(3.) The Lord Lieutenant shall raise the said sum and interest, and also any sum which, upon any adjustment under this Act of a charge between the counties, is charged against a county in excess of the share of the county in the cash portion of the Guarantee Fund, by a levy upon the county liable ; and for that purpose he shall send to the secretary of the grand jury of the county a requisition for the payment of the sum therein named within such period therein mentioned, as the Lord Lieutenant, with the consent of the Treasury, thinks reasonable. The requisition shall be laid before the grand jury at the next assizes, and the grand jury shall, without any previous proceeding at any presentment sessions, present the sum payable in pursuance of the requisition, together with such further sum as will defray the costs of collection at the ordinary rate, to be levied off the county at large, and in default of such presentment the judge of assize shall order the sum to be raised, and such order shall have the force of a presentment; and the county treasurer shall out of the first moneys which he receives in

respect of any presentment made at those assizes, pay the sum required into the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account, to be there placed to the credit of the county, and any sum so paid out of moneys not levied under this section shall be replaced out of moneys so levied.

(4.) A charge on the Guarantee Fund shall, as between the counties, be adjusted and be borne by such county and in such manner, and the burden as between the local authorities and persons in the county shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be adjusted and borne in such manner, as may be provided by regulations of the Lord Lieutenant made with the consent of the Treasury, and the benefit of any sum repaid to the Guarantee Fund from the Land Purchase Account shall be adjusted, in accordance with as nearly as may be the mode in which the burden of originally paying such sum was borne.

(5.) The share of a county in the Guarantee Fund or any portion thereof for any purpose of this Act shall be ascertained by the Lord Lieutenant in accordance with the regulations under this section, and the regulations shall provide for apportioning the Guarantee Fund in the proportion in which the Irish probate duty grant and the local taxation (customs and excise) duties and the local grants are distributable among the local authorities and persons in each county on the basis of the financial year in which the apportionment is made, and shall provide for the share to be assigned to any county where the benefits of any school or lunatic asylum are not confined to the county in which the school or asylum is situate, or where parts of a poor law union or other area are situate in more than one county.

(6.) All questions which arise as to the share of any county, local authority, or person, in any Fund or sum dealt with in this Act, or as to the rights or burdens of any county or local authority or person in respect of payments out of the Guarantee Fund or the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account, shall be determined by the Lord Lieutenant, and his decision shall be final.

7. Notwithstanding anything in the Land Purchase Acts or this Act, any advance made after the passing of this Act, which shall not exceed three fourths of the price paid for a holding, shall be repaid by an annuity of three pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence per cent on the amount of such advance for forty-nine years ; and an annual sum, at the rate of two shillings and sixpence for every hundred pounds of the advance, shall be paid and applied in the same manner as the county percentage mentioned in section four of this Act.

8. —(1.) Where an advance for the purchase of a holding is less than twenty times the annual value of the holding as in this Act defined, then during the first five years of the term of the purchase-annuity the annuity shall be eighty per cent of such annual value (and the excess of any purchase-annuity over an annuity of four per cent on the advance is in this Act referred to as “ the purchaser's insurance money ”), but the annuity shall, on application, be reduced after those five years, to such four per cent, and after the first eighteen years of the term shall on application be further reduced

1891.

Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891. Ch. 48.

223

to such annuity as, in accordance with the prescribed tables, will, after allowing for the purchaser's insurance money, replace at the end of the term the advance with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum: Provided that this sub-section shall not apply when the amount of the advance does not exceed three-fourths of the purchase money of the holding.

(2.) All such reductions shall be made by the Land Commission on the application in writing by letter or otherwise of the proprietor for the time being of the holding charged, and, if no such application is made, the annuity shall remain of the same amount, but in any case shall cease at such period, before the end of the term of the annuity, as may be provided by the prescribed tables, so as to replace the advance with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum.

(3.) If (after one fourth of the guaranteed land stock available for land purchase in a county has been applied for within three years after the passing of this Act) it appears to the Lord Lieutenant, on the report of the Land Commission, that it is expedient, in the interest of tenants desiring to purchase, that the purchase-annuities to which this section applies in the county should continue for more than five years to be eighty per cent of the said annual value, and he so declares by publication in the manner directed by him, this section shall, from the date mentioned in such declaration, apply to all such annuities in that county as are chargeable on any holding the agreement for the purchase of which has been made after the date of the declaration, as if the number of years mentioned in the declaration were throughout substituted for five years, and the annuity shall cease at such earlier period as may be fixed by the prescribed tables.

(4.) The Lord Lieutenant, on the report of the Land Commission, may, if he thinks it expedient for the reason aforesaid, by a subsequent declaration, revoke or vary any such declaration and may also make a new declaration under the provisions of this subsection ; but no such subsequent or new declaration shall affect any annuity chargeable on a holding the agreement for the purchase of which was made before the date of the declaration.

(5.) Provided that any such declaration, except when it merely revokes a previous declaration, shall not come into operation till it has lain before both Houses of Parliament for not less than thirty days, nor if either House passes a resolution objecting to it.

(6.) Where the whole or a part of any purchaser's insurance money has been paid and subsequently the annuity in respect of which it has been paid is in arrear, the Land Commission, if satisfied that such arrear is due to exceptional circumstances and not to any fault of the person liable to pay the annuity, may, if they think it expedient, set off against the whole or part of the arrear the purchaser's insurance money, or any part thereof; but the annuity (notwithstanding any reduction under the foregoing provisions of this section) shall be increased by such amount, after such period, not exceeding two years from the date of the set off or the termination of the first five years, or any extended term fixed by a declaration of the Lord Lieutenant under this section, whichever shall

latest happen, and for such time, as the Land Commission direct, in order to replace the sum so set off, but so that the annuity shall not exceed the annuity payable during the first five years of the term.

(7.) If in any financial year it appears to the Lord Lieutenant, on the report of the Land Commission and Local Government Board, that, in consequence of exceptional agricultural distress or calamity in any county, it is advisable in the public interest that any deficiency arising, or likely to arise, from the non-payment of purchase annuities in that county should be advanced in whole or in part out of the Reserve Fund instead of being paid as before provided by this Act, he may, with the consent of the Treasury, order such advance; but the order shall not come into operation till it has lain before both Houses of Parliament for not less than thirty days, nor if both Houses pass within the said period a resolution objecting to it; and the advance shall be repaid to the Reserve Fund out of the Exchequer contribution, before that contribution is applied to any purpose other than the Guarantee Fund.

(8.) Every such order for an advance in any year shall specify the electoral divisions in the county in which the said distress or calamity has occurred to such extent as to require the aid hereinafter mentioned to be given to the persons liable for the payment of purchase-annuities, and on application to the Land Commission by any such person in respect of a holding situated in an electoral division so specified, a portion of the advance may, in accordance with regulations made by the Land Commission, be deemed to be lent to him in discharge of the whole or part of any instalment of the purchase-annuity specified by the Land Commission, and the annuity shall be increased by such amount, and for such time not exceeding five years commencing from such date, as the Land Commission direct, in order to repay to the Reserve Fund or the Exchequer Contribution, as the case may be, the amount so deemed to be lent

(9.) The regulations shall, so far as possible, secure that—

(a.) no such loans shall be made to the extent to which the instalment can be paid out of the purchaser's insurance money; and that

(b.) if the amount of the advance is insufficient to meet all the loans applied for, such loans shall abate proportionately.

9.-—(1.) Advances under the Land Purchase Acts as amended by this Act, in addition to the amount of ten million pounds authorised by the Land Purchase Acts, 1885 and 1888, may be made by the issue of guaranteed land stock to the amount from time to time required by the Land Commission, but such advances for the purchase of holdings in any county shall not, except in so far as is hereafter provided, exceed twenty-five times the share of the county in the Guarantee Fund; and the Treasury, when of opinion that the advances made for the purchase of holdings in any county approximate to this limit, shall certify their opinion to the Lord Lieutenant, who shall forthwith ascertain, on the basis of the preceding financial year, the share of each county in the Guarantee Fund.

(2.) The Treasury, in communication with the Lord Lieutenant, may authorise, by order, additional advances in the county, not

1891.

Purchase of Land ( I) Act, 1891.

Ch. 48.

225

exceeding the capital value for the time being of that part of the Part 2-Sinking Fund which has been accumulated out of the Sinking Fund purchase payments paid out of purchase-annuities, or out of payments for the redemption of purchase-annuities, in the county, and such capital value shall include the capital of any guaranteed land stock redeemed by the said payments.

(3.)

CHAPTER 52.

An Act to amend the Public Health (Scotland) Acts.

[5th August 1891.]

'TTTHEREAS by the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1889, ▼ ▼ provision is made by sections seventeen and seventy-seven for dividing every county into districts for the purposes of the administration of the laws relating to public health, and by sections seventeen and seventy-eight for the constitution of a district committee for each district, which shall be the local authority therein under the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1867, and any amending Act, in this Act referred to as the Public Health (Scotland) Acts :

And whereas such districts comprise several parishes, and it has been found to be expedient, in order to facilitate the administration of the last-mentioned Acts with respect to the supply of water to such districts or parts thereof, that the said Acts should be amended as herein-after provided:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Public Health (Scotland) Amendment Act, 1891, and the Public Health (Scotland) Acts and this Act shall be read and construed together as one Act.

2. This Act shall not take effect within any district in any county until after the county council shall, on the application of the district committee, have passed a resolution approving of its taking effect within such district, such resolution having been passed, and such application having been sanctioned at meetings called with special notice of the resolution to be submitted thereat.

An application of a district committee or a resolution of a county council shall not have effect for the purposes of this section unless approved of by absolute majority of the whole members of the district committee or county council, as the case may be.

3. The following Acts, and parts of Acts, so far as the same respectively are applicable for the purposes and are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1867, are hereby incorporated with that Act:—

The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, except the provisions with respect to the amount of profit to be received by the undertakers when the waterworks are carried on for their benefit, and except the words in section forty-four thereof, “ with the “ consent in writing of the owner or reputed owner of any such “ house or of the agent of such owner ”;

The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1863;

The provisions of the Railway Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1845, with respect to the temporary occupation of lands near the railway during the construction thereof, but such last-mentioned provisions shall apply only in the case of any reservoir, filter, or distributing tank which the local authority

1891.

Public Health (Scotland) Amendment Act, 1891.

Ch. 52.

251

may be authorised to construct, and the works immediately connected therewith; and for the purposes of this Act those provisions shall be read as if such reservoir, filter, or tank, and works were therein mentioned, instead of “ the railway,” and the boundaries of such reservoir, filter, or tank, and works, instead of “ the centre of the railway; ” and the prescribed limits shall be two hundred yards from such boundaries.

4. Upon this Act taking effect the expense incurred or to be incurred by the district committee as local authority under the provisions of the Public Health (Scotland) Acts during the year ensuing for water supply (including the sums necessary for payment of interest on and repayment of instalments of any money borrowed for providing such supply) shall be paid out of the assessments in this section authorised; that is to say:—

(1.) It shall be lawful for the county council, and they are hereby authorised and required, once in every year to impose and levy an assessment (to be called the domestic water rate) upon all lands and heritages within the district which shall have been supplied with water by the district committee as local authority at such rate in the pound as shall be sufficient, when supplemented by the public water rate, if any, to defray the expense herein-before mentioned;

(2.) It shall be lawful for the county council, and they are hereby authorised, once in every year to impose and levy an assessment (to be called the public water rate) if they shall think fit upon all lands and heritages within the district, but such rate if imposed shall not exceed threepence in the pound, and may be such less amount as the county council may from time to time determine.

(3.) Tue assessments or rates in this section mentioned shall not in the aggregate exceed the rates authorised by the Public Health (Scotland) Acts, and shall be imposed and levied and be payable, and may be recovered in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as assessments under the provisions of the Public Health (Scotland) Acts.

Provided always that—

(a.) Where a special water supply district has been formed in the manner provided in the said Acts, and a sufficient supply of water has been obtained and is maintained therein under the authority of the said Acts, the lands and heritages situated within such special water supply district shall not be liable to assessment for the expense of supplying water to other parts of the district:

(b.) The local authority shall not be obliged to furnish a supply of water to any person for any less sum than five shillings in any one year:

(c.) No person shall be entitled to demand such supply of water or to require the local authority to lay down communication pipes, unless some pipe of the local authority shall have been laid within one hundred feet of the house or other premises in respect of which such R 2

5. The county council as the local authority may, in addition to the powers conferred by section eighty-nine (six) of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1867, borrow money for the purposes therein set forth on the security of the assessments hereby authorised, and may assign the said assessments and the general assessments that may be imposed under the said Act or any of them in security of the money to be so borrowed.

6. If in any special water supply district the maximum rates leviable shall' be inadequate to provide and maintain a sufficient supply of water, it shall be lawful for the local authority, at a meeting called with special notice, to resolve by an absolute majority of their number, to apply to the county council, who may by an absolute majority of the whole members of the council resolve, subject to such conditions as they may determine regarding the payment of any debt that may affect such special water supply district, that the area embraced within the boundaries of such special water supply district shall cease to exist as a special water supply district, and, in the event of such local authority so resolving, such area shall, subject as aforesaid, from and after a date to be fixed by such local authority cease to be rated and assessed for the purposes of water supply separately from the district; but such area may continue to be rated and assessed separately from the district for the purpose of the payment of Buch debt.

A resolution of a local authority under this section shall not have effect until it is confirmed by the Secretary for Scotland on the application of the county council, and after such inquiry as the Secretary for Scotland shall deem necessary. The costs of any such inquiry shall be borne by the local authority.

7. Nothing contained in or done in pursuance of the provisions of this Act shall authorise the supply of water to, or any assessment to be imposed and levied within, any district or part of a district which is already authorised to be supplied with water by any water company or water commissioners or trustees established by Act of Parliament, or shall prejudice or affect the last proviso of sub-section one of section eighty-nine of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1867.

8. Nothing contained in or done in pursuance of the provisions of this Act shall in any way prejudice the rights or powers of creditors who before the passing of this Act have advanced moneys to any local authority under the Public Health (Scotland) Acts, and all securities for such moneys may be enforced against the same assessments against which they may be enforced at the passing of this Act.

2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of a judge of the High Court who is president of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division thereof, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by letters patent, to appoint to that office as president of the said division any person who is a barrister of not less than fifteen years' standing, or who is a judge of the High Court or Court of Appeal, and the person so appointed shall, without prejudice to the rights of any judge of the Supreme Court existing at the passing of this Act, take precedence in court next after all ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal appointed before the time at which he shall become an ordinary or ex-officio member thereof.

3. For the purpose of aiding the House of Lords in the hearing and determination of appeals in Admiralty actions, the House may, in any such appeal in which it may think it expedient to do so, call in the aid of one or more assessors specially qualified, and hear such appeal wholly or partially with the assistance of such assessors.

This section shall be carried into effect in pursuance of Orders made by the House of Lords.

[5th August 1891.]

WHEREAS the Consular Marriage Act, 1849, and the Acts amending the same were by the Marriage Act, 1890, extended to marriages in British Embassies and on board Her Majesty's ships and other places, and by the Marriage Act, 1890, power was given to Her Majesty the Queen in Council to make regulations for adapting the said Acts to those marriages and for other purposes therein mentioned, and it is expedient to remove various doubts which have arisen respecting the application of the said Acts, and respecting the powers which may be exercised by the said regulations, in this Act referred to as the “ marriage regulations,” and to make further provision for the said extension:

And whereas it is expedient further to amend the said Acts :

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may be cited as the Foreign Marriage Act, 1891.

2. The period of residence required for a marriage under the Foreign Marriage Acts shall be three weeks, and accordingly in section two of the Consular Marriage Act, 1849, one week shall be substituted for one calendar month.

3. Before any marriage is solemnized under the Foreign Marriage Acts both the parties intending marriage shall appear before the consul, and each of them shall make oath—

(a) that he or she believes that there is not any impediment in kindred or alliance, or other lawful hindrance to the marriage; and

(5) unless the requirements of the Foreign Marriage Acts as to residence have been dispensed with, that both of the parties have for three weeks immediately preceding had their usual places of abode within the district of the consul; and

(c) where either of the parties, not being a widower or widow, is under the age of twenty-one years, that the consent of the person or persons whose consent to the marriage is required by law has been obtained thereto, or, as the case may be, that there is no person having authority to give such consent.

4.—(1.) Subject to the marriage regulations, a British consular officer, on being satisfied by personal attendance that a marriage between parties being British subjects, or of whom one is a British

subject, has been duly solemnized in a foreign country in accordance with the local law of the country, and on payment of the fee required by law, may register the marriage in accordance with the marriage regulations as having been so solemnized, and thereupon the Foreign Marriage Acts shall apply as if the marriage had been registered in pursuance of those Acts, except that nothing in this section shall affect the validity of the marriage so solemnized.

(2.) Section six of the Marriage Act, 1890, is hereby repealed.

5. —(1.) The marriage regulations may— Explanation

(c) prescribe the forms to be used in substitution for or in addition to those in the schedules to the Consular Marriage Act,

1849; and

(d) make such provision as may seem necessary or proper for carrying into effect the Foreign Marriage Acts, or any marriage regulations.

(2.) The regulations providing for the matters in this section mentioned are included in this Act in the expression “ marriage regulations,” and the marriage regulations may be made either generally or with reference to any particular case or class of cases.

(3.) Section nine of the Marriage Act, 1890, shall have effect as if in paragraph ( d) thereof for the words “ by whom,” were substituted the words “ by or before whom.”

6. —(1.) The written authority to solemnize and register mar- Explanation of riages given by a Secretary of State in pursuance of section nineteen *2 * 12 ^ict. of the Consular Marriage Act, 1849, and any enactment amending ^ the grant of that section, may be addressed to a marriage officer as herein-after authority to defined by the name of his office, without designating the name of

any particular person holding the office, and that authority may be executed by the person who for the time being holds or acts in the office described in the authority, and that person shall be a duly authorised consul within the meaning of the Foreign Marriage Acts, and the expression “ consul ” in those Acts shall, except where such meaning is inconsistent with the context, mean a marriage officer so authorised.

(2.) For the purposes of this Act a marriage officer means any British ambassador, minister, or charge d'affaires, any British consular officer, and any other officer who, in pursuance of the Foreign Marriage Acts or the marriage regulations, can be authorised to solemnize and register marriages under the said Acts.

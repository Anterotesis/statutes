And whereas after discharging the pecuniary obligation imposed by the said Acts a certain surplus will remain :.

And whereas Parliament has reserved to itself by the thirty-first Victoria, chapter seventeen, section five, the right of dealing with such surplus as it shall direct:

And whereas by an Act passed in the fourteenth and fifteenth, years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter one hundred and forty-six, entitled the Coal Duties (London and Westminster and adjacent Counties) Act, 1851, the Corporation were to retain one penny per ton out of the drawback allowance for the purposes in the said Act expressed:

1. — (1.) Where a child is maintained by the guardians of any union and was deserted by its parent, the guardians may at any time resolve that such child shall be under the control of the guardians until it reaches the age, if a boy, of sixteen, and if a girl of eighteen years, and thereupon until the child reaches that age all the powers and rights of such parent in respect of that child shall, subject as in this Act mentioned, vest in the guardians;

Provided that the guardians may rescind such resolution, if they think that it will be for the benefit of the child that it should be rescinded, or may permit such child to be either permanently or temporarily under the control of such parent, or of any other relative, or of any friend.

(2.) A court of summary jurisdiction, if satisfied on complaint made by a parent of the child, that the child has not been maintained by the guardians, or was not deserted by such parent, or that it is for the benefit of the child that it should be either permanently or temporarily under the control of such parent, or that the resolution of the guardians shou'd be determined, may make an order accordingly, and any such order shall be complied with by the guardians, and if the order determines the resolution, the resolution shall be thereby determined as from the date of the order, and the guardians shall cease to have the rights and powers of the parent as respects such child.

(3.) For the purposes of this Act a child shall be deemed to be maintained by the guardians if it is wholly or partly maintained by them in a workhouse or in any district school, separate school, separate infirmary, sick asylum, hospital for infectious diseases, institution for the deaf, dumb, blind, or idiots, or any certified school under the Act of the session of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter forty-three, or is boarded out by the guardians, whether within or without the limits of the union.

(4.) Where a parent is imprisoned under a sentence of penal servitude or imprisonment in respect of an offence committed against a child, this section shall apply as if such child had been deserted by that parent.

(5.) Nothing in this section shall relieve any person from any liability to contribute to the maintenance of a child, but the fact of such contribution being made shall not deprive the guardians of any of the powers and rights conferred on them by this section.

(6.) Nothing in this section shall authorise the guardians to cause a child to be educated in any religious creed other than that in which

(2.) A loan shall not be of such amount as exceeds, or will make the total debt of the guardians under the Acts relating to the relief of the poor exceed one fourth of the total annual rateable value of the union.

(3.) The Local Government Board may, by Provisional Order, extend the said maximum to double the amount above authorised, and sections two hundred and ninety-seven and two hundred and ninety-eight of the Public Health Act, 1875, shall apply to every such Provisional Order in like manner as if they were herein re-enacted and the guardians were a local authority.

(4.) The unapplied balance of any loan raised by any guardians may, with the consent of the Local Government Board, be applied to any purpose for which a loan can be raised under this Act by such guardians.

(5.) This section shall apply to the managers of any school district and to the managers of any asylum district, not being the metropolitan asylum district, in like manner as if they were guardians and this section were in terms made applicable thereto, but with the substitution of one sixteenth of the annual rateable value of the district for one fourth of the annual rateable value of the union.

(6.) All enactments in the Acts relating to the relief of the poor touching the purposes for which and the amount to which guardians of unions and managers of any school or asylum district to whom this section applies may borrow, shall be repealed without prejudice to anything done thereunder, but every loan under this section shall be made on the like security and be paid off in the like time and manner, and be borrowed and re-borrowed in the like manner as is provided by the enactments in force at the passing of this Act with respect to loans of such guardians and managers.

Rules with respect to the procedure under this section (including costs and the remuneration of assessors) may from time to time be made, as respects judges of county courts, by the authority having power to make rules of practice under the County Courts Act, 1888, and as respects metropolitan police and stipendiary magistrates by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, but in either case with the concurrence of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury as to fees.

5. If any master of a ship navigating outside a district in which pilotage is compulsory knowingly employs or continues to employ an unqualified pilot after a qualified pilot has offered to take charge of the ship, or has made a signal for that purpose, he shall in every case incur a penalty of double the amount of pilotage demandable for the conduct of the ship.

6. The returns required by section three hundred and thirty-seven of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, to be made by a pilotage authority to the Board of Trade shall include separate accounts of the receipts and expenditure in respect of any pension or superannuation funds administered by or under the control of the pilotage authority.

7. The powers of making byelaws conferred on a pilotage authority by section three hundred and thirty-three of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, shall extend to making byelaws requiring masters or mates who hold pilotage certificates granted in pursuance of section three hundred and forty or section three hundred and forty-two of that Act to contribute towards the pilotage fund of the district, and requiring that a periodical return of the pilotage services rendered by such masters or mates be made by them to the pilotage authority. Provided that the contribution of a master or mate under this section shall not exceed such proportion of the pilotage dues which would have been payable in respect of his ship if he had not held a pilotage certificate, as may be from time to time fixed by the Board of Trade.

8. The fees mentioned in section three hundred and forty-three of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, shall, in the case of pilotage certificates granted or renewed by a pilotage authority, be applicable to the expenses of and incidental to the examinations referred to in that section, and to the payment of such charges in connexion with the preparation and renewal of pilotage certificates as may from time to time be approved by the Board of Trade, and the surplus (if any) shall be applied for the benefit of the pilots' superannuation fund of the port or district (if any), or otherwise for the benefit of the qualified pilots of the port or district to which the certificates apply in such manner as the pilotage authority may think fit.

(2.) The holder of such a pilotage certificate shall be deemed to be a licensed pilot within the meaning of section three hundred and forty-eight of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854.

CHAPTER 71.

An Act to grant Money for the purpose of certain Local Loans, and for other purposes relating to Local Loans.

[30th August 1889.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1889.

Public Works Loans , 1889.

Ch. 71.

373

1. — (1.) For the purpose of local loans there may be issued by Grants for the National Debt Commissioners the following sums; namely,

(a.) For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan Com- FisherytC missioners, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the Board, sum of two million pounds;

(b.) For the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole one million pounds;

(c.) For the purpose of loans by the Fishery Board for Scotland, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole twenty-five thousand pounds.

(2.) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation, and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887. 50 & 51 vict

c« 16»

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local Certain debts loans specified in the First Schedule hereto should, to the extent of not to

the amount specified in the last column of that schedule, not be J^et°°of the reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the local loan* National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887: Be it therefore enacted fond-that the principal of the said local loans shall, to that extent, be written off from the account of assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas under the Landed Property Improvement (Ireland) Reduction of Act, 1847, and the Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) rate of interest Act, 1863, and the Acts amending and extending the same respec-

tively, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland have granted provement loans for the purposes of drainage and land improvement, and such y.

loans are to be repaid by terminable rentcharges; c> 42. 1C '

And whereas in calculating such rentcharges, interest was 26 & 27 vict-reckoned at the rate of three and a half per centum per annum, c* and it is expedient to reduce the annual amount of the said rentcharges by reducing the rate of interest on which they were calculated, and extending the term during which they are payable:

Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

Where under the recited Acts, or any of them, except the Acts mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act, any drainage loan or land improvement loan has been sanctioned by the Treasury on or before the last day of December one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, any rentcharge created either before or after the passing of this Act for repayment to the said Commissioners of the loan or of any loan granted as an addition thereto shall, as to any instalment to become due on or after the first gale day next after the passing of this Act, be reduced in the case of any rentcharge created for a term of twenty-two years, to five per cent., and in the case of any other rentcharge to four per cent, on the amount of the loan, and shall be payable for such term as the said Commissioners may by order declare to be necessary for the repayment with interest at three and one eighth per cent per annum of so much of the loan as has not accrued due for payment on the said day, and the

le

374 Ch. 71. Public Works Loans Act, 1889. 52 & 53 Vict.

order shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act be made and notified by poet or otherwise in manner directed by the said Commissioners to the person by or through whom the rentcharge should be paid.

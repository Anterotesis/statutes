An Act to apply a sum out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, and to appropriate the Supplies granted in this Session of Parliament.

[7th August 1914.]

Most Gracious Sovereign,

WE, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, towards making good the supply which we have cheerfully granted to Your Majesty in this session of Parliament, have resolved to grant unto Your Majesty the sum herein-after mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Grants out of Consolidated Fund.

1. The Treasury may issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and apply towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty for the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand nine hundred and fifteen the sum of two hundred and four million six hundred and forty-two thousand and fifty-five pounds.

1914.

Appropriation, 1914.

Ch. 24.

51

2. — (1) The Treasury may borrow from any person, by the issue of Treasury Bills or otherwise, and the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Treasury on the credit of the said sums, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole two hundred and four million six hundred and forty-two thousand and fifty-five pounds.

(2) The date of payment of any Treasury Bills issued under this flection shall be a date not later than the thirty-first day of March one thousand nine hundred and fifteen and section six of the Treasury Bills Act, 1877 (which relates to the renewal of bills), shall not apply with respect to those bills.

(3) Any money borrowed otherwise than on Treasury Bills shall be repaid, with interest not exceeding five pounds per cent, per annum, out of the growing produce of the Consolidated Fund, at any period not later than the next succeeding quarter to that in which the money was borrowed.

(4) Any money borrowed under this section shall be placed to the credit of the account of the Exchequer, and shall form part of the said Consolidated Fund, and be available in any manner in which such Fund is available.

Appropriation of Grants.

3. All sums granted by this Act and the other Act mentioned in Schedule (A.) annexed to this Act out of the said Consolidated Fund towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty, amounting, as appears by the said schedule, in the aggregate, to the sum of two hundred and seventy-three million seventy-nine thousand six hundred and eight pounds are appropriated, and shall be deemed to have been appropriated as from the date of the passing of the Acts mentioned in the said Schedule (A.), for the services and purposes expressed in Schedule (B.) annexed hereto.

The abstract of schedules and schedules annexed hereto, with the notes (if any) to such schedules, shall be deemed to be part of this Act in the same manner as if they had been contained in the body thereof.

In addition to the sums hereby granted out of the Consolidated Fund, there may be applied out of any money directed under section two of the Public Accounts and Charges Act, 1891, to be applied as appropriations in aid of the grants for the services and purposes specified in Schedule (B.) annexed hereto, the sums respectively set forth in the last column of the said schedule.

4. — (1) So long as the aggregate expenditure on naval and military services respectively is not made to exceed the aggregate sums appropriated by this Act for those services respectively, any surplus arising on any vote for those services, either by an excess of the sum realised on account of appropriations in aid of the vote over the sum which may be applied under this Act as appropriations in aid of that vote, or

(2) A statement showing all cases in which the sanction of the Treasury has been given to the temporary application of a surplus under this section, and showing the circumstances under which the sanction of the Treasury has been given, shall be laid before the House of Commons with the appropriation accounts of the naval and military services for the year, in order that any temporary application of any surplus sanctioned by the Treasury under this section may be submitted for the sanction of Parliament.

5. Whereas under the powers given for the purpose by the Appropriation Act, 1912, and the Appropriation (1912-3) Act, 1913, surpluses arising on certain votes for the naval and military services respectively have been temporarily applied as shown in the accounts set out in Schedule (C.) to this Act:

It is enacted that the application of those surpluses as shown in the said accounts is hereby sanctioned.

6. A person shall not receive any part of a grant which may be made in pursuance of this Act for half-pay or army, navy, or civil non-effective services, until he has subscribed such declaration as may from time to time be prescribed by a warrant of the Treasury before one of the persons prescribed by such warrant:

Provided that, whenever any such payment is made at more frequent intervals than once in a quarter, the Treasury may dispense with the production of more than one declaration in respect of each quarter.

Any person who makes a declaration for the purpose of this section, knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

7. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Appropriation Act, 1914.

Therefore the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and eighty-eight pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence shall be remitted.

Merchant Shipping (Convention)

Act, 1914.

4 & 5 Geo. 5.

Ports situated in the Colonies, Possessions or Protectorates of the High Contracting Parties are considered to be ports outside the States of the High Contracting Parties.

Persons who are on board by reason of force majeure or in consequence of the obligation laid upon the master to carry shipwreoked or other persons are not deemed to be passengers.

Article 3.

There are excepted from this Convention, save in the cases where the Convention otherwise provides, ships making voyages specified in a schedule to be communicated by each High Contracting Party to the British Government at the time of ratifying the Convention.

No schedule may include voyages in the course of which the ships go more than 200 sea miles from the nearest coast.

Each High Contracting Party has the right subsequently to modify its schedule of voyages in conformity with this Article on condition that it notifies the British Government of such modification.

Each High Contracting Party has the right to claim from another Contracting Party the benefit of the privileges of the Convention for all of its ships which are engaged in any one of the voyages mentioned in its own schedule. For this purpose the Party claiming such benefit shall impose on the said ships the obligations prescribed by the Convention in so far as, having regard to the nature of the voyage, these obligations would not be unnecessary or unreasonable.

Article 4.

No ship, not subject to the provisions of the Convention at the time of its departure, can be subjected to the Convention in the course of its voyage, if stress of weather or any other cause of force majeure compels it to take refuge in a port of one of the States of the High Contracting Parties.

Chapter III. — Safety of Navigation.

Article 5.

When the expression “every ship” is used in this Chapter and in the corresponding part of the annexed Regulations, it includes all merchant ships, whether they are the ships defined in Article 2 or not, which belong to any of the Contracting States.

Article 6.

The High Contracting Parties undertake to take all steps to ensure the destruction of derelicts in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean east of a line drawn from Cape Sable to a point situated in latitude 34° north and longitude 70° west. Further, they will establish in the North Atlantic with the least possible delay a service for the study and observation of ice conditions and a service of ice patrol. For this purpose:—

Two vessels shall be charged with these three services.

During the whole of the ice season, they shall be employed in ice patrol.

During the rest of the year the two vessels shall be employed in the study and observation of ice conditions and in the destruction of derelicts;

1914.

Merchant Shipping (

Act, 1914.

Moreover, the Governments of each of the Contracting States, if they consider that the route and the conditions of the voyage are such as to render a radiotelegraph installation unreasonable or unnecessary, may exempt from the above requirement the following ships:—

(1) Ships which in the course of their voyage do not go more than

150 sea miles from the nearest coast;

(2) Ships on which the number of persons ou board is exceptionally

or temporarily increased up to or beyoud fifty by the carriage of cargo hands for a part of the voyage, provided that the said ships are not going from one continent to another, and that, during that part of their voyage, they remain within the limits of latitude 30° N. and 30° S.;

Article 33.

Ships which, in accordance with Article 31 above, are required to be fitted with a radiotelegraph installation are divided, for the purpose of radiotelegraph service, into three classes, in accordance with the classification established for ship stations in Article XIII. (h) of the Regulations annexed to the Radiotelegraph Convention, signed in London on the 5th July, 1912, viz.: —

First Class. — Ships having a continuous service.

There shall be placed in the First Class ships which are intended to carry twenty-five or more passengers:—

(1) If they have au average speed in service of fifteen knots or

more;

(2) If they have average speed in service of more than thirteen

knots, but only subject to the twofold condition that they have on board two hundred persons or more (passengers and crew), and that, in the course of their voyage, they go a distance of more than five hundred sea miles between any two consecutive ports. Nevertheless these ships may be placed in the Second Class on condition that they have a continuous watch.

Second Class. — Ships having a service of limited duration.

There shall be placed in the Second Class all ships which are intended to carry, twenty-five or more passengers, if they are not, for other reasons, placed in the First Class.

Ch. 50.

Merchant Shipping (Convention) 4 & 5 Geo. 5 *

Act, 1914.

Ships placed in the Second Class must, during navigation, maintain a continuous watch for at least seven hours u day, and a watch of ten minutes at the beginning of every other hour.

Third Class. — Ships which have no fixed periods of service.

All ships which are placed neither in the First nor in the Second Class shall be placed in the Third Class.

The owner of a ship placed in the Second or in the Third Class has the right to require that, if the ship complies with all the requirements for a superior class, a statement to the effect that it belongs to that superior class shall be inserted in the Safety Certificate.

Article 34.

Ships which are required by Article 31 above to be fitted with a radiotelegraph installation shall be required, by the Governments of the countries to which they belong, to maintain a continuous watch during navigation as soon as the said Governments consider that it will be of service for the purpose of safety of life at sea.

Meanwhile, the High Contracting Parties undertake to require, from the date of the ratification of the present Convention subject to the delays specified below, a continuous watch on the following ships:—

(1) Ships whose average speed in service exceeds 13 knots, which

have on board 200 persons or more, and which, in the course of their voyage, go a distance of more than 500 sea mile* between two consecutive port9, when these ships are placed in the Second Class.

(2) Ships in the Second Class, for the whole of the time during

which they are more than 500 sea miles from the nearest coast.

(3) Other ships specified in Article 31, when they are engaged in

the Trans-Atlantic trade, or when they are engaged in other trades if their route takes them more than 1,000 sea miles from the nearest coast.

Ships connected with all kinds of fishing business, including whaling, which are required to be fitted with a radiotelegraph installation, shall not be required to maintain a continuous watch.

The continuous watch may be kept by one or more operators, holding certificates in accordance with Article X. of the Regulations annexed to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, 1912, together, if necessary, with one or more certificated watchers. Nevertheless, if an efficient automatic calling apparatus is invented, the continuous watch may Ikj maintained by this means by agreement between the Governments of the High Contracting Parties.

By “ certificated watcher ” is meant any person holding a certificate issued under the authority of the Administration concerned. To obtain this certificate the applicant must prove that he is capable of receiving and understanding the radiotelegraph distress signal and the safety signal described in the Regulations annexed hereto.

The High Contracting Parties undertake to take steps to ensure that the certificated watchers observe the secrecy of correspondence.

Article 35.

The radiotelegraph installations required by Article 31 above shall be capable of transmitting clearly perceptible signals from ship to ship over a range of at least 100 sea miles by day under normal conditions and circumstances.

Every ship which is required, in conformity with the provisions of Article 31 above, to be fitted with a radiotelegraph installation, shall, whatever be the class in which it is placed, be provided in accordance with Article XI. of the Regulations annexed to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, 1912, with an emergency installation, every part of which is placed in a position of the greatest possible safety to be determined by the Government of the country to which the ship ladougs.

Iu all cases the emergency installation must be placed, in its entirety, in the upper part of the ship, as high as practically possible.

The emergency installation includes, as provided by Article XI. of the Regulations annexed to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, 1912, an independent source of energy capable of being put into operation rapidly and of working for at least six hours with a minimum range of eighty sea miles for ships in the First Class and fifty sea miles for ships in the two other Classes.

If the normal installation, which, in accordance with this Article, has a rauge of at least one hundred sea miles, satisfies all the conditions prescribed above, an emergency installation is not required.

The licence provided for in Article IX. of the Regulations auuexed to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, 1912, may not be issued unless the installation complies both with the provisions of that Convention, and also with the provisions of this Convention.

Article 36.

supplements the aforementioned documents.

Article 37.

Every master of a ship, who receives a call for assistance from a vessel in distress is 1>ouud to proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress.

Every master of a vessel in distress has the right to requisition from among the ships which answer his call for assistance the ship or ships which he considers best able to render him assistance, but he must exercise this right only after consultation, so far as may he possible, with the masters of those ships. Such ships are then bound to comply immediately with the requisition by proceeding with all speed to the assistance of the persons in distress.

The masters of the ships which are required to render assistance are released from this obligation as soon as the master or masters requisitioned have made known that they will comply with the requisition, or us soon as the master of one of the ships which has reached the scene of the casualty has made known to them that their assistance is no longer necessary. *

If the master of a ship is unable, or considers it unreasonable or unnecessary, in the special circumstances of the case, to go to the

Code X. — Barometric Tendency.

By the “ barometric tendency at a given hour ” is meant the amount by which the barometric height has changed during the preceding three hours. It is to be expressed in millimetres. For example, the barometric tendency at 8 a.m. could be obtained by comparing the reading taken at that hour, say 755*7 mm., with a reading taken at 5 a.m., say 759*3 mm. In this case the barometric tendency would be expressed by a fall of 3 6 millimetres. As a general rule the barometric tendency is to be determined from the trace of the barograph.

The barometric tendency is coded in two figures, according to the following table:—

Code XI. — Sea Surface Temperature.

Sea surface temperature to tenths of a degree Centigrade, is coded by three figures, or, when necessary, by two figures preceded by zero. If the temperature is negative, the first of these three figures is 5.

For example:—

— 2*2° C. is coded as 522.

+ 1*0° C., , 010.

+ 15*6° C., , 156.

Table of Corrections for reducing Barometric Heights to 0° C. and to Sea Level.

Note. — The barometric reading should first be corrected for index error. This error may be neglected if it is less than 0*3 mm. The + sign indicates that the correction is to be added to the barometric reading.

The — sign indicates that the correction is to be tubtracted.

CONSTRUCTION.

Article V.

Definitions.

The meaning of the principal technical and other expressions contained both in the Convention and in these Regulations, under the heading of Construction, is as follows:—

(1) The load water-line is the water-line used in determining the

subdivision of the ship.

(2) The length of the ship is the extreme length at the load water-

line.

(3) The breadth of the ship is the extreme width from outside of

frame to outside of frame at or below the load water-line.

(4) The bulkhead deck is the uppermost continuous deck to which all

transverse watertight bulkheads are carried.

(5) The margin line is a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead.deck at

side line, and 76 millimetres (equivalent to three inches) l>elow the upper surface of that deck at side.

(6) The draught is the vertical distance from the top of keel amid-

ships to the load water-line.

(7) The freeboard is the vertical distance from the load water-line to

the margin line amidships.

(8) The depth of the ship is the sum of the draught and freeboard as

above defined.

(9) The sheer of the bulkhead deck at any point is the vertical

distance between the beam at side line at that point and a line drawn parallel to the load water-line at the height of the beam at side line amidships.

(10) If block coefficient of fineness of displacement to load water-

line is used, this coefficient shall be determined as follows:—

Volume of displacement to moulded lines.

Length X Breadth x Draught.

(11) The permeability of a space is the percentage of that space which

can be occupied by water.

1914.

Merchant Shipping (Convention)

Act, 1914.

Ch. 50.

207

The volume of a compartment which extends above the margin line shall be measured only to the height of that line. Volumes shall be understood as volumes to moulded lines.

(12) The machinery space is to be taken as extending in length between the extreme main transverse watertight bulkheads bounding the spaces devoted to the main and auxiliary propelling machinery, including boilers when installed.

Article VI.

Floodable Length.

The floodable length at any point of the length of a ship shall be determined taking into consideration form, draught, and other limiting characteristics of the ship in question.

This floodable length for a given point in a ship with a continuous bulkhead deck is the maximum percentage of the length of the ship (having its centre at the point in question) which can be flooded under the definite assumptions hereafter set forth in Article VII. without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line.

In the case of ships not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length must be such as to secure to the ship in question, for each portion of its length, and for all conditions of trim after damage, a measure of safety at least equal in effectiveness to that laid down for the ship with continuous bulkhead deck.

Article VII.

Permeability.

The definite assumptions referred to in Article VI. relate to the permeabilities of the spaces in question below the margin line.

In determining the floodable length a uniform average permeability shall be used throughout the whole length of each of the three following portions of the ship:—

(1) The machinery space;

(2) The portion forward of the machinery space; and

(3) The portion abaft the machinery space.

For steam ships the permeability of the machinery space, including the double bottom in wake thereof, shall be taken as 80 per cent. For ships fitted with internal combustion engines the corresponding permeability shall be taken as 85 per cent., unless it is proved by actual calculation that a lower figure may be adopted, provided that in no case shall that figure be less than 80 per cent.

The permeabilities for spaces forward and aft of the machinery space shall be as follows:—

(a) Sixty per cent, in cargo spaces, bunkers (permanent or reserve), storerooms, baggage and mail rooms, chain>lockers, watertight shaft or pipe tunnels, and fresh-water tanks above the double bottom.

It must be proved that the spaces just enumerated are practicable for the purpose intended and that they are in fact to be so used. The same permeability shall not be assigned to any other space without the approval of the Administration.

208

Ch. 50.

Merchant Shipping ()4 5 Geo. 5.

Act, 1914.

(b) Ninety-five per cent, in passenger and crew spaces, peaks, trimming-tanks exclusively so used, double bottoms, and all other spaces not specifically appropriated to one of the purposes indicated in the foregoing section (a).

If in a ’tween-deck space enclosed by complete transverse permanent steel bulkheads any portion thereof is appropriated to passengers, the whole of that space shall be regarded as passenger space; and, similarly, ’tween-deck spaces appropriated for the carriage of either passengers or cargo shall be regarded as passenger spaces.

Where the spaces before or abaft the machinery space below the margin line consist partly of spaces mentioned in section (a) and partly of spaces mentioned in section (6), the average percentage of permeability shall be determined separately for each end by the formula 95 — 35 r where r is the ratio between the volume of the spaces mentioned in section (a) and the total volume of the space in the portion of the ship under consideration.

Article VIII.

Permissible Length of Compartments.

(1) The maximum permissible length of one compartment having its centre at any point in the ship’s length is obtained from the floodable length (Article VI.) by multiplying that length by an appropriate factor, called the factor of subdivision.

(2) This factor of subdivision depends on the length of the ship, and, for a given length, varies according to the nature of the service for which the ship is intended. This factor decreases in a regular and continuous manner —

(a) As the length of ship increases; and

(b) As, for a given length, the ship departs from the type of ship

engaged in a mixed cargo and passenger service, and approaches to the type of ship primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers.

(3) For each of the two types of ships referred to in the previous paragraph (2) (b) the variation of the factor of subdivision may be expressed by a curve, of which the co-ordinates represent the length of the ship and the value of the factor. The following table gives certain points on two curves the higher of which corresponds to the minimum requirements for the “mixed” type, and the lower to the minimum requirements for the “passenger” type.

Column (A) gives the maximum permissible values of the factor of subdivision for the length of ships given in Columns (B) and (C).

Column (B) is applicable to ships engaged in a mixed cargo and passenger service.

Column (C) is applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers.

(4) For a given length, the value of the factor of subdivision appropriate to a ship between the two extreme limits will be between the values of the factors determined by the two curves before mentioned, and will be automatically fixed by a criterion of service which is to form the subject of further study.

Article IX.

(1) When the factor of subdivision is equal to or less than *5, it may be doubled in order to give at auy point of the ship’s length the total length of two adjacent compartments; but, in that case, the length of the shorter compartment of any pair shall not be less than one-quarter of the total length so obtained. If one of the two adjacent compartments is situated inside the machinery space and the second is situated outside the machinery space, and the average permeability of the portion of the ship in which the second is situated differs from eighty per cent., the length of the pair of compartments shall be adjusted to the proper value by applying a suitable correction.

(2) In no case whatever shall the length of auy watertight compartment exceed 28 metres (equivalent to 92 feet).

(3) When the factor of subdivision applicable to any ship is less than *84, but more than *5, the combined length of the two foremost compartments shall not exceed the floodable length at the extreme forward end, provided also that the length of the second compartment is not greater than that permissible by Article VIII. above and not less than 3 metres (equivalent to 10 feet).

(4) When the length of the ship is more than 213 metres (equivalent to 699 feet) but less than 251 metres (equivalent to 823 feet) the floodable length at the forward end of the ship shall be at least 20 per cent, of the ship’s length; and the ship, forward of a bulkhead placed either at the distance of the actual floodable length abaft the stem or not nearer to the stem than 20 per cent, of the ship’s length, shall be divided into at least three compartments.

(5) When the length of the ship is equal to or greater than 251 metres (equivalent to 823 feet) the same method shall be adopted, but the floodable length shall be at least 28 per cent, and the number of compartments at least four.

(6) A bulkhead may be recessed transversely, provided the sides of the recess are at a sufficient distance from the sides of the ship.

Vertical steps are inadmissible in the main transverse watertight bulkheads of ships to which the subdivision rules of Article VIII. apply where the factor of subdivision is greater than *5, unless such arrangements are made by additional subdivision as shall maintain the same measure of safety as that secured by bulkheads without steps. The total length of the steps in any bulkhead shall not exceed 2 per cent, of the «hip’s length, plus 3 metres (equivalent to 10 feet).

(7) The existence of recesses or steps in a bulkhead shall in no case affect the permissible volumes of the compartments adjacent to such bulkhead, as determined by this and the preceding Article.

Merchant Shipping (Convention) 4 & 5 Geo. 5.

Act, 1914.

Article X.

If the degree of safety of a ship is greater than that prescribed by Articles VIII. and IX. above, and if the owner requests that this fact be recorded on the Safety Certificate, in accordance with Article 17 (paragraph 4) of the Convention, this request shall be accompanied with all the data necessary to justify the claim.

In such case, the record shall state the fact that the subdivision is equal or superior to that provided for a ship of equal length in Column (C) of the Table in Article VIII., with an additional statement giving the length of the ship in Column (C) whose factor of subdivision according to the rules would be exnctly equal to that employed in determining the subdivision of the ship in question.

Values of length and factors for lengths not specifically stated in Columns (C) and (A) respectively of the Table in Article VIII. shall be obtained by interpolation.

Article XL Peak and Machinery Space Bulkheads.

Ships shall be fitted with a forepeak bulkhead to extend to the bulkhead deck, and to the weather deck in ships having continuous super-structures. This bulkhead shall be placed at a distance of not less than 5 per cent, of the ship's length from the stem at the load water-line.

An afterpeak bulkhead and bulkheads dividing the machinery space from the cargo and the passenger spaces shall also be fitted and carried up to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stopped below the bulkhead deck, provided that it shall at least be carried to the first deck above the load water-line, and that such deck forms a watertight flat from the afterpeak bulkhead to the stern, and also provided that the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished.

Article XII.

Fireproof Bulkheads.

In parts of a ship above the margin line there shall be fitted fireproof bulkheads which will serve to retard the spread of fire. The mean distance between any two consecutive bulkheads of this description shall not be greater than 40 metres (equivalent to 131 feet). Recesses in these bulkheads shall be fireproof, and the openings in these bulkheads shall be fitted with fireproof doors.

Article XIII.

Exits from Watertight Compartments.

(1) In passenger and crew spaces a practicable means of escape for the occupants shall be provided from each watertight compartment.

(2) There shall be a means of escape for the crew from each engine room, shaft tunnel and stokehold compartment, independent of the watertight dpors.

Article XIV.

Construction and Initial Testing of Watertight Bulkheads.

(1) Watertight bulkheads shall be constructed in such a manner that they shall be capable of supporting, with a proper margin of resistance, the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line.

1914.

Merchant Sharping (

Act, 11)14.

Ch. 50.

(2) Steps and recesses in bulkheads shall he as watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs.

Where frames or beams pass through a watertight deck or bulkhead, the watertightneBs shall be obtained by eaulked angle chocks, or cast iron or steel chocks efficiently secured and rust-jointed, and not by wood or cement.

(3) Testing main compartments by filling them with water is not compulsory. A complete examination of the bulkheads shall be made by a surveyor; and, in addition, a hose test shall be made in all cases.

(4) The foremost and aftermost compartments shall be tested with water to a head up to the margin line.

Double bottoms, deep tanks, and all compartments intended to hold liquids shall be tested with water to a head 2*44 metres (8 feet) above the top of the tank or to the load water-line, whichever is the greater.

(5) No change may be made in the structure of the bulkheads after the completion of the survey without the permission of the Administration.

(6) All provisions relating to main transverse watertight bulkheads shall apply to longitudinal bulkheads, so far as is practicable.

Article XV.

Openings in Watertight Bulkheads

(1) The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship; satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings.

(2) No doors, sluice valves, manholes, or access openings are permitted —

(a) In the collision bulkhead below the margin line.

(b) In watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space or from a reserve bunker, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this Article.

(3) In the machinery space and apart from bunker and shaft-tunnel doors, not more than one door may be fitted in each main transverse bulkhead within the machinery space for intercommunication, but where more than one separate shaft tunnel is fitted a door may be cut for each tunnel.

If a tunnel is fitted forward either for the purpose of pipes or as a communication passage it shall be fitted with a watertight door.

(4) The only types of watertight doors permissible are hinged doors, sliding doors, and doors of any other equivalent pattern, excluding plate doors secured only by bolts.

A hinged door shall be fitted with lever-operated catches workable from each side of the bulkhead.

A sliding door may have a horizontal or vertical motion. If hand-operated only, the door shall be capable of being operated at the door itself and also from an accessible position above the margin line. If operated by power, it shall be capable of being operated from the bridge, and by hand both at the door itself and from an accessible position above the margin line. A door dropping by its own weight, and fitted with a cataract cylinder or equivalent arrangement, may be considered as being operated by power, if capable of being released from the bridge.

Act, 1914.

(5) In the case of watertight bunker doors, satisfactory arrangements shall be made by means of screens or otherwise, to prevent the coal from interfering with the closing of the doors.

(6) Hinged watertight doors in passenger, crew, and working spaces are only permitted above a deck, the under side of which, at its lowest point at side, is at least 2*13 metres (7 feet) above the load water-line, and they are not permitted in those spaces below such deck.

Hinged watertight doors of specially heavy design may be fitted above the load water-line in bulkheads between cargo ’tween-deck spaces. They shall be closed before the voyage commences, and kept closed while at sea by efficient closing gear.

In all cases two children under 1*2 years of age shall be reckoned as one person.

Article XXXVII.

Cubic capacity of Open Boats of the First Class

1. The cubic capacity of an open boat of type 1A or IB shall be determined by Stirling’s (Simpson’s) Rule or by any other method giving the same degree of accuracy. The capacity of a square-sterned boat shall be calculated as if the boat had a pointed stern.

2. For example, the capacity in cubic metres (or cubic feet) of a boat, calculated by the aid of Stirling’s Rule, may be considered as given by the following formula:—

Capacity = f (A A + 2 + 4C)

I being the length of the boat in metres (or feet) from the inside of the planking or plating at the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post; in the case of a boat with a square stern the length is measured to the inside of the transom.

A, B, C denote respectively the areas of the cross-sections at the quarter length forward, amidships, and the quarter length aft, which correspond to the three points obtained by dividing I into four equal parts (the areas corresponding to the two ends of the boat are considered negligible).

The areas A, B, Cshall be deemed to be given in square metres (or square feet) by the successive application of the following formula to each of the three cross-sections:—

Area = A (a + 45 + 2c + +

1 /

h being the depth measured in metres (or in feet) iuside the planking or plating from the keel to the level of the gunwale, or, in certain cases, to a lower level, as determined hereafter.

a, 5, c, d, e denote the horizontal breadths of the boat measured in metres (or in feet) at the upper and lower points of the depth and at the three points obtained by dividing h into four equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme points, and c at the middle point, of A).

3. If the sheer of the gunwale, measured at the two points situated at a quarter of the length of the boat from the ends, exceeds 1 per cent, of the length of the boat, the depth employed in calculating the area of the cross-sections A or Cshall be deemed to be the depth amidships plus 1 per cent, of the length of the boat.

4. If the depth of the boat amidship exceeds 45 per cent of the breadth, the depth employed in calculating the area of the midship cross-section B shall be deemed to be equal to 45 per cent, of the breadth, and the depth employed in calculating the areas of the quarter length sections A and C is obtained by increasing this last figure by an amount equal to 1 per cent, of the length of the boat, provided that in no case shall the depths employed in the calculation exceed the actual depths at these points.

5. If the depth of the boat is greater than 122 centimetres (equivalent to feet) the uumber of persons given by the application of this rule

1914.

Merchant Shipping (Convention)

Act, 1914.

Ch. 50.

shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio of 122 centimetres to the actual depth, until the boat has been satisfactorily tested afloat with that number of persons on board all wearing life-jackets.

6. Each Administration shall impose, by suitable formulae, a limit for the number of persons allowed in boats with very fine ends and in boats very full in form.

7. Each Administration reserves the right to assign to a boat a capacity equal to the product of the length, the breadth and the depth multiplied by 0*6 if it is evident that this formula does not give a greater capacity than that obtained by the above method. The dimensions shall theu be measured in the following manner:—

Length: From the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post or, in the case of a square sterned boat, to the after side of the transom.

Breadth:From the outside of the planking at the point where the breadth of the boat is greatest.

Depth :Amidships inside the planking from the keel to the level of the gunwale, but the depth used in calculating the cubic capacity may not in any case exceed 45 per cent, of the breadth.

In all cases the shipowner has the right to require that the cubic capacity of the boat shall be determined by exact measurement.

8. The cubic capacity of a motor boat is obtained from the gross capacity by deducting a volume equal to that occupied by the motor and its accessories.

Article XXXVIII.

Deck area oj Pontoon Boats and Open Boats of the Second Class

1. The area of the deck of a pontoon boat of type 1C, 2B, or 2C shall be determined by the method indicated below or by any other method giving the same degree of accuracy. The same rule is to be applied in determining the area within the fixed bulwarks of a boat of type 2A.

2. For example, the surface in square metres (or square feet) of a boat may be deemed to be given by the following formula:—

Area = L (2a + 1 '5b + 4c + 1 *5rf + 2c).

I being the length in metres (or in feet) from the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post.

a, by c, rf, e denote the horizontal breadths in metres (or in feet) outside the planking at the points obtained by dividing I into four equal parts and subdividing the foremost and aftermost parts into two equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme subdivisions, c at the middle point of the length, and b and d at the intermediate points).

Bankruptcy notices.

in any civil proceeding in the High Court, and the goods have been either sold or held by the sheriff for twenty-one days:

Provided that, where an interpleader summons has been taken out in regard to the goods seized, the time elapsing between the date at which such summons is taken out and the date at which the proceedings on such summons are finally ’disposed of, settled, or abandoned, shall not be taken into account in calculating such period of twenty-one days;

(2) In such case the official receiver shall hold a meeting of creditors, before the public examination of the debtor is concluded, and send to each creditor, before the meeting, a copy of the debtor’s proposal with a report thereon; and if at that meeting a majority in number and three fourths in value of all the creditors who have proved, resolve to accept the proposal, it shall be deemed to be duly accepted by the creditors, and when approved by the court shall be binding on all the creditors.

Ch. 59.

(9) If the court is of opinion that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable, or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, or in any case in which the court is required, where the debtor is adjudged bankrupt, to refuse his discharge, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal.

(10) If any facts are proved on proof of which the court would be required either to refuse, suspend or attach conditions to the debtor’s discharge were he adjudged bankrupt, the couri shall refuse to approve the proposal, unless it provides reasonable security for the payment of not less than five shillings in the pound on all the unsecured debts provable against the debtor’s estate.

(11) In any other case the court may either approve or refuse to approve the proposal.

(13) A composition or scheme accepted and approved in pursuance of this section shall be binding on all the creditors so far as relates to any debts due to them from the debtor and provable in bankruptcy, but shall not release the debtor from any liability under a judgment against him in an action for seduction, or under an affiliation order, or under a judgment against him as a co-respondent in a matrimonial cause, except to such an extent and under such conditions as the court expressly orders in respect of such liability.

(15) The provisions of a composition or scheme under this section may be enforced by the court on application by any person interested, and any disobedience of an order of the court made on the application shall be deemed a contempt of court.

(16) If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the court, on satisfactory evidence, that the composition or scheme cannot, in consequence of legal difficulties, or for any sufficient cause, proceed without injustice or undue delay to the creditors or to the debtor, or that the approval of the court was obtained by fraud, the court may, if it thinks fit, on application by the official receiver or the trustee or by any creditor, adjudge the debtor bankrupt, and annul the composition or scheme,

Adjudication of bankruptcy where composition not accepted or approved.

but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made, or thing duly done, under or in pursuance of the composition or scheme.

Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt under this subsection, any debt provable in other respects, which has been contracted before the adjudication, shall be provable in the bankruptcy.

(17) If under or in pursuance of a composition or scheme a trustee is appointed to administer the debtor’s property or manage his business, or to distribute the composition, section twenty-five and Part IV. of this Act shall apply as if the trustee were a trustee in a bankruptcy, and as if the terms “ bankruptcy, ’" “ bankrupt, ” and “ order of adjudication ” included respectively a composition or scheme of arrangement, a compounding or arranging debtor, and an order approving the composition or scheme.

(18) Part II. of this Act shall, so far as the nature of the case and the terms of the composition or scheme admit, apply thereto, the same interpretation being given to the words “trustee, ” “ bankruptcy, ” “ bankrupt, ” and “ order of adjudication, ” as in the last preceding subsection.

(19) No composition or scheme shall be approved by the court which does not provide for the payment in priority to other debts of all debts directed to be so paid in the distribution of the property of a bankrupt.

(20) The acceptance by a creditor of a composition or scheme shall not release any person who under this Act would not be released by an order of discharge if the debtor had been adjudged bankrupt.

17. Notwithstanding the acceptance and approval of a composition or scheme, the composition or scheme shall not be binding on any creditor so far as regards a debt or liability from which, under the provisions of this Act, the debtor would not be released by an order of discharge in bankruptcy, unless the creditor assents to the composition or scheme.

Adjudication of Bankruptcy.

18. — (1) Where a receiving order is made against a debtor, then, if the creditors at the first meeting or any adjournment thereof by ordinary resolution resolve that the debtor be adjudged bankrupt, or pass no resolution, or if the creditors do not meet, or if a composition or scheme is not approved in pursuance of this Act within fourteen days after the conclusion of the examination of the debtor or such further time as the court may allow, the court shall adjudge the debtor bankrupt; and thereupon the property of the bankrupt shall become divisible among his creditors and shall vest in a trustee.

(2) Notice of every order adjudging a debtor bankrupt, stating the name, address, and description of the bankrupt, the date of the adjudication, and the court by which^ the adjudication is made, shall be gazetted and advertised in a

(2) The person so appointed shall give security in manner prescribed to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade, and the Board, if satisfied with the security, shall certify that his appointment has been duly made, unless they object to the appointment on the ground that it has not been made in good faith by a majority in value of the creditors voting, or that the person appointed is not fit to act as trustee, or that his connexion with or relation to the bankrupt or his estate or any particular creditor makes it difficult for him to act with impartiality in the interests' of the creditors generally.

(3) Provided that, where the Board make any such objection they shall, if so requested by a majority in value of the creditors, notify the objection to the High Court, and thereupon the High Court may decide on its validity.

(5) The official receiver shall not, save as by this Act provided, be the trustee of the bankrupt’s property.

(6) If a trustee is not appointed by the creditors within ' four weeks from the date of the adjudication, or, in the event of there being negotiations for a composition or scheme pending at the expiration of those four weeks, then within seven days from the close of those negotiations by the refusal of the creditors to accept, or of the court to approve, the composition or scheme, the official receiver shall* report the matter to the Board of Trade, and thereupon the Board of Trade shall appoint some fit person to be trustee of the bankrupt’s property, and shall certify the appointment.

(7) Provided that the creditors or the committee of inspection (if so authorised by resolution of the creditors) may, at any subsequent time, if they think fit, appoint a trustee, and, on the appointment being made and certified, the person appointed shall become trustee in the place of the person appointed by the Board of Trade.

country or, if no Excise duty is levied in the country into which the articles are sent, equal to the drawback allowed on exportation.

The sum by which the Transferred Sum is to be increased in pursuance of this provision may be fixed by the Joint Exchequer Board so as to vary during the first ten years after the transfer, but subject thereto shall be a definite sum.

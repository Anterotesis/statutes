c. 89.

Rules for determining existence of partnership.

Nature of Partnership.

1. — (1.) Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit.

(2.) But the relation between members of any compauy or association which is —

(a.) Registered as a company under the Companies Act, 1862, or any other Act of Parliament for the time being in force and relating to the registration of joint stock companies; or (b.) Formed or incorporated by or in pursuance of any other Act of Parliament or letters patent, or Royal Charter; or (c.) A company engaged in working mines within and subject to the jurisdiction of the Stannaries: is not a partnership within the meaning of this Act.

2. In determining whether a partnership does or does not exist, regard shall be had to the following rules :

(1.) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not of itself create a partnership as to anything so held or owned, whether the tenants or owners do or do not share any profits made by the use thereof. (2.) The sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership, whether the persons sharing such returns have or have not a joint or common right or interest in any property from which or from the use of which the returns are derived. (3.) The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is primd facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but the receipt of such a share, or of a payment contingent on or varying with the profits of a business, does not of itself make him a partner in the business; and in particular —

(a.) The receipt by a person of a debt or other liquidated amount by instalments or otherwise out of the accruing profits of a business does not of itself make him a partner in the business or liable as such :

(6.) A contract for the remuneration of a servant or agent of a person engaged in a business by a share of the profits of the business does not of itself make the servant or agent a partner in the business or liable as such :

(c.) A person being the widow or child of a deceased partner, and receiving by way of annuity a portion of the profits made in the business in which the deceased person was a partner, is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business or liable as such:

(d.) The advance of money by way of loan to a person engaged or about to engage in any business on a contract with that person that the lender shall receive a rate of interest varying with the profits, or shall receive a share of the profits arising from carrying on the business, does not of itself make the lender a partner with the person or persons carrying on the business or liable as such.

Provided that the contract is in writing, and signed by or on behalf of all the parties thereto:

(e.) A person receiving by way of annuity or otherwise a portion of the profits of a business in consideration of the sale by him of the goodwill of the business is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business or liable as such.

constables, (that is to say, to constables appointed to police forces, and to the pension or superannuation funds established for those forces, before the commencement of this Act, whether under any general or local Act, or otherwise) the following provisions shall have effect:

(I.) As soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, the amount of every existing pension or superannuation fund of a police force shall, where it is not already held by the treasurer of the police fund of that force, be transferred by the persons holding the same to such persons as the police authority may direct, to be held and dealt with as part of the pension fund under this Act, and as part of the capital or income thereof; as the case may require:

(2.) Where the Exchequer contribution to the police authority of a police force becomes payable before any existing fund of the force which is required to be so transferred is so transferred, or, in the case of a police force not having any such fund, before a pension fund is established for the force in pursuance of this Act, the payment of the contribution shall be deferred until the Secretary of State has certified that the fund is so transferred or established:

(3.) Where the police force of a borough has been consolidated with the police force of a county, and the existing pension or superannuation fund of the police force of the borough has not been transferred to the county treasurer, that fund shall be transferred in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section, as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, by the persons holding the same, and, in the absence of any agreement between the police authorities for the county and borough, the income of that fund shall be applied in paying the superannuation and other allowances charged thereon at the date of the transfer, and, subject thereto, in paying the pensions, allowances, and gratuities to constables employed in the consolidated force, and their widows and children, in such manner as may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Secretary of State:

(4.) In Lincolnshire section twenty-two of the County and Borough Police Act, 1859, and sections six, seven, and eight of the Police Superannuation Act, 1865, as amended by the Lincolnshire Police Superannuation Act, 1888, shall, so far as is consistent with the tenor thereof, apply to the pension fund under this Act in like manner as if it were the superannuation fund in those sections mentioned :

(5.) Every police authority shall, within fourteen days after a pension scale has been adopted by or framed for the police authority in pursuance of this Act, cause written notice to be given to every constable in the police force under that authority, requiring him to inform that authority in writing before the date of the commencement of this Act, whether he does or does not accept the provisions of this Act in lieu of the existing enactments respecting superannuation:

(7.) If by reason of the police authority not having given such notice as aforesaid an existing constable becomes entitled to a less pension than he would have been entitled to receive if this Act had not passed, he may apply to the police authority, and the police authority may make such order as may seem just for the purpose of preventing the constable from suffering any loss by reason of the notice not having been given :

(8.) In the case of any existing constable to whom this Act applies, his approved service for any period before the commencement of this Act in the force in which he is serving at the time of his retirement shall be reckoned as approved service; and his service for not les< than three years either wholly or partly before the commencement of this Act in any police force in any part of the United Kingdom from which he removed with the sanction of the chief officer or police authority of that force to another force, shall (notwithstanding the sanction was not given in writing) be reckoned as approved service for the said period in the last-mentioned force, uuless the police authority who give him the notice respecting the acceptance of this Act, inform him in writing at the time of such notice that they refuse to allow the said service to be reckoned, but their refusal shall not prevent the reckoning of that service under any other provision of this section:

(9.) Any description of service before the commencement of this Act, either in a police force or otherwise, which any existing constable to whom this Act applies is at the commencement of this Act entitled to reckon as service for any period towards superannuation out of the existing pension or superannuation fund of his police force, and which is not reckoned under any other provision of this Act, shall be reckoned for the same period for the purposes of pension under this Act: In the case of any existing constable to whom this Act applies, who has served not less than ten years before the commencement of this Act in a police force in which the police authority have heretofore, under the provisions of former Acts, granted pensions of higher amount than authorised by the scale adopted by that police authority under the provisions of this Act, and who becomes entitled to a pension under this Act, then, notwithstanding anything in this Act, the pension may, if the police authority think fit, exceed the amount prescribed in the adopted

scale so as it does not exceed the amount winch might have been granted if this Act had not passed:

(10.) Provided that if, in the case of any existing constable, rateable deductions or other payments towards superannuation or insurance have not, during the period of the service which he is entitled to reckon for the purpose of calculating his pension under this Act, or for some part of such period not less than ten years, been made, and contributions have not been made from other sources to a superannuation fund in lieu of the rateable deductions not so made, the pension granted under this Act to such constable may, if the police authority think fit, be reduced by an annual amount equal to such deferred annuity as could, according to the tables for. the purchase of deferred annuities from the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt through the medium of the Post Office, have been purchased by rateable deductions made at the rate fixed under this Act during the said period of service, or the part thereof during which such deductions or payments were not made.

CHAPTER 71.

An Act to amend the Law of Bankruptcy.

[18th August 1890.]

WHEREAS it is expedient to amend the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 (herein-after referred to as the principal Act), and other enactments relating to bankruptcy.

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy if execution against him has been levied by seizure of his goods under process in an action in any court, or in any civil proceeding in the High Court,

Ch. 71.

615

1890.

Bankruptcy 1890.

and the goods have been either sold or held by the sheriff for twenty-one days.

Provided that, where an interpleader summons has been taken out in regard to the goods seized, the time elapsing between the date at which such summons is taken out and the date at which the sheriff is ordered to withdraw, or any interpleader issue ordered thereon is finally disposed of, shall not be taken into account in calculating such period of twenty-one days.

Any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment shall be deemed a creditor who has obtained a final judgment within the meaning of section four of the principal Act-.

2. — (1.) The notes taken of a debtor's public examination in pursuance of section seventeen of the principal Act shall be read over either to or by the debtor.

(2.) Where the debtor is a lunatic or suffers from any such mental or physical affliction or disability as in the opinion of the court makes him unfit to attend his public examination, the court may make an order dispensing with such examination, or directing that the debtor be examined on such terms, in such manner, and at such place as to the court seems expedient.

3. — (1) Where a debtor intends to make a proposal for a composition in satisfaction of his debts, or a proposal for a scheme of arrangement of his affairs, he shall, within four days of submitting his statement of affairs, or within such time thereafter as the official receiver may fix, lodge with the official receiver a proposal in writing, signed by him, embodying the terms of the composition or scheme which he is desirous of submitting for the consideration of his creditors, and setting out particulars of any sureties or securities proposed.

(2 ) In such case the official receiver shall hold a meeting of creditors, before the public examination of the debtor is concluded, and send to each creditor, before the meeting, a copy of the debtor's proposal with a report thereon; and if at that meeting a majority in number and three fourths in value of all the creditors who have proved resolve to accept the proposal, the same shall be deemed to be duly accepted by the creditors, and when approved by the court shall be binding on all the creditors.

(3.) The debtor may at the meeting amend the terms of his proposal, if the amendment is, in the opinion of the official receiver, calculated to benefit the general body of creditors.

(4.) Any creditor who has proved his debt may assent to or dissent from the proposal by a letter, in the prescribed form, addressed to the official receiver so as to be received by him not later than the day preceding the meeting, and any such assent or dissent shall have effect as if the creditor had been present and had voted at the meeting.

(5.) The debtor or the official receiver may, after the proposal is accepted by the creditors, apply to the court to approve it, and notice of the time appointed for hearing the application shall be given to each creditor who has proved.

Public examination of debtor.

Compositions and schemes of arrangement.

(6.) The application shall not be heard until after the conclusion of the public examination of the debtor. Any creditor who lias proved may be heard by the court in opposition to the application, notwithstanding that he may at a meeting of creditors have voted for the acceptance of the proposal.

(7.) The court shall, before approving the proposal, hear a report of the official receiver as to the terms thereof, and as to the conduct of the debtor, and any objections which may be made by or on behalf of any creditor.

(8.) If the court is of opinioo that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable, or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, or in any case in which the court is required where the debtor is adjudged bankrupt to refuse his discharge, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal.

(9.) If any facts are proved on proof of which the court would be required either to refuse, suspend, or attach conditions to the debtor's discharge were he adjudged bankrupt, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal, unless it provides reasonable security for payment of not less them seven shillings and sixpence in the pound on all the unsecured debts provable against the debtor's estate.

(10.) In any other case the court may either approve or refuse to approve the proposal.

(11.) If the court approves the proposal, the approval may be testified by the seal of the court being attached to the instrument containing the terms of the proposed composition or scheme, or by the terms being embodied in an order of the court.

(12.) A composition or scheme accepted and approved in pursuance of this section shall be binding on all the creditors so far as relates to any debts due to them from the debtor and provable in bank* ruptcy, but shall not release the debtor from any liability under a judgment against him in an action for seduction, or under an affiliation order, or under a judgment against him as a co-respondent in a matrimonial cause, except to such an extent and under such conditions as the court expressly orders in respect of such liability.

(13.) A certificate of the official receiver that a composition or scheme has been duly accepted and approved shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive as to its validity.

(14.) The provisions of a composition or scheme under this section may be enforced by the court on application by any person interested, and any disobedience of an order of the court made on the application shall be deemed a contempt of court.

(15.) If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the court, on satisfactory evidence, that the composition or scheme cannot, in consequence of legal difficulties, or for any sufficient cause, proceed without injustice or undue delay to the creditors or to the debtor, or that the approval of the court was obtained by fraud, the court may, if it thinks fit, on application by the official receiver or the trustee, or by any creditor, adjudge the debtor bankrupt, and annul the composition or scheme, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition, or payment duly made, or thing duly done, under or in pursuance of the com-

position or scheme. Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt under this sub-section, any debt provable in other respects, which has been contracted before the adjudication, shall be provable in the bankruptcy.

(16.) If under or in pursuance of a composition or scheme a trustee is appointed to administer the debtor's property or manage his business, or to distribute the composition, section twenty-seven and Part V. of the principal Act shall apply as if the trustee were a trustee in a bankruptcy, and as if the terms “ bankruptcy,” " bankrupt,” and “ order of adjudication,” included respectively a composition or scheme of arrangement, a compounding or arranging debtor, and order approving the composition or scheme.

(17.) Part III. of the principal Act shall, so far as the nature of the case and the terms of the compositiou or scheme admit, apply thereto, the same interpretation being given to the words “ trustee,” “ bankruptcy,” “ bankrupt,” and “ order of adjudication,” as in the last preceding sub-section.

(18.) No composition or scheme shall be approved by the court which does not provide for the payment in priority to other debts of all debts directed to be so paid in the distribution of the property of a bankrupt.

(19.) The acceptance by a creditor of a composition or scheme shall not release any person who under the principal Act and this Act would not be released by an order of discharge if the debtor had been adjudged bankrupt.

4. A person shall be deemed not fit to act as trustee of the property of a bankrupt where he has been previously removed from the office of trustee of a bankrupt's property for misconduct or neglect of duty.

5. Sub-section one of section twenty-two of the principal Act (relating to the committee of inspection) shall be read and construed as if the words “ from among the creditors ” were substituted for the words “ from among the creditors qualified to vote.” Provided that a creditor who is appointed a member of a committee of inspection shall not be qualified to act until he has proved his debt and the proof has been admitted.

6. The resolution required for accepting a proposal for a composition or scheme in pursuance of section twenty-three of the principal Act shall be the like resolution as is required for accepting a like proposal made by a debtor before an adjudication of bankruptcy.

7. Section twenty-five of the principal Act (relating to the arrest of a debtor under certain circumstances) shall be read and construed as if the words “ believing that he has absconded, or is about to abscond,” were substituted for the words “ believing that he is about to abscond.”

8. — (1.) A bankrupt may, at any time after being adjudged bankrupt, apply to the court for an order of discharge, and the court shall appoint a day for hearing the application, but the application shall not be heard until the public examination of the bankrupt is concluded. The application shall be heard in open court.

(2.) On the hearing of the application the court shall take into consideration a report of the official receiver as to the bankrupt's conduct and affairs (including a report as to the bankrupt's conduct during the proceedings under his bankruptcy), and may either grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge, or suspend the operation of the order for a specified time, or grant an order of discharge subject to any conditions with respect to any earnings or income which may afterwards become due to the bankrupt, or with respect to bis after-acquired property : Provided that the court shall refuse the discharge in all cases where the bankrupt has committed any misdemeanor under the Debtors Act, 1869, or the principal Act, or any other misdemeanor connected with his bankruptcy, or any felony connected with his bankruptcy, unless for special reasons the court otherwise determines, and shall, on proof of any of the facts herein-after mentioned, either —

(ii) suspend the discharge for a period of not less than two years; or

(iii) suspend the discharge until a dividend of not less than ten shillings in the pound has been paid to the creditors; or

(8.) The facts herein-before referred to are : —

(a.) That the bankrupt's assets are not of a value equal to ten shillings in the pound on the amount of his unsecured liabilities, unless he satisfies the court that the fact that the assets are not of a value equal to ten shillings in the pound on the amount of his unsecured liabilities has arisen from circumstances for which he cannot justly be held responsible:

CHAPTER 2.

An Act for reducing the Hate of Interest on the National Debt.

[27th March 1888.]

WI HERE AS by the National Debt Act, 1870, it was provided V▼ that the new three pounds per cent, annuities (herein-after referred to as new three per cent, stock), being part of the National Debt, should, until redemption, continue to be payable by equal half-yearly dividends on the fifth day of April and the fifth day of October in each year, and should continue redeemable by Parliament at any time after the tenth day of October one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four at the rate of one hundred pounds sterling for every one hundred pounds of the capital sums in respect whereof those annuities were payable:

And whereas, with a view of reducing the rate of interest on the National Debt, it is expedient to provide for the conversion of the new three per cent, stock into stock of a lower denomination, and for the redemption of such portions of that stock as may be held by persons dissenting from such conversion:

And whereas it is also expedient, with the same view, to provide facilities for the conversion of the consolidated three pounds per cent, annuities and the reduced three pounds per cent, annuities (herein-after referred to respectively as consolidated three per cent, stock and reduced three per cent, stock), into stock of a lower denomination:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

CHAPTER 3.

An Act for further promoting the Revision of the Statute Law by repealing superfluous expressions of enactment, and enactments which have ceased to be in force or have become unnecessary.

[27th March 1888.]

WHEREAS in numerous statutes the expression “be it further t enacted by the authority aforesaid, ” or similar expressions of enactment, are frequently repeated, and it is expedient, with a view to the revision of the Statute Law, and particularly to the improvement of the Revised Edition of the Statutes, to repeal these expressions, which are superfluous;

And whereas it is expedient that certain enactments which may be regarded as spent, or have ceased to be in force otherwise than by express specific repeal by Parliament, or by lapse of time or otherwise have become unnecessary, should be expressly and specifically repealed:

And whereas the Crown Office Rules, 1886, regulate proceedings in outlawry in the Crown Office of Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice, and it is expedient that like rules be made for regulating proceedings in outlawry in courts of assize, oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery, and in other courts in England:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follow's:

1. — (1.) The enactments described in Parts I. and IL of the Enactment* schedule to this Act are hereby repealed: repeS*116

(2.) The Lord Chancellor may, if he thinks fit, by order, extend the Crown Office Rules in force for the time being as to proceedings in outlawry to proceedings in outlawry in courts of assize, oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery, and in other courts in England, with such modifications (if any) as to him may seem expedient; and, as from the date of the order under this enactment coming into operation, the enactments in Part III. of the Schedule to this Act shall be repealed.

(3.) Provided that the repeal of any words or expressions described in Part I. shall not affect the binding force, operation, or

14

construction of any statute, or of any part of a statute, whether as respects the past or future;

And where any enactment not comprised in the Schedule to this Act has been repealed, confirmed, revived, or perpetuated by any enactment hereby repealed, such repeal, confinnation, revivor, or perpetuation shall not be affected by the repeal effected by this Act;

And the repeal by this Act of any enactment shall not affect any enactment in which such enactment has been applied, incorporated, or referred to;

Nor shall such repeal of any enactment affect any right to any hereditary revenues of the Crown, or affect any charges thereupon, or prevent any such enactment from being put in force for the collection of any such revenues, or otherwise in relation thereto;

And this Act shall not affect the validity, invalidity, effect, or consequences of anything already done or suffered, — or any existing status or capacity, — or any right, title, obligation, or liability already acquired, accrued, or incurred, or any remedy or proceeding in respect thereof, — or any release or discharge of or from any debt, penalty, obligation, liability, claim, or demand, — or any indemnity, — or the proof of any past act or thing;

Nor shall this Act affect any principle or rule of law or equity, or established jurisdiction, form or course of pleading, practice, or procedure, or any existing usage, franchise, liberty, custom, privilege, restriction, exemption, office, appointment, payment, allowance, emolument, or benefit, notwithstanding that the same respectively may have been in any manner affirmed, recognised, or derived by, in, or from any enactment hereby repealed;

Nor shall this Act revive or restore any jurisdiction, office, duty, drawback, fee, payment, franchise, liberty, custom, right, title, privilege, restriction, exemption, usage, practice, procedure, or other matter or thing not now existing or in force;

And this Act shall not extend to repeal any enactment so far as the same may be in force in any part of Her Majesty’s dominions out of the United Kingdom, except where otherwise expressed in the said schedule.

2. This Act may be cited as the Statute Law Revision Act, 1888.

WHEREAS by the Westminster Abbey Act, 1886, the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter Westminster (in this Act referred to as the Dean and Chapter of Westminster) were authorised to borrow, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England (in this Act referred to as the Ecclesiastical Commissioners) were authorised to lend, on the security of the revenues of the Dean and Chapter, or of part thereof, such capital sums not exceeding ten thousand pounds in the whole as the Commissioners might consider to be required for the restoration or repair of Westminster Abbey and the buildings attached thereto:

And whereas by the said Act the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were authorised, if satisfied that the revenues of the Dean and Chapter would not suffice to repay the principal of or pay the interest on the aforesaid sum, to make a grant of such portion thereof as should be necessary' for the preservation of the building, provided that the repairs and restorations on which the grant was expended should have been approved by the said Commissioners:And whereas the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have in pursuance of the said Act paid a sum of seven thousand five hundred pounds to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and have agreed to pay a further sum of two thousand five hundred pounds, and the Commissioners are satisfied that the revenues of the Dean and Chapter will not suffice to repay the principal of dr pay the interest on any part of the aforesaid sum of ten thousand pounds, without some diminution of the charges on such revenues or unduly infringing on the annual sum available for the current repairs of Westminster Abbey and the buildings attached thereto, and it is expedient to authorise the Commissioners to make a grant of the whole of the said sum of ten thousand pounds:

And whereas in view of the present insecure condition of Westminster Abbey the said sum of ten thousand pounds is insufficient for the proper restoration and repair of the Abbey and the buildings attached thereto, and it is expedient to make further provision with a view to such restoration and repair:

(2.) In deciding whether a lower charge or difference in treatment does or does not amount to an undue preference, the court having jurisdiction in the matter, or the Commissioners, as the case may be, may, so far as they think reasonable, in addition to any other considerations affecting the case, take into consideration whether such lower charge or difference in treatment is necessary for the purpose of securing in the interests of the public the traffic in respect of which it is made, and whether the inequality cannot be removed without unduly reducing the rates charged to the complainant: Provided that no railway company shall make, nor shall the court, or the Commissioners, sanction any difference in the tolls, rates, or charges made for, or any difference in the treatment of, home and foreign merchandise, in respect of the same or similar services.

SCHEDULE H.

The Letter from Senate of the University of Durham to the Corporation of Sunderland, under date the eighteenth of June nineteen hundred and seven, referred to in section three (4) of this Act.

University of Durham, Gentlemen, June 18th, 1907.

In reference to your application of the 18th ult. for the affiliation of the Sunderland Technical College to the University of Durham, I am desired by Senate to inform you that the Committee appointed to consider

1908.

University of Durham, 1908. Ch. 20, 21.

53

the application, and to inspect the buildings and equipment of the college in connection with it, have reported to Senate, and that Senate has adopted the conclusions of the report, which are in the following terms:—

“ The committee are of opinion that there is ample opportunity for the development of University teaching in Sunderland, and a prospect of it actually taking place in a near future, and that the technical college is well adapted to serve as a nucleus. At present, however, the college is not in a position to undertake the curriculum the University requires in pure science, as it offers no teaching in geology, zoology, or botany. The Committee is of opinion that the college would be competent to undertake the University curriculum in engineering and electrical engineering if the following extension of its present resources could be provided:—

“ A more extensive physical laboratory, more fully provided for the teaching of branches of physics other than electricity.

“A separate lecturer at the head of the department of electrical engineering, who should by preference be a practising electrical engineer.

“ An extension of the laboratory accommodation and appliances for teaching electrical engineering.

“ A more adequate engineering laboratory, provided with the necessary steam machinery.”

I am further desired to inform you that it will give Senate sincere pleasure to hear further from you upon the matter, should you see your way to extend the resources of the college to meet the requirements which the University regards as essential for University teaching in engineering and electrical engineering; or further so to extend the scope of the education carried on in your college as to cover the University curriculum in pure science, or in any of the other branches of applied science recognised by the University as qualifying for degrees.

Faithfully yours,

(Signed) W. K. Hilton,

(Registrar).

involving the imposition of a pecuniary penalty only, in the first instance, or where the statute founded on or conferring jurisdiction authorises procedure in the absence of the accused, the court may, on the motion of the prosecutor and upon proof that the accused has been duly cited, or has received due intimation of the diet where such intimation has been ordered, proceed to hear and dispose of the case in the absence of the accused. Unless the statute founded on authorises conviction in default of appearance, proof of the complaint must be led to the satisfaction of the court. The court in any case to which this subsection applies may, if it shall judge it expedient,

. allow any law agent to appear and plead for and defend the accused, provided the court is satisfied that he has authority from the accused so to do, and may also allow a plea to be tendered for the accused by a person other than a law agent provided the plea is one of guilty, and the court is satisfied that such person has authority to tender such plea:

(3) The court may grant warrant to apprehend the accused:

(4) The court may, on the motion of the prosecutor, forfeit

any bail deposited or found for the appearance of the accused, or, where the accused has been ordered to attend under a penalty, may declare such penalty to be forfeited, and such bail or penalty may, where necessary, be recovered as provided for in section fifty of this Act, and in addition to such forfeiture the court may grant warrant to apprehend the accused.

51. All penalties and expenses imposed under this Act shall be paid to the clerk of court, to be accounted for by him to the person entitled thereto, and it shall not be necessary to specify in any sentence the person entitled to payment of any such penalty or expenses, unless where it is necessary to provide for the division of the penalty.

The signature of the judge or clerk of court to any sentence shall be sufficient also to authenticate the findings on which such sentence proceeds.

55. It shall be competent to correct any error in the minutes of procedure or in the extract of any sentence or order at any time prior to execution thereon, and such correction shall be authenticated by the initials of the clerk of court.

57. In any proceedings in a Court consisting of more than one judge the signature of one judge shall be sufficient in all warrants or other proceedings prior or subsequent to conviction, although the presence and signature of two or more judges may be necessary to conviction of the offence in respect of which such warrants are granted or procedure takes place, and it shall not be necessary that the judge so signing shall be one of the judges trying of dealing with the case otherwise.

58. A conviction of a part or parts only of the charge or charges libelled shall imply dismissal of the rest of the complaint.

59. No judge, clerk of court, or prosecutor in the public interest shall be liable to pay or be found liable by any court in damages for or in respect of any proceeding taken, act done, or judgment, decree, or sentence pronounced under this Act, unless

12. The directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares, provided that no call shall exceed one-fourth of the nominal amount of the share, or be payable at less than one month from the last call; and each member shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen days’ notice specifying the time or times of payment) pay to the company at the time or times so specified the amount called on his shares.

15. The provisions of these regulations as to payment of interest shall apply in the case of nonpayment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the share, or by way of premium, as if the same had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless —

(«) a fee not exceeding two shillings and sixpence is. paid to the company in respect thereof, and

22. Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member shall, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the directors, have the right, either to he registered as a member in respect of the share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such transfer of the share as the deceased or banknipt person could have made; but the directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by the deceased or bankrupt person before the death or bankruptcy.

23. A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of the share, lie entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the company.

Forfeiture of Shares.

24. If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of such call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.

25. The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of nonpayment at or before the time appointed the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

29. A statutory declaration in writing that the declarant is a director of the company, and that a share in the company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and that declaration, and the receipt of the company for the consideration, if any, given for the share on the sale Or disposition thereof

Ch. 69.

Companies (Consolidation), 1908. 8 Edw. 7.

30. The provisions of these regulations as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of nonpayment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the share, or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

Conversion of Shares into Stock.

31. The directors may, with the sanction of the company previously given in general meeting, convert any paid-up shares into stock, and may with the like sanction reconvert any stock into paid-up shares of any denomination.

32. The holders of stock may transfer the same, or any part thereof, in the same manner, and subject to the same regulations, as, and subject to which, the shares from which the stock arose might previously to conversion have been transferred, or as near thereto as circumstances admit; but the directors may from time to time fix the minimum amount of stock transferable, and restrict or forbid the transfer of fractions of that minimum, but the minimum shall not exceed the nominal amount of the shares from which the stock arose.

33. The holders of stock shall, according to the amount of the stock held by them, have the same rights, privileges, and advantages as regards dividends, voting at meetings of the company, and other matters as if they held the shares from which the stock arose, but no such privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profits of the company) shall be conferred by any such aliquot part of stock as would not, if existing in shares, have conferred that privilege or advantage.

34. Such of the regulations of the company (other than those relating to share warrants) as are applicable to paid-up shares shall apply to stock, and the words “share ” and “ shareholder ” therein shall include “ stock ” and “ stock-holder.”

Share Warrants.

35. The company may issue share warrants, and accordingly the directors may in their discretion, with respect to any share which is fully paid up, on application in writing signed by the person registered as holder of the share, and authenticated by such evidence, if any, as the directors may from time to time require as to the identity of the person signing the request, and on receiving the certificate, if any, of the share, and the amount of the stamp duty on the warrant and such fee as the directors may from time to time require, issue under the company’s seal a warrant, duly stamped, stating that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares therein specified, aod may provide by coupons, or otherwise for the payment of dividends, or other moneys, on the shares included in the warrant.

36. A share warrant shall entitle the bearer to the shares included in it, and the shares shall be transferred by the delivery of the share warrant, and the provisions of the regulations of the company with respect to transfer and transmission of shares shall not apply thereto.

711

37.

38. The bearer of a share warrant may at any time deposit the warrant at the office of the company, and so long as the warrant remains so deposited the depositor shall have the same right of signing a requisition for calling a meeting of the company, and of attending and voting and exercising the other privileges of a member at any meeting held after the expiration of two clear days from the time of deposit, as if his name were inserted in the register of members as the holder of the shares included in the deposited warrant. Not more than one person shall be recognised as depositor of the share warrant. The company shall, on two days’ written notice, return the deposited share warrant to the depositor.

39. Subject as herein otherwise expressly provided no person shall, as bearer of a share warrant, sign a requisition for calling a meeting of the company, or attend, or vote, or exercise any other privilege of a member at a meeting of the company, or be entitled to receive any notices from the company; but the bearer of a share warrant shall be entitled in all other respects to the same privileges and advantages as if he were named in the register of members as the holder of the shares included in the warrant, and he shall be a member of the company.

40. The directors may from time to time make rule3 as to the terms on which (if they shall think fit) a new share warrant or coupon may be issued by way of renewal in case of defacement, loss, or destruction.

Alteration of Capital.

41. The directors may, with the sauction of an extraordinary resolution of the company, increase the share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such amount, as the resolution shall prescribe.

42. Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the resolution sanctioning the increase of share capital, all new shares shall, before issue, be offered to such persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the company of general meetings in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled. The offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and, after the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the directors may dispose of the same in such manner as they think most beneficial to the company. The directors may likewise so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which tho new shares bear to shares held by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the directors, be conveniently offered under this article.

43. The new shares shall be subject to the same provisions with reference to the payment of calls, lien, transfer, transmission, forfeiture, and otherwise as the shares in the original share capital.

44. The company may, by special resolution —

(a) Consolidate and divide its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares:

(c) Cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the

resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person:

to, any incident authorised, and consent required, by law.

46. A general meeting shall be held once in every year at such time (not being more than fifteen months after the holding of the last preceding general meeting) and place as may be prescribed by the company in general meeting, or, in default, at such time in the month following that in which the anniversary of the company’s incorporation occurs, and at such place, as the directors shall appoint. In default of a general meeting being so held, a general meeting shall be held in the month next following, and may be convened by any two members in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings are to be convened by the directors.

47. The above-mentioned general meetings shall be called ordinary meetings; all other general meetings shall be called extraordinary.

48. The directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting, and extraordinary general meetings shall also be convened on such requisition, or, in default, may be convened by such requisitionists, as provided by section sixty-six of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908.

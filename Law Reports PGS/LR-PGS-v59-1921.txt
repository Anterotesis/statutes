BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: —

[Rates of unemployment benefit. 10 & 11 Geo. 5. c. 30.]

1. Paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 (in this Act referred to as “the principal Act ”), which provides that unemployment benefit shall, subject as thereinafter provided, be at the weekly rate of fifteen shillings for men and twelve shillings for women or such other weekly rates as may be prescribed, shall have effect as though twenty shillings and sixteen shillings respectively were therein substituted for fifteen shillings and twelve shillings.

[Provisions as to contributions.]

2. — (1) From and after the third day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, the contributions payable under the principal Act in respect of employed persons by those persons and their employers shall be at the rates set out in the First Schedule to this Act instead of at the rates specified in Part I. of the Third Schedule to the principal Act, and the contribution to be made out of moneys provided by Parliament shall, instead of being a contribution

2 Ch. 1. Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921. 11 Geo. 5.

at the rates specified in Part II. of the Third Schedule to the principal Act, be at a rate equal to one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the contributions paid in respect of the employed person by himself and his employer, and subsections (3) and (7) of section five of the principal Act shall have effect accordingly.

(2) For the purpose of determining the amount of unemployment benefit to which, having regard to the proportion of benefit to contributions fixed by paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to the principal Act, any person is entitled at any time after the second day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-two, no account shall be taken of any benefit which may have been received by that person at any time in respect of the period between the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred and twenty, and the third day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-two, and there shall be deemed to have been paid previously to that date in the case of every person who is an insured contributor at that date, twenty-five contributions in addition to the contributions actually paid in respect of him:

Provided that any additional contributions credited under the foregoing provision shall not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether any person satisfies the first statutory condition, or for the purposes of section twenty-five of the principal Act, which provides for the repayment in certain cases of part of the contributions paid by employed persons.

(3) If at any time while the contributions payable by employers and employed persons under the principal Act are payable at the rates fixed by this Act it appears to the Minister that the rates of those contributions are excessive, he may, with the consent of the Treasury by regulations under that Act, reduce those rates by not more than two-pence, but any regulations made under this subsection shall not reduce the rates unequally as between employers and employed persons.

[Amendments as to conditions for receipt of benefit.]

3. — (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, every person who has been engaged at any time in each of not less than twenty separate calendar weeks since the thirty-first day of December, nineteen hundred and nineteen, in any employment which made him, or which would, if the principal Act had been in force throughout the year nineteen

Provided that no person who holds, or has at any time held, a certificate of exemption under section three of the principal Act shall be entitled to benefit under this section.

(2) In the application of the preceding subsection to persons formerly engaged in war service within the meaning of this Act a period of not less than ten separate calendar weeks shall be substituted for a period of not less than twenty separate calendar weeks, and if in any particular case a person who has been engaged in war service satisfies the local employment committee that his failure to be employed for the period required by this section was in consequence of the present war and due to circumstances not within his own control or, in the case of a disabled person within the meaning of this Act, was due to his disablement, that person may, if the local employment committee so recommend, be treated for the purpose of this section as though he had been engaged for the period aforesaid in such employment as aforesaid, although he has not in fact been so engaged.

(3) No person shall be entitled to benefit under this section unless he proves that he is —

(a) Normally in employment such as would make him an employed person within the meaning of the principal Act;

Where a question is referred to a local employment committee under this section, the committee may make it a condition of their recommendation that the case of the claimant shall be reconsidered by the committee on the expiration of any specified period, or that the maximum aggregate period during which the claimant may receive benefit shall be reduced to a period less than the maximum period allowed by this Act.

Local employment committees in the exercise of their powers under this section shall have regard to such directions as the Minister may prescribe for their guidance.

[Period of unemployment benefit.]

4. — (1) Paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule to the principal Act (which provides that no person shall within any insurance year receive unemployment benefit for a period of more than fifteen weeks or such other period as may be prescribed) shall not operate during the special periods, and shall thereafter have effect as though twenty-six weeks were therein substituted for fifteen weeks.

[Treasury advances.]

5. — (I) The Treasury may, out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof, advance any sums required for the purpose of discharging the liabilities of the unemployment fund under the principal Act as amended by this Act:

[Provision for enabling associations to make arrangements under s. 17 of principal Act.]

6. — (1) It shall be lawful for any association to make any such amendments in the instrument governing its constitution as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the association to become an association with which the Minister may make an arrangement under section seventeen of the principal Act or for the purpose of enabling the association to include any class of its members within the scope of such an arrangement, and if the instrument regulating the constitution of the association contains provisions requiring any interval of time to elapse before any action can be taken or any amendment of the instrument can take effect, those provisions shall not apply to action taken for the purpose aforesaid.

(2) The powers by this section conferred on an association may, notwithstanding anything in the instrument governing the constitution of the association, be exercised by the council or other governing body of the association.

(3) In this section the expression “instrument” includes any Act, memorandum, articles of association, trust deed, or rules.

CHAPTER 29.

An Act to declare the lawfulness of certain Articles declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland in matters spiritual prepared with the authority of the General Assembly of the Church.

[28th July 1921.]

WHEBEAS certain articles declaratory of the constitution of the Church of Scotland in matters spiritual have been prepared with the authority of the General Assembly of the Church, with a view to facilitate the union of other Churches with the Church of Scotland, which articles are set out in the Schedule to this Act, and together with any modifications of the said articles or additions thereto made in accordance therewith are hereinafter in this Act referred to as “ the Declaratory Articles ”:

And whereas it is expedient that any doubts as to the lawfulness of the Declaratory Articles should be removed:

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: —

1. The Declaratory Articles are lawful articles* and the constitution of the Church of Scotland in matters spiritual is as therein set forth, and no limitation of the liberty, rights and powers in matters spiritual therein set forth shall be derived from any statute or law affecting the Church of Scotland in matters spiritual at present in force, it being hereby declared that in all questions of construction the Declaratory Articles shall prevail, and that all such statutes and laws shall be construed in conformity therewith and in subordination thereto, and all such statutes and laws in so far as they are inconsistent with the Declaratory Articles are hereby repealed and declared to be of no effect.

2. Nothing contained in this Act or in any other Act affecting the Church of Scotland shall prejudice the recognition of any other Church in Scotland as a Christian

Church of Scotland , 1921.

Church protected by law in the exercise of its spiritual functions.

3. Subject to the recognition of the matters dealt with in the Declaratory Articles as matters spiritual, nothing in this Act contained shall affect or prejudice the jurisdiction of the civil courts in relation to any matter of a civil nature.

4. This Act may be cited as the Church of Scotland Act, 1921, and shall come into operation on such date as His Majesty may fix by Order in Council after the Declaratory Articles shall have been adopted by an Act of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland with the consent of a majority of the Presbyteries of the Church.

SCHEDULE.

Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland in Matters Spiritual.

I. The Church of Scotland is part of the Holy Catholic or Universal Church; worshipping one God, Almighty, all-wise, and all-loving, in the Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the same in substance, equal in power and glory ; adoring the Father, infinite in Majesty, of whom are all things ; confessing our Lord Jesus Christ, the Eternal Son, made very man for our salvation ; glorying in His Cross and Resurrection, and owning obedience to Him as the Head over all things to His Church; trusting in the promised renewal and guidance of the Holy Spirit; proclaiming the forgiveness of sins and acceptance with God through faith in Christ, and the gift of Eternal life; and labouring for the advancement of the Kingdom of God throughout the world. The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation ; receives the Word of God which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as its supreme rule of faith and life; and avows the fundamental doctrines of the Catholic faith founded thereupon.

U. The principal subordinate standard of the Church of Scotland is the Westminster Confession of Faith approved by the General Assembly of 1647, containing the sum and substance of the Faith of the Reformed Church. Its government is Presbyterian, and is exercised through Kirk-sessions,

Jurisdiction of civil courts.

Citations and commencement*

Ch. 29. Church of Scotland , 1921. 11 & 12 Geo. 5.

Presbyteries, Provincial Synods, and General Assemblies. Its system and principles of worship, orders, and discipline are in accordance with “The Directory for the Public Worship of God,” “The Form of Presbyterial Church Government,” and “ The Form of Process,” as these have been or may hereafter be interpreted or modified by Acts of the General Assembly or by consuetude.

III. This Church is in historical continuity with the Church of Scotland which was reformed in 1560, whose liberties were ratified in 1592, and for whose security provision was made in the Treaty of Union of 1707. The continuity and identity of the Church of Scotland are not prejudiced by the adoption of these Articles. As a national Church representative of the Christian Faith of the Scottish people it acknowledges its distinctive call and duty to bring the ordinances of religion to the people in every parish of Scotland through a territorial ministry.

IV. This Church, as part of the Universal Church wherein the Lord Jesus Christ has appointed a government in the hands of Church office-bearers, receives from Him, its Divine King and Head, and from Him alone, the right and power subject to no civil authority to legislate, and to adjudicate finally, in all matters of doctrine, worship, government, and discipline in the Church, including the right to determine all questions concerning membership and office in the Church, the constitution and membership of its Courts, and the mode of election of its office-bearers, and to define the boundaries of the spheres of labour of its ministers and other office-bearers. Recognition by civil authority of the separate and independent government and jurisdiction of this Church in matters spiritual, in whatever manner such recognition be expressed, does not in any way affect the character of this government and jurisdiction as derived from the Divine Head of the Church alone, or give to the civil authority any right of interference with the proceedings or judgments of the Church within the sphere of its spiritual government and jurisdiction.

V. This Church has the inherent right, free from interference by civil authority, but under the safeguards for deliberate action and legislation provided by the Church itself, to frame or adopt its subordinate standards, to declare the sense in which it understands its Confession of Faith, to modify the forms of expression therein, or to formulate other doctrinal statements, and to define the relation thereto of its office-bearers and members, but always in agreement with the Word of God and the fundamental doctrines of the Christian Faith contained in the said Confession, of which agreement the Church shall be sole judge, and with due regard to liberty of opinion in points which do not enter into the substance of the Faith.

Church of Scotland , 1921.

Ch. 29.

VI. This Church acknowledges the divine appointment and authority of the civil magistrate within his own sphere, and maintains its historic testimony to the duty of the nation acting in its corporate capacity to render homage to Qod, to acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ to be King over the nations, to obey His laws, to reverence His ordinances, to honour His Church, and to promote in all appropriate ways the Kingdom of God. The Church and the State owe mutual duties to each other, and acting within their respective spheres may signally promote each other’s welfare. The Church and the State have the right to determine each for itself all questions concerning the extent and the continuance of their mutual relations in the discharge of these duties and the obligations arising therefrom.

VH. The Church of Scotland, believing it tojbe the will of Christ that His disciples should be all one in the Father and in Him, that the world may believe that the Father has sent Him, recognises the obligation to seek and promote union with other Churches in which it finds the Word to be purely preached, the sacraments administered according to Christ’s ordinance, and discipline rightly exercised; and it has the right to unite with any such Church without loss of its identity on terms which this Church finds to be consistent with these Articles.

VIII. The Church has the right to interpret these Articles, and, subject to the safeguards for deliberate action and legislation provided by the Church itself, to modify or add to them; but always consistently with the provisions of the first Article hereof, adherence to which, as interpreted by the Church, is essential to its continuity and corporate life. Any proposal for a modification of or addition to these Articles which may be approved of by the General Assembly shall, before it can be enacted by the Assembly, be transmitted by way of overture to Presbyteries in at least two immediately successive years. If the overture shall receive the approval, with or without suggested amendment, of two-thirds of the whole of the Presbyteries of the Church, the Assembly may revise the overture in the light of any suggestions by Presbyteries, and may transmit the overture when so revised to Presbyteries for their consent. If the overture as transmitted in its final form shall receive the consent of not less than two-thirds of the whole of the Presbyteries of the Church, the General Assembly may, if it deems it expedient, modify or add to these Articles in terms of the said overture. But if the overture as transmitted in its final form shall not receive the requisite consent, the same or a similar proposal shall not be again transmitted for the consent of Presbyteries until an interval of five years after the failure to obtain the requisite consent has been reported to the General Assembly.

Provided that, for the purpose of the foregoing provision, there shall be excluded from stock in hand any stock of which a valuation at a constant price has been accepted by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue for the purposes of duty.

2. For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, the amount of the loss on sales of stock shall be computed by deducting from the cost of the stock, or, if the value of the stock as on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, is less than its cost, from that value, a sum computed in accordance with the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule (in this Part of this Schedule referred to as “ the realised sum ”).

3. Where the quantity of any particular class of trading stock which is in hand on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, is not greater than the quantity of the same class of stock sold during the sales period, the realised sum shall be taken to be the sum realised on sales of stock up to the time at which the quantity of stock of that class sold first reaches the quantity of stock so in hand.

4. Where the quantity of any particular class of trading stock which is in hand on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, exceeds the quantity of the same class of trading stock sold during the sales period, the realised sum shall be taken to be the sum realised on the sales of stock of that class with the addition of an amount equal to the value as on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-three, of a quantity of stock of that class equal to the quantity by which the stock in hand exceeds the quantity of stock of the same class sold.

the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, consists of similar stock in different stages of manufacture and the quantity sold during the sales period is less than the quantity so in hand, the quantity sold shall be deemed to consist of that part of the stock which on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, was completely or most nearly completely manufactured ; and

(b) Where the stock sold has passed through a further

process of manufacture than that undergone by the stock in hand on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, the realised sum shall, for purposes of this Part of this Schedule, be reduced by the cost of the material and labour employed in the further process of manufacture, and the loss to be allowed under paragraph 1 of this Part of this Schedule shall, instead of being the full amount ascertained in accordance with the' provisions of paragraph 2 of this Part of this Schedule, be an amount which bears to that full amount the-same proportion as the amount of the cost or-value, as the case may be, mentioned in the said paragraph 2 bears to the amount of that cost or value increased by the cost of the material and labour aforesaid.

6. For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule where trading stock is sold during the sales period at a price less than its value at the time when the price is determined, the realised sum shall be taken to be the value at that time.

7. A claim under this Part of this Schedule shall not be allowed unless the stock of the trade or business is actually taken on the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-one. 8

8. Where a trade or business has, during the sales period, ceased or changed ownership this Part of this Schedule shall apply as if the date of the cessation or change of ownership were sul)stituted for the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-three.

(2) The value of any article for the purposes of this section shall be taken to be the price which an importer would give for the article if the article were delivered freight and insurance paid in bond at the port of importation in Great Britain or Ireland, or, in the case of importation into the Isle of Man direct from outside Great Britain or Ireland, at the port of importation into the Isle of Man. Duty shall be paid at that value as fixed by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.

Act, 1921.

(3) No duty shall be charged under this section on goods which are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners to have been consigned from and grown, produced or manufactured in the British Empire, and for the purposes of this subsection goods shall be deemed to have been manufactured in the British Empire which would be treated as having been so manufactured for the purposes of section eight of the Einance Act, 1919, (which 9 & 10 Geo. 5. relates to Imperial preference), and that section shall c* 32* apply accordingly.

(4) Where an imported article is a compound article of which an article liable to duty under this section is an ingredient or forms part, no duty shall be charged under this section in respect of the compound article if the compound is of such a nature that the article liable to duty has lost its identity, and any dispute as to whether an article has lost its identity shall be determined in like

262 Ch. 47. Safeguarding of Industries 11 & 12 Geo. 5.

A, 1921.

maimer as disputes as to whether goods are goods specified in the Schedule to this Act.

(5) Eor the purpose of preventing disputes arising as to whether any goods are or are not any goods chargeable with duty under this Part of this Act, the Board may from time to time issue lists defining the articles which are to he taken as falling under any of the general descriptions set out in the said Schedule, and where any list is so issued defining the articles which are to be taken as falling under any such general description, the said Schedule shall have effect as if the articles comprised in the list were therein substituted for that general description.

Act, 1921.

country in relation to which such an order has been made.

(3) Where any such company in granting such an exceptional rate has not distinguished in the quotation for the rate or in the rate book the amounts included therein for such several services as aforesaid —

(a) the rate, in the case of a station-to-station rate, shall be deemed to be composed of conveyance rate and terminal charges in proportion to the

1921.

Railways A, 1921.

amounts included in the corresponding standard rate for the same service and accommodation in respect of similar goods between the same stations; and

(b) in the case of any other rate, the company shall, within fourteen days after application in writing by any person interested in the disintegration of the rate, afford that person information of the amounts (if any) included in the rate for the several services aforesaid.

(4) Any dispute as to the disintegration of any such exceptional rate shall be determined by the rates tribunal at the instance of either a trader or the railway company.

(5) For the purposes of determining any question of an alleged undue or unreasonable preference or advantage, the Railway and Canal Commission shall not have regard to the separate component parts of any rate as shown in the rate book or as determined by this section, but shall, unless in any case in which an application has been made for the purpose it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commission that a consideration of the component parts of the rate would be fair and reasonable, determine the question in reference to the total rate for carriage applicable to the merchandise in respect of which such undue or unreasonable preference or advantage is alleged to arise and the conditions under which the rate applies.

41. — (1) Any amalgamated company or railway company to which a schedule of standard charges has been applied may charge fares below the standard fares in such circumstances as the company may think fit, but the circumstances in which such exceptional fares, if below ordinary fares, may be charged, and the amount of reduction below the standard fare, shall be reported to the Minister within fourteen days, or such longer period as the Minister may allow, after the decision has been arrived at.

(2) If the Minister is of opinion that any company has granted exceptional fares in such a manner as prejudicially to affect any other class of users of the railway, or so as to jeopardise the realisation of the standard revenue of the company, he may refer the matter to the rates tribunal, who may, after giving the parties interested an opportunity of being heard, cancel or modify all or any of the exceptional fares so granted.

(3) If an objection is made to the granting of the rate or fare or to the route, the rates tribunal shall consider whether the granting of the rate or fare is a due and reasonable facility in the interest of the public, and whether, having regard to the circumstances, the route proposed is a reasonable route, and shall allow or refuse the rate or fare accordingly or fix such other rate or fare as may seem to the rates tribunal just and reasonable.

(4) Where upon the application of a railway company or person requiring traffic to be forwarded a through rate or fare is agreed to by the forwarding companies or is made by order of the rates tribunal, the apportionment of such through rate or fare, if not agreed upon between the forwarding companies, shall be determined by the rates tribunal.

(5) If there is no objection except as to the apportionment of the rate or fare, the rate or fare shall come into operation as provided by subsection (2) of this section in the case where no objection has been sent by a forwarding company, but the decision of the rates tribunal as to its apportionment shall be retrospective; in any other case the operation of the rate or fare shall be suspended until the decision is given.

(7) For the purpose of calculating the through rate or fare, the standard charge for each portion of the through route shall be that which would have been applicable to such portion had the conveyance for the entire distance of the through route been upon the railway of the company owning such portion, and as if throughout the through route the mileage had been continuously upon one railway, and shall be calculated on the shortest working distance between the two points over the railways of the forwarding companies:

(a) a sum equal to five per cent, on capital expenditure forming the basis on which interest was allowed at the end of the period during which the constituent companies and subsidiary companies were in the possession of the Government; and

January, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and not included in the expenditure referred to in the last preceding paragraph, unless it can be shown that such expenditure has not enhanced the value of the undertaking; and

(c) such allowance as appears to the rates tribunal to be reasonable in respect of capital expenditure (not being less than twenty-five thousand pounds in the case of any work, and not being capital expenditure included in paragraph (a)), on works which enhance the value of the undertaking, but which had not at the beginning of the year nineteen hundred and thirteen become fully remunerative:

Provided that, in determining the sum which charges will, with efficient and economic working and management, yield, the tribunal shall, with a view to encouraging the taking of early steps for effecting economies in working and management expenses rendered possible by or in anticipation of amalgamation, take into consideration the economies effected by such steps already taken, and shall make such allowance in respect thereof as the tribunal may consider fair and equitable to an amount not exceeding thirty-three and one-third per cent, of such economies.

(2) The tribunal when fixing charges in pursuance of the provisions of this section shall have regard to the means which in their opinion are best calculated to ensure the maximum development and extension in the public interest of the carriage by railway of merchandise and of passengers and their luggage, and shall accordingly ascertain as far as may be practicable the effect which the existing charges, or any of them, have had upon the merchandise or passenger traffic to which they are applicable, and in particular whether the application of such charges has tended or, if continued, would be likely to tend towards causing the increase or diminution of the said traffic.

(3) If on any such review as is mentioned in the next following section it appears to the rates tribunal that the allowance made under paragraph (<?) of subsection (1) of this section was too high or too low, the tribunal may revise the allowance and make such adjustment in the amount of the standard revenue as may be necessary,

Periodical review of standard charges and exceptional rates.

(4) When fixing the charges necessary to produce the standard revenue, the tribunal shall take into consideration the charges in respect of any business carried on by the company ancillary or subsidiary to its railways, the charges for which are not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and if in the opinion of the tribunal the company is not making, or has not taken reasonable steps to enable it to make, adequate charges in respect of any such business, the tribunal shall, in fixing the charges under this Part of this Act, take into account the revenue which would be produced by any such business if adequate charges were in operation.

59. — (1) The rates tribunal shall review the standard charges and exceptional charges of each amalgamated company at the end of the first complete financial year after the appointed day, or, if the appointed day is the first day of January in any year, at the end of that year, and, unless directions are given by the Minister to the contrary in manner hereinafter appearing, at the end of each succeeding year, and the review shall be made on the experience of the operation of those charges for the period during which the standard charges have been in operation, or, if that period is more than three years, then on the experience of the operation of those charges during the preceding three years.

(2) The Minister may direct as respects any year after the second annual review that a review shall not be held, and the directions may extend either to all the amalgamated companies or to any one or more of those companies:

Provided that no such direction shall extend to-any company which has applied to the Minister for a review, or in respect of which the Board of Trade on the application of any representative body of traders have requested that a review shall be held.

(3) If on any such review the rates tribunal find that the net revenue or the average annual net revenue obtained, or which could, with efficient and economic management, have been obtained, by the company during the period on the experience of which the review is based is substantially in excess of the standard revenue of the company, with such allowance (if any) as appears to the tribunal necessary to remunerate adequately any additional capital which may have been raised or provided in respect of expenditure on capital account inourred since, the

1921.

Railways Act, 1921.

Ch. 56.

date upon which the standard charges were fixed in the first instance, the tribunal shall, unless they are of opinion that owing to change in circumstances the excess is not likely to continue, modify all or any of the standard charges and make a corresponding general modification of the exceptional charges of the company so as to effect a reduction of the net revenue of the company in subsequent years to an extent equivalent to eighty per cent of such excess:

Provided that the tribunal in making such modifications as aforesaid as respects one amalgamated company shall, so far as practicable, avoid making such modifications as would be likely to affect prejudicially the financial position of any other railway company.

(4) If on any such review the rates tribunal find that the net revenue or the average annual net revenue obtained by the company during the period on the experience of which the review is based is less than the standard revenue of the company, with such allowance (if any) as appears to the tribunal necessary to remunerate adequately any additional capital which may have been raised or provided in respect of expenditure on capital account incurred since the date upon which the standard charges were fixed in the first instance, and that the deficiency is not due to lack of efficiency or economy in the management, the tribunal shall, unless in their opinion owing to change of circumstances the deficiency is not likely to continue, make such modifications in all or any of the standard charges and such a corresponding general modification of the exceptional charges of the company as they may think necessary to enable the company to earn the standard revenue with such allowance (if any) as aforesaid.

(5) Whenever on any such review such an excess as

aforesaid is found, then, for the purposes of subsequent reviews, subsection (3) of this section shall have effect as if for the standard revenue there were substituted a sum (hereinafter referred to as the “ increased standard equal

to the standard revenue with the addition of twenty per cent, of such excess, and whenever on any such subsequent review an excess is found above the increased

‘ standard together with the allowance (if any) for additional capital, then, for the purpose of subsequent reviews, the increased standard shall be increased by a sum equal to twenty per cent, of such excess, and so on:

Provided that, if at any time after such an excess has been found, the standard charges and exceptional charges are modified in pursuance of subsection (4) of this section on account of a deficiency, no such substitution shall be made until an excess above the standard revenue together with the allowance (if any) for additional capital is again found.

(6) The rates tribunal, when modifying charges on any such review, shall have regard to the like considerations as when fixing charges in the first instance :

Provided that the tribunal shall have regard to the financial results obtained from the operation of any ancillary or subsidiary business carried on by the company, and if satisfied that the net revenue resulting therefrom is, having regard to all the circumstances, unduly low, may, for the purpose of such review, make such deductions from the charges which would otherwise have been fixed as they think proper.

(7) The modifications of standard charges and exceptional charges made in pursuance of this section shall take effect as from the first day of July in the year following the last year under review or such other date as the rates tribunal may fix.

(3) Where at the passing of this Act there is no express agreement as to the amount to be paid for such services, but the siding owner in fact pays station terminals and service terminals or any portion thereof or either of them, the siding owner shall hereafter pay for such services as aforesaid the station terminals and service terminals or such portion of the same as he has heretofore paid:

(4) Where after the passing of this Act a new siding is connected with the railway, or traffic which is not provided for under the foregoing provisions of this section passes to an existing siding, the siding owner shall pay for the aforesaid services the amount of the station and service terminals for the time being in force; provided that the sum thereafter agreed or in default of agreement determined by the rates tribunal to be payable for such services shall be payable from the date of such connection for traffic or of the passing of the traffic as the case may be or for a period of twelve months from the date of application to the tribunal, whichever is shorter:

Provided that nothing contained in this section shall give rise to any presumption as to the value of the aforesaid accommodation and services, and in fixing any sum which the siding owner is to pay the rates tribunal shall have regard only to what sum is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.

ANNEX.

Whereas the United States of America and the French Republic are equally animated by the desire to maintain the Peace of the World so happily restored by the Treaty of Peace, signed at Versailles the 28th day of June 1919, putting an end to the war begun by the aggression of the German Empire and ended by the defeat of that Power; and

Whereas the United States of America and the French Republic are fully persuaded that an unprovoked movement of aggression by

Ch. 34.

93

Germany against France would not only violate both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles, to which the United States of America and the French Republic are parties, thus exposing France anew to the intolerable burdens of an unprovoked war, but that such aggression on the part of Germany would be and is so regarded by the Treaty of Versailles as a hostile act against all the Powers signatory to that Treaty, and as calculated to disturb the peace of the world, by involving inevitably and directly the States of Europe and indirectly, as experience has amply and unfortunately demonstrated, the world at large; and

Whereas the United States of America and the French Republic fear that the stipulations relating to the left bank of the Rhine contained in said Treaty of Versailles may not at first provide adequate security and protection to France on the one hand and the United States of America as one of the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles on the other:

Therefore, the United States of America and the French Republic having decided to conclude a Treaty to effect these necessary purposes, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America, and Robert Lansing, Secretary of State of the United States, specially authorised thereto by the President of the United States, and Georges Clemenceau, President of the Council, Minister of War, and Stephen Pichon, Minister of Foreign Affairs, specially authorised thereto by Raymond Poincare, President of the French Republic, have agreed upon the following Articles:—

Article I.

In case the following stipulations relating to the left bank of the Rhine contained in the Treaty of Peace with Germany signed at Versailles the 28th day of June 1919, by the United States of America, the French Republic and the British Empire among other Powers:

“ Article 42. — -Germany is forbidden to maintain or construct any fortifications either on the left bank of the Rhine or on the right bank to the west of a line drawn 50 kilometres to the east of the Rhine.

“ Article 43. — In the area defined above the maintenance and assembly of armed forces, either permanently or temporarily, and military manoeuvres of any kind, as well as the upkeep of all permanent works for mobilisation, are in the same way forbidden.

“ Article 44. — In case Germany violates in any manner whatever the provisions of Articles 42 and 43, she shall be regarded as committing a hostile act against the Powers signatory of the present Treaty and as calculated to disturb the peace of the world.”

may not at first provide adequate security and protection to France, the United States of America shall be bound to come immediately to her assistance in the event of any unprovoked movement of aggression against her being made by Germany.

Article II.

The present Treaty, in similar terms with the Treaty of even date for the same purpose concluded between Great Britain and the French Republic, a copy of which Treaty is annexed hereto, will only come into force when the latter is ratified.

It will continue in force until, on the application of one of the Parties to it, the Council, acting if need be by a majority, agrees that the League itself affords sufficient protection.

Article IV.

The present Treaty will be submitted to the Senate of the United States at the same time as the Treaty of Versailles is submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. It will be submitted before ratification to the French Chambers of Deputies for approval. The ratifications thereof will be exchanged on the deposit of ratifications of the Treaty of Versailles at Paris, or as soon thereafter as shall be possible.

(3) The special suitability or adaptability of the land for any

purpose shall not be taken into account if that purpose is a purpose to which it could be applied only in pursuance of statutory powers, or for which there is no market apart from the special needs of a particular purchaser or the requirements of any Government Department or any local or public authority: Provided that any bona fide offer for the purchase of the land made before the passing of this Act which may be brought to the notice of the arbitrator shall be taken into consideration:

(4) Where the value of the land is increased by reason of

(5) Where land is, and but for the compulsory acquisition

would continue to be, devoted to a purpose of such a nature that there is no general demand or market for land for that purpose, the compensation may, if the official arbitrator is satisfied that reinstatement in some other place is bona fide intended, be assessed on the basis of the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement:

CHAPTER 80.

An Act to amend the Patents and Designs Acts.

[23rd December 1919.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. For section twenty-seven of the Patents and Designs Act, 1907 (hereinafter referred to as the principal Act), the following section shall be substituted:—

“27. — (1J Any person interested may at any time apply to the comptroller alleging in the case of any patent that there has been an abuse of the monopoly lights thereunder and asking for relief under this section.

(2) The monopoly rights under a patent shall be deemed to have been abused in any of the following circumstances: —

(a) If at any time after the expiration of four years from the date of the patent, the patented invention (being one capable of being worked in the United Kingdom), is not being worked within the United Kingdom on a commercial scale, and no satisfactory reason can be given for such non-working:

1919.

Patents and Designs Act, 1919.

Cii. 80.

Provided that, if an application is presented to the comptroller on this ground, and the comptroller is of opinion that the time which has elapsed since the date of the patent has by reason of the nature of the invention or for any other cause been insufficient to enable the invention to be worked within the United Kingdom on a commercial scale, the comptroller may adjourn the application for such period as will in his opinion be sufficient for that purpose:

(6) If the working of the invention within the United Kingdom on a commercial scale is being prevented or hindered by the importation from abroad of the patented article by the patentee or persons claiming under him, or by persons directly or indirectly purchasing from him, or by other persons against whom the patentee is not taking or has not taken any proceedings for infringement:

(c) If the demand for the patented article in the United

Kingdom is not being met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms:

(d) If, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a

licence or licences upon reasonable terms, the trade or industry of the United Kingdom or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in the United Kingdom, or the establishment of any new trade or industry in the United Kingdom, is prejudiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence or licences should be granted:

(e) If any trade or industry in the United Kingdom, or any

person or class of persons engaged therein, is unfairly prejudiced by the conditions attached by the patentee, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to the purchase, hire, licence, or U6e of the patented article, or to the using or working of the patented process:

Provided that, for the purpose of determining whether there has been any abuse of the monopoly rights under a patent, it shall be taken that patents for new inventions are granted not only to encourage invention but to secure that new inventions shall so far as possible be worked on a commercial scale in the United Kingdom without undue delay.

(3) On being satisfied that a case of abuse of the monopoly rights under a patent has been established, the comptroller may exercise any of the following powers as he may deem expedient in the circumstances:—

(o) He may order the patent to be indorsed with the words ‘ licences of right’and thereupon the same rules shall apply as are provided in this Act in respect of patents so indorsed, and an exercise by the comptroller of this power shall entitle every existing licensee to apply to the comptroller for an order entitling him

to - surrender his licence in exchange for a licence to be settled by the comptroller in like manner as if the — patent had been so indorsed at the request of the

patentee, and the comptroller may make such order;

• and an order that a patent be so indorsed may be made notwithstanding that there may be an agreement subsisting which would have precluded the indorsement of the patent at the request of the patentee:

(b)He may order the grant to the applicant of a licence on such terms as the comptroller may think expedient, including a term precluding the licensee from importing into the United Kingdom any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the patentee or persons claiming under him, would be an infringement of the patent, and in such case the patentee and all licensees for the time being shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against 6uch importation. A licensee under this paragraph shall be entitled to call upon. the patentee to take proceedings to prevent infringement of the patent, and if the patentee refuses, or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the licensee may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as though he were the patentee, making the patentee a defendant. A patentee so added as defendant shall not be liable for any costs unless he enteis an appearance and takes part in the proceedings. Service on him may be effected by leaving the writ at his address for service given on the register:

In settling the terms of a licence under this paragraph the comptroller shall be guided as far as may be by the same considerations as are specified in section twenty-four of this Act for his guidance in settling licences under that section:

(c) If the comptroller is satisfied that the invention is not

being worked on a commercial scale within the United Kingdom, and is such that it cannot be so worked without the expenditure of capital for the raising of wrhich it will be necessary to rely on the patent monopoly, he may, unless the patentee or those claiming under him will undertake to find such capital, order the grant to the applicant, or any other person, or to the applicant and any other person or persons jointly, if able and willing to provide such capital, of an exclusive licence on such terms as the comptroller may think just, but subject as hereinafter provided:

(d) If. the comptroller is satisfied that the objects of this

section cannot be attained by the exercise of any of the foregoing powers, he may order the patent to be

Cf. 80.

* revoked, either forthwith or after such reasonable interval as may be specified in the order, unless in the meantime such conditions as may be prescribed in the order with a view to attaining the objects of this section are fulfilled, and the comptroller may, on reasonable cause shown in any case, by subsequent order extend the interval so specified:

Provided that the comptroller shall make no order for revocation which is at variance with any treaty, convention, arrangement, or engagement with any foreign country or British possession:

(e) If the comptroller is of opinion that the objects of this section will be best attained by making no order under the above provisions of this section, he may make an order refusing the application and dispose of any question as to costs thereon as he thinks just.

(4) In settling the terms of any such exclusive licence as is provided in paragraph (c) of the last preceding subsection, due regard shall be had to the risks undertaken by the licensee in providing the capital and working the invention, but, subject thereto, the licence shall be so framed as —

, *d (a) to secure to the patentee the maximum royalty compatible with the licensee working the invention within the United Kingdom on a commercial scale and at a reasonable profit;

(b) to guarantee to the patentee a minimum yearly sum by way of royalty, if and so far as it is reasonable so to do, having regard to the capital requisite for the proper working of the invention and all the circumstances of the case; and, in addition to any other powers expressed in the licence or order, the licence and the order granting the licence shall be made revocable at the discretion of the comptroller if the licensee fails to expend the amount specified in the licence as being the amount which he is able and willing to provide for the purpose of working the invention on a commercial scale within the United Kingdom, or if he fails so to work the invention within the time specified in the order.

(5) In deciding to whom such an exclusive licence is to be granted the comptroller shall, unless good reason is shown to the contrary, prefer an existing licensee to a person having no registered interest in the patent.

. (6) The order granting an exclusive licence under this section shall operate to take away from the patentee any right which he may have as patentee to work or use the invention and to revoke all existing licences, unless otherwise provided in the order, but on granting an exclusive licence the comptroller may, if he thinks it fair and equitable, make it a condition that the licensee shall give proper compensation to be fixed by the comptroller for any money or labour expended by the

patentee or any existing licensee in developing or exploiting the invention.

(7) Every application presented to the comptroller under this section must set out fully the nature of the applicant’s interest and the facts upon which the applicant bases his case and the relief which he seeks. The application must be accompanied by statutory declarations verifying the applicant’s interest and the facts set out in the application.

(8) The comptroller shall consider the matters alleged in the application and declarations, and, if satisfied that the applicant has a bona fide interest and that a prima facie case for relief has been made out, he shall direct the applicant to serve copies of the application and declarations upon the patentee and upon any other persons appearing from the register to be interested in the patent, and shall advertise the application in the Illustrated Official Journal (Patents).

(9) If the patentee or any person is desirous of opposing the granting of any relief under this section, he shall, within such time as may be prescribed or within such extended time as the comptroller may on application further allow, deliver to the comptroller a counter statement verified by a statutory declaration fully setting out the grounds on which the application is to be opposed.

(10) The comptroller shall consider the counter statement's and declarations in support thereof and may thereupon dismiss the application if satisfied that the allegations in the application have been adequately answered, unless any of the parties demands a hearing or unless the comptroller himself appoints a hearing. In any case the comptroller may require the attendance before him of any'of the declarants to be cross-examined or further examined upon matters relevant to the issues raised in the application and counter statement, and he may, subject to due precautions against disclosure of information to rivals in trade, require the production before him of books and documents relating to the matter in issue.

(11) All orders of the comptroller under this section shall be subject to appeal to the Court, and on any such appeal the law officer or such other counsel as he may appoint shall be entitled to appear and be heard.

(12) In any case where the comptroller does not dismiss an application as hereinbefore provided, and

(a) if the parties interested consent, or

(b) if the proceedings require any prolonged examination of

documents or any scientific or local investigation which cannot in the opinion of the comptroller conveniently be made before him;

the comptroller may at any time order the whole proceedings or any question or issue of fact arising thereunder to be referred to an arbitrator agreed on by the parties, or in default of agreement appointed by the comptroller, and, where the whole

proceedings are so referred, the award of such arbitrator shall, if all the parties consent, be final, but otherwise, shall be subject to the same appeal as the decision of the comptroller under this section, and, where a question or issue of fact is so referred, the -arbitrator shall report his findings to the comptroller.

(13) For the. purposes of this section, the expression patented article’includes articles made by a patented process.”

“24. — (I) At any time after the sealing of a patent the comptroller shall, if the patentee so requests, cause the patent to be indorsed with the words ‘ licences of right, ’ and a corresponding entry to be made in the register, and thereupon —

(a) any person shall at any ti me thereafter be entitled as of right to a licence under the patent upon such terms as, in default of agreement, may be settled by the comptroller on the application of either the patentee or the applicant:

Provided that any licence the terms of which are settled by agreement shall be deemed, unless otherwise expressly provided, to include the terms and conditions specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection as if they had been imposed by the comptroller thereunder in like manner as if the terms had been settled by the comptroller:

(b) in settling the terms of any such licence the comptroller shall be guided by the following considerations —

(i) he shall, on the one hand, endeavour to secure the widest possible user of the invention in the United Kingdom consistent with the patentee deriving a reasonable advantage from his patent rights;

(ii) he shall, on the other hand, endeavour to secure to the patentee the maximum advantage consistent with the invention being worked by the licensee at a reasonable profit in the United Kingdom;

(iii) he shall also endeavour to secure equality of advantage among the several licensees, and for this purpose may, on due cause being shown, reduce the royalties or other payments accruing to the patentee under any licence previously granted:

Provided that, in considering the question of equality of advantage, the comptroller shall take into account any work done or outlay incurred by any previous licensee with a view to testing the commercial value of the invention or to securing the

Provision as to patents indorsed licences of right.”

. working thereof on a commercial scale in the United Kingdom:

(c) any such licence the terms of which are settled by the . comptroller may be so framed as to preclude the licensee from importing into the United Kingdom any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the patentee or those claiming under him, would be an infringement of the patent, and in such a case the patentee and all licensees under the patent shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against such importation:

(d)every such licensee shall be entitled to call upon a patentee to take proceedings to prevent the infringement of the patent, and if the patentee refuses, or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the licensee may institute proceedings for the infringement in his own name as though he were patentee, making the patentee a defendant. A patentee so added as defendant shall not be liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings. Service on him may be effected by leaving the writ at his address for service given on the register:

(c) if*in any action for infringement of a patent so indorsed the infringing defendant is ready and willing to take a licence upon terms to be settled by the comptroller, no injunction against him shall be awarded, and the, amount recoverable against him by way of damages (if any) shall not exceed double the amount which would have been recoverable against him as licensee if the licence had been dated prior to the earliest infringement:

Provided that this paragraph shall not apply where the infringement consists of the importation of infringing goods:

(f)the renewal fees payable by the patentee of a patent so

indorsed shall, as from the date of the indorsement, be one moiety only of the fees which would otherwise have been payable.

(2) The comptroller shall, before acting on any request to indorse a patent made by the patentee under this section, advertise such request in the Illustrated Official Journal (Patents), and shall satisfy himself that the patentee is not precluded contract from making such request, and for that purpose shall require from the patentee such evidence, by statutory declaration or otherwise, as he may deem necessary:

Provided that a patentee shall not be deemed to be so precluded by reason only of his having granted a licence under the patent where the licence does not limit his right to grant other licences.

(3) Any person, alleging that a request under this section has been made contrary to some contract in which he is interested, may apply to the comptroller within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, and the comptroller, if satisfied of the truth of such allegation, shall refuse to indorse the patent pursuant to the request or shall cause the indorsement, if already made, to be cancelled.

Any order under this subsection shall be subject to appeal to the court. '

(4) All indorsements of patents under this section shall be entered on the register of patents and shall be published in the Illustrated Official Journal (Patents), and in such other manner as to the comptroller may seem desirable for the purpose of bringing the invention to the notice of manufacturers.

(5) If at any time it appears that in the case of a patent so indorsed there is no existing licence the comptroller may, if he thinks fit, on the application of the patentee and on payment by him of the unpaid moiety of all renewal fees which have become due since the indorsement, after due notice cancel the indorsement, and in that case the patentees rights and liabilities shall be the same as if no such indorsement had been made.”

Provided that, where part of the area of supply of the local authority is situated in a locality which is not included in an electricity district, the powers of purchasing that part may, if the Electricity Commissioners consent, be exercised by a joint electricity authority within whose district any part of the area of supply is situated.

(2) Where under the Electric Lighting Acts, or under any order made thereunder or under any special or local Act, any right to purchase the whole or any part of the undertaking of any authorised distributors is vested in any local authority (including a county council), the right may, by any order under this Act constituting a joint electricity authority for the district comprising the area of the local authority, be transferred to and vested in the joint electricity authority, subject to the order providing for adequate representation on the joint electricity authority of the local authority from whom the right is transferred, and, on any such right being so transferred, the Order or Act conferring the right shall be construed accordingly, and any question as to the adequacy of such representation shall be determined by the Electricity Commissioners:

Provided that, if the area of the local authority is situate partly in the district of one joint electricity authority and partly in that of another, the right shall be transferable to such one of those joint electricity authorities or divisible between them as the Electricity Commissioners may determine, and where part of such area is situate in a locality which is not included in an electricity district the right of purchasing that part may, if the Electricity Commissioners consent, be transferable to a joint electricity authority within whose district any part of such area is situate.

CHAPTER 101.

An Act to make further provision with respect to the Government of India. [23rd December 1919.]

WHEREAS it is the declared policy of Parliament to provide’for the increasing association of Indians in every branch of Indian administration, and for the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in British India as an integral part of the empire:

And whereas progress in giving effect to this policy can only be achieved by successive stages, and it is expedient that substantial steps in this direction should now be taken:

And whereas the time and manner of each advance can be determined only by Parliament, upon whom responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples:

And whereas the action of Parliament in such matters must be guided by the co-operation received from those on whom new opportunities of service will be conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of responsibility:

And whereas concurrently with the gradual development of self-governing institutions in the Provinces of India it is expedient to give to those Provinces in provincial matters the largest measure of independence of the Government of India, which is compatible with the due discharge by the latter of its own responsibilities:

Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Part I.

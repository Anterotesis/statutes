CHAPTER 1.

An Act to enable Guardians of the Poor to borrow Money for the purpose of procuring Seed Potatoes and Seed Oats, and other Seed for Tenants in Ireland; and for other purposes.

[1st March 1880.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.]

1. This Act may be cited as the Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880.

[Application of Act.]

2. At any time after the passing of this Act, and before the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the Local Government Board, if satisfied that the occupiers of land in any electoral division of any union are generally unable to procure an adequate supply of seed potatoes, seed oats, or other seed, may, by order, authorise or, if they think fit, may require the Guardians of the Poor of the union to put the provisions of this Act in force in reference to such electoral division; and the Local Government Board may from time to time, by order made for that purpose, revoke or vary any such order.

The Local Government Board shall prepare, and may from time to time add to or alter, a schedule of the unions, and of the electoral divisions thereof, in which they have authorised the Guardians to put the provisions of this Act in force.

[Powers of Guardians to borrow.]

3. The Guardians of the Poor of any union scheduled for the time being may apply to the Local Government Board for a loan for the use of any scheduled electoral division of their union. If the Local Government Board approves of any such application they shall transmit it to the Commissioners of Public Works, who may, with the consent of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, make, out of any moneys placed at their disposal by Parliament for the purpose of loans, any loan to such Board of Guardians, on the security of any rate applicable to any of the purposes of the Acts for the Relief of the Poor which is leviable in the electoral division for the use of which the loan is made, and without requiring any further or other security.

[Terms of loan.]

4. Such loans shall be made without interest, and shall be repayable by the Guardians to the Commissioners of Public Works by two equal instalments, the first of such instalments to be paid on the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and the second of such instalments to be paid on the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two.

2 Ch. 1. Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880. 43 Vict.

When any such loan is made all rates leviable for any of the purposes of the Acts for the Relief of the Poor in the electoral division for the use of which the loan was made shall become forthwith charged, without any deed of mortgage or other instrument being required, with the repayment by such instalments of the sum lent for the use of the division.

[Orders for payment of loans may be made by Local Government Board.]

5. If at any time the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland certify that any sum remains due to them from the Board of Guardians of any union on account of any loan made for the use of any electoral division for the purchase of seed, and is then payable to the Commissioners, the Local Government Board shall, by order under their seal, assess that sum on the electoral division, and shall send copies of the order to the Board of Guardians and to the treasurer of the union; and thereupon the treasurer of the union shall, out of any money then in his hands to the credit of the Guardians, or if such money is insufficient for the purpose, then out of all moneys subsequently received by him on account of the Guardians, pay over the amount mentioned in the order to the Commissioners of Public Works. The Guardians of the union shall debit the electoral division with the amount so assessed upon the division.

[Application of loans.]

6. The Guardians may apply the whole or any part of the sum borrowed by them for the use of each electoral division in purchasing seed potatoes, seed oats, or other seed which the Local Government Board may authorise, and in defraying all expenses incurred for carriage, storage, or otherwise in providing such seed for sale. Such seed shall be sold by the Guardians to occupiers of land and cultivators of land (not being occupiers) on the application of the occupier, and on his security, in the electoral divisions, subject to the provisions of this Act.

The Guardians may sell such seed, subject to the following provisions:

1. They may sell to any occupier of land valued at not more than fifteen pounds a quantity of seed potatoes sufficient to sow an acre, and of seed oats or other seed sufficient to sow another acre of land, “ statute measure provided that the total cost of such seed does not exceed five pounds for any one occupier:

2. They may sell to any person who cultivates for his own use any land under a contract made by him with the tenant of the land a quantity of seed potatoes sufficient to sow a quarter of an acre of land statute measure. No such sale shall be made except upon the application of the person who is tenant of the land, and upon his agreeing to pay to the Guardians the price of the seed so sold in the same manner as if the seed had been sold to him:

3. No seed shall be sold to any occupier of land valued at more than fifteen pounds, and no seed shall be sold for less than the net price paid by the guardians for it, including all expenses incurred for carriage, storage, or otherwise in providing such seed for sale:

4. No seed shall be sold to any person unless the Guardians, or such persons as the Local Government Board may nominate in that behalf, are satisfied that the land into which it is to be put has been properly prepared and is ready for sowing:

1880. Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880. Ch. 1. 3

5. If in any case any premises in the occupation of any occupier are not separately valued under the Acts relating to the valuation of rateable property in Ireland, the Guardians may receive such evidence as they think fit as to the annual value of such premises, and such premises shall, for the purpose of this Act, be taken to be of the value which the Guardians shall determine, as if such premises had been separately valued at that amount under the said Acts.

[Recovery of price from purchasers.]

7. Payment of the amount due to the Guardians from each person indebted to the Guardians on account of any purchase of seed, whether made before or after the passing of this Act, shall be made by two equal instalments.

For the purpose of obtaining payment of each such instalment due from each such person the Guardians shall levy such sum, where the person is rated under the Acts for the Relief of the Poor, as part of the poor rate payable by such person, by a special rate to be added to the poor rate assessed on the tenements occupied by such person, and to be collected therewith.

Where such person is not rated under the Acts for the Relief of the Poor the Guardians shall make a special rate for the purposes of this Act, in which he shall be rated.

Every special rate made for the purpose of obtaining payment of money due from each such person shall be recoverable in the same manner and with the same remedies by the collectors of the poor rate as if it were poor rate, and shall be lodged to the credit of the Guardians with the treasurer of the union.

Provided that no person paying any such special rate shall be entitled to make any deduction on account of such payment from any rent which he is liable to pay.

The first of such special rates shall be made by the Guardians at the same time as the first ordinary rate made for the relief of the poor in the union after the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty, and the second of such special rates shall be made by the Guardians at the same time as the first ordinary rate for the relief of the poor made in the union after the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one. The first instalment payable by each person indebted shall be taken to be due on the day on which the first of such special rates is made, and the second instalment shall be taken to be due on the day on which the second of such special rates is made.

Any person indebted to any Board of Guardians on account of any such purchase of seed may pay off his debt, or each instalment of it, at any time before each such special rate is made.

[Power of entry and inspection.]

8. When any seed has been sold under this Act to any person in any union, any of the Guardians of the union, or any person nominated by the Guardians or by the Local Government Board, may atnall reasonable times enter into and examine any land occupied or tilled by such person, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the seed sold to such person has been properly sown by him, and may do all acts reasonably necessary for that purpose. For the purpose of facilitating such examination the Guardians shall keep a list of all the names and addresses of all purchasers of seed, and shall permit such list to be inspected by any person having authority to

4 Ch. 1. Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880. 43 Vict.

make such examination under this Act If any person refuses to a Guardian or other person acting in execution of this Act admission to any land which such Guardian or person is entitled to enter or examine, or obstructs or impedes him in so entering or examining, the person so offending may be prosecuted in a summary manner,

[14 & 15 Vict. c. 93.]

according to the provisions of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, and any Act amending the same, and on conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds.

[Summary recovery of price of seed.]

9. If any person to whom any seed has been sold by any Board of Guardians before or after the passing of this Act does not properly sow such seed, the Guardians of the union may forthwith proceed to recover the price of such seed, whether the amount is more or less than two pounds, before the justices in petty sessions,

[22 Vict. c. 14.]

in the manner prescribed by the Act passed in the session of Parliament held in the twenty-second year of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter fourteen, and any Acts amending it; and the provisions of such Act and Acts shall apply to such proceedings as if the debt sued for was under the value of two pounds.

[Powers of Local Government Board where Guardians make default.]

10. If at any time it appears to the Local Government Board that the Board of Guardians of any union have made default in any respect in the execution of this Act, the Local Government Board may, if they think fit, themselves carry this Act into execution with reference to such union and the several electoral divisions thereof, and shall have for that purpose all the powers vested by this Act in the Board of Guardians of a union scheduled under this Act In such case application for any loan may be made by the Local Government Board directly to the Commissioners of Public Works, and in other respects the Local Government Board shall be in the place and stead of the Board of Guardians so making default

[Saving for other remedies.]

11. Nothing contained in this Act shall be taken to prejudice or affect any proceedings which might have been instituted by the Commissioners of Public Works or by any Board of Guardians for the enforcement of any contract or the recovery of any debt.

12. If at any time before the passing of this Act the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland shall have advanced money to any Board of Guardians for the purchase of seed, the sum so advanced, or any part thereof remaining unpaid from time to time, shall be a charge upon the rates leviable on such electoral division or divisions in the union as the Local Government Board shall appoint; and such sum or part shall be repaid in the same manner as sums lent by the Commissioners of Public Works to Boards of Guardians under the authority of this Act, and the provisions of this Act relative to the repayment of loans made under the authority of this Act shall apply to such loans made before the passing of this Act.

[Confirmation of expenditure by Guardians, and indemnity.]

[38 & 39 Vict. c. 49.]

This Act shall be construed as one with the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement (Scotland) Act, 1875, (in this Act referred to as the principal Act,) and the principal Act and this Act may be cited together as the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement (Scotland) Acts, 1875 and 1880.

[Amendment of schedule to principal Act.]

[As to assessment of compensation.]

If at any time the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland certify that any sum remains due to them from the Board of Guardians of any union on account of any loan or advance made under this Act, or on the faith of any such resolution, and is then payable to the Commissioners, the Local Government Board shall by order under their seal assess that sum on such of the several electoral divisions in the union as they think proper, and shall send copies of the order to the Board of Guardians and to the treasurer of the union; and thereupon the treasurer of the union shall, out of any money then in his hands to the credit of the guardians, or if such money is insufficient for the purpose then out of all moneys subsequently received by him on account of the guardians, pay over the amount mentioned in the order to the Commissioners of Public Works. The guardians of the union shall debit the several electoral divisions with such proportions of that sum as the said order of the Local Government Board shall have assessed upon such electoral divisions respectively.

8. If at any time before the passing of this Act any outlay shall have been made by any Board of Guardians for the purpose of providing out-door relief in food or fuel, such outlay, and all resolutions and proceedings of the board and of their officers in relation thereto, shall be ratified and confirmed and be as valid and effectual as if the outlay had been made and the resolutions and proceedings had been

passed and taken under the authority and in compliance with the provisions of this Act: And all persons who have acted in any manner in making any such outlay or otherwise in providing such relief shall be released and indemnified from and against any penalties, and from and against all legal claims or proceedings in consequence thereof

9. Whereas under the provisions of the Land Improvement Acts, Validation of and under the provisions of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, loans, and the Public Health (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1879, the Com- 41 & 42 Vict. missioners of Public Works in Ireland are empowered to lend vict money to owners of land and to sanitary authorities, but subject Ci 57. to the conditions prescribed by the above-mentioned Acts:

And whereas by reason of the want of employment for the labouring classes, and the consequent distress in certain districts in Ireland, it became desirable to extend without delay the facilities and advantages in obtaining loans under the said Acts, and to dispense with some of the conditions prescribed by the said Acts:

And thereupon, for the purpose above stated, and with a view to enable owners of land and sanitary authorities to afford immediate employment to the labouring classes in such distressed districts, the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, on the application of His Grace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, authorised the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland to lend to owners of land and sanitary authorities in such districts sums of money for some of the purposes of the said Acts, but upon terms more favourable to the borrowers than the terms prescribed by the said Acts:

And in pursuance of such authority the Commissioners of Public Works, by public notice dated the twenty-second day of November one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, and by a subsequent public notice dated the twelfth day of January one thousand eight hundred and eighty, amending the former notice and extending to all loans which had been applied for and obtained under the conditions of the said former notice, announced that they were authorised to make loans to owners of land and to sanitary authorities in certain districts under the said Acts, but upon the terms set forth in such notices, for the purposes therein specified:

And whereas a number of loans have been applied for by owners of land and sanitary authorities, and have been made to them by the Commissioners of Public Works, in accordance with thfc said public notices and upon the terms set forth therein, and it is necessary and expedient that all such loans, and the several proceedings taken or which shall be taken in reference to them, should be ratified and confirmed upon the terms set forth in such notices.

Therefore, all loans made by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, in compliance with applications made under either of their public notices of the twenty-second day of November and the twelfth day of January last, and all advances of money made or hereafter to be made by the Commissioners on account of any such loan, and all contracts, express or implied by law, entered into between the Commissioners and any person or sanitary authority respecting any such loan, or any interest thereon, and all securities for the repayment of any such loan or interest, and all things done or to be done in the making or repaying of such loan, shall be

ratified and confirmed and be as valid and effectual as if the terras set forth in the second of the said notices had been enacted in the said Acts as the terms upon which any such loan might be made, and as if such loan had been made in other respects in strict accordance with the provisions of such Acts applicable to such loan; and it is hereby declared that the provisions of the second of the two notices aforesaid shall extend to loans applied for and obtained under the conditions of the notice dated the twenty-second of November; and in the case of any loan which would have been charged upon any special land or rate if made in strict accordance with the provisions of such Acts applicable to such loan, or with reference to which loan any of such Acts creates any legal right or liability, such land or rate shall be charged and such legal right or liability shall be created, as fully as if such loan were made in strict accordance with the provisions of such Acts applicable to such loan: Provided always, that in any award for increase of rent to be made by the Commissioners of Public Works, Ireland, under the said Land Improvement Acts, the increase, if any, so awarded shall not exceed the yearly rentcharge payable by the owner for such loan.

10. And whereas further measures for the relief of some of such distressed districts became necessary, and the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury accordingly authorised the Commissioners of Public Works to advance by way of loan, certain sums to be expended in such works as should be presented by extraordinary presentment sessions of certain baronies, which the Lord Lieutenant announced that he would convene, on the application of the guardians of the poor of unions situate either wholly or in part in those baronies, when such application was supported by the report of the Local Government Board; and for other purposes:

And whereas, on such applications being made, the Lord Lieutenant directed extraordinary meetings of the baronial presentment sessions to be convened in certain baronies in Ireland, and issued certain instructions to the justices and the associated cess-payers assembled at such presentment sessions as to the works which they might present, and their proceedings in relation thereto, and as to the approval by the Commissioners of Public Works of such presentments, and the terms upon which loans would be made for such works by the Commissioners of Public Works, and as to other mattes: .

And whereas extraordinary meetings of the presentment sessions were held in some of such baronies, and the justices and associated cess-payers have made presentments for works in accordance with such instructions, and such presentments have been approved by the Commissioners of Public Works, and loans have been made for such works on the terms contained in such instructions:

And whereas it is necessary and expedient that all presentments made at any such presentment sessions before or after the passing of this Act which have been or shall be approved by the Commissioners of Public Works, and all loans and advances which have been made or shall be made thereon, and the several proceedings taken, or which shall be taken thereunder, should be ratified and confirmed, and that such loans should be repaid as is provided by this Act:

1880. Relief of Distress (Ireland), 1880. Ch. 4. 13

Therefore all presentments made or to be made at any such extraordinary presentment sessions in accordance with such instructions, and which have been or shall be approved by the Commissioners of Public Works, and all works consequent upon such presentments, and all advances of public money made or to be made, and all things done or to be done in execution of such presentments, shall be ratified and confirmed as if the same had been presented, made, and done strictly in accordance with the statutes under which such works may be presented for.

11. At any time after the passing of this Act, and before the Future meet-thirty-first day of December one thousand eight hundred and eighty, ing* of baronial the Lord Lieutenant may from time to time, if he thinks fit, con- 8e8S10ns-vene extraordinary presentment sessions for any barony, and may

issue instructions to the justices and the associated cess-payers assembled at such sessions, to which instructions they shall conform.

The Lord Lieutenant may from time to time, if he think fit, revoke, vary, or add to the instructions issued before the passing of this Act, or which may be issued by him to the justices, and associated cess-payers constituting any extraordinary presentment sessions, but in so far as such instructions relate to any loan or advance of money only with the consent of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury. All presentments made by such sessions, in accordance with the instructions from time to time in force, shall be as valid and effectual as if they had been duly presented by the grand jury, and fiated by the court at any assizes or presenting term.

The Commissioners of Public Works may, with the consent of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, make loans or advances for the purposes of carrying into effect the presentments of any extraordinary presentment sessions convened under the authority of this Act, and for the other purposes mentioned in the instructions issued by the Lord Lieutenant, upon the terms hereinafter stated.

All instructions issued by the Lord Lieutenant to the justices and associated cess-payers of any extraordinary presentment sessions shall be laid before Parliament within one month after they have been issued, if Parliament is then sitting, and if not, then within one month after the next meeting of Parliament.

12. The several persons entitled from time to time to attend as Permanence of justices and as associated cess-payers respectively at the extraor- Jj£“8io^tion 01 dinary presentment sessions in any barony, in accordance with the instructions issued by the Lord Lieutenant, and the persons appointed

to serve on any Standing Committee of any such sessions, shall, notwithstanding that they may have ceased to be entitled to attend at the ordinary presentment sessions of the barony, continue to be exclusively entitled to constitute the extraordinary presentment sessions for a period of six months after the first meeting of the extraordinary presentment sessions at which they were respectively entitled to attend, or for such other period as the Lord Lieutenant by order, to be published in the Dublin Gazette, may appoint.

13. The moneys advanced from time to time by the Commissioners Repayment of of Public Works for the purpose of the presentments of any ex- advances* traordinary presentment sessions shall be charged upon the several

baronies for the use of which they were advanced. The moneys paid from time to time by the Commissioners of Public Works to the secretary of the grand jury of any county, or to any county surveyor, for expenses incurred by such secretary or surveyor, shall be charged upon the county at large. All such sums shall be repaid, with interest at the rate of one per centum per annum commencing from the expiration of two years after the making of the loan, by grand jury presentments, by thirty half-yearly instalments, the first of such instalments to be presented at the assizes next preceding the expiration of the said period of two years; and the Commissioners of Public Works shall, before each assizes, make out a certificate for each county in which such extraordinary presentment sessions have been held, specifying the amount properly chargeable upon each barony in the county or upon the county at large. Every such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of all facts and circumstances necessary to authorise the making of it. The Commissioners of Public Works shall transmit the certificate to the secretary of the grand jury, to be laid before the grand jury, and thereupon the grand jury shall, without any previous application to presentment sessions, make a presentment for the amount specified in such certificate as payable by each barony, or by the county at large, or, in default of such presentment, the amount shall be raised by an order of the judge of assize, which order shall have the force of a presentment. The amounts raised under such presentments shall be paid to the Commissioners of Public Works in such manner as the Commissioners of the Treasury may from time to time direct.

Any person receiving rent in respect of any premises liable to such payment under grand jury presentment, who also pays a rent in respect of the same, shall be entitled to deduct from the rent so paid by him a sum bearing such a proportion to the amount of the sum deducted from the rent received by him as the rent paid by him bears to the rent received by him.

Provided always, whenever the net annual value of the whole of the rateable hereditaments occupied by any person having no greater estate or interest therein than a tenancy from year to year, or holding under any lease or other contract of tenancy, shall not exceed four pounds, the cess payable in respect of such hereditaments under any presentment pursuant to this Act shall be applotted on the immediate lessor of such person; and, if at the time of applotting any such cess the name of such immediate lessor shall not be accurately known to the person applotting the cess, it shall be sufficient to describe him as “the immediate lessor, ” with or

In the baronies chargeable under this Act receipts for grand jury cess shall be given by the collectors, distinguishing the amount paid under presentments pursuant to this Act from the rest of the cess payable for the half year.

15. The Commissioners of Public Works may pay to the secretary Remuneration of the grand jury of any county, and to the county surveyor, such for county sums as they consider to have been properly and necessarily ex- officer8* pended by such secretary or surveyor in publishing notices or advertisements, or in attendance at such presentment sessions, or otherwise in relation to such presentment sessions, and for the remuneration of such clerks or assistants as the Commissioners may sanction. The sums so paid by the Commissioners, and any sums paid by them before the passing of this Act to any such secretary or county surveyor for such purposes, shall be repaid to the Commissioners by grand jury presentment in the manner provided by this Act.

The grand jury shall present to every collector remuneration for the collection of all assessments made for the purposes mentioned in this Act, at the same rate as they present to him for collecting grand jury cess; and the grand jury may, if they think fit, also present to the secretary of the grand jury, and the county surveyor, and his assistants, and to the treasurer of any county who was in office as such treasurer prior to the passing of the Act of the session so & 81 Vict. of Parliament held in the thirtieth and thirty-first years of the 46, reign of Her present Majesty, chapter forty-six, such reasonable sum, to be levied off the county at large, as remuneration for the trouble incurred by each such person in respect to such presentment sessions, as, having regard to the other duties of such person and the rate at which he is remunerated for them, the grand jury thinks fit.

All such owners and occupiers shall be entitled to traverse for damages.

Any advance made by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt to the Commissioners of Church Temporalities for the purposes of this Act, shall be charged upon the property accruing to and shall be payable by the Commissioners of Church Temporalities under the said Irish Church Act, 1869, as if it were part of the debt already owing by the Commissioners of Church Temporalities to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, and shall be paid to the latter in priority of all debts due from the said Church Temporalities Commissioners under any statutes except the said Irish Church Act, 1869.

19. The amounts presented from time to time by grand juries, and the amounts paid from time to time by sanitary authorities and owners of land, in repayment of loans made by the Commissioners of Public Works, shall be paid by the Commissioners of Public Works, subject to such directions as the Commissioners of the Treasury may give from time to time, to the Commissioners of Church Temporalities.

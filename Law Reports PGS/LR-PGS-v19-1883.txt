5. Whereas by section eighty of the Army Act, 1881, provision is made with respect to the recording of the answers of a recruit in an attestation paper to the questions put to him, and with respect to the signing and attesting of the attestation paper, and doubts have arisen with respect to the application of the said section to duplicates of such paper if duplicates are required by the regulations of a Secretary of State under Part II. of the said Act, and it is expedient to remove such doubts: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

There shall be added to section eighty of the Army Act, 1881, after the sixth subsection the following enactment:

(7.) Where the regulations of a Secretary of State under this part of this Act require duplicate attestation papers to be signed and attested, this section shall apply to both such duplicates, and in the event of any amendment of an attestation paper the amendment shall be made in both of the duplicate attestation papers.

6. Whereas by the second subsection of section ninety-four of the Army Act, 1881, it is enacted that an officer while subject to military law shall not act as a justice of the peace for the purpose of the attestation of soldiers:

And whereas militiamen can be attested before any officer as well as before a justice of the peace, and it is expedient to make provision for the attestation of soldiers before officers: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

In section ninety-four of the Army Act, 1881, the words “an “ officer in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, if authorised in that “ behalf under the regulations of a Secretary of State also, ” shall be inserted before the words “every person exercising the office of a magistrate ” in the first subsection; and the second subsection shall be omitted.

Whereas under section one hundred and forty-five of the Army Act, 1881, it is provided that in the case either (a) of an order or decree made for payment by a soldier either of the cost of the maintenance of his wife or child, or of any bastard child, or of the cost of any relief given to his wife or child, by way of loan, being sent to a Secretary of State, or (b) of it appearing to the satisfaction of a Secretary of State that a soldier has deserted or left in destitute circumstances, without reasonable cause, his wife or any of his legitimate children under fourteen years of age, the Secretary of State may order a sum therein mentioned to be deducted from the daily pay of such soldier, and to be appropriated in the first case in liquidation of the sum adjudged to be paid by such order or decree, and in the second case towards the maintenance of such wife or children:

In section one hundred and forty-five of the Army Act, 1881, the words “Secretary of State shall order ” shall be substituted for the words “Secretary of State may order ” in the second subsection.

9. Whereas in section one hundred and seventy-five of the Army Act, 1881, which declares what persons shall be subject to military law as officers, the first subsection is as follows:

(1.) "Officers of the regular forces on full pay, and if not otherwise subject to military law, officers of the staff of the army, and officers employed on military service under the orders of an officer of the regular forces: ”

And whereas, having regard to the terms of the Royal "Warrant regulating the pay and promotion of the army, doubts have arisen with respect to the construction of the above enactment, and it is expedient to remove such doubts: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

In section one hundred and seventy-five of the Army Act, 1881, the words “officers of the regular forces on the active list, within “ the meaning of any Royal Warrant for regulating the pay and “ promotion of the regular forces, and officers not on such active “ list who are employed on military service under the orders of an “ officer of the regular forces, who is subject to military law ” shall be substituted for the first subsection (above recited).

10. Whereas by section one hundred and eighty-two of the Army Act, 1881, power is given to a court-martial to sentence a warrant officer to be suspended from rank, pay, and allowances, or any of them, and injustice may arise if a warrant officer is sentenced to a suspension in any one of such cases, and not in all of them, and it is expedient to prevent the same:

And whereas by the same section power is given to a court-martial to sentence a warrant officer to be transferred to a corps in the same arm or branch of the service, and in the same regimental rank as that in which he served immediately before his transfer to be warrant officer, and such power is unnecessary, as the power to order such transfer is by section eighty-three of the same Act vested in the competent military authority: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

In section one hundred and eighty-two of the Army Act, 1881, the words “or any of them ” shall be omitted after the words “rank and pay and allowances ” in the second subsection.

An Act to make provision respecting certain Municipal Corporations and other Local Authorities not subject to the Municipal Corporation Act.

[29th June 1883.]

WHEREAS Commissioners were appointed by His late Majesty King William the Fourth (in this Act referred to as the Commissioners of 1834) to inquire into Municipal Corporations in England and Wales, and made reports respecting divers corporations, including most of those mentioned in the schedules to this Act:

And whereas the Municipal Corporation Acts consolidated and repealed by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, were passed and applied to most of the places mentioned in the above report, but not to those which are mentioned in the schedules to this Act:

And whereas Commissioners were appointed by Her Majesty to inquire into Municipal Corporations not subject to the Municipal Corporation Acts (in this Act referred to as the Commissioners of 1876), and have made reports to Her Majesty respecting the places mentioned in the schedules to this Act, and it is expedient to make the provisions herein-after appearing respecting those places:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.] 1. This Act may be cited as the Municipal Corporations Act, 1883.

(1.) All civil, criminal, and Admiralty jurisdiction of any corporate officer, court, or judge of the said place appointed or holding office under any charter, grant, or prescription shall cease, whether such jurisdiction is conferred by such charter, grant, or prescription, or by any Act, and the place shall be subject to the same jurisdiction as the part of the county in which it is situate or to which it adjoins, and if it adjoins more than one county or part of a county, then as the county or part with which it has the longest common boundary:

(2.) All exclusive rights of trading, local exemptions from juries, and other local franchises, privileges, and exemptions existing under any charter or grant or prescription shall cease.

1883. Municipal Corporations, 1883. Ch. 18.

3. On and after the twenty-fifth day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, or such later day, not after the twenty-ninth day of September one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, as Her Majesty in Council may, in the case of any place or places, appoint, the following provisions shall (subject to the savings for vested interests and other provisions contained in this Act) apply to each of the places mentioned in the schedules to this Act to which Her Majesty may not be pleased before the said day to grant a new charter; that is to say,

(a.) The place shall not be a corporate town or borough, and any municipal or other corporation thereof existing under any charter or grant or prescription shall be dissolved:

(b.) All property of any corporation in the place which is dissolved by this Act, or of any person as member or officer thereof, or of any court or judge whose jurisdiction is abolished by this Act, shall be applied for the public benefit of the inhabitants of the place in such manner as may be for the time being provided by a scheme of the Charity Commissioners, or, in a case where a scheme is made by the Local Government Board, by that scheme, and shall vest in such persons or body corporate as may be specified in such scheme.

(2.) Provided that until any such scheme takes effect the said property shall continue to be held, managed, and enjoyed as heretofore in like manner as if a scheme of the Charity Commissioners, in pursuance of this Act, had provided for such holding, management, and enjoyment, and for that purpose the persons managing the property shall continue in like manner as if they were a body constituted by the scheme for the administration of such property, but the legal estate in the property shall vest in the official trustees.

4. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the application to any place of any charter applying the Municipal Corporation Acts which Her Majesty may be pleased to grant, or affect anything done in pursuance of those Acts or any scheme thereunder, and shall not affect the operation of any such charter, thing, or scheme; save that nothing in the said Acts or scheme shall authorise the establishment or continuance of any court for the trial of civil actions.

(2.) Nothing in this Act shall affect the right to the benefit of any charity, or shall alter or confer any power of altering the defined charitable purposes (if any) to which any property is by law applicable at the passing of this Act.

5. Whereas the Commissioners of 1876 reported that the places mentioned in the first part of the First Schedule to this Act might be dealt with by being subjected to the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, and the Acts amending the same, as if they were mentioned in Schedule B. of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, the Privy Council shall cause an inquiry to be made into the expediency of advising Her Majesty to grant a charter extending the Municipal Corporation Acts to the several places mentioned in the first part of the First Schedule to this Act, and also whether

Ch. 18. Municipal Corporations Act, 1883. 46 & 47 Vict.

it is expedient that any adjoining district not included in the existing corporations shall be included in the places to which such charters may be granted, and shall report to Her Majesty thereon.

(2.) The expenses of such inquiry shall be regulated by the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, and paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.

(3.) Nothing in this section shall require an inquiry to be held with respect to any place with respect to which a similar inquiry has been held since the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine.

6. The Privy Council, upon being satisfied by any applicants after inquiry that it is expedient for the public so to do, may, by order, provide for retaining any court leet or other court or any officer, whether as returning officer for the return of members to serve in Parliament, or as town clerk for the purpose of the registration of parliamentary voters, or otherwise, and for the appointment of any officer so retained, subject in every case to such exceptions, restrictions, and modifications as seem expedient.

(2.) Subject to the provisions of any Order of the Privy Council, any person who at the passing of this Act holds an office by virtue of which he is such returning officer or town clerk as aforesaid may during the time limited for the tenure of his office continue to perform the duties of such returning officer or town clerk as aforesaid, and on the expiration of such time, dr his otherwise ceasing to perform the duties, the said duties shall, so far as regards the returning officer, be performed in manner provided by the Act of the session of the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter fifty-seven, intituled “ An Act to “ amend the law relating to the appointment of returning officers “ in certain cases, ” and so far as regards the town clerk shall be performed by the person in the parliamentary borough who is town clerk within the meaning of section one hundred and one of the Parliamentary Registration Act, 1843.

7. Whereas there are local boards or improvement commissioners in some of the places mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act, and the Commissioners of 1876 reported that it might be expedient to establish local boards in other of such places: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) Where any part of any of the places mentioned in any of the schedules to this Act is comprised in the district of any local board or improvement commissioners, whether established before or after the passing of this Act, and Her Majesty is not pleased to grant a charter to such place, the Local Government Board, after such local inquiry as they think expedient, may, at any time before any corporation in the said place becomes abolished by this Act, make such scheme as might be made by the Committee of Council under part eleven of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882:

(2.) Sections two hundred and thirteen and two hundred and fourteen of and the Seventh Schedule to that Act shall, so far as is consistent with the tenour thereof, apply accordingly as if they were herein re-enacted, with the substitution of the Local Government Board for the Committee of Council,

41

1883. Municipal Corporations, 1883. Ch. 18.

and of the said district for borough, and with a limitation to the purposes of this section:

(3.) A scheme may be made as aforesaid for the purpose of amending any previous scheme under this section:

(4.) Sections two hundred and ninety-four, two hundred and ninety-five, and two hundred and ninety-six of the Public Health Act, 1875, shall, so far as is consistent with the tenour thereof, apply to any local inquiry held by order of the Local Government Board for the purposes of this section.

8. (1.) The Charity Commissioners may provide, by the appointment of interim trustees and otherwise, for the security and proper management and application of the property, for the application of which such Commissioners have, or may in certain events have, power under this Act to make a scheme.

(2.) If any such property has after the first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, and before the date at which a charter or a scheme under this Act, or the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as the case may be, takes effect, been alienated by way of sale, mortgage, grant, lease, charge, or otherwise, and such alienation has not been made in pursuance of some covenant, contract, or agreement bon& fide made or entered into on or before the said first day of March, or of some resolution duly entered in the Corporation books of the Corporation on or before the said first day of March, or in pursuance of any right saved by this Act, and such alienation has been made collusively and for no consideration, or for insufficient consideration, such alienation may be set aside in the like proceedings (instituted with the consent of the Charity Commissioners or of the Attorney-General) and in like manner as a lease of land of a charity granted without due consideration may be set aside: Provided that if a charter is granted or a scheme made whereby the property is affected, the said proceedings shall be commenced within one year after the charter or scheme takes effect.

(3.) Anything authorised by this Act to be done by the Charity Commissioners may be done by an order of those Commissioners, which may be made in like manner as if the property were the endowment of a charity and application had been made as provided by the Charitable Trusts Acts, 1853 to 1869; and an order of the Charity Commissioners may be made at any time after the passing of this Act, so, however, that the order shall not take effect until such date as the Charity Commissioners fix as being, in their opinion, under the circumstances of the case, most consistent with the purposes of this Act.

They [the same authority] shall restore the articles to the owners thereof or to their representatives, as soon as such articles are claimed and the interests of the salvors have been properly guaranteed.

1883.

Sea Fisheries Act, 1883. Cu. 22. 75

The administrative or judicial authorities, according as the laws of the different countries may provide, shall fix the amount which the owners shall pay to the salvors.

It is, however, agreed that this provision shall not in any way prejudice such conventions respecting this matter as are already in force, and that the high contracting parties reserve the right of regulating, by special arrangements between themselves, the amount of salvage at a fixed rate per net salved.

Fishing implements of any kind found unmarked shall be treated as wreck.

Article XXVI.

The superintendence of the fisheries shall be exercised by vessels belonging to the national navies of the high contracting parties. In the case of Belgium, such vessels may be vessels belonging to the State, commanded by captains who hold commissions.

Article XXVII.

The execution of the regulations respecting the document establishing nationality, the marking and numbering of boats, &c., and of fishing implements, as well as the presence on board of instruments which are forbidden (Articles VI., VII., VIII., IX., X., XI., XII., XIII., and XXIII., § 2), is placed under the exclusive superintendence of the cruizers of the nation of each fishing boat.

Nevertheless, the commanders of cruizers shall acquaint each other with any infractions of the above-mentioned regulations committed by the fishermen of another nation.

* Article XXVIII.

The cruizers of all the high contracting parties shall be competent to authenticate all infractions of the regulations prescribed by the present convention, other than those referred to in Article XXVII., and all offences relating to fishing operations, whichever may be the nation to which the fishermen guilty of such infractions may belong.

Article XXIX.

When the commanders of cruizers have reason to believe that an infraction of the provisions of the present convention has been committed, they.may require the master of the boat inculpated to exhibit the official document establishing her nationality. The fact of such document having been exhibited shall then be endorsed upon it immediately.

The commanders of cruizers shall not pursue further their visit or search on board a fishing boat which is not of their own nationality, unless it should be necessary for the purpose of obtaining proof of an offence or of a contravention of regulations respecting the police of the fisheries.

Article XXX.

The commanders of the cruizers of the Signatory Powers shall exercise their judgment as to the gravity of facts brought to their knowledge, and of which they are empowered to take cognizance, and shall verify the damage, from whatever cause arising, which may be sustained by fishing boats of the nationalities of the high contracting parties.

They shall draw up, if there is occasion for it, a formal statement of the verification of the facts as elicited both from the declarations of the parties interested and from the testimony of those present.

The commander of the cruizer may, if the case appears to him sufficiently serious to justify the step, take the offending boat into a port of the nation to which the fishermen belong. He may even take on board the cruizer a part of the crew of the fishing boat in order to hand them over to the authorities of her nation.

Article XXXI.

The formal statement referred to in the preceding Article shall be drawn up in the language of the commander of the cruizer, and according to the forms in use in his country.

The accused and the witnesses shall be entitled to add, or to have added, to such statement, in their own language, any observations or evidence which they may think suitable. Such declarations must be duly signed.

Article XXXII.

Resistance to the directions of commanders of cruizers charged with the police of the fisheries, or of those who act under their orders, shall, without taking into account the nationality of the cruizer, be considered as resistance to the authority of the nation of the fishing boat.

Article XXXIII.

When the act alleged is not of a serious character, but has nevertheless caused damage to any fisherman, the commanders of cruizers shall be at liberty, should the parties concerned agree to it, to arbitrate at sea between them, and to fix the compensation to be paid.

Where one of the parties is not in a position to settle the matter at once, the commanders shall cause the parties concerned to sign in duplicate a formal document specifying the compensation to be paid.

One copy of this document shall remain on board the cruizer, and the other shall be handed to the master of the boat to which the compensation is due, in order that he may, if necessary, be able to make use of it before the Courts of the country to which the debtor belongs.

Where, on the contrary, the parties do not consent to arbitration, the commanders shall act in accordance with the provisions of Article XXX.

Article XXXIV.

The prosecutions for offences against, or contraventions of, the present convention shall be instituted by, or in the name of, the State.

The convention shall continue in operation for five years from the above day; and, unless one of the high contracting parties shall, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of five years, give notice of intention to terminate its operation, shall continue in force one year longer, and so on from year to year. If, however, one of the Signatory Powers should give notice to terminate the convention, the same shall be maintained between the other contracting parties, unless they give a similar notice.

A colonial register shall, as regards the particulars entered therein, be deemed to be a part of the company’s register of members, and shall be primal facie evidence of all particulars entered therein. Any such register shall be kept in the manner provided by the Companies Acts, 1862 to 1880, with this qualification, that the advertisement mentioned in section thirty-three of the Companies Act, 1862, shall be inserted in some newspaper circulating in the district wherein the register to be closed is kept, and that any competent court in the colony where such register is kept shall be entitled to exercise the same jurisdiction of rectifying the same as is by section thirty-five of the Companies Act, 1862, vested, as respects a register, in England and Ireland in Her Majesty’s superior courts of law or equity, and that all offences under section thirty-two of the Companies Act, 1862, may, as regards a colonial register,

(5.) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the duplicate register, the shares registered in a colonial register shall be distinguished from the shares registered in the principal register, and no transaction with respect to any shares registered in a colonial register shall, during the continuance of the registration of such shares in such colonial register, be registered in any other register.

(6.) The company may discontinue to keep any colonial register, and thereupon all entries in that register shall be transferred to some other colonial register kept by the company in the same colony, or to the register of members kept at the registered office of the company.

(7.) In relation to stamp duties the following provisions shall have effect: —

Where any such scheme provides for the creation of such a new body of trustees in or for any such defined local area, the Commissioners shall, so far as conveniently may be, provide for the representation on such new body of trustees of the inhabitants of such local area.

18. In framing any scheme relating to the general charity property now belonging to or applicable in the parishes mentioned in the said Second Schedule, the Commissioners shall consider and declare whether it is for the public advantage that any of the property or endowments belonging to the charity or charities dealt with by the scheme shall continue to be administered and managed by the body or bodies of trustees now administering and managing the same; and the Commissioners may in any such case provide that such property or endowments shall continue to be administered and managed by such body or bodies, and in any such case may alter the constitution of any such existing body or bodies of trustees, and, if they shall think fit, unite such bodies or body with any other body or bodies of trustees so as to create a new body or bodies of trustees for the administration, management, and application of such property and endowments in the said parishes, or any one or more of them, or for the application of such property and endowments, or any part of them, to any one or more of the objects to which such property and endowments may be applicable under the fourteenth section of this Act.

19. The Commissioners shall not be bound to provide in any one scheme for all the objects aforesaid, but may make provision for such objects, or any one or more of them, by one or by more schemes in the manner they shall judge most convenient, nor shall anything herein be construed to prevent the Commissioners from providing in any such scheme or schemes for any other object which shall upon inquiry appear to them to be necessary or desirable for the purposes of this Act, nor from proposing in any scheme any such modifications and variations as to matters of detail and regulation as shall not be substantially repugnant to any of the provisions of this Act.

20. The Commissioners shall not be bound to specify in any scheme the precise objects to which or the manner in which the general charity property shall be applied by the New Governing Body, but they may (if they shall think fit) specify such objects or manner with such particularity as they may think necessary, and may (if they shall think fit) leave the details of such application to be subsequently settled by the New Governing Body in manner herein-after mentioned.

21. No scheme shall be so framed as to affect or shall affect any endowment or part of an endowment (as the case may be) originally

22. In making schemes for the application of charity property or endowments to educational purposes the Commissioners shall have as much regard to the educational interests of girls as of boys.

• 23. It shall not be obligatory upon the Commissioners to prepare

a scheme under this Act for any endowment, or part of an endowment, which is an educational endowment as defined by section five of the Endowed Schools Act, 1869.

IV. — Procedure for approving Schemes.

24. When the Commissioners have prepared the draft of a scheme they shall cause it to be printed, and printed copies of it to be sent to the governing body of every endowment to which it relates, and to the vestry clerk of the parish in which such endowment is now applicable, and to the Remembrancer of the City of London, and shall also cause the draft, or a proper abstract of it, to be published and circulated in such manner as they think sufficient for giving information to all persons interested.

25. During two months after the first publication of the draft of a scheme, or any longer time which they may appoint, the Commissioners shall receive any objections or suggestions made to them in writing respecting such scheme, and shall duly consider the same.

26. After the expiration of the two months, or such longer time as to the Commissioners may seem proper, the Commissioners shall proceed to revise the scheme, and may, if they think fit, amend the same, and republish it and send copies of it as republished to the persons before mentioned, and shall submit the scheme for the approval of the Committee of Council on Education.

27. The Committee of Council on Education, as soon as a scheme is submitted to them, shall, before approving the same, cause the scheme to be published and circulated in such manner as they think sufficient for giving information to all persons interested, together with a notice stating that during one month after the first publication of such notice the Committee of Council on Education will receive any objections or suggestions made to them in writing respecting such scheme. After the expiration of the said month the Committee of Council on Education may, if they think fit, approve the scheme or may remit the scheme, with such declaration as the nature of the case seems to them to require, to the Commissioners.

The Committee of Council on Education as soon as they approve a scheme shall forthwith cause the scheme so approved to be published and circulated in such manner as they think sufficient for giving information to all persons interested, together with a notice stating that unless within two months after the publication of the scheme when approved a petition is presented to the Committee of Council on Education, such scheme may be approved by Her Majesty without being laid before Parliament.

During the said two months a petition praying that the scheme may be laid before Parliament may be presented to the Committee

Petitions may 28. Any person conceiving himself aggrieved by any provision HerM?estdin a sc^leme» on ground of its not making due compensation Council in for any vested interest to which he has been declared entitled as aforesaid, may, within two months from the publication of such* scheme when approved as aforesaid, petition Her Majesty in Council stating the grounds of the petition and praying Her Majesty to withhold her approval from the whole or any part of the scheme. Her Majesty may refer any such petition for the consideration and advice of three members at the least of Her Privy Council, of whom one shall be a member of the Judicial Committee, and such three members may, if they think fit, admit counsel to be heard in support of and against the petition, and shall have the same power with respect to the costs of all parties to the petition as the High Court of Justice would have if the petition were a proceeding therein for obtaining a scheme. Any petition not proceeded with in accordance with the regulations made with respect to petitions presented to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council shall be deemed to be withdrawn.

It shall be lawful for Her Majesty by Order in Council to declare that no cause has been shown why she should withhold her approval from the said scheme or to remit it to the Commissioners with such declaration as the nature of the case may require.

29. Where a scheme is remitted with a declaration the Commissioners may either proceed to prepare another scheme in the matter in the same manner as if no scheme had been previously prepared, or may submit for the approval of the Committee of Council on Education such amendments in the scheme as will bring it into conformity with the declaration.

The Committee may, if they think fit, approve the scheme with such amendments, and the same shall be published and circulated in the same manner and subject to the same right of petition to Her Majesty in Council as is before directed in the case of the approval of a scheme, and so on from time to time as often as occasion may require.

_ 30. If within the said two months from the publication of the

an^e8rovaUf sc^eme’ when approved as aforesaid, no petition praying that the Her Majesty in scheme be laid before Parliament has been presented in pursuance Council. of this Act to the Committee of Council on Education, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by Order in Council to declare her approbation of such scheme without the same being laid before Parliament.

If any petition praying that the scheme be laid before Parliament has been presented, but no petition to Her Majesty in Council is presented, then the scheme shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament after the expiration of the time for the presentation of a petition to Her Majesty in Council. If a petition is presented to Her Majesty in Council against the scheme, as well as a petition praying that the scheme be laid before Parliament, then the scheme shall be laid before Parliament after any later date at which the petition is withdrawn or Her Majesty in Council has declared as

aforesaid that no cause has been shown why she should withhold her approval from the scheme. If Parliament be then sitting the scheme shall be so laid before it forthwith. If Parliament be not then sitting, the scheme shall be so laid within three weeks after the beginning of the next ensuing session of Parliament; and if such scheme has lain before Parliament for not less than two months during the same session, then, unless an Address has been presented within such two months by one or other of the Houses of Parliament praying Her Majesty to withhold her consent from such scheme or any part thereof, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by Order in Council to declare her approbation of such scheme or any part thereof to which such Address does not relate.

31. Where a scheme relates to an endowment or endowments which or each of which (as the case may be) during the three years preceding the commencement of' this Act has had an average annual gross income of not more than one hundred pounds, no petition shall be presented to Her Majesty in Council with reference to such scheme so far as it relates to any such endowment or endowments. The statement of the Commissioners shall be conclusive evidence for the purpose of this section of the income of an endowment.

32. If any scheme, or any part thereof, is not approved by Her Majesty, the Commissioners may thereupon proceed to prepare another scheme in the matter, and so on from time to time as often as occasion may require.

33. Schemes may be from time to time framed and approved for amending any scheme approved under this Act, and all the provisions of this Act relative to an original scheme shall apply also to an amending scheme, mutatis mutandis.

V. — Supplemental .

34. No scheme shall of itself have any operation, but the same, when and as approved by Her Majesty in Council, shall, from the date specified in the scheme, or if no date is specified then from the date of the Order in Council, have full operation and effect in the same manner as if it had been enacted in this Act.

Where a scheme shall have been so framed as to make it necessary that any further acts should be done in order to carry out the arrangements prescribed by such scheme, the Commissioners shall have power, immediately after the making of such Order in Council, to do and execute, or cause to be done, and executed, all such acts and deeds, and all such conveyances and assurances in the law whatsoever, as may in their judgment be necessary for carrying out the provisions of the scheme approved by such order, and for securing the application of the property dealt with by such scheme to the purposes to which such scheme may direct it to be applied.

35. Upon a scheme coming into operation every Act of Parliament, letters patent, statute, deed, instrument, trust, or direction relating to the subject matter of the scheme, and expressed by such scheme to be repealed and abrogated, shall, by virtue of the scheme, and of this Act, be repealed and abrogated from the date in that behalf specified, or if no date is specified, from the date of the scheme coming into operation, and all property purporting to be

A local authority may from time to time make agreements with the owners, lessees, or occupiers of or the persons working any mine for compromising any claim made or to be made in respect of anything done or omitted before the passing of this Act in relation to the matters in this Act mentioned or otherwise for carrying into effect the purposes of this Act in relation to the past or future working of mines.

5.

Where any right of support has been acquired before the passing of this Act by a local authority in respect of any sanitary work, and no compensation is at the passing of this Act recoverable in respect of such right, nothing in this Act shall be construed to appty to the work in respect of which such right has been acquired, or operate to deprive the local authority of such right or to entitle any person to any compensation in respect thereof, to which such person would not have been entitled if this Act had not been passed.

CHAPTER 41.

An Act to amend the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1880, with respect to fishing vessels and apprenticeship to the sea fishing service and otherwise.

[25th August 1883.] "TXT HERE AS the enactments of the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1880, with respect to fishing vessels, require amend-

ment, and it is desirable to make further provision for the encouragement and regulation of the fishing trade:

And whereas it is expedient to amend the Acts relating to merchant shipping in certain particulars:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Merchant Shipping (Fishing Boats) Act, 1883.

This Act and the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1880, the Merchant Shipping (Colonial) Act, 1869, and the Mer chant Shipping (Colonial Inquiries) Act, 1882, may be cited collectively as the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1883, and shall be construed as though they formed one Act. This Act shall not apply to Scotland.

2. This Act shall be divided into two parts, the first part relating to fishing boats and the sea fishing service, and the second part to miscellaneous matters.

Part I.

Fishing Boats and the Sea Fishing Service.

3. Such portions of the first part of this Act as in any way relate to indentures of apprenticeship to the sea fishing service or agreements with boys under sixteen years of age with respect to such service shall apply to all fishing vessels of twenty-five tons register tonnage and upwards; and such portions of the first part of this Act as in any way relate to discipline, or the settlement of disputes between a skipper or owner and a seaman, or to deaths, injuries, punishments, ill-treatment, and casualties, and section twenty-five shall apply to all fishing boats and to the whole fishing service. The remainder of the first part of the Act shall apply to trawlers of twenty-five tons register tonnage and upwards only, and to no other fishing boats.

The Board of Trade, by order under the hand of the President of the Board of Trade, to be published in the “London Gazette, ” may exempt any class of such trawler or trawlers belonging to any port from the whole or any portion of the said part of this Act from the date in such order mentioned, and may in like manner extend all or any of the provisions of the said part of this Act to any fishing boats in such order referred to, and may in like manner from time to time revoke, alter, or amend any order made by the Board as aforesaid. The Board of Trade may, before making any order under this section, institute such inquiry as in their opinion may be required for the purpose of enabling them to make such order by such person or persons as the President may appoint

section to be issued out of the Consolidated Fund, or any part of that sum.

6. Whereas by a Bill pending in Parliament, for an Act to be called the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, it is (among other things) provided that the twentieth section of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, enabling grants to be made in aid of emigration, shall be amended as therein mentioned, and that the sum of two hundred thousand pounds shall be substituted in that section for the sum of one hundred thousand pounds therein mentioned, and thereby the raising of an additional sum of one hundred thousand pounds by the Irish Land Commission for the purposes of the said section as so amended is rendered necessary: And whereas by section six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, the Irish Land Commission, for the purpose of paying money for grants under the said section of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, and for other purposes under that Act, were authorised to borrow on the security of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, such sums not exceeding in the whole two million six hundred thousand pounds, at the rate and on the terms and in the maimer and with the guarantee of the Consolidated Fund as therein mentioned:

And whereas it is expedient to extend the said section of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, to the raising of the said additional sum of one hundred thousand pounds:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

In the event of the above recited provision of the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, being passed into law, the Irish Land Commission may borrow the said additional sum of one hundred thousand pounds in manner provided by section six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, and that section shall apply in like manner as if two million seven hundred thousand pounds were therein substituted for two million six hundred thousand pounds.

PART

Provision as to certain Loans.

nTdebtedue Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners, in the year £°om trustees^ one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and subsequent years, Arbroath har- advanced to the Aberbrothwich otherwise called Arbroath Harbour botir. Trustees sums amounting in the whole to twenty thousand pounds,

which sums were expended on works for the harbour of Arbroath, and, with interest at the rate of three and a half per cent, per annum, are repayable out of the revenues of the harbour by annuities terminating between the years one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-five; and by the payment of such annuities the capital now due has been reduced to eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty-four pounds five shillings and tenpence:

And whereas the revenues of the harbour are applicable in the first place for the management and maintenance thereof:

And whereas an accident has occurred whereby serious injury has been caused to the works of the harbour, and the estimated cost of the works necessary for the repair of such injury amounts to ten thousand pounds:

1883. Public Works Loans Act, 18S3. Ch. 42.

And whereas, with a view to the repair of the said injury to the works of the harbour, it is expedient to authorise such suspension of the payment of the said annuities due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners as is herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Public Works Loan Commissioners, subject to such conditions as may seem expedient, may, with the consent of the Treasury, suspend the payments on account of the advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Arbroath Harbour Trustees and the interest thereon during such period not exceeding five years from the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, as may be considered necessary for the purpose of enabling the Arbroath Harbour Trustees to repair the said injury to the works of the harbour, and the Public Works Loan Commissioners may, if they think fit, with the consent of the Treasury, enter into arrangements with the Arbroath Harbour Trustees for payment of the said capital debt of eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty-four pounds five shillings and tenpence, with all interest due and to become due thereon, by instalments commencing after the said period of suspension, and terminating in or before the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty, and any such arrangement may include the capitalization of such interest.

8. Whereas divers sums amounting in the whole to fifteen Provision as to thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds were advanced in the year Athlunkard one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six and subsequent years, ime *

out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, in aid of the building of a bridge at Limerick, called the Athlunkard Bridge, and the said sums were advanced to the bridge commissioners on the security of the tolls of the bridge, and were repayable by annual instalments with interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum:

And whereas no instalment of principal has ever been paid, and ihere was due on the thirty-first day of December one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two in respect of arrears of interest on the said advances the sum of eighteen thousand three hundred and thirty-seven pounds nineteen shillings and elevenpence, and the total sum now due to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland for principal and interest amounts to thirty-four thousand one hundred and eighty-seven pounds nineteen shillings and elevenpence:

And whereas the bridge commissioners held the bridge on trust for the public, and derived no pecuniary benefit therefrom, and they or the larger part of them are dead, and there is no power to appoint any new commissioners:

And whereas in consequence of the deaths of some of the bridge commissioners, and the absence of any power to appoint new commissioners, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland took possession in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight of the bridge and the tolls thereof, and have ever since been in possession of the tolls, and maintained the bridge, and applied the surplus of the tolls, after payment of the expenses of collection and the maintenance of the bridge, in payment of the interest on the said advances:

202

Ch. 42. Public Works Loans Act, 1883. 46 & 47 VICT.

And whereas the average annual amount applicable to the payment of such interest during the six years ending on the thirty-first of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three amounted to four hundred and fifty-eight pounds six shillings and eightpence, and with the exception of such surplus tolls, no other moneys are applicable to the repayment of the said advances and the interest thereon:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the composition of the said debt and the abolition of the tolls on the bridge and for the maintenance of the bridge in manner herein-after provided: Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

(1.)

(2.) The grand jury of the county of Clare, if a presentment has been duly made by presentment sessions, and the grand jury think fit, may present that the county of Clare shall be charged with the payment to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland of a portion of the said sum of six thousand pounds with interest thereon.

(3.) The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland shall ascertain what sum would be charged in respect of each hundred pounds of the said sum of six thousand pounds, and so in proportion for smaller parts thereof, if the same were to be discharged by fifty equal half-yearly instalments ', beginning at the time mentioned in the certificate, with interest on the unpaid portion at the rate of three and a quarter per cent, per annum, and shall certify the sum so ascertained to the presentment sessions for the said county before the meeting thereof for the purposes of this section, and shall also certify the same to the grand jury before the assizes at which the presentment of the grand jury is proposed to be made.

1883. Public Works Loans Act, 1883. Ch. 42.

(4.) The presentment of the grand jury, if made, shall provide for the payment of any sum which is presented by fifty equal half-yearly instalments, which shall be applotted and levied from time to time without any further presentment, and shall commence at the time mentioned in the certificate.

(5.) Any presentment under this section may be traversed and may be fiated by the judge of assize in like manner as any other presentments of a grand jury.

(6.) For the purposes of this section a special meeting of the county at large presentment sessions of Clare may be held on a day to be appointed by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland within twelve months after the passing of this Act.

(7.) The justices and associated cesspayers for the time being entitled to attend at the ordinary county at large presentment sessions of the said county shall be entitled to attend at a meeting of the presentment sessions under this section.

(8.)

A like notice shall be given of the intention to submit a presentment for the purposes of this section at any ordinary meeting of county at large presentment sessions. The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland may make such arrangements as they think fit respecting the making of an application for any presentment under this section.

(10.) Some person nominated for that purpose by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland shall attend at any such meeting, and shall give information to the meeting as to the powers conferred upon the presentment sessions and grand jury by this section; and as to the amount for which the county may become liable if the meeting agrees that any charge should be imposed.

(11.) The Corporation of Limerick may, by a resolution of the council undertake to hold for the use of the public the Ath-lunkard Bridge and the approaches thereto, and to maintain the same in good and sufficient order, repair, and condition, and to light the bridge and approaches in a sufficient manner.

The expenses of the Corporation of Limerick incurred in pursuance of this section may be defrayed out of any moneys or rates applicable for the purpose of maintaining or lighting the roads in the city of Limerick, as the case may be, but nothing in this section relating to the maintenance and lighting of the said bridge, and the roadway thereof and approaches thereto, shall diminish any liability of the borough fund or general purposes rate to pay the sums due to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.

9. In case the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland advance a loan for the purpose of building a new court house in lieu of the existing court house in Green Street, Dublin, the period for repayment of any such loan or any instalment thereof may, notwithstanding anything in the Acts relating to loans by the said Commissioners, be such period not exceeding forty years from the date of the loan or instalment as the said Commissioners, with the consent of the Treasury, determine.

10. Whereas in pursuance of the power conferred by section four of the Public Works Loans Act, 1880, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, with the approval of the Treasury, have remitted certain instalments of principal and interest charged by virtue of the award mentioned in the said section on certain lands and mills situate on each side of the river Corrib, in the county of Galway, which said instalments were set forth in the schedule to the said Act, and amounted together to the sum of one thousand five hundred and sixty-six pounds fourteen shillings and tenpence, whereof the sum of eleven hundred and seventy-one pounds ten shillings was the amount remitted in respect of the mills and lands comprised in lots nine and ten referred to in the said schedule:

And whereas after the remission of the said last-mentioned sum there remained due to the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom in respect of principal and interest the further sum of eight hundred and twenty-three pounds three shillings and sevenpence charged by virtue of the said award upon the mills and lands comprised in the said lots nine and ten:

And whereas the last-mentioned mills and lands were vested in the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and have since such remission as aforesaid been sold by the said Commissioners with the consent of the Treasury for the sum of five hundred pounds:

1883. Public Works Loans Act, 1883. Ch. 42. 205

And whereas the residue of the said sum of eight hundred and twenty-three pounds three shillings and sevenpence, after payment into the Consolidated Fund of the said sum of five hundred pounds, amounts to the sum of three hundred and twenty-three pounds three shillings and sevenpence, which is irrecoverable, and it is therefore expedient that it should be extinguished:

Be it therefore enacted that the said sum of three hundred and twenty-three pounds three shillings and sevenpence, so due to the Consolidated Fund as aforesaid, shall be and the same is hereby extinguished, and shall be considered as a free grant from Parliament.

Amendment of Acts.

11. Whereas certain advances have been made by the Irish Land Amajdment of Commission to landlords in respect of antecedent arrears due by the s. le^as tenants of certain holdings respectively, pursuant to section sixteen to recovery of of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, and such holdings have certain rent-been respectively declared to be charged with rentcharges in repay- c arjre*‘ ment of such advances, and advances may be made and holdings charged in like manner in future: And whereas it is provided by the said section that such rentcharges shall be from time to time collected by the collector authorised to collect poor rates in the electoral division in which the holding is situate, and that every such collector shall pay and account for the sum so collected by him to the guardians of the union in which such holding is situate, and that the guardians shall transmit the amounts from time to time received by them as aforesaid to the Irish Land Commission:

And whereas it is expedient to make a different provision respecting the collection of such rentcharges; be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) The mode of collecting and levying the said rentcharge herein before recited shall not be used after the passing of this Act:

(2.) Where any advance has been made or shall hereafter be made pursuant to section sixteen of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, and where any holding has been or shall hereafter be charged with a rentcharge in repayment of any such advance, each such rentcharge shall be collected directly by the Irish Land Commission, and the payment thereof may be enforced in the same manner in all respects as if such rent-charge were an annuity in favour of the Irish Land Commission in repayment of an advance for the purpose of supplying money for the purchase of a holding pursuant to section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, save only that section ten of the Public Works Loans Act, 1882, shall not apply to any rentcharge levied and collected pursuant to this present enactment:

(3.) Provided always that nothing herein contained shall prejudice or affect the provisions of the said section sixteen of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, with respect to the power of the county court to order a sale of the tenancy on such default and such application as therein mentioned, nor the provisions as to the proceedings consequent on such sale, nor as to the contingent liability of the landlord, nor with respect to the

BE it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

PART I.

Powers of Grand Jury to Guarantee.

1. (1.) It shall be lawful for the promoters of any tramway, Grand jury being a public company, in making application to the grand jury of "ia3r present in any county under the Tramways (Ireland) Acts, to propose that a baronial barony or baronies in the county shall guarantee the payment of guarantee, dividends, not exceeding five per centum, upon so much of the share capital of the undertaking as is for the time being paid-up capital as defined by this Act: And also that, in case of default on the part of the promoters, the completion, working, and maintaining of the undertaking may be provided for, under the circumstances specified in this Act, at the cost of the same barony or baronies.

(2.) The grand jury shall inquire into such proposal, and shall hear all persons interested, and may make a presentment to be submitted to the Lord Lieutenant in Council that such baronies or parts of baronies as the grand jury may specify shall be chargeable with the payment of dividends at such rate, not exceeding five per centum per annum as the grand jury may determine on so much of the share capital of the company as is for the time being paid-up capital as defined by this Act: And also that the same baronies or parts of baronies shall become chargeable, under the circumstances specified in this Act, with the payment from time to time of such sums as may be required for completing, working, or maintaining the undertaking.

The guarantee may be limited by the presentment to expire at a fixed period.

(3.) The presentment shall provide that the barony or baronies or parts of baronies which it is proposed to charge with any part

Order in Council may adopt the presentment of the grand jury.

Ch. 43. T ramway s and Public Companies Ireland) Act. 46 47 Vict.

of such guarantee shall be represented in the direction or supervision of the affairs and finance of the company, so far as relates to the said tramway, or the part or parts thereof, in respect of which such barony or baronies or parts of baronies are proposed to be charged. This may be done —

(a.) By enabling the presentment sessions for such barony from time to time to elect a director or a local consulting director or directors of the company as the grand jury think necessary: (b.) By enabling such presentment sessions from time to time to appoint an auditor, with power to inspect the books and accounts of the said company relating to the said tramway at stated and reasonable times:

(c.) By enabling such presentment sessions from time to time to appoint a delegate or delegates to attend and vote at the general meetings of the company on business relating to the said tramway, under such conditions as may be prescribed:

(d.) By any combination of the foregoing arrangements deemed proper:

(e.) The presentment may lay down a scale of payment, so far as they are chargeable upon the earnings of the undertaking, if any, for the directors and officials of the company, and may provide for the revision of such scale.

(4.) The presentment shall contain all such other conditions as the grand jury think proper to insert.

(5.) The presentment may apply to one barony only, if the grand jury so think fit. If it applies to moi-e baronies than one, it shall determine the proportions of their liability respectively, or the presentment may provide that the proportions of such liability may be afterwards determined from time to time by arbitration or otherwise as the grand jury think expedient.

(6.) Nothing contained in this Act shall operate to prevent a company from promoting, constructing, and working two or more different tramway undertakings: Provided always that such company shall keep separate capital and revenue accounts for each tramway.

2. In addition to the persons entitled under the Tramways (Ireland) Acta to appeal to the Lord Lieutenant in Council against the presentment of a grand jury approving of the undertaking, it shall be lawful for any persons, not less than twenty in number, who are collectively liable to pay one eighth or upwards of the county cess in any barony specified in the presentment of the grand jury, to present a petition of appeal to the Lord Lieutenant in Council against such presentment. Such petition of appeal shall operate in the same manner as a petition of appeal under the Tramways (Ireland) Acts to prevent the Order in Council from taking effect unless confirmed by Parliament.

3. When any such presentment has been submitted to the Lord Lieutenant, the Order in Council, which the Lord Lieutenant is empowered to make under the Tramways (Ireland) Acts, may include, in addition to any provisions which it might have contained if this Act had not been passed, a confirmation of the presentment of the grand jury so far as it relates to any charge or liability to be defrayed by any barony.

Orders in Council under this Act shall only be made with the sanction of the Treasury.

4. During the continuance of the guarantee the net receipts from the tramway, after deducting from the gross receipts the expenses of the management and working and proper maintenance of the tramway, shall be applied to the payment of a dividend at the guaranteed rate on so much of the share capital of the company applicable to such tramway as is for the time being paid-up capital within the meaning of this Act; and in the event of a total failure or partial insufficiency in any half year of such net receipts to pay such dividend, then the sums required to pay such dividend or to make up any deficiency therein shall be charged upon and levied off the barony or baronies chargeable under the guarantee, and the sums so levied shall be applied for that purpose, and to no other purpose whatever.

5. Whenever in any half year there remains any surplus of the receipts from the tramway (after deducting the expenses of the management and working of the tramway, and after deducting dividend at the guaranteed rate upon the capital of the company for the time being paid up), and any money shall in any previous half year have been contributed by the baronies under their guarantee, or for maintaining or working the tramway, such surplus shall be paid over by the company to the treasurer of the county until all moneys paid by the baronies, together with the costs and expenses of levying the same, shall have been repaid to such treasurer. All moneys so repaid to the treasurer shall be apportioned by him between the Treasury and the baronies in the proportions in which the Treasury and the baronies respectively have made payments on account of the undertaking. The amount which on such apportionment is found to be payable to the Treasury shall be paid by the treasurer of the county to the Commissioners of Public Works, for the use of the Exchequer, in such manner as the Treasury may from time to time order. The amount which is payable to the baronies shall be carried by the treasurer to the credit of the baronies in proportion to the amounts paid by them respectively, and shall be applied by him in reduction of the county cess payable by the baronies respectively.

Provided that the power under this section of creating any annuity shall not unless continued by Parliament be exercised after the thirty-.first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and four.

(5.) The annuities created under this section may be increased above or reduced below the amounts above named for the purpose of such adjustment as is provided by this Act.

3. The Treasury may, in manner provided by this Act, from time to time convert such amount of perpetual annuities standing to the account of the Paymaster General as the Treasury think expedient, not exceeding in the whole forty million pounds capital stock, into such terminable annuities for periods not exceeding twenty years as will terminate within twenty years from the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, and may be of equivalent capital value.

annuity so as to bring the result into conformity with the table, and a return of any such adjustment shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

(b.) Where the perpetual annuities converted were held by the Paymaster General on behalf of the High Court of Justice, the table shall show the amount of perpetual annuities to be periodically replaced by means of the terminable annuity, and the account of the result shall show the amount of perpetual annuities actually so replaced, and the table and account shall be submitted to the Lord Chancellor before any adjustment is made, (c.) Where the perpetual annuities converted were held by the National Debt Commissioners, the table shall show the capital to be periodically replaced by means of the annuity, and the account shall show, so nearly as the transactions of the National Debt Commissioners allow, the result of the application of the terminable annuity as compared with the said table.

(d.) If at any time the Lord Chancellor certifies to the Treasury, that by reason of the conversion under this section of perpetual annuities of any description into a terminable annuity, the Paymaster General* is unable to meet the claims of the suitors of any Division of the Supreme Court to that description of perpetual annuities, the Treasury shall forthwith create such perpetual annuities as appear to them to be required to meet those claims, so that the amount so created do not exceed the amount of the said perpetual annuities converted after deducting the amount replaced; and thereupon the terminable annuity shall be adjusted as is above in this section mentioned.

5. For the purpose of facilitating the aforesaid conversion of perpetual annuities into terminable annuities, the Treasury may, in manner provided by this Act, exchange such of the existing terminable annuities specified in the schedule to this Act, (which are held by the National Debt Commissioners on account of trustee savings banks or Post Office savings banks, and terminate in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty*five,) as the Treasury think expedient, not exceeding in the whole the annual sum of five million one hundred and thirty-five thousand two hundred and sixty-three pounds, for such new terminable annuities for periods not exceeding twenty years, as may be of equivalent capital value; and the capital value of the existing annuities shall be deemed to be their present value ascertained on the basis of the rate of interest yielded by three per cent, perpetual annuities at the average price of the day as certified by the Bank of England on the day of the exchange, and in calculating the capital value of the new annuities the interest shall be taken at the same rate.

6. Whereas by the Savings Banks Act, 1863, the Treasury were empowered to convert portions of the three per cent, perpetual annuities held by the National Debt Commissioners on account of Post Office savings banks into an equal amount of two and a half per cent, perpetual annuities, and to pay the difference in value by a terminable annuity ending on the fifth day of April one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, and it is expedient to extend the period for the said terminable annuity; be it therefore enacted as follows:

1883.

355

National Debt , 1883. Ch. 54.

Any terminable annuity created in pursuance of the above-recited enactment of the Savings Banks Act, 1863, may be for a term not exceeding twenty years from the date of the creation thereof.

Consolidated Bank Annuities, held by the National Debt Commissioners on account of Post Office Saving Banks;

And whereas it is expedient to authorise the Treasury to redeem a portion of the said terminable annuity, and upon such redemption to reduce the annual sum of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, by which the permanent annual charge for the National Debt was increased by section three of the above-mentioned Act: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) The Treasury shall at such times as they think fit before the first day of April next after the passing of this Act pay out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof the sum of one million pounds to the National Debt Commissioners, and upon that payment shall cancel such portion of the said terminable annuity held by the National Debt Commissioners, as is of equivalent capital value to the sum so paid, ascertained on the basis of the rate of interest yielded by the Three per Cent. Consolidated Bank Annuities at the average price of the day as certified by the Bank of England on the day of payment.

(2.) The Treasury may cancel the said portion of the terminable annuity by a warrant to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England directing them to cancel in their books that portion of the said annuity.

(3.) The sum paid to the National Debt Commissioners in pursuance of this section shall be applied by them in like manner as other moneys in their hands on account of Post Office Savings Banks.

(4.) The permanent annual charge of the National Debt shall, during the currency of the terminable annuity created under the Indian Loan Act, 1881, be reduced by the amount of the portion cancelled in pursuance of this section, and the Sinking Fund Act, 1875, as amended by section three of the Indian Loan Act, 1881, shall be construed accordingly.

8. For the purposes of this Act the following provisions shall have effect: —

(1.) The conversion or exchange of one class of annuities into or for another class of annuities, and the adjustment of a terminable annuity, shall be effected by a warrant of the Treasury to the Bank of England directing them to cancel in their books, as from the date of conversion or exchange specified in the warrant, annuities of such class, and standing in such names and of such an amount as is mentioned in the warrant, and by the creation (by the same or another warrant) in the same names of such annuities as the case requires.

(8.) All perpetual annuities created in pursuance of this Act shall be consolidated with other perpetual annuities of the same description and payable at the same date, and shall be transferable in the books of the Bank of England in like manner as the annuities with which they are consolidated, and shall be subject to the enactments relating to those annuities so far as is consistent with the tenor of those enactments. ^nmrion$nuto 0*) Any terminable annuity payable to the National Debt application^f ° Commissioners in respect of the conversion under this Act of any terminable perpetual annuities held by them shall, so far as it represents in-

taken to an assay office to be assayed, and shall be found upon assay not to be of standard quality, such plate shall be deemed to be plate removed from a warehouse for assay under this section, and shall be dealt with accordingly. Plate taken to be assayed under this sub-section shall be identified to the satisfaction of the proper officer of the assay office.

And whereas the sum of eighty-seven pounds fourteen shillings and ninepence, being the balance arising from such canal revenue, was not paid over to the tonnage duty fund, and, after deducting a sum of five pounds and eightpence paid by the Corporation of London for stamp duty in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty, there remains a sum of eighty-two pounds fourteen shillings and one penny on account of the said revenue in the hands of the Chamberlain of the City of London as part of unclaimed balances:

And whereas the tonnage duty fund has been transferred to the Conservators of the River Thames, and it is expedient that the said sum should be paid to the said Conservators for the credit of the tonnage duty fund: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The Chamberlain of the City of London is hereby authorised, out of the sums in his hands on account of unclaimed balances, to pay into the Exchequer the sum of eight pounds twelve shillings and fivepence halfpenny in respect of the advances from the Exchequer as above recited, and further to pay to the Conservators of the River Thames for the credit of the tonnage duty fund the sum of eighty-two pounds fourteen shillings and one penny in part repayment of the debt due from the canal revenue, as above recited.

And whereas any such contract may provide for the said redemption by the transfer of Government securities as therein defined, instead of by payment of a sum of money:

(1.) The Treasury may in pursuance of the Consolidated Fund (Permanent Charges Redemption) Act, 1873, contract from time to time with the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales (in this section referred to as the Charity Commissioners) for the redemption of all or any of the annuities under that Act which are payable for charitable purposes in England or Wales, and the money or securities paid or transferred for such redemption may be paid or transferred to the official trustees of charitable funds in pursuance of such contract, and upon such payment or transfer the annuities to which the contract refers shall cease to be charged on and payable out of the Consolidated Fund or moneys provided by Parliament, so however that any proportionate part of any such annuity which may be due up to the time of such payment or transfer shall be paid by the Treasury to the person entitled thereto.

(2.) The Charitable Trusts Acts, 1853 to 1869, shall apply in like manner as if any money paid or securities transferred to the said official trustees in pursuance of this section for the redemption of any annuity had been paid or transferred in pursuance of an order of the Charity Commissioners under the said Acts, and were part of the endowment of the charity entitled to the annuity, and expressions in this section shall have the same meaning as in the said Acts.

(3.) The Consolidated Fund (Permanent Charges Redemption) 46 Vict. c. l. Act, 1883, which provides for the borrowing by the Treasury from the National Debt Commissioners of the capital sum or securities necessary for carrying into effect’a contract for the redemption of any annuity as defined by the Consolidated Fund (Permanent Charges Redemption) Act, 1873, shall apply for the purposes of this section.

Be it enacted that whenever the Local Government Board, Ireland, shall make any such regulations, the Board may direct the urban sanitary authority within any district in which such regulations shall be declared to be in force, to superintend and see to the execution of such regulations, or any of them, either independently or jointly with the board of guardians of any union within which or within part of which regulations so issued by the Local Government Board are declared to be in force, and thereupon every urban sanitary authority so directed by the Local Government Board shall have the like powers and authority in every respect as the board of guardians of any union within such district.

Scheme by Sanitary Authority.

4. Where a representation as herein-after mentioned is made to Sanitary autho-the sanitary authority that the existing house accommodation for agricultural labourers and their families within any section of the scheme, sanitary district, to be defined in such representation, is deficient,

having regard to the ordinary requirements of the district, or is unfit for human habitation owing to dilapidation, the want of light, air, ventilation, or proper conveniences, or to any other sanitary defects, and that such deficiency or sanitary defects cannot be effectually remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the erection of other dwellings in lieu of or in addition to the dwellings already existing in the section, the sanitary authority shall take such representation into their consideration at a meeting of which not less than fourteen days public notice has been given, and of which a special notice has been sent to each member of the sanitary authority not less than fourteen days before the day of meeting, and if satisfied of the truth thereof, and of the sufficiency of their resources, shall pass a resolution that an improvement scheme ought to be made in respect of such section, and after passing such resolution they shall forthwith proceed to make a scheme for the improvement of such section.

The sanitary authority may from time to time postpone their decision as to passing a resolution, or may postpone the making of a scheme, to any subsequent meeting specified by them at the time of such postponement, and in such case not less than three days notice of such meeting shall be sent to each member of the sanitary authority.

Two or more sections may be included in one improvement scheme.

The Local Government Board may, if they think fit, exercise for the purposes of this Act the powers conferred upon them by the twelfth section of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, of forming two or more sanitary districts or contributory places into a united district, as if the purposes of this Act were among the purposes specified in the said section; and the provisions of section thirteen of the said Act as to the governing body of a united district, and of section fourteen as to the constitution of a joint board, shall apply in the case of such united district, and such united district shall be deemed to be a rural sanitary district for the purposes of this Act.

shall cease to be of any force or validity, unless within one month after the making of the scheme an approval in writing of the said representation and proceedings shall be signed and forwarded to the sanitary authority by so many additional persons, rated as aforesaid and resident within the said area, as, with those who shall have already signed the representation and are resident within the said area, shall make up the number of twelve. The representation, if made on the ground of insufficient house accommodation, shall set forth specific instances of such insufficiency, and if made on the ground of sanitary defects shall be accompanied by a certificate of a sanitary officer of the sanitary authority to which the representation is made in corroboration of the sanitary defects alleged. The representation shall also define the section to which the scheme is to apply, and shall contain a suggestion on the part of the signatories as to the locality or localities in their opinion most suitable for the erection of the proposed new dwellings.

0. The improvement scheme of a sanitary authority shall be accompanied by maps, particulars, and estimates; it may exclude any part of the section in respect of which a representation is made, or may include any neighbouring lands within that district if the sanitary authority are of opinion that such exclusion is expedient or inclusion is necessary for making their scheme efficient for the purposes for which it is intended; it shall distinguish the lands proposed to be taken compulsorily. It shall further propose the erection of a sufficient number of labourers cottages so as to provide for the accommodation of the labouring class in suitable dwellings, with the requisite approaches to such dwellings; it shall also provide for proper sanitary arrangements, and for a plot or garden not exceeding half a statute acre being allotted to each dwelling. It may also provide for such scheme or any part thereof being carried out and effected by the person entitled to the first estate of freehold in any property subject to the scheme or with the concurrence of such person, under the superintendence and control of the sanitary authority, and upon such terms and conditions to be embodied in the scheme as may be agreed upon between the sanitary authority and such person. The scheme shall also specify the area which the sanitary authority propose as the area upon which the cost to be incurred in carrying the scheme into execution shall be charged. The scheme shall avoid all interference with the demesne and amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken, or with any home farm, or lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence, and in all cases lands shall be selected with due regard to the general situation and convenience of the owner’s property, so as to diminish the value thereof as little as possible.

Confirmation of Scheme.

7. Upon the completion of an improvement scheme the sanitary authority shall publish during three consecutive weeks in the month of September, or October, or November in some two or more newspapers circulating within the jurisdiction of the sanitary authority, an advertisement stating the fact of a scheme having been made, the limits of the section to which the scheme relates, the estimated cost of carrying the scheme into effect, and the proposed area of

charge, and naming a convenient place where a copy of the scheme may be seen at all reasonable hours: and during the month next following the month in which such advertisement is published serve a notice on every owner or reputed owner, lessee or reputed lessee, and occupier of any lands proposed to be taken compulsorily, so far as such persons can reasonably be ascertained, stating that such lands are proposed to be taken compulsorily for the purpose of an improvement scheme, and in the case of any owner or reputed owner, lessee or reputed lessee, requiring an answer stating whether the person so served dissents or not in respect of taking such lands, such notice to be served —

(a.) By delivery of the same personally to the person required to be served, or, if such person is absent abroad or cannot be found, to his agent, or if no agent can be found, then by leaving the same on the premises; or (6.) By leaving the same at the usual or last known place of abode of such person as aforesaid; or (c.) By forwarding the same by post in a prepaid letter addressed to the usual or last known place of abode of such person.

One notice addressed to the occupier or occupiers without naming him or them and left at any house shall be deemed to be a notice served on the occupier or on all the occupiers of any such house.

Upon compliance with the provisions contained in this section Petition to with respect to the publication of advertisements and the service of notices, the sanitary authority shall present a petition to the Local Government Board praying that an order may be made confirming such scheme. The petition shall be accompanied by a copy of the scheme, and shall state the names of the owners or reputed owners, lessees or reputed lessees, who have dissented in respect of the taking their lands, and shall be supported by such evidence as the Local Government Board may from time to time require.

If, on consideration of the petition and on proof of the publication of the proper advertisements and the service of the proper notices, the Local Government Board think fit to proceed with the case, they shall direct a local inquiry to be held for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of the representation made as to the section, and the deficiency of houses for agricultural labourers and their sanitary defects, and the sufficiency of the scheme, and any local objections to be made to such scheme, and as to the propriety of confirming such scheme.

After receiving the report made upon such inquiry the Local Government Board may make a Provisional Order declaring the limits of the section to which the scheme relates, and authorising such scheme to be carried into execution. The Provisional Order shall also specify the areas which are to be contributory places for the purposes of this Act, upon which the expenses incurred under this Act are to be charged. Such Provisional Order may be made either absolutely or with such conditions and alterations of the scheme as the Local Government Board may think fit, so that no addition be made to the lands proposed in the scheme to be taken compulsorily, and it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority to serve a copy of any Provisional Order so made in the manner and upon the persons in which and upon whom notices in respect of

The Local Government Board may make such order as they think fit in favour of any persons whose lands were proposed by the scheme to be taken compulsorily for the allowance of the reasonable costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred by him in opposing such scheme.

All costs, charges, and expenses incurred by the Local Government Board in relation to any Provisional Order under this Act shall, to such amount as the Local Government Board think proper to direct, and all costs, charges, and expenses of any person, to such amount as may be allowed by the Local Government Board in pursuance of the aforesaid power, shall be deemed to be an expense incurred by the sanitary authority under this Act, and shall be paid to the Local Government Board and to such person respectively, in such manner and at such times, and either in one sum or by instalments, as the Local Government Board may order, with power for the Local Government Board to direct interest to be paid, at such rate, not exceeding five pounds in the hundred by the year, as the Local Government Board may determine, upon any sum for the time being due in respect of such costs, charges, and expenses as aforesaid.

Any order made by the Local Government Board in pursuance of this section may be made a rule of Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice in Ireland, and be enforced accordingly.

8. A Provisional Order of the Local Government Board for confirming an improvement scheme under this Act shall become absolute, and shall take effect, without any Act of Parliament confirming the same, in case

(a) the order does not authorise the purchase or taking of any land otherwise than by agreement; and

(b) a petition against the order, signed by not less than three ratepayers liable to pay rates in respect of property situate within the area declared by such order to be chargeable, is not lodged with the Local Government Board within such time, not less than one month after the making and publication of the Provisional Order, as the Local Government Board may from time to time by regulation prescribe.

9. Where any Bill for confirming a Provisional Order authorising an improvement scheme is referred to a Committee of either House

1883.

Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883. Ch. 60.

of Parliament upon the petition of any person opposing such Bill, the Committee shall take into consideration the circumstances under which such opposition was made to the Bill, and whether such opposition was or was not justified by such circumstances, and shall award costs accordingly to be paid by the promoters or the opponents of the Bill as the Committee may think just.

Any costs under this section may be taxed and recovered in the manner in which costs may be taxed and recovered under the Act of the session of the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter twenty-seven.

The decision of the majority of the members of the Committee for the time being present and voting on any question under this section shall be deemed to be the decision of the Committee.

10. Where a representation is made to the sanitary authority with a view to their passing a resolution in favour of an improvement scheme, and they fail to pass any resolution in relation to such representation, or pass a resolution to the effect that they will not proceed with such scheme, such sanitary authority shall as soon as possible send a copy of the representation, accompanied by their reasons for not acting upon it, to the Local Government Board, and upon the receipt thereof the Local Government Board may, if they think it necessary, direct a local inquiry to be held and a report to be made to them with respect to the correctness of the representation made to the sanitary authority, and any matters connected therewith on which the Local Government Board may desire to be informed.

11. In any case in which an order has been or shall be made under section three of the Labourers Cottages and Allotments (Ireland) Act, 1882, or under section nineteen of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, for providing accommodation for the labourers employed on any holding, and such order has not been complied with within six months after the date of such order, it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority of the district in which such holding is situate to make such complaint as mentioned in, and to put in force, the provisions of section four of the Labourers Cottages and Allotments (Ireland) Act, 1882.

Execution of Scheme by Local Authority.

12. When the confirming Act authorising any improvement scheme of a sanitary authority under this Act has been passed by Parliament, it shall be the duty of that authority to take steps for purchasing the lands required for the scheme, and otherwise for carrying the scheme into execution, as soon as practicable. They may sell or let all or any part of such lands to any purchasers or lessees for the purposes and under the condition that such purchasers or lessees will, as respects the land so purchased by or leased to them, carry the scheme into execution, and in particular they shall insert in any grant or lease of any part of the section provisions binding the grantee or lessee to build thereon as in the grant or lease prescribed, and to maintain and repair the buildings, and prescribing the maximum rents to be charged therefor, and prohibiting the division of buildings, and any addition to or alteration of the character of buildings, without the consent of the sanitary authority

3. Compensation under this Act shall not be payable in respect of any improvement mentioned in the first part of the First Schedule hereto, and executed after the commencement of this Act, unless the landlord, or his agent duly authorised in that behalf, has, previously to the execution of the improvement and after the passing of this Act, consented in writing to the making of such improvement, and any such consent may be given by the landlord unconditionally, or upon such terms as to compensation, or otherwise, as may be agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant, and in the event of any agreement being made between the landlord and the tenant, any compensation payable thereunder shall be deemed to be substituted for compensation under this Act.

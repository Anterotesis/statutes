Finance (New Duties), 1916. Ch. 11.

(b) in special cases with the approval of the Commissioners, through a barrier which, or by means of a mechanical contrivance which, automatically registers the number of persons admitted, unless the proprietor of the entertainment has made arrangements approved by the Commissioners for furnishing returns of the payments for admission to the entertainment and has given security up to an amount and in a manner approved by the Commissioners for the payment of duty.

If any person is admitted for payment to any place of entertainment and the provisions of this section are not complied with, the person admitted and the proprietor of the entertainment to which he is admitted shall be liable in respect of each offence to an excise penalty, in the case of the person admitted of five pounds, and in the case of the proprietor of fifty pounds, and the proprietor shall in addition be liable to pay any duty which should have been paid.

power a prescribed standard of calorific power;

(b) exempt the undertakers from penalties in respect of a

deficiency in illuminating power and substitute for the provisions imposing such penalties provisions imposing penalties in the case of deficiency in calorific power; and

1. — (1) A brewer shall not brew at his brewery or breweries during the first three quarters to which this Act applies more than the aggregate maximum barrelages for those quarters as determined for the purposes of this Act, and shall not brew at his brewery or breweries in any subsequent quarter to which this Act applies more than his maximum barrelage for the quarter as determined for the purposes of this Act.

(2) If a brewer acts in contravention of this provision he shall be liable in respect of each offence to an Excise penalty of one hundred pounds, and, in addition, to an Excise penalty of two pounds for every barrel of beer brewed by him exceeding the maximum barrelage.

(3) This section shall not apply to brewers other than brewers for sale. 2

2. — (1) The maximum barrelage shall be determined by the Commissioners in the case of each brewery and shall be, as respects any quarter, the standard barrelage as defined in this section with the addition as respects any quarter after the first quarter of the surplus barrelage as so defined.

(2) The standard barrelage for the purposes of this section shall be —

(c) in the case of any special brewery where the Commissioners are satisfied that, owing to the transfer of a brewing business or any other change in the circumstances of the brewery taking place after the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and fifteen, the standard barrelage as ascertained under the foregoing provisions does not afford a proper standard of comparison or affords no standard of comparison, such number of barrels as the Commissioners think just having regard to the special circumstances of the case;

An Act to grant Money for the purpose of certain Local Loans out of the Local Loans Fund, and for other purposes relating to Local Loans.

[3rd August 1916.]

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. — (1) For the purpose of local loans, there may be issued a rant* for by the National Debt Commissioners the following sums, public works, namely: —

(a) For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan

Commissioners, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of one million five hundred thousand pounds:

(b) For the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public

purposes of those loans comes into operation, and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local loans specified in the Schedule to this Act should, to the extent specified in the last column of that schedule, not be reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887; therefore, the principal of the said loans shall to that extent be written off from die assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay that loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the “surplus herring brand fees, ” as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the “surplus herring brand fees ” of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees ” so pledged as aforesaid, was in the year ending the thirty-first. day of March nineteen hundred and sixteen insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of two hundred pounds, with interest amounting to one hundred and seventy-five pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence, now remains unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable:

1916.

Public Works Loans Act, 1916. Ch. 28.

Therefore the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and 6eventy-five pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence shall be remitted.

1. — (1) Where the right honourable the lord mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of Dublin (in this Act referred to as “ the corporation ”) require to purchase land under the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1907, for the purpose of widening, opening, enlarging or otherwise improving streets, in the city of Dublin in connection with the reconstruction of areas, streets, houses or buildings destroyed or damaged in the course of the recent disturbances, they may be authorised to purchase the land compulsorily by means of an order submitted to the Local Government Board and confirmed in accordance with the schedule to this Act.

(2) Any such order may for the purpose of enabling the corporation to widen an existing street authorise the corporation to compulsorily acquire any lands (hereinafter called “the acquired lands”) more remote from such street than the premises actually fronting upon the street, and such order may provide that when the acquisition of the acquired' lands is completed, the respective interests in the lands (hereinafter called “ the intervening lands ”) situate between the street and the acquired lands shall cease to attach to the same and shall instead attach to the lands (including the necessary portions of the acquired lands) exactly corresponding in area, lay out, and situation with relation to the new frontage of the widened street and any street intersecting or intersected by the same. Such last-mentioned lands are hereinafter called "the substituted lands.”

(3) As from the coming into operation of the said order with reference to the respective interests in the intervening lands, every grant, conveyance, and assurance relating to any portion of the intervening lands and every interest, legal and equitable, in the same shall affect the corresponding portion of the substituted lands as if such portion were the land originally dealt with in such grant, conveyance, or assurance, or affected by such interest.

(2) If it appears to the city architect, having regard to the nature and situation of the site of the proposed new building, or of the building proposed to be restored or altered, or the external design of any buildings erected or in the course of erection in the neighbourhood of that site, that the character of the proposed new building, restoration, or alteration is such as would be injurious to the amenity of the street which the front of the proposed new building or the building proposed to be restored or altered faces, whether on account of the proposed external design, the proposed line of frontage, or the materials proposed to be used in the external walls facing that street or in any portion of the building which will be visible from that street, he may require such reasonable alterations to be made as respects the design, line of frontage, and materials as he thinks proper, and may require the plans, sections, and elevations to be amended accordingly. The front of a building at the comer of two streets shall be deemed to face each street for the purposes of this provision.

(3) A requirement of the city architect under this section shall not have effect unless notice thereof in writing is delivered or sent by post to the building owner within one month after the day on which the plans, sections, and elevations are delivered as aforesaid, or within fourteen days after the day on which the further particulars (if any) are furnished as aforesaid, whichever period expires later.

(4) If any dispute or difference arises as to the reasonableness of any requirement of the city architect under this section the matter in dispute shall be settled by arbitration between the corporation and the building owner, and the corporation shall appoint the city architect or a person nominated by him to be arbitrator on their behalf, and the building owner shall appoint an arbitrator on his behalf, and section two

(b) Any reference to that Act shall be construed as a

reference to this Act;

(d) The arbitrators or umpire shall have power to make

such modifications of any requirement of the city architect as seem proper, and the requirement as so modified shall be deemed to be a requirement of the city architect under this section;

(e) The powers of the arbitrators and umpire as to the costs

(Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916.

provisions of section thirty-nine of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as to compensation shall apply in like manner as if the new frontage line had been prescribed by the corporation under that section.

(8) The corporation may on the recommendation of the city architect relax or waive any byelaw of the corporation relating to buildings where and so far as such relaxation or waiver is necessary in order to enable a joint plan of reconstruction to be carried out in relation to two or more buildings subject to the consent of the owners of these buildings, but, save as aforesaid, the provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any byelaws of the corporation relating to buildings.

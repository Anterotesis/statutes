1. — (1) For the purpose of local loans, there may be issued by the National Debt Commissioners the following sums, namely: —

(a) For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan

(b) For the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public

Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland:

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay that loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan:

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees, ” as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at tie times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the “surplus herring brand fees ” of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under thle security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal:

And whereas the said portion of the “ surplus herring brand fees ” so pledged as aforesaid, was in the year ending the thirty-first. day of March nineteen hundred and seventeen insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of two hundred pounds, with interest amounting to one hundred and sixty-nine pounds four shillings and sixpence, now remains unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable:

Therefore the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and sixty-nine pounds four shillings and sixpence shall be remitted.

4. Notwithstanding anything in any other Act the provisions of section one of the Public Works Loans Act, 1897 (which relates to the rates of interest on future local loans on the security of local rates), shall apply to a loan made out of the local loans fund otherwise than on the security of local rates as they apply to a loan made out of that fund on such security, and where under any special Act any loan made out of the said fund is repayable by means of an annuity or rentcharge payable for any period the amount of the periodical payment on account of the annuity or rentcharge, and the redemption value of the loan, shall in the case of a loan made after the commencement of this

SCHEDULE.

Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee of Chequers in the county of Buckingham, having expressed his desire and intention to transfer forthwith the ownership of the Chequers Estate together with certain chattels and moneys as a free gift (in trust) to the nation subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, and in order that the house may be used and maintained in perpetuity as the official country residence of the British Prime Minister, and having more particularly explained the objects of his gift in the following words ! —

“ It is not possible to foresee or foretell from what classes or conditions of life the future wielders of power in this country *• will be drawn. Some may be as in the past men of wealth and famous descent; some may belong to the world of trade and business; others may spring from the ranks of the manual toilers. 44 To none of these in the midst of their strenuous and responsible labours could the spirit and anodyne of Chequers do anything but good. In the city-bred man especially, the periodic coutact with the most typical rural life would create and preserve a just sense of proportion between the claims of town and country. To 44 the revolutionary statesman the antiquity and calm tenacity of Chequers and its annals might suggest some saving virtues in the continuity of English history and exercise a check upon too hasty 4< upheavals, whilst even the most reactionary could scarcely be insensible to the spirit of human freedom which permeates the countryside of Hampden Burke and Milton.

44 Apart from these more subtle influences, the better the health of our rulers the more sanely will they rule and the inducement to spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods will, it is hoped, benefit the nation as well as its chosen leaders. The main features of this scheme are therefore designed not merely to make Chequers available as the official country residence of the Prime Minister of the day, but to tempt him to visit it regularly and to make it possible for him to live there, even though his income should be limited to his salary.”

THIS INDENTURE is accordingly made the twenty-fourth day of November One thousand nine hundred and seventeen between Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee of Chequers in the county of Buckingham of the first part Dame Ruth Moore Lee the wife of the said Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee of the second part Allan Ernest Messer and Arthur Edward Nicholls both of No. 14 Old Jewry Chambers in the City of London Solicitors of the third part and The Public Trustee of the fourth part Whereas the said Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee is desirous of transferring forthwith the ownership of the Chequers Estate together with certain chattels as a free gift (in trust) to the nation subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth And whereas the said Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee also desires to create a trust fund for maintaining the Chequers Estate And whereas under and by virtue of two indentures of lease short particulars of which are set forth in the schedule hereto the said Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee and Ruth Moore Lee became and at law remain lessees of the greater part of the hereditaments hereinafter conveyed and settled for the term of twenty-one years from the twenty-ninth day of September one thousand nine hundred and nine and

thereafter for their joint lives and for the life of the survivor of them at certain rents and subject to certain covenants and conditions in the said indentures respectively contained And whereas under and by virtue of an indenture dated the fifth day of April one thousand nine hundred and seventeen and made between Mary Ruth Falcke of the one part and the said Allan Ernest Messer and Arthur Edward Nicholls of the other part the fee simple and inheritance of the said hereditaments and of certain adjoining hereditaments (all hereinafter shortly collectively called “ the Chequers Estate ”) was duly conveyed unto and to the use of the said Allan Ernest Messer and Arthur Edward Nicholls as joint tenants with the benefit of and subject to the said leases And whereas the fee simple and inheritance of the Chequers Estate was in fact purchased by and conveyed to the said Allan Ernest Messer and Arthur Edward Nicholls as agents for and with the moneys of the said Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee and the same estate is now held by them in trust for him And whereas the said Sir Arthur Hamilton Lee is also the absolute owner of the furniture pictures tapestry books manuscripts china relics works of art silver linen and other effects now in and about the Mansion House of Chequers And whereas the trusts hereinafter declared in relation to the Chequers Estate and the said trust fund would infringe certain rules of law unless these presents were confirmed and made valid by Act of Parliament and it is intended that a Bill shall be introduced into Parliament for the confirmation of these presents accordingly And whereas it is intended that the said Bill shall constitute the Commissioners of Works as defined by the Interpretation Act 1889 or some other body into a statutory corporation and that the legal ownership of the Chequers Estate shall be vested in the said Commissioners of Works or other body as custodian trustee and that such trust fund shall be vested in the Public Trustee but that the administration of the trusts shall be confided to a body of administrative trustees consisting from time to time of the holders of certain offices hereinafter mentioned Now this INDENTURE WITNESSETH as follows *. —

(Confirmation) Act, 1918.

4. Where as respects any accounting period the profits of any undertaking retained by the owner are less than the guaranteed standard as hereinafter defined, or if there is a loss or the loss is greater than the guaranteed standard, when that standard is a negative quantity, such sum as may be required to make up the guaranteed standard, shall, subject to the provisions of clause 13, bo paid to the owner by the Controller.

5. For the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) of the proviso to clause 3, and of clause 4, profits retained, and for the purposes of clause 4, loss, shall be profits or loss after taking into account any refund of excess profits duty on account of the deficiencies in the accounting period attributable to the undertaking and any refund of coal mines excess payment.

6. If the stock of coal at the end of the period of control of any undertaking is in excess of that at its commencement, the profit or loss on such excess when sold, as compared with the valuation in the balance sheet at the end of the period of control, shall for the purpose of determining the amount to be paid to make up the guaranteed standard in respect of the last accounting period be brought to account as though the realisation had taken place in that period.

7. The expression “The Guaranteed Standard” means —

(a) when the output of the undertaking in any accounting period is not less than the standard output, the profits standard; or (5) where the output of the undertaking in any accounting period is less than the standard output, but amounts to at least 65 per cent, thereof, the profits standard reduced by a percentage thereof equal to three-fourths of the percentage of the reduction of output; or (c) where the output of the undertaking in any accounting period is less than 65 per cent, of the standard output, the profits standard subject to suoh reduction as may be fixed under clause 10.

application he shall fix such substitute for the profits standard as he thinks fair in the circumstances, and the amount so fixed shall be subject to appeal as provided by clailse 11 hereof, but if the Controller refuses the application his decision shall be final.

10. If the output of the undertaking in any accounting period is less than sixty-five per cent, of the standard output, the guaranteed standard shall be the profits standard, subject to such reduction as the Controller may fix, and may be a sum varying according to the output:provided that —

(a) so far as the decrease in output is due to action by the Controller

not common to the whole of the coal industry under his control, the guaranteed standard shall be calculated at a rate per ton of output, regard being had only to the tonnage which would have been raised and the comparative cost of raising it had there been no such action by the Controller, and. shall be greater than that which would be fixed if the rule for ascertaining the guaranteed standard in the case of an undertaking where the reduction of output was thirty-five per cent, or less applied, so however that the guaranteed standard shall in uo such case exceed the amount which would have been the guaranteed standard if the reduction of output had been thirty-five per cent.; and

(b) so far as the decrease in output is due to any other cause, the

guaranteed standard shall be less than would have been fixed if the said rule applied, and shall be calculated at a rate per ton of output, regard being had only to the tonnage raised and what it would have cost to raise such tonnage in the standard period;

(c) in either case, if a mine is closed, the guaranteed standard shall not include any sum in respect of the cost of maintaining the mine in a state of repair or of reopening it or any rent, royalties, wayleaves, management or other similar charges, in respect thereof.

12. Where an undertaking is subject to control during part only of an accounting period the profits standard or the special standard, as the case may require, and the guaranteed standard and any other sums brought

190

(Confirmation) Act, 1918.

into account in calculating the sums retainable under clause 3 or pajable under clause shall, for the purposes of applying this agreement to such part of such accounting period, be proportionately reduced, and the profits for that period shall be apportioned between the parts of the period before and after the date of the commencement of the control in proportion to the number of months or fractions of months in those parts respectively.

13. Any profit retained by the owner under clause 3 of this Agreement in any accounting period in excess of the guaranteed standard, except in so far as such profits may be made up by a refund of excess profits duty on account of deficiencies in that period, shall be set off against any amount to be paid to the owner under clause of this Agreement to make up the guaranteed standard in respect of any subsequent accounting period, and any sum paid under clause to the owner to make up the guaranteed standard in respect of any accounting period shall be made good out of any excess over the guaranteed standard which the owner is entitled under clause 3 to retain in respect of any subsequent accounting period.

14. If the owner of a mine intends to close or abandon the mine or any part thereof he shall give to the Controller not less than sixty days notice of his intention, and if before the expiration of the notice the Controller directs that the mine or such part thereof shall not be closed or abandoned, the mine shall continue to be carried on in accordance with the direction of the Controller, and thereupon the guaranteed standard applicable to the particular undertaking shall forthwith by agreement between the Controller and the owner, or failing such agreement, then by the Board of Referees appointed under the Act be revised and fixed at such an amount (positive or negative) as will under the operation of clause 4, indemnify the owner against any loss caused to him by continuing to carry on the mine or such part thereof which he would not have suffered if he had been permitted to close or abandon the mine or such part thereof.

If no such directions are given by the Controller, the mine or such part thereof as aforesaid, shall, unless otherwise agrqed between the Controller and the owner, be closed at the expiration of the notice, or abandoned at the earliest date at which the owner shall have power to abandon it under the conditions of his tenure, and in such case if the mine or part thereof closed or abandoned does not constitute the whole undertaking, then such revision shall be made in the amount of the guaranteed standard of the remaiuder of the undertaking as may be agreed between the Controller and the owner, or settled, in default of such agreement, by the said Board of Referees.

15. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and so far as not repugnant thereto, profits shall be the amount of the profits as determined or determinable under the Act and excess of profits over the profits standard for the purposes of this Agreement shall be computed and coal mines excess payments shall be assessed and collected by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in like manner as the excess of profits over the profits standard for the purposes of excess profits duty is computed and payments of that duty ure assessed and collected, and the provisions of the Act (including those relating to appeals) shall apply accordingly:

Provided that no excess profits duty paid in respect of a period prior to the time when the control of the undertaking in question commenced shall be repayable by reason of any deficiency created by coal mines excess payments in respect of any period whilst the undertaking was subject to control, nor shall any coal mines excess payment be applied to make good deficiencies or losses for which excess profits duty would be repayable.

(a) confer any right to have the profits retained under clause 3 together with any further sums received under clause to make up the guaranteed standard treated for the purpose of income tax, super-tax, or excess profits duty otherwise than as the profits of carrying on the trade or business; or

(i b) be deemed to constitute any claim for an amendment of an assessment under section one hundred and thirty-three or section one hundred and thirty-four of the Income Tax Act, 1842, nor to affect any such claim which, but for this Agreement, the owner would have been entitled to make under either of those sections.

17. The owner of every undertaking shall keep and furnish to the Controller at such times and in such form as the Controller may determine such cost accounts, trading accounts, and balance sheets and other accounts as the Controller may require, audited and verified in such manner as he may direct, and if part only of the undertaking is under the control of the Controller, entirely separate accounts of the portion of the undertaking under such control shall be kept, and the price charged on departmental transactions between the controlled portion of the undertaking and any other portion thereof shall be on a commercial basis, and such as may from time to time be approved by the Controller.

on the output as may be specified iu such application, and every such owner shall pay the amount due by him under such levy.

The proceeds of such levy shall be paid into a fund under the control of the Controller who shall thereout pay to the association or associations on whoso application the levy shall have been made, such sums as may be from time to time certified by such association or group of associations to be required for the purposes aforesaid.

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. In order to remove doubts as to the construction of the Wills Act, 1837, it is hereby declared and enacted that section eleven of that Act authorises and always has authorised any soldier being in actual military service, or any mariner or seaman being at sea, to dispose of his personal estate as he might have done before the passing of that Act, though under the age of twenty-one years.

2. Section eleven of the Wills Act, 1837, shall extend to any member of His Majesty’s naval or marine forces not only when he is at sea but also when he is so circumstanced that if he were a soldier he would be in actual military service within the meaning of that section.

3. — (1) A testamentary disposition of any real estate in England or Ireland made by a person to whom section eleven of the Wills Act, 1837, applies, and who dies after the passing of this Act, shall, notwithstanding that the person making the disposition was at the time of making it under twenty-one years of age or that the disposition has not been made in such manner or form as was at the passing of this Act required by law, be valid in any case where the person making the disposition was of such age and the disposition has been made in such manner and form that if the disposition had been a disposition of personal estate made by such a person domiciled in England or Ireland it would have been valid.

(2) A testamentary disposition of any heritable property in Scotland made after the passing of this Act by a person to whom section eleven of the Wills Act, 1837, applies or to whom it would apply if he were domiciled in England, shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that such person is under twenty-one years of age, provided always that he is of such age that he could, if domiciled in Scotland, have made a valid testamentary disposition of moveable property.

4. Where any person dies after the passing of this Act having made a will which is, or which, if it had been a disposition of property, would have been rendered valid by section eleven of the Wills Act, 1837, any appointment contained in that will of any person as guardian of the infant children of the testator shall be of full force and effect.

BE it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Part I.

Financial Provisions.

1. — (1) The sum to be retained by the Insurance Commis- Amendment sioners under subsection (3) of section fifty-five of the National ^nd^ict Insurance Act, 1911 (in this Act referred to as “ the principal i^Geo. g ' Act ”), out of each weekly contribution shall, in the case of an c. 65. insured person being a woman, be one penny and one-sixth

instead of one penny halfpenny.

(2) The sums retained by the Insurance Commissioners under the said subsection shall, instead of being wholly applied towards discharging the liabilities of the Insurance Commissioners to approved societies in respect of reserve values, be applied in carrying to the Contingencies Fund and the Central Fund hereinafter constituted, amounts calculated in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act, and the balance only shall be applied in discharging such liabilities as aforesaid and apportioned amongst societies in manner provided by subsection (4) of the said section:

Provided that if at any time it appears to the National Health Insurance Joint Committee that, after taking into account the necessity of creating a proper reserve, the sums standing to the credit of the Central Fund are more than sufficient for the purposes for which that fund is established, the Committee may by regulations provide for decreasing the amounts to be carried to that fund and making a corresponding increase in the amounts to be carried to the Contingencies Fund.

2. — (1) There shall be established under the control of the Women’s National Health Insurance Joint Committee a fund to be called

the Women’s Equalisation Fund and to be applied in assisting approved societies in meeting their liabilities in respect of the sickness claims of women.

(2) There shall in each year be charged on the Women’s Equalisation Fund and distributed among approved societies in manner provided by a scheme to be made by the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, with the approval of the Treasury, such sum, not exceeding eight shillings in respect of each of the total number (calculated in the prescribed manner) of

Q

214

Ch. 62. National Health Insurance Act, 1918. 7 A 8 Geo. 6.

married women who are members of approved societies and who are employed contributors, as may be ascertained in accordance with the said scheme.

(3) Subject as hereinafter provided, there shall in respect of each year be carried to the Women’s Equalisation Fund out of moneys provided by Parliament such sum as will suffice to meet the charges thereon:

Provided that the sum to be carried to the Fund in respect of each of the years nineteen hundred and thirteen, nineteen hundred and fourteen, nineteen hundred and fifteen, and nineteen hundred and sixteen, shall, instead of being provided as aforesaid, be provided out of the moneys voted by Parliament before the commencement of this Act in aid of the provision of sickness benefit for women, and in so far as the moneys so voted are insufficient to meet the aggregate charges on the fund in respect of those four years shall be provided out of the moneys applicable towards discharging the liabilities of the Insurance Commissioners to approved societies in respect of reserve values.

(4) All sums distributed among societies under this section shall be available for the payment of benefits, and shall, for the purposes of section three of the principal Act, be deemed to have been derived from contributions made in respect of contributors notwithstanding that they are derived in whole or in part from moneys provided by Parliament.

3. — (1) The Insurance Commissioners shall periodically apportion amongst the several societies the sums by this Act directed to be carried to the Contingencies Fund in the case of men in proportion to the number of contributions credited in respect of the members of those societies respectively who are men, and the sums by this Act directed to be carried to the Contingencies Fund in the case of women in proportion to the number of contributions credited in respect of the members of those societies respectively who are women, and the sums so apportioned to any society shall, with the proper proportion of the accumulations of interest on the amount from time to time standing to the credit of the fund, form the contingencies fund of the society, and be available for making good any deficiency of the society or of the branches thereof in manner hereinafter appearing, and no part of any surplus of any society or branch disclosed on a valuation shall be applied towards making good any deficiency in any other society or branch.

(2) If on the valuation of a society without branches a deficiency is disclosed, the sums standing to the credit of the contingencies fund of the society shall be applied towards making good the deficiency; and if no deficiency is so disclosed, or if the sums standing to the credit of the contingencies fund are more than sufficient to make good that deficiency, the sums standing to the credit of that fund or the balance thereof shall, subject to the provisions of this section with respect to small societies, be carried to the benefit fund of the society, but

1918.

National Health Insurance Act, 1918. Ch. 62.

216

any amount so carried shall not be treated for the purposes of section thirty-seven of the principal Act as forming part of any surplus found at that valuation.

In this section the expression “benefit fund” means the fund out of which benefits payable by the society or branch are provided.

(3) If on the valuation of any society with branches a deficiency is disclosed in the case of any one or more branches of the society, the central authority of the society shall apply the sums standing to the credit of the contingencies fund of the society towards making good those deficiencies, except that, if satisfied that any part of a deficiency is due to any maladministration by the branch in question, the central authority may, with the consent of the Insurance Commissioners, refuse so to make good at all or in part that part of the deficiency.

If there are no deficiencies, or if the sums standing to the credit of the contingencies fund are more than sufficient to provide for the total amount of the deficiencies made good under the foregoing provision, the fund or the balance of the fund shall, subject to the provisions of this section relating to small societies, be apportioned amongst the several branches in proportion to the amounts paid into the fund in respect of contributions of members of those branches respectively since the commencement of the principal Act, or since the last valuation, as the case may be, but where there was a deficiency in the case of any branch the amount so paid into the fund in respect of contributions of members of that branch shall for the purpose of this provision be deemed to be reduced by the amount (if any) applied towards making good the deficiency.

The amount so apportioned to any branch shall be applied and dealt with as follows: —

(a) If there was a deficiency in the case of the branch and any part thereof was not discharged out of the contingencies fund of the society as being due to maladministration, the amount shall be applied towards making good that deficiency;

(h) Subject as aforesaid the amount shall be carried to the benefit fund of the branch, but any amount so carried shall not be treated for the purposes of section thirty-seven of the principal Act as forming part of any surplus found at that valuation.

(4) Regulations of the National Health Insurance Joint Committee shall provide, in the case of societies which at the date as at which a valuation is made have not joined an association formed or recognised under this section and have less than one thousand members, for applying pro rata to such extent, not exceeding one half, as may be necessary, any balances of the contingencies funds of those societies not required for making good deficiencies in those societies under the foregoing provisions of this section towards making good pro rata the balances of the deficiencies remaining in the case of other such societies after the application of the contingencies

Ch. 62. National Health Insurance, 1918. 7 8 Geo. 5.

funds of those societies in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section, subject, nevertheless, to the power of the Insurance Commissioners to refuse to allow to be made good either at all or in part any part of any deficiency which in their opinion is due to maladministration:

Provided that the Insurance Commissioners shall exempt from this subsection any society consisting of persons entitled to rights in a superannuation or other provident fund established for the benefit of persons employed by one or more employers, if the employer in addition to the contributions payable by him under Part I. of the principal Act is responsible for the solvency of the fund or for the benefits payable thereout, or is liable to pay a substantial part of, or to make substantial contributions to, or substantially to supplement the benefits payable out of the fund, and this subsection shall not apply to any society so exempted.

(5) The Insurance Commissioners may make regulations providing for the formation within the prescribed time for the purposes of this section of associations with central financial committees, and prescribing the conditions on which, and the time within which, a society shall be entitled or allowed to join, or having joined to secede from, an association, and the manner in which, and the conditions on which, such an association may be dissolved; and those regulations shall provide for recognising as an association formed for the purposes of this section any association which was formed for the purposes for which provision was made by section thirty-nine of the principal Act and was in existence on the first day of January nineteen hundred and eighteen, or which was on that date in the course of being so formed, if in the opinion of the Insurance Commissioners the association is such that they could properly have consented to its formation under the said section.

Where such an association has been formed this section shall, subject to such adaptations as may be prescribed, apply as though the association were a society with branches and the associated societies were the branches of the society and the contingencies funds of the associated societies formed the contingencies fund of the society.

Except so far as relates to the power of refusing to allow any part of a deficiency due to maladministration to be made good out of any contingencies fund, nothing in this subsection shall be construed as conferring on any central financial committee any powers of control over the administration of any society.

If at the date as at which any valuation is made the aggregate number of the members of the societies in any association is less than five thousand, those societies shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated in relation to that valuation as if they had not been associated.

(6) If in the case of a society consisting of persons entitled to rights in a superannuation or other provident fund established for the benefit of persons employed by one or more persons the

1918.

217

employer is responsible for the solvency of the fund, or for the benefits payable thereout, he shall not, in the event of a deficiency being disclosed on a valuation of the society, be required to make good the deficiency or to make up to their full amount the benefits payable out of the fund except in so far as the contingencies fund of the society is insufficient for the purpose, but save as aforesaid nothing in the provisions of this section shall affect any obligation in relation to such a society undertaken by the employer whereby he becomes responsible for the solvency of the fund or for the benefits payable thereout, or liable to pay a substantial part of or to make substantial contributions to or substantially to supplement the benefits payable out of the fund.

(7) The powers conferred by the proviso to subsection (1) of section sixteen of the National Insurance Act, 1913, may, subject 3*4 Geo. a. to the consideration by the National Health Insurance Joint c-37-Committee of any submission made by the governing body of

the society, be exercised on representations made within six months after the passing of this Act in like manner as they were authorised to be exercised on representations made within six months after the passing of that Act, so, however, that any separation of funds required to be made in consequence of the exercise of the said powers under this section shall not take effect until after the first valuation, and shall be carried out in such maimer as the Committee may direct; and where, on a representation made within six months after the passing of the first-mentioned Act, the National Health Insurance Joint Committee have exercised in respect of a society the powers conferred on them by that proviso, they may, on a representation being made within six months after the passing of this Act, reverse their decision, if they are satisfied in manner provided by that proviso that the members of the society resident in the part of the United Kingdom affected desire the decision to be reversed, and that the governing body of the society assent thereto.

(8) The normal intervals between valuations of societies shall be five instead of three years.

4. — (1) There shall be established under the control of the Central Fund. National Health Insurance Joint Committee a fund to be called the Central Fund, to which shall be carried in respect of each year, beginning with the year nineteen hundred and seventeen, out of moneys provided by Parliament, the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, together with the sums which under this Act are directed to be carried to that fund, and all accumulations of interest on the money for the time being standing to the credit of that fund.

(2) If on the valuation of any society or any branch of a society, the society or branch is found in deficiency, and the sums in any contingencies funds available to make good that deficiency are not sufficient, the Committee, if satisfied that the deficiency is due in whole or in part to an abnormal rate of

(3) For the purpose of determining whether the claim of any society or branch for relief out of the fund should be granted, the Committee shall, if so requested by the society or in the case of a branch by the central authority of the society, appoint an independent body, constituted in accordance with regulations made by the Committee, to investigate the circumstances to which the deficiency was attributable, and in determining whether and to what extent relief should be granted out of the fund to the society or branch shall have regard to the report of such investigating body.

5. The amendments specified in the second column of the Second Schedule to this Act, which relate to minor details, shall be made in the provisions of the principal Act specified in the first column of that Schedule.

2. — (1) The Director-General of National Service may at any time by order withdraw any certificate of exemption from military service to which this section applies as from such date, not being less than fourteen days after the date of the order, as may be specified in the order, and as from that date any certificate to which the order applies shall cease to be in force.

(2) This section applies to any certificate of exemption from the provisions of the Military Service Acts, 1916 and 1917, whether granted before or after the passing of this Act, and whether granted by a tribunal or by or under the authority of a Government Department, where the certificate was granted or renewed on occupational grounds, and also applies to any certificate so granted or renewed on such grounds to a man who has voluntarily attested, notwithstanding that the certificate has not statutory force.

renewal of a certificate, and no certificate shall be granted or renewed where the certificate, if it had been operative at the time at which the order was made, would have come within the terms of the order; and

(b) no application shall be made by or in respect of a man

whose certificate comes within the terms of the order for the renewal of the certificate except on grounds which are not occupational, or for the grant of any certificate on occupational grounds, and no such application if already made shall be proceeded with, and no certificate shall be renewed or granted on any such application,

and any certificate granted or renewed in contravention of the foregoing provisions shall be invalid, but save as aforesaid nothing in this section shall affect any right of a man, whether unattested or attested, whose certificate has been withdrawn under this Act to apply for a renewal of his certificate which he would have had if this Act had not been passed.

1881 Arklow Harbour Act, 1882. Ch. 13. 23

CHAPTER 13.

An Act for the Improvement of Arklow Harbour.

[19th June 1882.]

WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of Ireland of the thirty-second year of the reign of George the Third, chapter twenty-four, intituled " An Act for the better enabling certain 3$ O. a. c. 24. " persons to open and work mines, and to raise coal, culm, minerals,

" and fossils in this kingdom, and to open and improve the harbour of Arklow in the county of Wicklow, and to form a canal from the said harbour of Arklow to the Meetings Bridge,

" and to extend the same towards the Kilkenny collieries and the " Glenmalur mines," the Hibernian Mine Company were incorporated with divers powers for working mines and for opening and improving the harbour of Arklow, and for making and maintaining canals and navigation works, with power to take tolls, rates, and duties for vessels using their harbours and canals:

- *ocix *

And whereas by an Act passed in the twenty-sixth year of the 26 & 27 Vict, reign of Her Majesty the Queen, intituled " An Act for the Amalgamation of the Hibernian Mine Company with the Wicklow " Copper Mine Company (Limited), and for other purposes; " after reciting amongst other things the said Act, and that the property of the Hibernian Company comprised the quays of the harbour of Arklow, with all the wharves and buildings thereon held in fee; and that the Hibernian Company had expended more than seventeen thousand pounds on works for the improvement of the said harbour and for making it fit for the reception of vessels and the landing and shipping of goods; and reciting that on the second day of February one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight the Wicklow Copper Mine Company was registered under the Joint Stock Com- 19 & 20 Vict, panics Act, 1856, as a Company with limited liability; and that the c. *7. two Companies were desirous and it was expedient that the two Companies and their respective undertakings, property, and effects should be amalgamated, it is enacted that on the first day of September one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three tho two Companies should be thereby amalgamated into a new Company, which, by the name " the Wicklow Copper Mine Company, " should be one body corporate with the powers thereby given; and that the recited Act of the Parliament of Ireland of the thirty-second year of George the Third, chapter twenty-four, relating to the Hibernian Company should be repealed, and that all the estates and property, including the harbour of Arklow, of which the two Companies respectively were seised or possessed, should be vested in the Wicklow Copper Mine Company:

And whereas one of the objects for which the Wicklow Copper Mine Company was incorporated was the maintaining, repairing, and improving of the harbour of Arklow’, and the channel, embankments, piers, quays, wharves, buildings, and other works and conveniences of and connected writh the harbour, and the regulating and controlling of the user of the same, and for any of those pur|)oses; and also for the purpose of erecting sluices and other works for the improvement of the said harbour the Company may at all times

24

Ch. 13. Arklow Harbour Act, 1882. 45 Tier.

use the bridge of Arklow, provided they make good any injury the bridge may sustain by their operations:

And whereas the said harbour of Arklow is an important station and place of refuge for vessels employed in prosecuting the sea fisheries on the east coast of Ireland, but the said harbour has of late years been gradually silting up, and a bar is frequently formed across the entrance thereto, whereby its value and usefulness are materially injured:

And whereas it is expedient that the said harbour should be deepened, extended, and otherwise improved, and the Wicklow Copper Mine Company, being unable to undertake the execution of the necessary works for that purpose, have agreed, in consideration of the sum of five thousand pounds, to be paid as herein-after mentioned, to transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (in this Act referred to as " the Board, ") all their estate, interest, and property in the said harbour of Arklow, and the quays, wharves, and buildings connected therewith, as the same are delineated in red in the tracing now deposited in the office of the Board of Works in Dublin, and to which the seal of the Board has been affixed, and all their rights in the same:

And whereas it is expedient that the Board should be authorised to undertake the execution of the said works, and for that purpose to advance by way of grant the sum of fifteen thousand pounds, being one moiety of the estimated cost thereof, and to advance by way of loan, on the security provided by this Act, the sum of twenty thousand pounds, being five thousand pounds for the price to be paid to the Wicklow Copper Mine Company, together with the other moiety of the estimated cost of the said works; and, if by reason of unforeseen circumstances the said estimated sum proves insufficient for the full completion of the works, to advance by way of further loan on the security of the rates leviable by the Town Commissioners of the town of Arklow such sum as may be necessary for that purpose:

And whereas the objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queen s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.]

1. This Act may be cited as the Arklow Harbour Act, 1882.

If the justices and associated cesspayers of one only of the baronies declare their opinion to be in favour of such charge, they shall then proceed to declare their desire as to the period (not exceeding fifty years) within which the loan should he made repayable, having regard to the rate of interest fixed by the Treasury, by their minute dated the sixteenth day of August one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, for loans to which section two of the Public Works Loans Act, 1879, applies. 42 & 43 Vict.

In case the justices and associated cesspayers of more than one barony have agreed to charge the rates of the baronies with the payment of specified portions of the loan, the order shall apportion the charge upon the same baronies accordingly. The barony or baronies declared by such order to be charged with any payments shall by virtue of this Act l»ecome charged with such payments accordingly.

All sums declared by the Treasury to be charged upon any barony shall be repayable within such period as the Treasury may at their discretion determine, at such rate of interest as the Treasury have fixed for loans to which section two of the Public Works Loans 42 & 43 Vict. Act, 1879, applies; and otherwise upon the same terms and condi- c- 77* tions as apply to loans made by the Board for purposes like to the purposes of this Act, under the Act of the session of the first and second years of the reign of King William the Fourth, chapter thirty-three, intituled, "An Act for the Extension and Promotion of " Public Works in Ireland."

The Board may, upon being so authorised, out of any moneys placed in their hands by Parliament, lodge in the Bank of Ireland to the credit of the Wicklow Copper Mine Company the sura of five thousand pounds.

CHAPTER 15.

An Act to provide for the better application of Moneys paid by way of Compensation for the compulsory acquisition of Common Lands and extinguishment of Rights of Common.

[19th June 1882.]

WHEREAS under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and of railway and other special Acts of Parliament, money is directed or authorised to be paid to a committee as compensation for the extinction of commonable rights or for lands, being common lands or in the nature thereof, the right to the soil of which belongs to the commoners:

And by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and by the Inclosure Act, 1852, and the Inclosure Act, 1854, certain powers of apportioning and otherwise dealing with such money are conferred upon any such committee and upon the Inclosure Commissioners for England and Wales (herein-after called the Commissioners), hut such powers are found in practice to be insufficient, and money paid by way of compensation as aforesaid is often in consequence useless to the persons interested therein:

And whereas it is expedient to give such powers of dealing with such compensation money as are herein-after specified, but such powers cannot be conferred without the sanction of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Commonable Rights Compensation Act, 1882.

WHEREAS under the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed in the session of the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter eighty-six, intituled " The Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Act, 1874, " loans have been made for fishing purposes which have proved to be of great public utility and of important benefit to the poorer classes of fishermen in certain counties in Ireland; and it is expedient for the still further encouragement and promotion of the Fisheries that the provisions of said Act should be amended:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Amendment Act, 1882.

2. The second and third clauses of the fifth section of the Act thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth Victoria, chapter eighty-six, which limit the amount of loans to be made in any one year to a certain proportion of the fund standing to the credit of the county in which such loans are made, are hereby repealed; and it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, under the said Act, to advance, by way of loan, such amount, not exceeding in the whole the amount standing to the credit of each county in any year, as the Inspectors of Irish Fisheries may from time to time recommend, subject to the provisions, of the said Act and the rules made thereunder by the Lord Lieutenant in Council.

3. In addition to any rules heretofore made the Lord Lieutenant in Council may make such further rules as may seem expedient to enable the Inspectors of Irish Fisheries to supply, in cases where they may deem it expedient, to persons obtaining loans under the said Act and this Act, boats or fishing-gear in lieu of money; and on the certificate of the Inspectors that such boats and gear have

45

1882. Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Act (1874) Ch. 16, 17.

been supplied the Commissioners may pay for such boats and gear instead of paying the money to the borrowers, which shall be as effectually binding on the borrowers, so far as the liabilities or securities they may have entered into with the Commissioners shall extend, as if such borrowers had received the actual value of such securities in money instead of boats and gear.

4. All moneys of whatever amount, and at whatever time they may have accrued, due to the Commissioners on account of loans made by them under the said recited Act or this Act, including any costs and charges in respect of such loans or the recovery thereof, may be recovered before the justices in petty sessions, in the manner prescribed by the Act of the twenty-second year of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter fourteen, and any Acts amending it.

The power given by this section shall be deemed to be in addition to and not in derogation of any other powers to which the Commissioners may be entitled at common law or in equity of recovering any moneys due to them, and the Commissioners may use any such powers accordingly.

5. A certificate, purporting to be under the seal of the Commissioners and to be signed by one of them, stating the amount due to the Commissioners from any person in respect of any loan made to him under the said recited Act or this Act, together with interest thereon, and any costs and charges in respect of such loans or the recovery thereof, shall, until the contrary is proved, be evidence of the amount due and of the liability of the party therein named to pay the same; and it shall be sufficient, notwithstanding any rule, order, or form of procedure in any court whatsoever, if such certificate be produced to the court before which proceedings are instituted for the recovery, of any such sum by any person delegated by the said Commissioners, or any one of them, to produce such certificate.

6. This Act and the said recited Act may be read and construed as one Act.

And whereas in a financial despatch to the Government of India, dated the twenty-first of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, certain changes respecting the grant of annuities to widows were authorised by the Secretary of State for India in Council, and certain terms were stated on which the Secretary of State for India in Council was willing to take over the assets, liabilities, and management of the said institution:

And whereas in accordance with the instructions contained in the aforesaid despatch the Government of India caused the inquiry to be made, whether upon the terms offered by the Secretary of State for India in Council in the said despatch the subscribers to the said fund were willing to surrender the accumulated fund to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the proposition so to make over the accumulated fund on the terms offered by the Secretary of State for India in Council was carried in the affirmative by the subscribers by a large majority of votes:

And whereas in order to avoid any doubt that may arise in regard to the legality of such transfer it is necessary to make provision by law for enabling the trustees of the said fund to transfer the assets and liabilities thereof to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and for enabling the Secretary of State for India in Council to accept the same:

(a.) That the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring on the last gale day of the tenancy in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one (which year of the tenancy is in this Act referred to as " the year expiring as aforesaid ") has been satisfied on or before the thirtieth day of ^November one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two; and (6.) That antecedent arrears of rent are due to the landlord; and (c.) That the tenant is unable to discharge such antecedent arrears, without loss of his holding, or deprivation of the means necessary for the cultivation thereof, the Irish Land Commission (in this Act referred to as the Land Commission) may make an order for the payment to or for the benefit of the landlord of a sum equal to one half of such antecedent arrears, subject to the limitation that the sum so paid shall not exceed the yearly rent payable in respect of the holding for the year of the tenancy next preceding the year expiring as aforesaid:

(4.) A remission by the landlord of the whole or any part of the rent payable in respect of the year expiring as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a satisfaction of the amount of rent so remitted; provided that no remission made for any previous year shall be credited to the year expiring as aforesaid.

(5.) The Land Commission, if satisfied on the occasion of any application made under this Act that it is just so to do, may authorise the tenant to make to the Land Commission any payments on account of the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring as aforesaid which the tenant might otherwise have made to the landlord, and such payment shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been made to the landlord, and the Land Commission shall, having first given public notice in the prescribed manner, cause any sum so paid by the tenant to be paid to the person appearing to such Commission to be entitled thereto as landlord.

Whereas by section fifty-nine of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, it is provided, that where it appeared to the court, on the joint application made on or before the twenty-eighth day of February one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, of the landlord and tenant of any holding valued at a sum not exceeding thirty pounds a year, that the tenant had paid the whole of the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring on the gale day next before the twenty-second day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and that antecedent arrears were due, the Land Commission might make in respect of such antecedent arrears an advance of a sum not exceeding one year’s rent of the holding and not exceeding half the antecedent arrears, and thereupon the court should by order declare the holding to be charged with the repayment to the Land Commission of the said advance by a rent-charge payable and calculated as in the said section mentioned:

And whereas in pursuance of the said section divers advances have been made in respect of the arrears of rent on divers holdings, and such holdings have been charged with the repayment of the said advances by such rentcharges as in the said section mentioned, and it is expedient to amend the said section: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where in pursuance of section fifty-nine of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, an advance has. been made, before the passing of this Act, towards the payment of the arrears due in respect of any holding, and a rentcharge has been charged on such holding for the repayment of such advance, the Land Commission, if it is proved to their satisfaction on the application of either the landlord or the tenant of the holding that the tenant was, at the date of the said advance being made, unable to discharge the arrears in respect of which the advance was made, may by order cancel the said rent-charge, and the same shall cease to be payable, whether by the landlord or the tenant, as from the last day appointed for payment of the same next before the date of the order, and the amount of the said advance shall be a charge on the Irish Church Temporalities Fund.

The charge declared by the order as aforesaid shall have priority over all charges affecting the holding, except quit-rent and crown rent, and sums payable to the Commissioners of Public Works, and shall be payable by the tenant of the holding for the time being, and shall be levied and collected in manner herein-after provided; and in the event of the tenant failing to pay any half-yearly instalment of the said charge for the space of twelve months after the same shall have accrued due, then and in every such case the amount of such instalments, together with the entire of the unpaid residue of such charge, with interest as ascertained by the Land Commission, shall forthwith be payable by the tenant, and the amount thereof shall be raised by sale of the tenancy in the prescribed manner.

The half-yearly instalments of such charge shall be from time to time collected by the collector authorised to collect poor rate in the electoral division in which such holding is situate; and for the purpose of such collection every collector shall have all such powers and authorities as he shall for the time being possess for collecting and recovering poor rate, and shall and may collect and levy the same accordingly from the tenant liable to pay the same, notwithstanding that such tenant may not be liable to pay poor rate.

For the purpose of such collection the Land Commission shall, in each half-year, transmit to the clerk of every union, within which any holding or holdings charged as aforesaid shall be situate, a warrant tinder the seal of the Land Commission, setting forth the names of the tenants within such union liable to pay such charges or the instalments thereof, and the amount due by each respectively, and such warrant shall be judicially noticed in all proceedings in court, and shall be conclusive evidence of the arrears due by such tenants respectively, and of their liability to pay the same.

The collector shall be paid by the Land Commission such remuneration, not exceeding one shilling in the pound of his collection, as the Land Commission, with the consent of the Treasury, may determine, and the clerk of the union may be paid such remuneration (if any) as the Land Commission may with the like consent determine.

Every such collector shall pay and account for the sums collected or collectable by him under this Act to the guardians of the union in which such holding is situate in the prescribed form; and the

ICG

4

Ch. 47. Arrears of Rent ()Ac£, 1882. 45 & 46 Vict.

guardians shall transmit the amounts from time to time received by them as aforesaid to the Land Commission under the prescribed regulations.

In the event of such default by the tenant for the space of twelve months as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the county court of the county in which the holding is situate, on the application of the Land Commission, to order a sale of such tenancy, which shall be sold, and the proceeds of such sale dealt with by the said county court in the prescribed manner.

If the proceeds of any such sale fail to realise the amount ascertained by the Land Commission as aforesaid, together with the cost of sale, the amount of the deficiency shall be paid by the landlord of the said holding, and shall be a charge upon his estate and interest therein, and shall be collected and levied in the prescribed manner: Provided, that on any transfer of the tenant’s interest in the holding by sale, the principal sum and interest, if any, remaining due to the Land Commission, shall be paid out of the purchase money to the Land Commission.

On the order of the Land Commission being made as aforesaid in relation to any holding such antecedent arrears shall be deemed to be absolutely released.

The landlord and tenant may agree that any rent paid by the tenant in or subsequent to the year expiring as aforesaid shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have been paid in respect of the rent due for that year, and not in respect of arrears of rent.

Where arrears of rent in respect of a holding are due to some person or persons besides the landlord the advance made under this section shall be rateably distributed amongst the persons entitled thereto.

An application for an advance under this section shall not be made after the periods mentioned in the tenth clause aforesaid.

The omission or refusal by either landlord or tenant of any holding to join with the other of them in obtaining a loan from the Land Commission under this section shall not prejudice any other application or proceeding which either of them may make or institute under this Act or the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, or the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, in relation to such holding.

The Land Commission shall, at such time after the expiration of each period of twelve months as the Treasury may from time to time appoint, make up an account showing for the said period of twelve months the amount of all such payments due to them in respect of rentcharges payable to them under this section as they have failed to recover at the expiration of the said period.

Whenever, in the case of any tenant evicted for nonpayment of rent, or in case the holding of the tenant has been sold and purchased by the landlord, and possession taken thereof by him, since the first day of May one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the landlord agrees to reinstate such tenant on the terms in this section set forth, this section shall apply as if such tenant had not been so evicted from his holding.

Where a person has paid any public charges or taxes which, if not paid, would be remitted under this section, the amount which would have been so remitted shall be allowed as a deduction from any future payment or payments of the public charges or taxes of the same description, or may be recovered as a debt from the authority to whom it may have been paid.

Any payment which an owner may receive under this Act in respect of arrears of rent shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken into account as rent.

The Land Commission shall ascertain, for the purposes of this section, in such manner as they think best calculated to ascertain the truth, the amount of public charges or taxes due in any year or portion of a year from a person as or in consequence of his being owner of a holding.

4. A savings banks insurance granted to one person may be for any amount not exceeding one hundred pounds.

(2.) A savings banks insurance may be granted to a person not over the age of sixty-five years and not under the age of fourteen years, or if the amount does not exceed five pounds, not under the age of eight years.

Regulations may be made, in pursuance of the said section sixteen of the Government Annuities Act, 1864, as amended by this Act, by the National Debt Commissioners, with the approval of the Treasury, so far as regards any annuities and insurances granted by such Commissioners either directly or through any parochial or other society.

1882.

305

Govei'nment Annuities Act, 1882. Ch. 51.

maximum amount which otherwise is allowed to be deposited in a savings bank, either in any one savings bank year or in the aggregate, such excess shall bear no interest, but shall be forthwith applied to the purpose for which it was deposited, or paid over to the depositor.

(c.) Nothing in the said Acts or this Act shall exempt any person obtaining or becoming entitled to a savings bank insurance from any probate or stamp duty payable by law.

(2.) A savings bank annuity or insurance depending on the life of any person may be granted to that person jointly with any other persons to an amount not exceeding in the whole the amount of the annuity or insurance which could have been granted to one person, and the said persons shall be deemed to be entitled to such annuity and insurance as joint tenants.

(3.) The National Debt Commissioners may permit the transfer of any annuity so granted to more persons than one under such regulations, as to such Commissioners seem fit, so however that the person on whose life such annuity is granted shall be transferee, or one of the transferees, and where it is granted on the joint lives of two or more persons, all of those persons, or such of those persons as the National Debt Commissioners think fit, shall be the transferees or included among the transferees.

And whereas by section four of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1879, it is provided that the above requirements of section five of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, may, if the confirming authority so authorise, be complied with by the provision of equally convenient accommodation at some place other than within the area or the immediate vicinity of the area comprised in such scheme:

Where the lands are purchased by the local authority the local authority shall pull down the obstructive building, or such part thereof as may be obstructive within the meaning of this section, and keep as an open space the whole site, or such part thereof as may be required to be kept open for the purpose of remedying the evils caused by such obstructive building, and may, with the assent of the confirming authority and upon such terms as such authority thinks expedient, permit such portion of the site to be sold as is not required for the purpose of carrying this section into effect.

Where in the opinion of the arbitrator the demolition of an obstructive building adds to the value of such other buildings as are in that behalf mentioned in this section, the arbitrator shall apportion so much of the compensation to be paid for the demolition of the obstructive building as may be equal to the increase in value of the other buildings amongst such other buildings respectively, and the amount apportioned to each such other building in respect of its increase in value by reason of the demolition of such obstructive building shall be deemed to be private improvement expenses incurred by the local authority in respect of such building, and such local authority may, for the purpose of defraying such expenses, make and levy improvement rates on the occupier of such premises accordingly; and the provisions of the Public Health Act, 885 & 39 Vict* 1875, relating to private improvement expenses and to private im- c* provement rates shall, so far as circumstances admit, apply accordingly in the same manner as if such provisions were incorporated in this Act, and the said provisions shall be deemed to extend to the city of London and to the metropolis, and in the construction of the said provisions, as respects the city of London the Commissioners

Where an officer of health in pursuance of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, has reported any premises as unfit for human habitation, or in pursuance of this part of this Act has reported that the pulling down of any obstructive building would be expedient, the board of guardians in whose union or parish, or the owner of any property in the neighbourhood of which such premises or buildings are situate, may complain to the Metropolitan Board of Works that the local authority have failed to put in force the provisions of the said Acts in respect of such premises or buildings, and the Metropolitan Board of Works may, if they think it expedient so to do, thereupon proceed under section twelve of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act, 1879, and that section shall apply as if it were enacted in this part of this Act and in terms made applicable to the duties of local authorities under this part of this Act *

10. If, for the purpose of giving effect to any adjustment which the Local Government Board are authorised or required to make under the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, or the Acts amending the same, it is necessary that a separate rate should be levied on part of a parish only, the Board may in the order of adjustment direct such rate to be made, and the same shall be assessed, made, allowed, published, collected, and levied in the same manner and by the same persons as if it were a poor rate and extended to the whole parish.

11. It shall not be incumbent on the Local Government Board to make an adjustment under the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, or the Acts amending the same, in any case where the circumstances appear to them to render such adjustment inexpedient or unnecessary.

The Scotch Education Department may approve such scheme with or without any modifications as they think fit.

In framing and approving such scheme the same powers may be exercised, and subject to the same conditions, as nearly as may be, as in the case of any scheme under this Act; and such scheme, when approved by the Scotch Education Department, shall have effect as if it were a scheme approved by Order in Council under this Act.

Ch. 61. Bills of Exchange Act, 1882. 45 & 46 Vict.

18. A bill may be accepted —

(1.) before it has been signed by the drawer, or while otherwise incomplete:

(2.) When it is overdue, or after it has been dishonoured by a previous refusal to accept, or by non-payment:

(3.) When a bill payable after sight is dishonoured by non-acceptance, and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any different agreement, is entitled to have the bill accepted as of the date of first presentment to the drawee for acceptance.

19. (1.) An acceptance is either (a) general or (h) qualified.

(2.) A general acceptance assents without qualification to the

order of the drawer. A qualified acceptance in express terms varies the effect of the bill as drawn.

In particular an acceptance is qualified which is —

(a.) conditional, that is to say, which makes payment by the acceptor dependent on the fulfilment of a condition therein stated:

(6.) partial, that is to say, an acceptance to pay part only of the amount for which the bill is drawn:

(c.)- local, that is to say, an acceptance to pay only at a particular specified place:

An acceptance to pay at a particular place is a general acceptance, unless it expressly states that the bill is to be paid there only and not elsewhere:

(d.) qualified as to time:

(e.) the acceptance of some one or more of the drawees, but not of all.

20. (1.) Where a simple signature on a blank stamped paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a prima facie authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount the stamp will cover, using the signature for that of the drawer, or the acceptor, or an indorser; and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a prima facie authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.

(2.) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given. Reasonable time for this purpose is a question of fact.

Provided that if any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

21. (1.) Every contract on a bill, whether it be the drawer’s, the acceptor’s, or an indorser’s, is incomplete and revocable, until delivery of the instrument in order to give effect thereto.

Provided that where an acceptance is written on a bill, and the drawee gives notice to or according to the directions of the person entitled to the bill that he has accepted it, the acceptance then becomes complete and irrevocable.

371

1882. Bills of Exchange Act, 1882. Ch. 61.

(2.) As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery —

(a.) in order to be effectual must be made either by or under the authority of the party drawing, accepting, or indorsing, as the case may be:

(£>.) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.

But if the bill be in the hands of a holder in due course a valid delivery of the bill by all parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him is conclusively presumed.

(3.) Where a bill is no longer in the possession of a party who has signed it as drawer, acceptor, or indorser, a valid and unconditional delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.

Capacity and Authority of Parties.

22. (1.) Capacity to incur liability as a party to a bill is co-ex- Capacity of

tensive with capacity to contract parties.

Provided that nothing in this section shall enable a corporation to make itself liable as drawer, acceptor, or indorser of a bill unless it is competent to it so to do under the law for the time being in force relating to corporations.

(2.) Where a bill is drawn or indorsed by an infant, minor, or corporation having no capacity or power to incur liability on a bill, the drawing or indorsement entitles the holder to receive payment of the bill, and to enforce it against any other party thereto.

23. No person is liable as drawer, indorser, or acceptor of a bill Signature

who has not signed it as such:Provided that uLwtity *10

(1.) Where a person signs a bill in a trade or assumed name, he is liable thereon as if he had signed it in his own name:

(2.) The signature of the name of a firm is equivalent to the signature by the person so signing of the names of all persons liable as partners in that firm.

24. Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a Forged or bill is forged or placed thereon without the authority of the person JJ^ature6^ whose signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signa- hSaqjZ flfl /$j' ture is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the bill or to give\... /ik

a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof against any partyr ‘*///' *

thereto can be acquired through or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment of the bill is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.

Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the ratification of an unauthorised signature not amounting to a forgery.

25. A signature by procuration operates as notice that the agent Procuration has but a limited authority to sign, and the principal is only bound signature8‘ by such signature if the agent in so signing was acting within the

Value and holder for value.

(2.) In determining whether a signature on a bill is that of the principal or that of the agent by whose hand it is written, the construction most favourable to the validity of the instrument shall be adopted.

The Consideration for a Bill.

27. (1.) Valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted by —

(a.) Any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract;

(b.) An antecedent debt or liability. Such a debt or liability is deemed valuable consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at a future time.

(2.) Where value has at any time been given for a bill the holder is deemed to be a holder for value as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill who became parties prior to such time.

(3.) Where the holder of a bill has a lien on it arising either from contract or by implication of law, he is deemed to be a holder for value to the extent of the sum for which he has a lien.

Holder in due course.

28. (1.) An accommodation party to a bill is a person who has signed a bill as drawerr acceptor, or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending hTs nallie to some other ^person.

(2.) An accommodation party is liable on the bill to a holder for value; and it is immaterial whether, when such holder took the bill, he knew such party to be an accommodation party or not

29. (1.) A holder in due course is a holder who has taken a bill, complete and regular- on the' lace of it, under the following conditions; namely,

(a.) That he became the holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously dishonoured, if such was the fact:

(b.) That he took the bill in good faith and for value, and that at the time the bill was negotiated to him he had no notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it.

(2.) In particular the title of a person who negotiates a bill is defective within the meaning of this Act when he obtained the bill, or the acceptance thereof, by fraud, duress, or force and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a fraud.

(3.) A holder (whether for value or not), who derives his title to a bill through a holder in due course, and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality affecting it, has all the rights ot that holder in due course as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill prior to that holder.

subsequent to the alleged fraud or illegality, value has in good faith been given for the bill.

Negotiation of Bills.

. 3L (1.) A bill is negotiated when it is transferred from one Negotiation of

person to another in such a manner as to constitute the transferee bil1-

the holder of the bill.

(2.) A bill payable to bearer is negotiated by delivery.

(3.) A bill payable to order is negotiated by the indorsement of

the holder completed by delivery.

(4.) Where the holder of a bill payable to his order transfers it for value without indorsing it, the transfer gives the transferee such title as the transferor had in the bill, and the transferee in addition acquires the right to have the indorsement of the transferor.

(5.) Where any person is under obligation to indorse a till in a representative capacity, he may indorse the bill in such terms as to negative personal liability.

32. An indorsement in order to operate as a negotiation must Requisites of a

comply with the following conditions, namely, — mentmdorsc '

(1.) It must be written on the bill itself and be signed by the indorser. The simple signature of the indorser on the bill, without additional words, is sufficient.

An indorsement written on an allonge, or on a " copy " of a bill \

issued or negotiated in a coflU ll'y"to here " copies " are recognised, is deemed to be written on the bill itself.

(2.) It must be an indorsement of the entire bill. A partial in- | dorsement, that is to say, an indorsement which purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer the bill to two or more indorsees severally does not operate as a negotiation of the bill.

(3.) Where a bill is payable to the order of two or more payees or indorsees who are not partners all must indorse, unless the one indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.

(4.) Where, in a bill payable to order, the payee or indorsee is wrongly designated, or his name is mis-spelt, he may indorse the bill as therein described, adding, if he think fit, his proper signature.

(5.) Where there are two or more indorsements on a bill, each indorsement is deemed to have been made in the order in which it appears on the bill, until the contrary is proved.

(6.) An indorsement may be made in blank or special. It may also contain terms making it restrictive.

33. Where a bill purports to be indorsed conditionally the con- Conditional dition may be disregarded by the payer, and payment to the indorsement, indorsee is valid whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.

writing above the indorser’s signature a direction to pay the bill to or to the order of himself or some other person.

35. (1.) An indorsement is restrictive which prohibits the further negotiation of the bill or which expresses that it is a mere authority to deal with the bill as thereby directed and not a transfer of the ownership thereof, as, for example, if a bill be indorsed " Pay D. only, " or " Pay D. for the account of X., " or " Pay D. or order for collection."

(2.) A restrictive indorsement gives the indorsee the right to receive payment of the bill and to sue any party thereto that his indorser could have sued, but gives him no power to transfer his rights as indorsee unless it expressly authorise him to do so.

(3.) Where a restrictive indorsement authorises further transfer, all subsequent indorsees take the bill with the same rights and subject to the same liabilities as the first indorsee under the restrictive indorsement.

36. (1.) Where a bill is negotiable in its origin it continues to be negotiable until it has been (a) restrictively indorsed or (6) discharged by payment or otherwise.

(2.) Where an overdue bill is negotiated, it can only be negotiated sqbiect to any defect of title atiecting it at its maturity]" and thenceforward no person who takes~it^anriccquire^)r give a better title than that which the person from whom he took it had.

(3.) A bill payable on demand is deemed to be overdue within the meaning and for the purposes, of this section, when it appears on the face of it to have been in circulation for an unreasonable length of time. What is an unreasonable length of time for this purpose is a question of fact.

(4.) Except where an indorsement bears date after the maturity of the bill, every negotiation is prima facie deemed to have been effected before the bill was overdue.

(5.) Where a bill which is not overdue has been dishonoured any person who takes it with notice of the dishonour takes it subject to any defect of title attaching thereto at the time of dishonour, but nothing in this sub-section shall affect the rights of a holder in due course.

37. Where a bill is negotiated back to the drawer, or to a prior indorser or to the acceptor, such party may, subject to the provisions of this Act, re-issue and further negotiate the bill, but he is not entitled to enforce payment of the bill against any intervening party to whom he was previously liable.

38. The rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follows:

(1.) Helnay sue on the bill in his own name: " —

(2.) Where he is a holder in due course, he holds the bUFfree from any defect of title of prior parties, as well as from mere personal defences available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment against all parties liable on the bill:

(3.) Where his title is defective (a) if he negotiates the bill to a holder in due course, that holder obtains a good and complete title to the bill, and (b) if he obtains payment of the bill the person who pays him in due course gets a valid discharge for the bill.

The Treasury may, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided by the said Act, borrow the sum authorised by this section to be issued out of the Consolidated Fund, or any part of that sum.

6. Whereas by a Bill pending in Parliament for an Act to be called the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, it is provided that the liabilities incurred by the Irish Land Commission as therein mentioned should be primarily charged on the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, and, subject thereto, on the Consolidated Fund in such manner as might thereafter be provided by Parliament.

And whereas it is expedient to make provision for the discharge of such liabilities in the event of the said Bill being passed: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) In the event of the said Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act,

1882, being passed, the Irish Land Commission, for the purpose of meeting orders for payment made under the said Act, and of making advances, and of paying money for grants under the said Act, and generally of discharging the liabilities incurred by them under that Act, may, with the consent of the Treasury, from time to time borrow, on the security [of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, such sums not exceeding in the whole two million six hundred thousand pounds, and at such rate and on such terms as may be sanctioned by the Treasury.

(2.) The Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt may, if they think fit, with the approval of the Treasury, out of any money in their hands on account of savings banks, lend to the Irish Land Commission, with such guarantee as is by this section

395

1882. Public Works Loans Act, 1882. Ch. 62.

authorised, but not otherwise, the whole or any part of the money which by this section the Irish Land Commission are authorised to borrow.

(3.) For the purpose of giving effect to the charge by the said Act on the Consolidated Fund, the Treasury may from time to time guarantee, in such form as they think expedient, the payment of the principal and interest of all or any part of the money for the time being borrowed by the Irish Land Commission in pursuance of this section.

(4.) Any security given by the Irish Land Commission in pursuance of this section shall be in such form and contain such provisions as the Treasury may approve.

(5.) The Treasury may from time to time, if required, for the purpose of giving effect to any such guarantee as aforesaid, issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, such sums as may be necessary for the payment of the principal and interest guaranted by them, or of any part thereof; but any money so issued shall be repaid to the Consolidated Fund out of any surplus of the funds in the hands of the Irish Land Commission on account of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund.

(6.) For the purposes of this section, the Irish Church Temporalities Fund means the fund under the control of the Irish Land Commission under the provisions of the Irish Church Act Amendment Act, 1881.

PART IV.

Amendment of Acts.

7. Whereas under the General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, the Board of Trade can make a provisional order, subject to confirmation by Parliament, authorising the construction of a harbour, pier, or other works within the meaning of the said Act, and authorising the promoters to raise a loan to the amount specified in the order for the purpose of such harbour, pier, or works, and in many cases where the promoters are a public body difficulties arise in raising such loan on account of the defective security, while the construction of the said harbour, pier, or works is of so great importance to the inhabitants of the town or place where the same are to be constructed that they would be willing to guarantee the loan, if power were given for this purpose, and it is expedient to provide for the conferring of such power by the provisional order: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) Where a provisional order under the General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, authorises any public body to raise a loan for the construction of any works as defined by that Act in any place, the same or any other order may authorise any rating authority as herein-after defined in that place, under the circumstances and subject to the conditions specified in the order, to charge, if they think it expedient for the inhabitants at large of such place, any fund or rate under their control for the purpose of aiding the public body in raising the said loan, or any part thereof, from the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and to give such aid by guaranteeing the principal and interest

of the loan or by borrowing the sum required and advancing it to the public body, or partly in one way and partly in the other, or otherwise in manner provided by the order.

(2.) The order shall provide that the resolution of the rating authority to give the guarantee shall be a special resolution, that is to say, a resolution passed at one meeting of such authority and published in manner directed by the order, so as to give notice to all persons interested, and confirmed at a second meeting of the rating authority held not less than fourteen days after the first of such public notices has been given, and not less than three months after the meeting at which the resolution was passed.

(3.) The order shall provide for the time within which and the mode in which ony money borrowed by the rating authority is to be repaid, and for the effectual recovery out of the said fund or rate of any sum payable under the guarantee, and of the principal and interest of any money borrowed by the said authority, and for the reimbursement of the fund or rate out of the income of the said works, or otherwise by the said public body, and shall contain such incidental provisions as seem necessary or proper for carrying this section into effect.

(4.) The promoters of an order proposing to confer power under this section on any rating authority shall, a reasonable time before they apply to the Board of Trade to settle the order, submit to the Local Government Board, or as regards Scotland to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, a statement of such proposal, and if the Local Government Board, or Secretary of State for the Home Department, declare that in their opinion, having regard to the financial condition of the rating authority, or to the necessity for such rating authority to provide a water supply or drainage for the inhabitants of the said place, or otherwise to fulfil the original duties of such authority, it is inexpedient to burden such rating authority with any such charge as is mentioned in such proposal, the Board of Trade in settling the order shall omit any provision conferring power on the rating authority under this section.

In this section, —

The expression "public body" means any rating authority, also any commissioners, or trustees, or other body or person who manage or undertake the works without any view to the payment of any dividend or profits out of the revenue from such works:

The expression "rating authority" means —

(1.) As regards England, any authority being an urban sanitary authority under the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Acts amending the same; and (2.) As regards Scotland, the town council or commissioners of police of, or other local authority having power to levy assessments in, any royal or parliamentary burgh, or in any populous place the boundaries whereof have been fixed and ascertained under the General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act, 18C2, or under the Act therein recited or under any local Act; and

8. Where after the passing of this Act any money is advanced Accountt to by the Public Works Loan Commissioners on the security of a rate ©insecurity of as defined by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, the borrowers rate, shall cause their treasurer to keep a separate account under the title of the Public Works Loan Commissioners Loan Account, or such other title as may be approved by the Local Government Board, and shall cause all the said advances to be carried to the credit of that account, and all orders or other documents directing payments out of such account shall show on the face of them that the payment is to be made out of that account, and an order or other document for a payment out of the said account shall not be made or given except the payment is for a purpose for which the said advances were made.

9. Section thirteen of the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, and section eleven of the Public Works Loans (Ireland) Act, 1877 (which provided for annual and quarterly statements from borrowers of the amounts which they will probably apply to borrow), are hereby repealed.

10. Whereas by section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, it is provided that any advance made by the Irish Land Commission for the purpose therein mentioned shall be repaid by an annuity in favour of the Land Commission for thirty-five years of five pounds for every one hundred pounds of such advance, and so in proportion for any less sum, and further that every such advance shall be secured to the Commission either in such manner as may be agreed upon or in manner provided by Part Three of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872.

And whereas in pursuance of the last-mentioned Acts the annuity is repayable by equal half-yearly payments on the first day of May and the first day of November in every year, and the necessary apportionment is made in respect of the first and last of such payments.

And whereas it is expedient to make such different provision respecting the said annuity as herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where any advance repayable by an annuity under section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, has either before or after the passing of this Act been secured in manner provided by Part Three of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872, the first half-yearly payment of the annuity shall, where the advance is not made on one of the gale days (namely, the first day of May or the first day of November), be due and paid on the second of such gale days after the date of the advance, and together with such first half-yearly payment there shall be due and paid an additional sum for interest on the advance at the rate of three and a half per cent, per annum from the date of the advance, until the first gale day next after that date.

Bay sums amounting in the whole to sixty-two thousand pounds,

which sums were expended on a breakwater and works for the harbour, and, with interest at the rate of three and a quarter per cent, per annum, are repayable out of the revenues of the harbour by annuities amounting in the whole to two thousand six hundred and forty-two pounds five shillings, and terminating between the years one thousand nine hundred and eighteen and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three; and by the payment of such annuities the capital sum due has been reduced to fifty-seven thousand eight hundred and twenty-one pounds thirteen shillings and twopence.

And whereas the harbour and the revenues thereof were, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, transferred by the British Fisheries Society to the Pulteney Harbour trustees, and the said Act charged the above annuities on the revenue of the harbour next after an annual sum of sixteen hundred pounds for the maintenance and management of the harbour.

And whereas the breakwater and works upon which the said sums were expended have been almost wholly destroyed by the violence of the sea, and in consequence of the injury thereby caused to the harbour and other causes, the revenue of the harbour, upon which the said annuities are charged has been diminishing.

And whereas with a view to the restoration of the said works or other improvement of the harbour, it is expedient to raise further loans and to empower the Treasury, on being satisfied of the circumstances herein-after mentioned, to authorise such postponement of the said annuities due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners, as is herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

If the Pulteney Harbour trustees satisfy the Treasury that works for the restoration of the destroyed breakwater and works or otherwise for the improvement of Pulteney Harbour would be of public utility, and that such works can be executed for a reasonable sum, the Treasury may authorise the Public Works Loan Commissioners to agree that notwithstanding anything in the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, any loan or loans to be borrowed for the said works should, to such amount (not exceeding the said sum) and on such conditions as may seem expedient, have priority over the advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners before the passing of this Act, and the interest thereon, and may further authorise them to agree with the Pulteney Harbour trustees that the payments on account of the said advances, and the interest thereon, should be wholly or partly suspended during such number of years as may be agreed upon.

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may advance the said new loan or loans if they are satisfied with the sufficiency of the security for the same, irrespective of the said advances and interest hereby authorised to be postponed.

In the case of every county inspector and sub-inspector appointed before the passing of this Act to whom the pension granted under this Act is of less amount than might have been granted to him if this Act had not been passed, such annual addition shall be made to the pension granted to him under this Act as shall make it equal to the pension which might have been granted to him if this Act had not been passed.

Provided that no county inspector or sub-inspector appointed before the passing of this Act shall be entitled to receive any pension exceeding the amount which may be granted to him under the scale provided by this Act, or the amount which it would have been lawful to grant to him if this Act had not been passed; but every such county inspector or sub-inspector shall, on retirement, and if otherwise qualified for a pension, be entitled to elect between such amounts respectively.

(2.) With a view to exhaust any adhesive postage stamps denoting an amount not exceeding two shillings and sixpence which may have been unissued or unused, such stamps to a proper amount may be used to denote any stamp duties of an amount not exceeding two shillings and sixpence, which may legally be denoted by adhesive stamps not appropriated by any word or words on the face of them to any particular description of instrument.

14. (1.)

culated at the rate therein mentioned, as composition for stamp on certain duty chargeable on transfers of any stock of the government of " Canada inscribed in books kept in the United Kingdom:37 & 38 Vict.

And whereas after the passing of the above Act the government c*2ft* of Canada issued to the public, with the option of inscription at any time in books kept in the United Kingdom, the loans mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act; and holders of the said loans before the passing of the Inland Revenue Act, 1880, had exercised Js2o.44 Vict* that option to the extent in the said Schedule mentioned, and the government of Canada had paid composition for the stamp duty accordingly:

And whereas by section fifty-four of the Inland Revenue Act,

1880, the amount of the composition for stamp duty chargeable on transfers of stock of the government of Canada and other stock was increased, subject to a proviso that such increased composition should not apply for twelve months in the case of the holders of debentures of the government of a colony who had an option to exchange such debentures within twelve months for colonial stock, to which the Colonial Stock Act, 1877, applied: 405* 41 Vict-

And whereas, having regard to the special circumstances connected with the issue of the stock mentioned in the said Schedule, it is expedient to make for the holders of that stock a similar provision to that made by the above-mentioned proviso in the case of the holders of colonial stock:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where at any time since the passing of the Inland Revenue Act, 1880, whether before or after the passing of this Act, but before the first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six,

Any part of the loans of the government of Canada mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act, has been inscribed as stock in books kept in the United Kingdom, the government of Canada may pay to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, by way of composition for the stamp duty chargeable on transfers of such stock, a sum calculated at the rate mentioned in the Canadian Stock Stamp Act, 1874, instead of the rate mentioned in the Inland Revenue Act, 1880.

PART III.

18. Whereas the full amounts of dividends on the national debt Adjustment of payable at the Bank of England have from time to time been issued *[?J " from the Exchequer to the Governor and Company of the said mSationTof bank. fractions of a

And whereas fractions of a penny have never been paid by the dividends of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England on account of the National Debt, dividends on the national debt, and the fractions so unpaid have accumulated in the hands of the governor and company of the Bank of England, and such accumulations amount, as shown by the account in the Third Schedule to this Act, to upwards of one hundred and forty thousand pounds.

And whereas the sums issued out of the Exchequer to the governor and company of the Bank of England for payment of the dividends exceed, as shown in the said account, the sums paid for

dividends, and out of the sums so issued a net sum of upwards of seven hundred thousand pounds, as shown by the said account, has been repaid to the Exchequer in pursuance of the enactments referred to in the said Schedule and was on the thirty-first March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two outstanding in the books of the Bank of England.

And whereas it is expedient to make such provision as hereinafter appearing, respecting the said accumulations of fractions of a penny. Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

The governor and company of the Bank of England shall from time to time, when required by the Treasury, certify to the Treasury the amount in their hands arising from fractions of a penny not paid on account of dividends on the national debt, and the Treasury may by warrant direct the said governor and company to repay the same to the Exchequer: Provided that so long as there is an account outstanding of money repaid into the Exchequer, as aforesaid, out of the sums issued for the payment of dividends, the same instead of being repaid shall be written off from the said account, and also from the account of the sums issued from the Exchequer for the payment of the said dividends, and such amount shall be written off as if it had never been issued from the Exchequer.

19. After such date as the Treasury may appoint the dividends payable in respect of the two pounds ten shillings per centum annuities mentioned in the first schedule to the National Debt Act, 1870, shall be paid quarterly, on the fifth day of January, the fifth day of April, the fifth day of July, and the fifth day of October in every year, and the said Act shall be construed accordingly; and references therein to a half year’s dividend shall be construed to refer as regards the two pounds ten shillings per centum annuities to a quarter’s dividend.

Regulations may be made under section thirty-nine of the said Act for carrying into effect such quarterly payments in the case of stock certificates, and for the return of old coupons and the issue of new coupons for that purpose.

20. Whereas under the Acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to this Act (in this section referred to as the Fortification Acts) divers sums amounting in the whole to seven million four hundred and sixty thousand pounds were authorised to be borrowed by the Treasury by the creation of terminable annuities, and to be applied under the direction of one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State towards defraying the expenses of constructing the fortifications mentioned in the Fortification Acts:

And whereas of the above sums the sum of seven million four hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds has been actually raised in pursuance of the Fortification Acts by means of loans from the National Debt Commissioners made on the security of terminable annuities created under the said Acts, and the balance of thirty-five thousand pounds has not been raised:

And whereas out of the sums raised by such loans a balance of four thousand and eighty pounds one shilling and tenpence is unexpended:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the disposal of the said unexpended balance and to extinguish the said power of

431

raising money and creating terminable annuities: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Such portion of the amount raised in pursuance of the Fortification Acts as at the passing of this Act has not been expended shall at such time as the Treasury may direct be paid to the National Debt Commissioners in repayment of an equivalent part of the loans made by them under the said Acts; and so much of the annuities created under the Fortification Acts and standing in the names of those Commissioners as the Controller General or Assistant Controller and the Actuary of the National Debt Office may certify under their hands to be equivalent to the amount of such repayment shall be cancelled in such manner as the Treasury may direct.

All power of raising any money under the Fortification Acts shall cease and the Fortification Acts shall be repealed;

Provided that —

(1.) All annuities created in pursuance of the said Acts shall, save as provided by this section, continue to be charged on the Consolidated Fund and paid as if the said Acts had not been repealed; and

(2.) All land vested in one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State in pursuance of the said Acts shall continue to be vested in such Secretary of State on behalf of Her Majesty.

21. Whereas by divers Acts and lastly by the Friendly Societies 38 & Act, 1875, the societies in those Acts and this Act referred to as c-60, friendly societies are authorised to invest the moneys received from members on account of assurances with the National Debt Commissioners, and to pay such moneys to those Commissioners in sums of not less than fifty pounds, and are entitled to receive receipts for such moneys bearing interest at the following rates; that is to say.

For money invested by any society legally established before the 28th day of July 1828, which invested money with the Commissioners before 23rd July 1855.

For money invested by any society legally established between the 28th day of July 1828, and the 15th day of August 1850, which invested any money with the Commissioners before 23rd July 1855.

Guarantee from the Consolidated Fond of moneys due from the National Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies.

Cn^.Revenue, FriendlySocietie8, and National Debt ActA5 & 46 Vict.

And whereas the Commissioners have from time to time invested the moneys so paid to them in parliamentary securities to an account entitled the fund for Friendly Societies, but such securities have produced less interest than that to which the societies were entitled as above-mentioned, and thereby there has been, as appears from the returns annually laid before Parliament, a gradually increasing deficiency in the value of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners on the said account to meet the sums due from those Commissioners to the Friendly Societies:

And whereas the Customs, Inland Revenue, and Savings Banks Act, 1877, provided that the National Debt Commissioners shall annually make out an account with respect to the year ending on the twentieth day of November, showing on one side the interest accrued from the said securities, and on the other side the interest paid and credited to Friendly Societies; and further, after reciting that it was intended that where the interest accrued from such securities in any year was insufficient to meet the interest required to be paid and credited, such deficiency should be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, the said Act provided for paying into the Exchequer any surplus of interest received over and above the interest paid and credited:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the payment out of the Consolidated Fund of all capital sums, as well as the interest due from the National? Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies, when the securities held on account of Friendly Societies by the said Commissioners to meet the same have been exhausted:

Be it therefore enacted, as follows:

(1.) Whenever it appears to the Treasury from time to time that by reason of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners on account of Friendly Societies being exhausted, the moneys in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners standing to the credit of the fund for Friendly Societies will be insufficient to meet the sums which are likely to become due from the National Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies, the Treasury shall provide money to meet the deficiency out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, in such manner as they may think expedient.

(2.) The Treasury may in any financial year borrow all or any part of the moneys issued in that financial year out of the Consolidated Fund, or the growing produce thereof, in pursuance of this Act, by means of a terminable annuity for such period not exceeding eighteen years from the thirty-first day of December next after the passing of this Act as the Treasury think expedient.

(3.) An annuity created in pursuance of this section shall be created by warrant of the Treasury to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England directing them to inscribe in their books the amount of such annuity in the names directed by the warrant.

(4.) Every such annuity shall be charged on the Consolidated Fund, and shall be added to and paid out of the permanent annual charge for the National Debt, and the permanent annual charge for the National Debt shall, during the period for which the said annuity is created, be increased by the amount of the annuity.

(5.) All money for the time being in the hands of the National Investment of Debt Commissioners on account of Friendly Societies shall be invested by them in the like manner as if they were moneys in Smsietie*. 5 their hands on account of savings banks, and all enactments relating to the investment of such last-mentioned moneys shall apply accordingly.

22. Whereas under the Prison (Officers Superannuation) Act, Advance of 1878, the Treasury are authorised in certain cases to pay to a local "°5onai7Debt authority a capital sum as commutation of the share of an annuity Commissioners payable to an officer of a prison by the Treasury, and are also for payment of authorised to accept from a local authority a capital sum fas commutation of the share of any such annuity payable by the local v"ctrCi 63. authority, and it is provided that any sum so paid by the Treasury

shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and that any sum so paid to the Treasury shall be paid into the Exchequer, and it is expedient to make such other provision respecting the said capital sums as herein-after mentioned; be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) The National Debt Commissioners may, on the request of the Treasury, advance out of any funds for the time being in their hands on account of savings banks any capital sum to be paid by the Treasury in pursuance of the Prison (Officers Superannuation)

Act, 1878.

(2.) Any amount advanced by the National Debt Commissioners in pursuance of this section shall be repaid to them by means of a terminable annuity for a period of ten years, to be calculated with interest at the rate of not less than three and a half per cent, per annum, and such annuity shall he paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.

(3.) If at any time it appears desirable to the Treasury and to the said Commissioners that a portion of any such advance should be repaid immediately out of the Consolidated Fund, the Treasury may charge on and issue to the said Commissioners out of the Consolidated Fund or the growing produce thereof the said portion, and the annuity shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the portion of the advance so repaid.

(4.) All capital sums paid to the Treasury by a local authority in pursuance of the Prison (Officers Superannuation) Act, 1878, 38 & 39 Vict, shall be paid to the National Debt Commissioners and shall be c 45, applied by them in like manner as is directed with respect to the old sinking fund by section five of the Sinking Fund Act, 1875.

(5.) The amount of any annuity payable to the National Debt Commissioners in pursuance of this section, and the portion of any advance which is to be repaid immediately out of the Consolidated Fund to the National Debt Commissioners, and the amount by which any annuity is to be reduced in consequence of such repayment shall be certified under the hands of the Controller General or Assistant Controller and the Actuary of the National Debt Office.

23. Whereas by the Consolidated Fund (Permanent Charges Amendment of Redemption) Act, 1873, the Treasury are authorised as regards certain annuities as defined by that Act which are charged on the reganis perm»-Consolidated Fund or moneys provided by Parliament to contract nent charge* on for their redemption by payment of a capital sum out of moneys Fund01'*-

provided by Parliament not exceeding the sum therein mentioned; and in the case of any annuity payable to an ecclesiastical corporation, the contract for such redemption is made subject to the consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England, and the money for such redemption is to be paid to those Commissioners to be applied under their direction for the benefit of the person entitled thereto.

And whereas any such contract may provide for the said redemption by the transfer of Government securities as therein defined instead of by the payment of a sum of money.

And whereas it is expedient to extend the powers of the said Act as regards the redemption of annuities payable to ecclesiastical corporations in England: Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

(1.) The Treasury may, in pursuance of the Consolidated Fund (Permanent Charges Redemption) Act, 1873, contract from time to time with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England for the redemption of all or any of the annuities redeemable under that Act which are payable to ecclesiastical corporations in England; and on payment of the money or transfer of the securities to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in pursuance of any such contract, the annuities to which the contract refers shall cease to be charged on and payable out of the Consolidated Fund or moneys provided by Parliament, and shall be payable by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England, so however that any proportionate part of any such annuity which may be due up to the time of such payment or transfer shall be paid by the Treasury to the person entitled thereto.

(2.) The Treasury may from time to time borrow from the National Debt Commissioners, and those Commissioners may lend out of the funds in their hands on account of Trustee and Post Office Savings Banks, such capital sum or such Government securities as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect any contract with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners under this section.

(3.) For the purpose of repaying any such loan the Treasury may by warrant under their hands create, and direct the Governor and Company of the Bank of England to inscribe in their books for the National Debt Commissioners, a terminable annuity for a period of ten years from the date of the loan, to be calculated with interest at the rate of not less than three and a half per cent per annum.

(4.) Sections four, five, six, and seven of the Savings Bank Investment Act, 1869, shall apply to every such terminable annuity in like manner as they apply to the terminable annuities created in pursuance of that Act for the National Debt Commissioners.

24. Whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the right of Her Majesty to certain escheats, forfeitures, personal estate of intestates, fines, and recognisances, herein-after mentioned, is vested in Her Majesty in right of Her Crown or in right of Her Duchy of Lancaster, and it is expedient to remove such doubts.

Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

Such rights of Her Majesty as are herein-after mentioned shall be deemed to have been vested in Her Majesty in right of Her Crown

as from and after the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one.

Forthwith after the passing of this Act the Treasury shall cause a sum of fifteen thousand pounds to be paid out of the Consolidated Fund or out of the growing produce thereof to the Receiver General of the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster, or his deputy or deputies, and such sum shall be applied in like manner as sums arising from the sale of any part of the possessions of the Duchy of Lancaster are applied under the Duchy of Lancaster Lands Act, 1855, and the provisions of that Act shall apply in like manner as if such sum were purchase money for land sold under the authority of that Act.

The rights of Her Majesty to which this section applies are: —

(a.) Any right vested in Her Majesty to any escheat or forfeiture of land lying within any liberty of the Duchy of Lancaster which is not situated in the county of Lancaster, not being an escheat or forfeiture of land holden of any manor vested in Her Majesty in right of Her Duchy of Lancaster;

(b.) Any right vested in Her Majesty to the personal estate of any person dying intestate and without next of kin who is domiciled within any such liberty;

(c.) Any right vested in Her Majesty to any sum arising from a fine imposed on or estreated recognisance acknowledged by any person residing within any such liberty.

25. So much of the Act of the session of the twenty-first and twenty-second years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter seventy-two, intituled " An Act to facilitate the sale and transfer of land in Ireland, " as limits certain fees therein mentioned to a sum not exceeding three halfpence for every seventy-two words is hereby repealed.

Section eighty-four of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, shall apply to all fees and percentages to be taken in any proceedings under the above-mentioned Act of the twenty-first and twenty-second years of the reign of Her present Majesty, and any Act amending the same, with this qualification that the Land Judges or one of them shall be substituted in the said section for the Presidents of the divisions of the High Court, or one of them.

CHAPTER 79.

An Act to make provision for the arrangement of Accounts between the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and the Secretary of State in Council of India in respect of certain Home Charges for Her Majesty's Forces serving in India.

[18th August 1882.]

WHEREAS certain home charges of Her Majesty's forces serving in India payable out of the revenues of India are defrayed in the first instance out of the Exchequer, and under an arrangement in force since the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy advances were from time to time made out of the revenues of India to the Exchequer by way of repayment of those charges, and the actual expenditure was to be subsequently ascertained and adjusted:

And whereas differences have been pending between the Secretary of State for the War Department and the Secretary of State in Council of India which prevented such adjustment, and in consequence the accounts of the said actual expenditure fell into arrear; so that while the claim on the part of the Exchequer for the period from the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy to the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven amounted to three million three hundred and two thousand two hundred and forty-six pounds eleven shillings and eightpence the total amount advanced by way of repayment to the Exchequer out of the revenues of India amounted only to two million eight hundred and ninety thousand pounds, and the balance claimed by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury as due to the Exchequer, but disputed in part by the Secretary of State in Council of India, amounted to four hundred and twelve thousand two hundred and forty-six pounds eleven shillings and eightpence, which balance was reduced by a subsequent settlement of twenty-one thousand six hundred and thirty-five pounds to a net claim of three hundred and ninety thousand six hundred and eleven pounds eleven shillings and eightpence as due to the Exchequer but in part disputed as before mentioned:

And whereas the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, by a Minute dated the second day of July one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, proposed as an arrangement of the said differences and accounts that the sums actually advanced out of the revenues of India to the Exchequer by way of repayment of the said charges during the years above mentioned should be taken in full discharge of all the claims of the Exchequer upon the revenues of India in respect of the aforesaid charges:

And whereas it is expedient to sanction the said arrangement:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1. This Act may be cited as the India (Home Charges Arrears) Act, 1882.

CHAPTER 81.

An Act for disannexing the Rectory of Somersham from the Office of Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge, and for making better provision for the Cure of Souls within the said Rectory; and for other purposes.

[18th August 1882.]

WHEREAS His late Majesty King James the First, for the increase of the stipend of the regius professor or reader of divinity in the University of Cambridge, did by his Letters Patent bearing date the twenty-sixth day of August, in the third year of his reign, grant to the chancellor, masters, and scholars of the said University of Cambridge and their successors all that his advowson, donation, free disposition, and right of patronage of the Rectory of Somersham (together with Colne and Pidley, and other chapelries, rights, members, and appurtenances) in the county of Huntingdon, and did by the same Letters Patent signify and declare it to be his royal will and pleasure that the said rectory should for ever thereafter be held and enjoyed by the said professor for so long time as he should continue in the said office, and did thereby further signify and declare his royal will and intention to be that an Act of Parliament should be obtained for that purpose:

And whereas by an Act passed in the tenth year of Her late Majesty Queen Ann for, amongst other things, confirming and rendering more effectual the said Letters Patent, it was enacted that the canonry and rectories in the said Act mentioned should be annexed to the offices or places also in the said Act mentioned, namely, among others, that the said Rectory of Somersham, and all members, tithes, lands, tenements, hereditaments, profits, and emoluments whatsoever thereto belonging, or in anywise appertaining, or with the same used or enjoyed, was and should thereby be united and for ever annexed unto the said office or place of regius professor of divinity, and should be held and enjoyed by the person already placed in the said office or place; and by such other person or persons as should from time to time for ever thereafter be placed and put into

1882.

Ch. 81.

477

Somersltam Rectory Act, 1882.

the said office or place in as full and ample manner to all intents and purposes as if they were duly presented, nominated, admitted, instituted, and inducted thereunto; and the said professor or reader and his successors for the time being, during such time or times only as they should continue in the said office or place should by virtue of such office or place for ever thereafter have and hold the said rectory without any presentation, admission, institution, or induction, or any other act or thing whatsoever to entitle them thereunto, and should be and were thereby declared to be during their continuance in the said office or place full and perfect incumbents of the said rectory to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and that so often as it should happen that the said office or place should become void by death, resignation, or otherwise, the said rectory should at the same time become void, and the person that should be placed in such office or place so become void should by virtue of such office or place only have and enjoy the said rectory for so long time as he should continue in such office or place and no longer: And it was thereby provided that the said professor should celebrate divine service and perform all other parochial duties relating to the cure of souls within the said rectory which any other rector of the said rectory had theretofore done and performed, and were by law obliged to do and perform, or should allow to learned and able curates to be licensed by the bishop or ordinary of the diocese who should be constantly residing within the said rectory such competent salaries and stipends as the said bishop or ordinary should judge sufficient: And it was thereby also provided that neither that Act nor anything therein contained should excuse or be construed to excuse the said professor from the payment of first fruits and tenths, or from the payment of all dues of what kind soever to the bishop or other ordinary who before the making of that Act had lawful right to claim the same, or from canonical obedience to the bishop or ordinary of the said diocese, but such professor should be obliged to make payment thereof:

And whereas it has been found that by reason of the duties belonging to his office of profeasor the said regius professor is unable to celebrate divine service and to perform in person the other parochial duties relating to the cure of souls within the said rectory, and it is expedient that the said regius professor should devote himself entirely to the duties of his office of profeasor, and that divine service should be celebrated and all other parochial duties performed within the said rectory by some person appointed for that purpose with permanence of tenure:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

[Short title.]

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Somersham Rectory Act, 1882.

3.

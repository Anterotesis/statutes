1881 Arklow Harbour Act, 1882. Ch. 13. 23

CHAPTER 13.

An Act for the Improvement of Arklow Harbour.

[19th June 1882.]

WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of Ireland of the thirty-second year of the reign of George the Third, chapter twenty-four, intituled “ An Act for the better enabling certain 3$ O. a. c. 24. “ persons to open and work mines, and to raise coal, culm, minerals,

“ and fossils in this kingdom, and to open and improve the harbour of Arklow in the county of Wicklow, and to form a canal from the said harbour of Arklow to the Meetings Bridge,

“ and to extend the same towards the Kilkenny collieries and the “ Glenmalur mines," the Hibernian Mine Company were incorporated with divers powers for working mines and for opening and improving the harbour of Arklow, and for making and maintaining canals ana navigation works, with power to take tolls, rates, and duties for vessels using their harbours and canals:

- *ocix *

And whereas by an Act passed in the twenty-sixth year of the 26 & 27 Vict, reign of Her Majesty the Queen, intituled “ An Act for the Amalgamation of the Hibernian Mine Company with the Wicklow “ Copper Mine Company (Limited), and for other purposes; ” after reciting amongst other things the said Act, and that the property of the Hibernian Company comprised the quays of the harbour of Arklow, with all the wharves and buildings thereon held in fee; and that the Hibernian Company had expended more than seventeen thousand pounds on works for the improvement of the said harbour and for making it fit for the reception of vessels and the landing and shipping of goods; and reciting that on the second day of February one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight the Wicklow Copper Mine Company was registered under the Joint Stock Com- 19 & 20 Vict, panics Act, 1856, as a Company with limited liability; and that the c. *7. two Companies were desirous and it was expedient that the two Companies and their respective undertakings, property, and effects should be amalgamated, it is enacted that on the first day of September one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three tho two Companies should be thereby amalgamated into a new Company, which, by the name “ the Wicklow Copper Mine Company, ” should be one body corporate with the powers thereby given; and that the recited Act of the Parliament of Ireland of the thirty-second year of George the Third, chapter twenty-four, relating to the Hibernian Company should be repealed, and that all the estates and property, including the harbour of Arklow, of which the two Companies respectively were seised or possessed, should be vested in tho Wicklow Copper Mine Company:

And whereas one of the objects for which the Wicklow Copper Mine Company was incorporated was the maintaining, repairing, and improving of the harbour of Arklow’, and the channel, embankments, piers, quays, wharves, buildings, and other works and conveniences of and connected writh the harbour, and the regulating and controlling of the user of the same, and for any of those pur|)oses; and also for the purpose of erecting sluices and other works for the improvement of the said harbour the Company may at all times

24

Ch. 13. Arklow Harbour Act, 1882. 45 Tier.

use the bridge of Arklow, provided they make good any injury the bridge may sustain by their operations:

And whereas the said harbour of Arklow is an important station and place of refuge for vessels employed in prosecuting the sea fisheries on the east coast of Ireland, but the said harbour has of late years been gradually silting up, and a bar is frequently formed across the entrance thereto, whereby its value and usefulness are materially injured:

And whereas it is expedient that the said harbour should be deepened, extended, and otherwise improved, and the Wicklow Copper Mine Company, being unable to undertake the execution of the necessary works for that purpose, have agreed, in consideration of the sum of five thousand pounds, to be paid as herein-after mentioned, to transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (in this Act referred to as “ the Board, ”) all their estate, interest, and property in the said harbour of Arklow, and the quays, wharves, and buildings connected therewith, as the same are delineated in red in the tracing now deposited in the office of the Board of Works in Dublin, and to which the seal of the Board has been affixed, and all their rights in the same:

And whereas it is expedient that the Board should be authorised to undertake the execution of the said works, and for that purpose to advance by way of grant the sum of fifteen thousand pounds, being one moiety of the estimated cost thereof, and to advance by way of loan, on the security provided by this Act, the sum of twenty thousand pounds, being five thousand pounds for the price to be paid to the Wicklow Copper Mine Company, together with the other moiety of the estimated cost of the said works; and, if by reason of unforeseen circumstances the said estimated sum proves insufficient for the full completion of the works, to advance by way of further loan on the security of the rates leviable by the Town Commissioners of the town of Arklow such sum as may be necessary for that purpose:

And whereas the objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queen s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

Short title. 1. This Act may be cited as the Arklow Harbour Act, 1882.

If the justices and associated cesspayers of one only of the baronies declare their opinion to be in favour of such charge, they shall then proceed to declare their desire as to the period (not exceeding fifty years) within which the loan should he made repayable, having regard to the rate of interest fixed by the Treasury, by their minute dated the sixteenth day of August one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, for loans to which section two of the Public Works Loans Act, 1879, applies. 42 & 43 Vict.

The barony or baronies declared by such order to be charged with any payments shall by virtue of this Act l»ecome charged with such payments accordingly.

All sums declared by the Treasury to be charged upon any barony shall be repayable within such period as the Treasury may at their discretion determine, at such rate of interest as the Treasury have fixed for loans to which section two of the Public Works Loans 42 & 43 Vict. Act, 1879, applies; and otherwise upon the same terms and condi- c- 77* tions as apply to loans made by the Board for purposes like to the purposes of this Act, under the Act of the session of the first and second years of the reign of King William the Fourth, chapter thirty-three, intituled, “An Act for the Extension and Promotion of “ Public Works in Ireland.”

The Board may, upon being so authorised, out of any moneys placed in their hands by Parliament, lodge in the Bank of Ireland to the credit of the Wicklow Copper Mine Company the sura of five thousand pounds.

CHAPTER 15.

An Act to provide for the better application of Moneys paid by way of Compensation for the compulsory acquisition of Common Lands and extinguishment of Rights of Common.

[19th June 1882.]

WHEREAS under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and of railway and other special Acts of Parliament, money is directed or authorised to be paid to a committee as compensation for the extinction of commonable rights or for lands, being common lands or in the nature thereof, the right to the soil of which belongs to the commoners:

And by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and by the Inclosure Act, 1852, and the Inclosure Act, 1854, certain powers of apportioning and otherwise dealing with such money are conferred upon any such committee and upon the Inclosure Commissioners for England and Wales (herein-after called the Commissioners), hut such powers are found in practice to be insufficient, and money paid by way of compensation as aforesaid is often in consequence useless to the persons interested therein:

And whereas it is expedient to give such powers of dealing with such compensation money as are herein-after specified, but such powers cannot be conferred without the sanction of Parliament:

Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L This Act may be cited as the Commonable Rights Compensation Act, 1882.

[19th June 1882.]

WHEREAS under the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed in the session of the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter eighty-six, intituled “ The Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Act, 1874, ” loans have been made for fishing purposes which have proved to be of great public utility and of important benefit to the poorer classes of fishermen in certain counties in Ireland; and it is expedient for the still further encouragement and promotion of the Fisheries that the provisions of said Act should be amended:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Amendment Act, 1882.

2. The second and third clauses of the fifth section of the Act thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth Victoria, chapter eighty-six, which limit the amount of loans to be made in any one year to a certain proportion of the fund standing to the credit of the county in which such loans are made, are hereby repealed; and it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, under the said Act, to advance, by way of loan, such amount, not exceeding in the whole the amount standing to the credit of each county in any year, as the Inspectors of Irish Fisheries may from time to time recommend, subject to the provisions, of the said Act and the rules made thereunder by the Lord Lieutenant in Council.

3. In addition to any rules heretofore made the Lord Lieutenant in Council may make such further rules as may seem expedient to enable the Inspectors of Irish Fisheries to supply, in cases where they may deem it expedient, to persons obtaining loans under the said Act and this Act, boats or fishing-gear in lieu of money; and on the certificate of the Inspectors that such boats and gear have

45

1882. Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Act (1874) Ch. 16, 17.

been supplied the Commissioners may pay for such boats and gear instead of paying the money to the borrowers, which shall be as effectually binding on the borrowers, so far as the liabilities or securities they may have entered into with the Commissioners shall extend, as if such borrowers had received the actual value of such securities in money instead of boats and gear.

4. All moneys of whatever amount, and at whatever time they may have accrued, due to the Commissioners on account of loans made by them under the said recited Act or this Act, including any costs and charges in respect of such loans or the recovery thereof, may be recovered before the justices in petty sessions, in the manner prescribed by the Act of the twenty-second year of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter fourteen, and any Acts amending it.

The power given by this section shall be deemed to be in addition to and not in derogation of any other powers to which the Commissioners may be entitled at common law or in equity of recovering any moneys due to them, and the Commissioners may use any such powers accordingly.

5. A certificate, purporting to be under the seal of the Commissioners and to be signed by one of them, stating the amount due to the Commissioners from any person in respect of any loan made to him under the said recited Act or this Act, together with interest thereon, and any costs and charges in respect of such loans or the recovery thereof, shall, until the contrary is proved, be evidence of the amount due and of the liability of the party therein named to pay the same; and it shall be sufficient, notwithstanding any rule, order, or form of procedure in any court whatsoever, if such certificate be produced to the court before which proceedings are instituted for the recovery, of any such sum by any person delegated by the said Commissioners, or any one of them, to produce such certificate.

6. This Act and the said recited Act may be read and construed as one Act.

And whereas it is expedient to extend the provisions of the said Act to the granting of certificates for all licences for sale of beer by retail for consumption off the premises:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

L Notwithstanding anything in section eight of the Wine and Extension of Beerhouse Act, 1869, or in any other Act now in force, the licensing s to

CHAPTER 45.

An Act to make provision for the transfer of the Assets and Liabilities of the Provident Branch of the Bombay Civil Pund and other funds to the Secretary of State for India in Council.

[18th August 1882.]

WHEREAS an institution known as the Provident Branch of the Bombay Civil Fund (founded on the Bombay Civil Fund of earlier date) was established in Bombay under the authority given by the Court of Directors of the East India Company in a public despatch to the Governor in Council at Bombay, dated the thirty-first of December one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, the said Provident Branch having a separate capital for making provision for such of the civil servants of the said company as should be obliged by ill-health to leave India either temporarily or permanently, and for the granting of annuities to the widows and children of its members and of portions for the children of members, and the said fund was supported by the subscriptions of the civil servants of the said company and by certain contributions from the said company:

And whereas in a financial despatch to the Government of India, dated the twenty-first of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, certain changes respecting the grant of annuities to widows were authorised by the Secretary of State for India in Council, and certain terms were stated on which the Secretary of State for India in Council was willing to take over the assets, liabilities, and management of the said institution:

And whereas in accordance with the instructions contained in the aforesaid despatch the Government of India caused the inquiry to be made, whether upon the terms offered by the Secretary of State for India in Council in the said despatch the subscribers to the said fund were willing to surrender the accumulated fund to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the proposition so to make over the accumulated fund on the terms offered by the Secretary of State for India in Council was carried in the affirmative by the subscribers by a large majority of votes:

And whereas in order to avoid any doubt that may arise in regard to the legality of such transfer it is necessary to make provision by law for enabling the trustees of the said fund to transfer the assets and liabilities thereof to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and for enabling the Secretary of State for India in Council to accept the same:

Ch. 45.

(a.) That the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring on the last gale day of the tenancy in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one (which year of the tenancy is in this Act referred to as “ the year expiring as aforesaid ”) has been satisfied on or before the thirtieth day of ^November one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two; and (6.) That antecedent arrears of rent are due to the landlord; and (c.) That the tenant is unable to discharge such antecedent arrears, without loss of his holding, or deprivation of the means necessary for the cultivation thereof, the Irish Land Commission (in this Act referred to as the Land Commission) may make an order for the payment to or for the benefit of the landlord of a sum equal to one half of such antecedent arrears, subject to the limitation that the sum so paid shall not exceed the yearly rent payable in respect of the holding for the year of the tenancy next preceding the year expiring as aforesaid:

(4.) A remission by the landlord of the whole or any part of the rent payable in respect of the year expiring as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a satisfaction of the amount of rent so remitted; provided that no remission made for any previous year shall be credited to the year expiring as aforesaid.

(5.) The Land Commission, if satisfied on the occasion of any application made under this Act that it is just so to do, may authorise the tenant to make to the Land Commission any payments on account of the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring as aforesaid which the tenant might otherwise have made to the landlord, and such payment shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been made to the landlord, and the Land Commission shall, having first given public notice in the prescribed manner, cause any sum so paid by the tenant to be paid to the person appearing to such Commission to be entitled thereto as landlord.

Whereas by section fifty-nine of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, it is provided, that where it appeared to the court, on the joint application made on or before the twenty-eighth day of February one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, of the landlord and tenant of any holding valued at a sum not exceeding thirty pounds a year, that the tenant had paid the whole of the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring on the gale day next before the twenty-second day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and that antecedent arrears were due, the Land Commission might make in respect of such antecedent arrears an advance of a sum not exceeding one year’s rent of the holding and not exceeding half the antecedent arrears, and thereupon the court should by order declare the holding to be charged with the repayment to the Land Commission of the said advance by a rent-charge payable and calculated as in the said section mentioned:

And whereas in pursuance of the said section divers advances have been made in respect of the arrears of rent on divers holdings, and such holdings have been charged with the repayment of the said advances by such rentcharges as in the said section mentioned, and it is expedient to amend the said section: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where in pursuance of section fifty-nine of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, an advance has. been made, before the passing of this Act, towards the payment of the arrears due in respect of any holding, and a rentcharge has been charged on such holding for the repayment of such advance, the Land Commission, if it is proved to their satisfaction on the application of either the landlord or the tenant of the holding that the tenant was, at the date of the said advance being made, unable to discharge the arrears in respect of which the advance was made, may by order cancel the said rent-charge, and the same shall cease to be payable, whether by the landlord or the tenant, as from the last day appointed for payment of the same next before the date of the order, and the amount of the said advance shall be a charge on the Irish Church Temporalities Fund.

16. Where it appears to the Land Commission, on the joint application of the landlord and tenant of any such holding valued

Ch. 47.

Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882.

at a sum not exceeding fifty pounds a year, that the tenant has paid the whole (or such sum as the landlord may be willing to accept in full discharge of the whole) of the rent payable in respect of the year of the tenancy expiring as aforesaid, and that the tenant has obtained a receipt in full for such rent, and that antecedent arrears are due, the Land Commission may make to the landlord, in respect of such antecedent arrears, an advance of a sum not exceeding one year’s rent of the holding, and not exceeding half the antecedent arrears, and thereupon the court shall by order declare the holding to be charged with the repayment of the advance to the Land Commission, by a rentcharge payable half-yearly on the first day of January and the first day of July during the thirty-five years from the date specified in the order, and calculated at the rate of five pounds by the hundred, by the year, of the advance.

The charge declared by the order as aforesaid shall have priority over all charges affecting the holding, except quit-rent and crown rent, and sums payable to the Commissioners of Public Works, and shall be payable by the tenant of the holding for the time being, and shall be levied and collected in manner herein-after provided; and in the event of the tenant failing to pay any half-yearly instalment of the said charge for the space of twelve months after the same shall have accrued due, then and in every such case the amount of such instalments, together with the entire of the unpaid residue of such charge, with interest as ascertained by the Land Commission, shall forthwith be payable by the tenant, and the amount thereof shall be raised by sale of the tenancy in the prescribed manner.

The half-yearly instalments of such charge shall be from time to time collected by the collector authorised to collect poor rate in the electoral division in which such holding is situate; and for the purpose of such collection every collector shall have all such powers and authorities as he shall for the time being possess for collecting and recovering poor rate, and shall and may collect and levy the same accordingly from the tenant liable to pay the same, notwithstanding that such tenant may not be liable to pay poor rate.

For the purpose of such collection the Land Commission shall, in each half-year, transmit to the clerk of every union, within which any holding or holdings charged as aforesaid shall be situate, a warrant tinder the seal of the Land Commission, setting forth the names of the tenants within such union liable to pay such charges or the instalments thereof, and the amount due by each respectively, and such warrant shall be judicially noticed in all proceedings in court, and shall be conclusive evidence of the arrears due by such tenants respectively, and of their liability to pay the same.

The collector shall be paid by the Land Commission such remuneration, not exceeding one shilling in the pound of his collection, as the Land Commission, with the consent of the Treasury, may determine, and the clerk of the union may be paid such remuneration (if any) as the Land Commission may with the like consent determine.

Every such collector shall pay and account for the sums collected or collectable by him under this Act to the guardians of the union in which such holding is situate in the prescribed form; and the

ICG

4

Ch. 47. Arrears of Rent ()Ac£, 1882. 45 & 46 Vict.

guardians shall transmit the amounts from time to time received by them as aforesaid to the Land Commission under the prescribed regulations.

In the event of such default by the tenant for the space of twelve months as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the county court of the county in which the holding is situate, on the application of the Land Commission, to order a sale of such tenancy, which shall be sold, and the proceeds of such sale dealt with by the said county court in the prescribed manner.

If the proceeds of any such sale fail to realise the amount ascertained by the Land Commission as aforesaid, together with the cost of sale, the amount of the deficiency shall be paid by the landlord of the said holding, and shall be a charge upon his estate and interest therein, and shall be collected and levied in the prescribed manner: Provided, that on any transfer of the tenant’s interest in the holding by sale, the principal sum and interest, if any, remaining due to the Land Commission, shall be paid out of the purchase money to the Land Commission.

On the order of the Land Commission being made as aforesaid in relation to any holding such antecedent arrears shall be deemed to be absolutely released.

The landlord and tenant may agree that any rent paid by the tenant in or subsequent to the year expiring as aforesaid shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have been paid in respect of the rent due for that year, and not in respect of arrears of rent.

Where arrears of rent in respect of a holding are due to some person or persons besides the landlord the advance made under this section shall be rateably distributed amongst the persons entitled thereto.

An application for an advance under this section shall not be made after the periods mentioned in the tenth clause aforesaid.

The omission or refusal by either landlord or tenant of any holding to join with the other of them in obtaining a loan from the Land Commission under this section shall not prejudice any other application or proceeding which either of them may make or institute under this Act or the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, or the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, in relation to such holding.

The Land Commission shall, at such time after the expiration of each period of twelve months as the Treasury may from time to time appoint, make up an account showing for the said period of twelve months the amount of all such payments due to them in respect of rentcharges payable to them under this section as they have failed to recover at the expiration of the said period.

Whenever, in the case of any tenant evicted for nonpayment of rent, or in case the holding of the tenant has been sold and purchased by the landlord, and possession taken thereof by him, since the first day of May one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the landlord agrees to reinstate such tenant on the terms in this section set forth, this section shall apply as if such tenant had not been so evicted from his holding.

Exemption in 17. Where, in the case of a holding of which any person is owner, reject of antecedent arrears of rent due in respect of any year or years, or uponarr^raof portion of a year, have been extinguished in pursuance of this Act,

and any public charge or tax accrued during such year or years, or portion of year or years, is due from such person as or in consequence of his being owner of such holding, then, on proof to the satisfaction of the Land Commission that the owner has, during such time as aforesaid, received no rent, or an amount of rent less than the full rent, such public charges or taxes shall, if no rent has been received, be wholly remitted, and if an amount of rent less than the full rent has been received, be remitted in proportion to the amount of rent not received.

Where a person has paid any public charges or taxes which, if not paid, would be remitted under this section, the amount which would have been so remitted shall be allowed as a deduction from any future payment or payments of the public charges or taxes of the same description, or may be recovered as a debt from the authority to whom it may have been paid.

Any payment which an owner may receive under this Act in respect of arrears of rent shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken into account as rent.

The Land Commission shall ascertain, for the purposes of this section, in such manner as they think best calculated to ascertain the truth, the amount of public charges or taxes due in any year or portion of a year from a person as or in consequence of his being owner of a holding.

4. A savings banks insurance granted to one person may be for any amount not exceeding one hundred pounds.

(2.) A savings banks insurance may be granted to a person not over the age of sixty-five years and not under the age of fourteen years, or if the amount does not exceed five pounds, not under the age of eight years.

Regulations may be made, in pursuance of the said section sixteen of the Government Annuities Act, 1864, as amended by this Act, by the National Debt Commissioners, with the approval of the Treasury, so far as regards any annuities and insurances granted by such Commissioners either directly or through any parochial or other society.

1882.

305

Govei'nment Annuities Act, 1882. Ch. 51.

maximum amount which otherwise is allowed to be deposited in a savings bank, either in any one savings bank year or in the aggregate, such excess shall bear no interest, but shall be forthwith applied to the purpose for which it was deposited, or paid over to the depositor.

(2.) A savings bank annuity or insurance depending on the life of any person may be granted to that person jointly with any other persons to an amount not exceeding in the whole the amount of the annuity or insurance which could have been granted to one person, and the said persons shall be deemed to be entitled to such annuity and insurance as joint tenants.

(3.) The National Debt Commissioners may permit the transfer of any annuity so granted to more persons than one under such regulations, as to such Commissioners seem fit, so however that the person on whose life such annuity is granted shall be transferee, or one of the transferees, and where it is granted on the joint lives of two or more persons, all of those persons, or such of those persons as the National Debt Commissioners think fit, shall be the transferees or included among the transferees.

Where an order of the local authority for pulling down an obstructive building is made under this section and is not appealed against, or if appealed against is confirmed, the local authority shall be deemed to be authorised to purchase the lands on which the obstructive building is erected in like manner as if they had been authorised by a special Act to purchase the same; and for the purpose of such purchase the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Acts amending the same with respect to

1882.

Artizans' Dwellings Act 1882. Ch. 54. 32D

the purchase and taking of lands otherwise than by agreement shall be deemed to be incorporated in this Act (subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act), and for the purpose of those provisions this Act shall be deemed to be the special Act, and the local authority to be the promoters of the undertaking, and such lands may be purchased at any time within one year after the date of the order, or if it was appealed against after the date of the confirmation.

(5.) The owner of the lands may within one month after notice to purchase the same is served upon him declare that he desires to retain the site of the obstructive building and undertake either to pull down or to permit the local authority to pull down the obstructive building, and in such case the owner shall retain the site and shall receive compensation from the local authority for the pulling down of the obstructive building.

(6.) The amount of such compensation, and also the amount of any compensation to be paid on the purchase of any lands under this section, shall in case of difference be settled by arbitration in manner provided by section seven of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act, 1879, as amended by this part of this Act.

(7.) Where the owner retains the site or any part thereof section twenty-three of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, shall apply to such site.

(8.) Where the lands are purchased by the local authority the local authority shall pull down the obstructive building, or such part thereof as may be obstructive within the meaning of this section, and keep as an open space the whole site, or such part thereof as may be required to be kept open for the purpose of remedying the evils caused by such obstructive building, and may, with the assent of the confirming authority and upon such terms as such authority thinks expedient, permit such portion of the site to be sold as is not required for the purpose of carrying this section into effect.

Where in the opinion of the arbitrator the demolition of an obstructive building adds to the value of such other buildings as are in that behalf mentioned in this section, the arbitrator shall apportion so much of the compensation to be paid for the demolition of the obstructive building as may be equal to the increase in value of the other buildings amongst such other buildings respectively, and the amount apportioned to each such other building in respect of its increase in value by reason of the demolition of such obstructive building shall be deemed to be private improvement expenses incurred by the local authority in respect of such building, . and such local authority may, for the purpose of defraying such expenses, make and levy improvement rates on the occupier of such premises accordingly; and the provisions of the Public Health Act, 885 & 39 Vict* 1875, relating to private improvement expenses and to private im- c* provement rates shall, so far as circumstances admit, apply accordingly in the same manner as if such provisions were incorporated in this Act, and the said provisions shall be deemed to extend to the city of London and to the metropolis, and in the construction of the said provisions, as respects the city of London the Commissioners

If any dispute arises between the owner or occupier of any building (to which any amount may be apportioned in respect of private improvement expenses) and the arbitrator by whom such apportionment is made, such dispute shall be settled by two justices in manner provided by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, in cases where the compensation claimed in respect of lands does not exceed fifty pounds.

Where an officer of health in pursuance of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, has reported any premises as unfit for human habitation, or in pursuance of this part of this Act has reported that the pulling down of any obstructive building would be expedient, the board of guardians in whose union or parish, or the owner of any property in the neighbourhood of which such premises or buildings are situate, may complain to the Metropolitan Board of Works that the local authority have failed to put in force the provisions of the said Acts in respect of such premises or buildings, and the Metropolitan Board of Works may, if they think it expedient so to do, thereupon proceed under section twelve of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act, 1879, and that section shall apply as if it were enacted in this part of this Act and in terms made applicable to the duties of local authorities under this part of this Act *

2. Where any part of a parish is isolated or detached from the other part or parts of the parish, and is wholly surrounded by another parish, such part shall, from and after the twenty-fifth day of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, be amalgamated with the last-mentioned parish in the same manner and with the same consequences and limitations in every respect, subject nevertheless as herein-after mentioned, as if the amalgamation had been effected by an order of the Local Government Board under the principal Act, and such part shall be deemed to be within the same county as the parish with which it is amalgamated.

Provided as follows:

(1.) If two or more isolated or detached parts of parishes adjoin each other, and such parts together are wholly surrounded by another parish, the same shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed one isolated or detached part.

(3.) This section shall not apply to any parish situate wholly or partly in the metropolis.

3. Where the parish with which any such isolated or detached part of a parish as aforesaid becomes amalgamated, under the provisions of this Act, is not a place separately maintaining its own highways, or entitled to return a separate waywarden to a highway board, the Local Government Board may deal with such parish for highway purposes by an order in like manner as they would have been enabled to deal with the same by a supplemental order under section seven of the Poor Law Act, 1879, if the amalgamation had been effected prior to the passing of that Act by an order under the principal Act.

4. If the population of any such isolated or detached part of a parish as aforesaid exceeds three hundred persons, one tenth in number and rateable value of the persons appearing on the rate in force for the time being to be rated to the relief of the poor in respect of property within such part may apply to the Local Government Board, in writing, on or before the first day of December next, to have the same declared to be a separate parish, and the Board may by order either dismiss the application or constitute such part a separate parish from and after a day to be fixed by the order; and if an order is made dismissing the application, section two of this Act shall not take effect with respect to such part until such order is made.

An order constituting a parish under this section shall have the same consequences and may contain the same provisions as if the same were made under the principal Act, but section two of that Act shall not apply to such order.

9. Where the Local Government Board, by order, under section six of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 18G7, have altered, or shall hereafter alter, any district formed under that Act, they may ascertain the proportionate value of the property and the amount of the obligations of every parish or union affected by the change, and may fix the amount to be received, or paid, or secured to be paid by every such parish or union.

10. If, for the purpose of giving effect to any adjustment which the Local Government Board are authorised or required to make under the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, or the Acts amending the same, it is necessary that a separate rate should be levied on part of a parish only, the Board may in the order of adjustment direct such rate to be made, and the same shall be assessed, made, allowed, published, collected, and levied in the same manner and by the same persons as if it were a poor rate and extended to the whole parish.

11. It shall not be incumbent on the Local Government Board to make an adjustment under the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, or the Acts amending the same, in any case where the circumstances appear to them to render such adjustment inexpedient or unnecessary.

12. Where, under the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, or any of the Acts amending the same, the consent in writing of a majority of the guardians of a union or the managers of a school district is required it shall be deemed a sufficient compliance with such requirement if a resolution giving consent is passed at a meeting of the guardians or managers, of which meeting, and of the business to be transacted thereat, not less than fourteen days notice shall be given to each guardian or manager.

13. The guardians of any union who send any pauper child to a school certiffed under the Act of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter forty-three, may pay the reasonable expenses incurred in the maintenance, clothing, and education of such child whilst in such school to an amount not exceeding such rate of payment as may be sanctioned by the Local Government Board for pauper children sent to such school, anything contained in the said Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

(d) such purposes have become prejudicial to the public welfare:

(2.) The proportion of the endowment or annual income for the time being so applicable to such other charitable uses shall be deemed to be the proportion which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is the proportion which has according to the average of such number of years as the Commissioners shall determine been appropriated as regards capital or applied as regards income to such uses, or if that proportion differs from the proportion which ought to have been so appropriated or applied according to the express directions of the instrument of foundation or the decree of any competent court or the statutes or regulations governing such endowment, the proportion applicable to such other charitable uses shall be the proportion which ought, according to the express directions of such instrument, or such decree or such statutes or regulations, to have been appropriated or applied to such other charitable uses:

(5.) When any portion of the endowment or the annual income of such portion has been accumulated and not applied to any purpose, the Commissioners shall determine whether and in what proportion such portion or income is to be considered for the purposes of this section as having been appropriated or applied for educational purposes or for other charitable uses.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the Commissioners shall have power by any scheme to deal with such endowment, and with the governing body thereof, in the same manner in all respects as if the whole of it were an educational endowment.

11. Any governing body having an endowment or fund which is not an educational endowment within the meaning of this Act, if there are no persons who are entitled to benefit out of the endowment, or if the purposes of the endowment have failed altogether, or have become obsolete or useless, or are otherwise sufficiently provided for, or are insignificant in comparison with the magnitude of the endowment, or are, in the opinion of such governing body, not substantially beneficial to the class of persons for whom such endowment was originally intended, or if it has been found impossible, either from the inadequacy of the endowment, or the impracticable character of the founders’ intentions, to carry these intentions into effect, may intimate in writing to the Commissioners their assent to the endowment being deemed to be,

As soon as may be after the expiration of the said two months, or the holding of such inquiry by the Commissioners, or the receipt by the Commissioners of the report of the assistant commissioner on the local inquiry held by him (as the case may be), the Commissioners shall proceed to consider any objections made to them in writing respecting the draft scheme, and any amendments proposed thereon, and the report (if any), and thereupon they shall, if they think fit, frame a scheme in such form as they think expedient, and submit it for the approval of the Scotch Education Department, provided that where a scheme has been prepared and submitted in pursuance of this Act to the Commissioners, before the Commissioners have prepared the draft of a scheme, the Commissioners shall, if requested by the governing body who submitted it, submit such scheme with their own to the Scotch Education Department.

26. The Scotch Education Department, as soon as a scheme is submitted to them, shall, before approving the same, cause the scheme, or a proper abstract thereof, to be published in such manner as they think sufficient for giving information to all persons interested, together with a notice stating that during two months after the first publication of such notice the Scotch Education Department will receive any objections made to them in writing by any public body or persons interested respecting such scheme.

After the expiration of the said two months, unless a case has been submitted to the Court of Session within the time and in the manner herein-after provided, the Scotch Education Department may, if they think fit, approve the scheme or may remit the scheme, with such declaration as the nature of the case seems to them to require, to the Commissioners, and if they remit the scheme with a declaration the provisions contained in the immediately succeeding section shall apply.

The Scotch Education Department as soon as they approve a scheme shall forthwith, in such manner as they think sufficient for giving information to all persons interested, publish a notice that the scheme has been approved by them, and that unless within two months after the first publication of such notice a petition is presented to the Scotch Education Department as in this section men-

27. Where a scheme is remitted with a declaration the Scotch Education Department shall transmit to the Commissioners any objections made to them in writing respecting such scheme, and the Commissioners may thereupon proceed to prepare an amended scheme and may submit the same for the approval of the Scotch Education Department in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as are in this Act provided in the case of the approval of a scheme, and so on from time to time as often as occasion may require.

28. A scheme of the Commissioners shall not be submitted to the Scotch Education Department unless a majority of the Commissioners for the time being have signified in writing their approval of such scheme, but in all other respects three Commissioners may act under this Act.

29. The majority of members of a governing body who are present at a meeting of their body duly constituted shall have power to do anything that may be required to be done by a governing body for the purposes of this Act: Provided that this power shall be in addition to and not in restraint of any power which any meeting of such governing body may have independently of this Act.

30. —

(1.) If the governing body of any endowment to which a scheme relates, or any person or body corporate directly affected by such scheme, feel aggrieved by the scheme on the ground of the scheme being one which is not within the scope of, or made in conformity with this Act, or

(2.) if any person, holding any office, place, employment, pension, compensation allowance, bursary, or emolument under or arising out of an endowment dealt with by the scheme, feel aggrieved by the scheme on the ground that it does not save or make due compensation, as required by this Act, for his vested interests, — such governing body, person, or body corporate may, within one month after the first publication of the scheme or amended scheme, submit a case to the Court of Session, to which the Commissioners shall and any others directly interested may be parties, for the opinion of the said Court on the question or questions therein stated, and if the Court is of opinion that the scheme is contrary to law on any of the grounds in this section mentioned, the Scotch Education Department shall not approve thereof, but they may, if they think fit, remit the same to the Commissioners with a declaration as herein-before provided.

3L In any proceeding before the Court of Session authorised by this Act, the judgment or deliverance of the Court shall be final and not subject to review; and the Court shall dispose of all questions of expenses, and may, if they think fit, direct the expenses or any part thereof (including the expenses of the Commissioners) to be paid out of the funds of the educational endowment to which the proceeding relates: Provided always, that it shall not be lawful for the Court to find the Commissioners liable in expenses.

32. If at the expiration of the time for a petition to the Scotch Education Department praying that a scheme be laid before Parliament no such petition has been presented, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to declare her approbation of such scheme without the same being laid before Parliament.

If any such petition has been presented, the Scotch Education Department shall, as soon as may be, cause the scheme to be laid before both Houses of Parliament; and after it has Jain two months before Parliament, then, unless within such two months an address has been presented by one or other of the said Houses praying Her Majesty to withhold her consent from such scheme or any part thereof, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by Order in Council to declare her approbation of such scheme or any part thereof, to which such address does not relate.

A scheme when approved by Her Majesty in Council shall have full operation and effect from the date of such Order in Council, in the same manner as if it had been enacted in this Act; and thereupon every Act of Parliament, letters patent, statute, deed, instrument, trust, or direction relating to the subject-matter of the scheme, so far as inconsistent with the provisions thereof, shall be repealed and abrogated.

33. In the case of endowments belonging to any State-aided school or to any public school under the Education (Scotland) Acts, 1872 and 1878, of less annual value than fifty pounds, the procedure herein-before prescribed shall not apply, if the governing body of such endowment or the school board, as the case may be, frame and submit to the Scotch Education Department a scheme respecting such endowment.

The Scotch Education Department may approve such scheme with or without any modifications as they think fit.

In framing and approving such scheme the same powers may be exercised, and subject to the same conditions, as nearly as may be, as in the case of any scheme under this Act; and such scheme, when approved by the Scotch Education Department, shall have effect as if it were a scheme approved by Order in Council under this Act.

34. Schemes may be from time to time framed and approved for amending any scheme approved under this Act, and all the provisions ‘ of this Act relative to an original scheme shall apply also to an amending scheme, mutatis mutandis.

Session may on summary application by the Commissioners grant a second warrant of citation and diligence in ordinary form, or make such other order as may be necessary.

This section shall authorise the citation and examination of witnesses and the recovery and inspection of documents before an assistant commissioner; and any assistant commissioner may administer an oath or affirmation, as the case may be, to any witness or haver.

18. A bill may be accepted —

(1.) before it has been signed by the drawer, or while otherwise incomplete:

(2.) When it is overdue, or after it has been dishonoured by a previous refusal to accept, or by non-payment:

(3.) When a bill payable after sight is dishonoured by non-acceptance, and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any different agreement, is entitled to have the bill accepted as of the date of first presentment to the drawee for acceptance.

19. (1.) An acceptance is either (a) general or (h) qualified.

(2.) A general acceptance assents without qualification to the

order of the drawer. A qualified acceptance in express terms varies the effect of the bill as drawn.

In particular an acceptance is qualified which is —

(a.) conditional, that is to say, which makes payment by the acceptor dependent on the fulfilment of a condition therein stated:

(6.) partial, that is to say, an acceptance to pay part only of the amount for which the bill is drawn:

(c.)- local, that is to say, an acceptance to pay only at a particular specified place:

An acceptance to pay at a particular place is a general acceptance, unless it expressly states that the bill is to be paid there only and not elsewhere:

(d.) qualified as to time:

(e.) the acceptance of some one or more of the drawees, but not of all.

20. (1.) Where a simple signature on a blank stamped paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a prima facie authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount the stamp will cover, using the signature for that of the drawer, or the acceptor, or an indorser; and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a prima facie authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.

(2.) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given. Reasonable time for this purpose is a question of fact.

Provided that if any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

21. (1.) Every contract on a bill, whether it be the drawer’s, the acceptor’s, or an indorser’s, is incomplete and revocable, until delivery of the instrument in order to give effect thereto.

Provided that where an acceptance is written on a bill, and the drawee gives notice to or according to the directions of the person entitled to the bill that he has accepted it, the acceptance then becomes complete and irrevocable.

But if the bill be in the hands of a holder in due course a valid delivery of the bill by all parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him is conclusively presumed.

(3.) Where a bill is no longer in the possession of a party who has signed it as drawer, acceptor, or indorser, a valid and unconditional delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.

Capacity and Authority of Parties.

Provided that nothing in this section shall enable a corporation to make itself liable as drawer, acceptor, or indorser of a bill unless it is competent to it so to do under the law for the time being in force relating to corporations.

(2.) Where a bill is drawn or indorsed by an infant, minor, or corporation having no capacity or power to incur liability on a bill, the drawing or indorsement entitles the holder to receive payment of the bill, and to enforce it against any other party thereto.

24. Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a Forged or bill is forged or placed thereon without the authority of the person JJ^ature6^ whose signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signa- hSaqjZ flfl /$j' ture is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the bill or to give\... . /ik

Value and holder for value.

(2.) In determining whether a signature on a bill is that of the principal or that of the agent by whose hand it is written, the construction most favourable to the validity of the instrument shall be adopted.

The Consideration for a Bill.

27. (1.) Valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted by —

(a.) Any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract;

(b.) An antecedent debt or liability. Such a debt or liability is deemed valuable consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at a future time.

(2.) Where value has at any time been given for a bill the holder is deemed to be a holder for value as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill who became parties prior to such time.

(3.) Where the holder of a bill has a lien on it arising either from contract or by implication of law, he is deemed to be a holder for value to the extent of the sum for which he has a lien.

Holder in due course.

28. (1.) An accommodation party to a bill is a person who has signed a bill as drawerr acceptor, or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending hTs nallie to some other ^person.

(2.) An accommodation party is liable on the bill to a holder for value; and it is immaterial whether, when such holder took the bill, he knew such party to be an accommodation party or not

29. (1.) A holder in due course is a holder who has taken a bill, complete and regular- on the' lace of it, under the following conditions; namely,

(a.) That he became the holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously dishonoured, if such was the fact:

(b.) That he took the bill in good faith and for value, and that at the time the bill was negotiated to him he had no notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it.

(2.) In particular the title of a person who negotiates a bill is defective within the meaning of this Act when he obtained the bill, or the acceptance thereof, by fraud, duress, or force and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a fraud.

(3.) A holder (whether for value or not), who derives his title to a bill through a holder in due course, and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality affecting it, has all the rights ot that holder in due course as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill prior to that holder.

subsequent to the alleged fraud or illegality, value has in good faith been given for the bill.

Negotiation of Bills.

. 3L (1.) A bill is negotiated when it is transferred from one Negotiation of

person to another in such a manner as to constitute the transferee bil1-

the holder of the bill.

(2.) A bill payable to bearer is negotiated by delivery.

(3.) A bill payable to order is negotiated by the indorsement of

the holder completed by delivery.

(4.) Where the holder of a bill payable to his order transfers it for value without indorsing it, the transfer gives the transferee such title as the transferor had in the bill, and the transferee in addition acquires the right to have the indorsement of the transferor.

(5.) Where any person is under obligation to indorse a till in a representative capacity, he may indorse the bill in such terms as to negative personal liability.

32. An indorsement in order to operate as a negotiation must Requisites of a

comply with the following conditions, namely, — mentmdorsc '

(1.) It must be written on the bill itself and be signed by the indorser. The simple signature of the indorser on the bill, without additional words, is sufficient.

An indorsement written on an allonge, or on a “ copy ” of a bill \

issued or negotiated in a coflU ll'y“tohere “ copies ” are recognised, is deemed to be written on the bill itself.

(2.) It must be an indorsement of the entire bill. A partial in- | dorsement, that is to say, an indorsement which purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer the bill to two or more indorsees severally does not operate as a negotiation of the bill.

(3.) Where a bill is payable to the order of two or more payees or indorsees who are not partners all must indorse, unless the one indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.

(4.) Where, in a bill payable to order, the payee or indorsee is wrongly designated, or his name is mis-spelt, he may indorse the bill as therein described, adding, if he think fit, his proper signature.

(5.) Where there are two or more indorsements on a bill, each indorsement is deemed to have been made in the order in which it appears on the bill, until the contrary is proved.

(6.) An indorsement may be made in blank or special. It may also contain terms making it restrictive.

33. Where a bill purports to be indorsed conditionally the con- Conditional dition may be disregarded by the payer, and payment to the indorsement, indorsee is valid whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.

writing above the indorser’s signature a direction to pay the bill to or to the order of himself or some other person.

35. (1.) An indorsement is restrictive which prohibits the further negotiation of the bill or which expresses that it is a mere authority to deal with the bill as thereby directed and not a transfer of the ownership thereof, as, for example, if a bill be indorsed “ Pay D. only, ” or “ Pay D. for the account of X., ” or “ Pay D. or order for collection.”

(2.) A restrictive indorsement gives the indorsee the right to receive payment of the bill and to sue any party thereto that his indorser could have sued, but gives him no power to transfer his rights as indorsee unless it expressly authorise him to do so.

(3.) Where a restrictive indorsement authorises further transfer, all subsequent indorsees take the bill with the same rights and subject to the same liabilities as the first indorsee under the restrictive indorsement.

36. (1.) Where a bill is negotiable in its origin it continues to be negotiable until it has been (a) restrictively indorsed or (6) discharged by payment or otherwise.

(2.) Where an overdue bill is negotiated, it can only be negotiated sqbiect to any defect of title atiecting it at its maturity]" and thenceforward no person who takes~it^anriccquire^)r give a better title than that which the person from whom he took it had.

(3.) A bill payable on demand is deemed to be overdue within the meaning and for the purposes, of this section, when it appears on the face of it to have been in circulation for an unreasonable length of time. What is an unreasonable length of time for this purpose is a question of fact.

(4.) Except where an indorsement bears date after the maturity of the bill, every negotiation is prima facie deemed to have been effected before the bill was overdue.

(5.) Where a bill which is not overdue has been dishonoured any person who takes it with notice of the dishonour takes it subject to any defect of title attaching thereto at the time of dishonour, but nothing in this sub-section shall affect the rights of a holder in due course.

37. Where a bill is negotiated back to the drawer, or to a prior indorser or to the acceptor, such party may, subject to the provisions of this Act, re-issue and further negotiate the bill, but he is not entitled to enforce payment of the bill against any intervening party to whom he was previously liable.

38. The rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follows:

(1.) Helnay sue on the bill in his own name: " —

(2.) Where he is a holder in due course, he holds the bUFfree from any defect of title of prior parties, as well as from mere personal defences available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment against all parties liable on the bill:

(3.) Where his title is defective (a) if he negotiates the bill to a holder in due course, that holder obtains a good and complete title to the bill, and (b) if he obtains payment of the bill the person who pays him in due course gets a valid discharge for the bill.

1881, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of four hundred thousand pounds may be issued out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, in manner provided by the said Act, and such sums may be issued during the period ending on the day on which a further Act providing money for the purpose of such advances or purchases comes into operation.

The Treasury may, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided by the said Act, borrow the sum authorised by this section to be issued out of the Consolidated Fund, or any part of that sum.

6. Whereas by a Bill pending in Parliament for an Act to be called the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act, 1882, it is provided that the liabilities incurred by the Irish Land Commission as therein mentioned should be primarily charged on the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, and, subject thereto, on the Consolidated Fund in such manner as might thereafter be provided by Parliament.

And whereas it is expedient to make provision for the discharge of such liabilities in the event of the said Bill being passed: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) In the event of the said Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act,

1882, being passed, the Irish Land Commission, for the purpose of meeting orders for payment made under the said Act, and of making advances, and of paying money for grants under the said Act, and generally of discharging the liabilities incurred by them under that Act, may, with the consent of the Treasury, from time to time borrow, on the security [of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, such sums not exceeding in the whole two million six hundred thousand pounds, and at such rate and on such terms as may be sanctioned by the Treasury.

(2.) The Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt may, if they think fit, with the approval of the Treasury, out of any money in their hands on account of savings banks, lend to the Irish Land Commission, with such guarantee as is by this section

395

1882. Public Works Loans Act, 1882. Ch. 62.

authorised, but not otherwise, the whole or any part of the money which by this section the Irish Land Commission are authorised to borrow.

(3.) For the purpose of giving effect to the charge by the said Act on the Consolidated Fund, the Treasury may from time to time guarantee, in such form as they think expedient, the payment of the principal and interest of all or any part of the money for the time being borrowed by the Irish Land Commission in pursuance of this section.

(4.) Any security given by the Irish Land Commission in pursuance of this section shall be in such form and contain such provisions as the Treasury may approve.

(5.) The Treasury may from time to time, if required, for the purpose of giving effect to any such guarantee as aforesaid, issue out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, such sums as may be necessary for the payment of the principal and interest guaranted by them, or of any part thereof; but any money so issued shall be repaid to the Consolidated Fund out of any surplus of the funds in the hands of the Irish Land Commission on account of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund.

(6.) For the purposes of this section, the Irish Church Temporalities Fund means the fund under the control of the Irish Land Commission under the provisions of the Irish Church Act Amendment Act, 1881.

PART IV.

Amendment of Acts.

7. Whereas under the General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, the Board of Trade can make a provisional order, subject to confirmation by Parliament, authorising the construction of a harbour, pier, or other works within the meaning of the said Act, and authorising the promoters to raise a loan to the amount specified in the order for the purpose of such harbour, pier, or works, and in many cases where the promoters are a public body difficulties arise in raising such loan on account of the defective security, while the construction of the said harbour, pier, or works is of so great importance to the inhabitants of the town or place where the same are to be constructed that they would be willing to guarantee the loan, if power were given for this purpose, and it is expedient to provide for the conferring of such power by the provisional order: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) Where a provisional order under the General Pier and Harbour Act, 1861, authorises any public body to raise a loan for the construction of any works as defined by that Act in any place, the same or any other order may authorise any rating authority as herein-after defined in that place, under the circumstances and subject to the conditions specified in the order, to charge, if they think it expedient for the inhabitants at large of such place, any fund or rate under their control for the purpose of aiding the public body in raising the said loan, or any part thereof, from the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and to give such aid by guaranteeing the principal and interest

of the loan or by borrowing the sum required and advancing it to the public body, or partly in one way and partly in the other, or otherwise in manner provided by the order.

(2.) The order shall provide that the resolution of the rating authority to give the guarantee shall be a special resolution, that is to say, a resolution passed at one meeting of such authority and published in manner directed by the order, so as to give notice to all persons interested, and confirmed at a second meeting of the rating authority held not less than fourteen days after the first of such public notices has been given, and not less than three months after the meeting at which the resolution was passed.

(3.) The order shall provide for the time within which and the mode in which ony money borrowed by the rating authority is to be repaid, and for the effectual recovery out of the said fund or rate of any sum payable under the guarantee, and of the principal and interest of any money borrowed by the said authority, and for the reimbursement of the fund or rate out of the income of the said works, or otherwise by the said public body, and shall contain such incidental provisions as seem necessary or proper for carrying this section into effect.

(4.) The promoters of an order proposing to confer power under this section on any rating authority shall, a reasonable time before they apply to the Board of Trade to settle the order, submit to the Local Government Board, or as regards Scotland to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, a statement of such proposal, and if the Local Government Board, or Secretary of State for the Home Department, declare that in their opinion, having regard to the financial condition of the rating authority, or to the necessity for such rating authority to provide a water supply or drainage for the inhabitants of the said place, or otherwise to fulfil the original duties of such authority, it is inexpedient to burden such rating authority with any such charge as is mentioned in such proposal, the Board of Trade in settling the order shall omit any provision conferring power on the rating authority under this section.

In this section, —

The expression “public body” means any rating authority, also any commissioners, or trustees, or other body or person who manage or undertake the works without any view to the payment of any dividend or profits out of the revenue from such works:

The expression “rating authority” means —

(1.) As regards England, any authority being an urban sanitary authority under the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Acts amending the same; and (2.) As regards Scotland, the town council or commissioners of police of, or other local authority having power to levy assessments in, any royal or parliamentary burgh, or in any populous place the boundaries whereof have been fixed and ascertained under the General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act, 18C2, or under the Act therein recited or under any local Act; and

8. Where after the passing of this Act any money is advanced Accountt to by the Public Works Loan Commissioners on the security of a rate ©insecurity of as defined by the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, the borrowers rate, shall cause their treasurer to keep a separate account under the title of the Public Works Loan Commissioners Loan Account, or such other title as may be approved by the Local Government Board, and shall cause all the said advances to be carried to the credit of that account, and all orders or other documents directing payments out of such account shall show on the face of them that the payment is to be made out of that account, and an order or other document for a payment out of the said account shall not be made or given except the payment is for a purpose for which the said advances were made.

9. Section thirteen of the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, and section eleven of the Public Works Loans (Ireland) Act, 1877 (which provided for annual and quarterly statements from borrowers of the amounts which they will probably apply to borrow), are hereby repealed.

10. Whereas by section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, it is provided that any advance made by the Irish Land Commission for the purpose therein mentioned shall be repaid by an annuity in favour of the Land Commission for thirty-five years of five pounds for every one hundred pounds of such advance, and so in proportion for any less sum, and further that every such advance shall be secured to the Commission either in such manner as may be agreed upon or in manner provided by Part Three of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872.

. And whereas in pursuance of the last-mentioned Acts the annuity is repayable by equal half-yearly payments on the first day of May and the first day of November in every year, and the necessary apportionment is made in respect of the first and last of such payments.

And whereas it is expedient to make such different provision respecting the said annuity as herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where any advance repayable by an annuity under section twenty-eight of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, has either before or after the passing of this Act been secured in manner provided by Part Three of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1872, the first half-yearly payment of the annuity shall, where the advance is not made on one of the gale days (namely, the first day of May or the first day of November), be due and paid on the second of such gale days after the date of the advance, and together with such first half-yearly payment there shall be due and paid an additional sum for interest on the advance at the rate of three and a half per cent, per annum from the date of the advance, until the first gale day next after that date.

Bay sums amounting in the whole to sixty-two thousand pounds,

which sums were expended on a breakwater and works for the harbour, and, with interest at the rate of three and a quarter per cent, per annum, are repayable out of the revenues of the harbour by annuities amounting in the whole to two thousand six hundred and forty-two pounds five shillings, and terminating between the years one thousand nine hundred and eighteen and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three; and by the payment of such annuities the capital sum due has been reduced to fifty-seven thousand eight hundred and twenty-one pounds thirteen shillings and twopence.

And whereas the harbour and the revenues thereof were, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, transferred by the British Fisheries Society to the Pulteney Harbour trustees, and the said Act charged the above annuities on the revenue of the harbour next after an annual sum of sixteen hundred pounds for the maintenance and management of the harbour.

And whereas the breakwater and works upon which the said sums were expended have been almost wholly destroyed by the violence of the sea, and in consequence of the injury thereby caused to the harbour and other causes, the revenue of the harbour, upon which the said annuities are charged has been diminishing.

And whereas with a view to the restoration of the said works or other improvement of the harbour, it is expedient to raise further loans and to empower the Treasury, on being satisfied of the circumstances herein-after mentioned, to authorise such postponement of the said annuities due to the Public Works Loan Commissioners, as is herein-after mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

If the Pulteney Harbour trustees satisfy the Treasury that works for the restoration of the destroyed breakwater and works or otherwise for the improvement of Pulteney Harbour would be of public utility, and that such works can be executed for a reasonable sum, the Treasury may authorise the Public Works Loan Commissioners to agree that notwithstanding anything in the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, any loan or loans to be borrowed for the said works should, to such amount (not exceeding the said sum) and on such conditions as may seem expedient, have priority over the advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners before the passing of this Act, and the interest thereon, and may further authorise them to agree with the Pulteney Harbour trustees that the payments on account of the- said advances, and the interest thereon, should be wholly or partly suspended during such number of years as may be agreed upon.

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may advance the said new loan or loans if they are satisfied with the sufficiency of the security for the same, irrespective of the said advances and interest hereby authorised to be postponed.

The rates of salaries so fixed shall be in lieu of those at present in force, and shall take effect from and after the thirtieth day of June one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two. The salaries so appointed shall be in addition to any good service pay at present authorised to be paid.

3. From and after the passing of this Act, the third section of the Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1874, shall, so far as it determines the proportion which county inspectors and sub-inspectors may receive of their salaries on being superannuated, be amended as follows:

(a.) The gratuity referred to in sub-section one of the said section may be granted to any county inspector or sub-inspector whose service has exceeded five years and has been less than ten years.

(6.) The annual pension which may be granted to any county inspector or sub-inspector shall be as follows:

For the purpose of calculating the amount of any pension which may be granted under this Act, the term salary shall include all allowances for lodging, house-rent, and servant: Provided that the allowance in respect of lodging or house-rent shall not exceed one sixth of the actual salary and other emoluments.

In the case of every county inspector and sub-inspector appointed before the passing of this Act to whom the pension granted under this Act is of less amount than might have been granted to him if this Act had not been passed, such annual addition shall be made to the pension granted to him under this Act as shall make it equal to the pension which might have been granted to him if this Act had not been passed.

Provided that no county inspector or sub-inspector appointed before the passing of this Act shall be entitled to receive any pension exceeding the amount which may be granted to him under the scale provided by this Act, or the amount which it would have been lawful to grant to him if this Act had not been passed; but every such county inspector or sub-inspector shall, on retirement, and if otherwise qualified for a pension, be entitled to elect between such amounts respectively.

4.

After the said first day of October every assistant inspector-general, county inspector, and sub-inspector, shall cease to be a member of the force when he fulfils the two following conditions; that is to say, when he attains the specified age for retirement, and when also he has by the length of his service become qualified to receive the maximum pension of the rank and class in which he is then serving; Provided that the second of the said two conditions shall be deemed to be fulfilled in the case of any assistant inspector-general, county inspector, and sub-inspector to whom respectively the Commissioners of the Treasury ori the recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant agree, within six months of the passing of this Act, to grant such maximum pension, notwithstanding that he may not then have served the full number of years which qualify him to receive the same.

by adhesive stamps not appropriated by any word or words on the face of them to any particular description of instrument, and any postage duties to the like amount may be denoted by the same adhesive stamps.

(2.) With a view to exhaust any adhesive postage stamps denoting an amount not exceeding two shillings and sixpence which may have been unissued or unused, such stamps to a proper amount may be used to denote any stamp duties of an amount not exceeding two shillings and sixpence, which may legally be denoted by adhesive stamps not appropriated by any word or words on the face of them to any particular description of instrument.

14. (1.) Where two or more adhesive stamps are used to denote a stamp duty upon an instrument, such instrument is not to be deemed duly stamped unless the person upon whom the duty of cancellation is by law imposed cancels each or every stamp by writing on or across the same his name or initials or the name or initials of his firm, together with the true date of his so writing, so that both or all and every of the stamps may be effectually cancelled and rendered incapable of being used for any other instrument, or for any postal purpose, or unless it is otherwise proved that the stamps appearing on the instrument were affixed thereto at the proper time.

This section shall not exempt any person from any proceeding by indictment or otherwise for any offence which is punishable under the Post Office Acts as defined by the Post Office (Offences) Act, 1837, or otherwise by law, provided that no person shall be liable to be punished more than once for the same offence.

16. From and after the passing of this Act the Public Offices Fees Act, 1879, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein contained, apply and be deemed to have been applicable as from the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, to the stamp duties granted to Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, by an Act passed in the session holden in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the reign of Her Majesty, intituled “ An Act to substitute stamp duties for fees on passing letters patent “ for inventions, and to provide for the purchase for the public use “ of certain indexes of specifications, ” and also to the stamp duty of five pounds on the “ certificate of registration of a design ” granted to Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, by the Stamp Act, 1870, and the said duties shall be deemed to be, and to have been as from the said first day of April, fees payable in a public office and not stamp duties.

17. Whereas by the Canadian Stock Stamp Act, 1874, provision was made for the government of Canada paying capital sums, cal-

culated at the rate therein mentioned, as composition for stamp on certain duty chargeable on transfers of any stock of the government of “ Canada inscribed in books kept in the United Kingdom:37 & 38 Vict.

And whereas after the passing of the above Act the government c*2ft* of Canada issued to the public, with the option of inscription at any time in books kept in the United Kingdom, the loans mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act; and holders of the said loans before the passing of the Inland Revenue Act, 1880, had exercised Js2o.44 Vict* that option to the extent in the said Schedule mentioned, and the government of Canada had paid composition for the stamp duty accordingly:

And whereas by section fifty-four of the Inland Revenue Act,

1880, the amount of the composition for stamp duty chargeable on transfers of stock of the government of Canada and other stock was increased, subject to a proviso that such increased composition should not apply for twelve months in the case of the holders of debentures of the government of a colony who had an option to exchange such debentures within twelve months for colonial stock, to which the Colonial Stock Act, 1877, applied: 405* 41 Vict-

And whereas, having regard to the special circumstances connected with the issue of the stock mentioned in the said Schedule, it is expedient to make for the holders of that stock a similar provision to that made by the above-mentioned proviso in the case of the holders of colonial stock:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Where at any time since the passing of the Inland Revenue Act, 1880, whether before or after the passing of this Act, but before the first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six,

Any part of the loans of the government of Canada mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act, has been inscribed as stock in books kept in the United Kingdom, the government of Canada may pay to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, by way of composition for the stamp duty chargeable on transfers of such stock, a sum calculated at the rate mentioned in the Canadian Stock Stamp Act, 1874, instead of the rate mentioned in the Inland Revenue Act, 1880.

PART III.

National Debt and Miscellaneous.

18. Whereas the full amounts of dividends on the national debt Adjustment of payable at the Bank of England have from time to time been issued *[?J “ from the Exchequer to the Governor and Company of the said mSationTof bank. fractions of a

And whereas fractions of a penny have never been paid by the dividends of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England on account of the National Debt, dividends on the national debt, and the fractions so unpaid have accumulated in the hands of the governor and company of the Bank of England, and such accumulations amount, as shown by the account in the Third Schedule to this Act, to upwards of one hundred and forty thousand pounds.

And whereas the sums issued out of the Exchequer to the governor and company of the Bank of England for payment of the dividends exceed, as shown in the said account, the sums paid for

dividends, and out of the sums so issued a net sum of upwards of seven hundred thousand pounds, as shown by the said account, has been repaid to the Exchequer in pursuance of the enactments referred to in the said Schedule and was on the thirty-first March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two outstanding in the books of the Bank of England.

And whereas it is expedient to make such provision as hereinafter appearing, respecting the said accumulations of fractions of a penny. Be it therefore enacted as follows: —

The governor and company of the Bank of England shall from time to time, when required by the Treasury, certify to the Treasury the amount in their hands arising from fractions of a penny not paid on account of dividends on the national debt, and the Treasury may by warrant direct the said governor and company to repay the same to the Exchequer: Provided that so long as there is an account outstanding of money repaid into the Exchequer, as aforesaid, out of the sums issued for the payment of dividends, the same instead of being repaid shall be written off from the said account, and also from the account of the sums issued from the Exchequer for the payment of the said dividends, and such amount shall be written off as if it had never been issued from the Exchequer.

19. After such date as the Treasury may appoint the dividends payable in respect of the two pounds ten shillings per centum annuities mentioned in the first schedule to the National Debt Act, 1870, shall be paid quarterly, on the fifth day of January, the fifth day of April, the fifth day of July, and the fifth day of October in every year, and the said Act shall be construed accordingly; and references therein to a half year’s dividend shall be construed to refer as regards the two pounds ten shillings per centum annuities to a quarter’s dividend.

Regulations may be made under section thirty-nine of the said Act for carrying into effect such quarterly payments in the case of stock certificates, and for the return of old coupons and the issue of new coupons for that purpose.

20. Whereas under the Acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to this Act (in this section referred to as the Fortification Acts) divers sums amounting in the whole to seven million four hundred and sixty thousand pounds were authorised to be borrowed by the Treasury by the creation of terminable annuities, and to be applied under the direction of one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State towards defraying the expenses of constructing the fortifications mentioned in the Fortification Acts:

And whereas of the above sums the sum of seven million four hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds has been actually raised in pursuance of the Fortification Acts by means of loans from the National Debt Commissioners made on the security of terminable annuities created under the said Acts, and the balance of thirty-five thousand pounds has not been raised:

And whereas out of the sums raised by such loans a balance of four thousand and eighty pounds one shilling and tenpence is unexpended:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the disposal of the said unexpended balance and to extinguish the said power of

431

raising money and creating terminable annuities: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Such portion of the amount raised in pursuance of the Fortification Acts as at the passing of this Act has not been expended shall at such time as the Treasury may direct be paid to the National Debt Commissioners in repayment of an equivalent part of the loans made by them under the said Acts; and so much of the annuities created under the Fortification Acts and standing in the names of those Commissioners as the Controller General or Assistant Controller and the Actuary of the National Debt Office may certify under their hands to be equivalent to the amount of such repayment shall be cancelled in such manner as the Treasury may direct.

All power of raising any money under the Fortification Acts shall cease and the Fortification Acts shall be repealed;

Provided that —

(1.) All annuities created in pursuance of the said Acts shall, save as provided by this section, continue to be charged on the Consolidated Fund and paid as if the said Acts had not been repealed; and

(2.) All land vested in one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State in pursuance of the said Acts shall continue to be vested in such Secretary of State on behalf of Her Majesty.

21. Whereas by divers Acts and lastly by the Friendly Societies 38 & Act, 1875, the societies in those Acts and this Act referred to as c-60, friendly societies are authorised to invest the moneys received from members on account of assurances with the National Debt Commissioners, and to pay such moneys to those Commissioners in sums of not less than fifty pounds, and are entitled to receive receipts for such moneys bearing interest at the following rates; that is to say.

For money invested by any society legally established before the 28th day of July 1828, which invested money with the Commissioners before 23rd July 1855.

For money invested by any society legally established between the 28th day of July 1828, and the 15th day of August 1850, which invested any money with the Commissioners before 23rd July 1855.

For money invested by any society legally established since the 15th day of August 1850.

Guarantee from the Consolidated Fond of moneys due from the National Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies.

Cn^.Revenue, FriendlySocietie8, and National DebtActA5 & 46 Vict.

And whereas the Commissioners have from time to time invested the moneys so paid to them in parliamentary securities to an account entitled the fund for Friendly Societies, but such securities have produced less interest than that to which the societies were entitled as above-mentioned, and thereby there has been, as appears from the returns annually laid before Parliament, a gradually increasing deficiency in the value of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners on the said account to meet the sums due from those Commissioners to the Friendly Societies:

And whereas the Customs, Inland Revenue, and Savings Banks Act, 1877, provided that the National Debt Commissioners shall annually make out an account with respect to the year ending on the twentieth day of November, showing on one side the interest accrued from the said securities, and on the other side the interest paid and credited to Friendly Societies; and further, after reciting that it was intended that where the interest accrued from such securities in any year was insufficient to meet the interest required to be paid and credited, such deficiency should be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, the said Act provided for paying into the Exchequer any surplus of interest received over and above the interest paid and credited:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the payment out of the Consolidated Fund of all capital sums, as well as the interest due from the National? Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies, when the securities held on account of Friendly Societies by the said Commissioners to meet the same have been exhausted:

Be it therefore enacted, as follows:

(1.) Whenever it appears to the Treasury from time to time that by reason of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners on account of Friendly Societies being exhausted, the moneys in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners standing to the credit of the fund for Friendly Societies will be insufficient to meet the sums which are likely to become due from the National Debt Commissioners to Friendly Societies, the Treasury shall provide money to meet the deficiency out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, in such manner as they may think expedient.

(2.) The Treasury may in any financial year borrow all or any part of the moneys issued in that financial year out of the Consolidated Fund, or the growing produce thereof, in pursuance of this Act, by means of a terminable annuity for such period not exceeding eighteen years from the thirty-first day of December next after the passing of this Act as the Treasury think expedient.

shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, and that any sum so paid to the Treasury shall be paid into the Exchequer, and it is expedient to make such other provision respecting the said capital sums as herein-after mentioned; be it therefore enacted as follows:

(1.) The National Debt Commissioners may, on the request of the Treasury, advance out of any funds for the time being in their hands on account of savings banks any capital sum to be paid by the Treasury in pursuance of the Prison (Officers Superannuation)

Act, 1878.

(4.) All capital sums paid to the Treasury by a local authority in pursuance of the Prison (Officers Superannuation) Act, 1878, 38 & 39 Vict, shall be paid to the National Debt Commissioners and shall be c 45, applied by them in like manner as is directed with respect to the old sinking fund by section five of the Sinking Fund Act, 1875.

provided by Parliament not exceeding the sum therein mentioned; and in the case of any annuity payable to an ecclesiastical corporation, the contract for such redemption is made subject to the consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England, and the money for such redemption is to be paid to those Commissioners to be applied under their direction for the benefit of the person entitled thereto.

And whereas any such contract may provide for the said redemption by the transfer of Government securities as therein defined instead of by the payment of a sum of money.

(2.) The Treasury may from time to time borrow from the National Debt Commissioners, and those Commissioners may lend out of the funds in their hands on account of Trustee and Post Office Savings Banks, such capital sum or such Government securities as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect any contract with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners under this section.

(3.) For the purpose of repaying any such loan the Treasury may by warrant under their hands create, and direct the Governor and Company of the Bank of England to inscribe in their books for the National Debt Commissioners, a terminable annuity for a period of ten years from the date of the loan, to be calculated with interest at the rate of not less than three and a half per cent per annum.

(4.) Sections four, five, six, and seven of the Savings Bank Investment Act, 1869, shall apply to every such terminable annuity in like manner as they apply to the terminable annuities created in pursuance of that Act for the National Debt Commissioners.

24. Whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the right of Her Majesty to certain escheats, forfeitures, personal estate of intestates, fines, and recognisances, herein-after mentioned, is vested in Her Majesty in right of Her Crown or in right of Her Duchy of Lancaster, and it is expedient to remove such doubts.

Be it therefore enacted as follows:—

Such rights of Her Majesty as are herein-after mentioned shall be deemed to have been vested in Her Majesty in right of Her Crown

. An Act to make provision for the arrangement of Accounts between the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury and the Secretary of State in Council of India in respect of certain Home Charges for Her Majesty’s Forces serving in India.

[18th August 1882.]

WHEREAS certain home charges of Her Majesty’s forces serving in India payable out of the revenues of India are defrayed in the first instance out of the Exchequer, and under an arrangement in force since the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy advances were from time to time made out of the revenues of India to the Exchequer by way of repayment of those charges, and the actual expenditure was to be subsequently ascertained and adjusted:

And whereas differences have been pending between the Secretary of State for the War Department and the Secretary of State in Council of India which prevented such adjustment, and in consequence the accounts of the said actual expenditure fell into arrear; so that while the claim on the part of the Exchequer for the period from the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy to the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven amounted to three million three hundred and two thousand two hundred and forty-six pounds eleven shillings and eightpence the total amount advanced by way of repayment to the Exchequer out of the revenues of India amounted only to two million eight hundred and ninety thousand pounds, and the balance claimed by the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury as due to the Exchequer, but disputed in part by the Secretary of State in Council of India, amounted to four hundred and twelve thousand two hundred and forty-six pounds eleven shillings and eightpence, which balance was reduced by a subsequent settlement of twenty-one thousand six hundred and thirty-five pounds to a net claim of three hundred and ninety thousand six hundred and eleven pounds eleven shillings and eightpence as due to the Exchequer but in part disputed as before mentioned:

And whereas the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, by a Minute dated the second day of July one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, proposed as an arrangement of the said differences and accounts that the sums actually advanced out of the revenues of India to the Exchequer by way of repayment of the said charges during the years above mentioned should be taken in full discharge of all the claims of the Exchequer upon the revenues of India in respect of the aforesaid charges:

And whereas it is expedient to sanction the said arrangement:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

1. This Act may be cited as the India (Home Charges Arrears) Act, 1882.

the said office or place in as full and ample manner to all intents and purposes as if they were duly presented, nominated, admitted, instituted, and inducted thereunto; and the said professor or reader and his successors for the time being, during such time or times only as they should continue in the said office or place should by virtue of such office or place for ever thereafter have and hold the said rectory without any presentation, admission, institution, or induction, or any other act or thing whatsoever to entitle them thereunto, and should be and were thereby declared to be during their continuance in the said office or place full and perfect incumbents of the said rectory to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and that so often as it should happen that the said office or place should become void by death, resignation, or otherwise, the said rectory should at the same time become void, and the person that should be placed in such office or place so become void should by virtue of such office or place only have and enjoy the said rectory for so long time as he should continue in such office or place and no longer: And it was thereby provided that the said professor should celebrate divine service and perform all other parochial duties relating to the cure of souls within the said rectory which any other rector of the said rectory had theretofore done and performed, and were by law obliged to do and perform, or should allow to learned and able curates to be licensed by the bishop or ordinary of the diocese who should be constantly residing within the said rectory such competent salaries and stipends as the said bishop or ordinary should judge sufficient: And it was thereby also provided that neither that Act nor anything therein contained should excuse or be construed to excuse the said professor from the payment of first fruits and tenths, or from the payment of all dues of what kind soever to the bishop or other ordinary who before the making of that Act had lawful right to claim the same, or from canonical obedience to the bishop or ordinary of the said diocese, but such professor should be obliged to make payment thereof:

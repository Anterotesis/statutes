If, within one month after the sending of the copies aforesaid, any shareholder or shareholders, the aggregate nominal value of whose shares (which term also includes stock) is not less than twenty thousand pounds, shall, by writing addressed to the secretary of the company, require that the scheme be submitted to a meeting of the shareholders, or (if there are more than one class of shareholders of the company) of the class to which such shareholder or shareholders belong, the directors shall forthwith summon such meeting accordingly, by giving not less than fourteen days* notice thereof by post to each shareholder of the company, or to each shareholder of the class concerned, as the case may be.

Act, 1880; and to amend and explain the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1880, and the Local Government Board (Ireland) Act, 1872,

[11th August 1881.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this Parliament assembled, as follows:

1. The board of guardians of any union may, with the consent Payment of of the Local Government Board, divide, with reference to all or Beei loans-any of the electoral divisions of the union, each special rate which the guardians are empowered to make under the provisions of the seventh section of the Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880, as amended 43 Vict c. i. by the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1880, into J3* 44 Vict two equal special rates (in this Act referred to as reduced seed rates), so that the sum which under the provisions of the said Act should be levied in any one year by means of one special rate shall be levied in two consecutive years by means of two special rates. Where a resolution has been adopted by the board of guardians that such division should take effect, the first of the reduced seed rates shall be made at the same time as the first ordinary rate made for the relief of the poor in the union after the date of the resolution of the board of guardians. The subsequent reduced seed rates shall be made in consecutive years, one in every year, at the same time as the ordinary rate made for the relief of the poor in the union after the first day of August in each year.

The following conditions shall apply to every resolution of any board of guardians on the subject of the division of such special rates:

Grants to distressed unions. 43 & 44 Vict. c. 14.

43 Vict c. 4.

Ch. 28. Loc(dGowrn7rierUBmrd(L)Anie7idt.Act, lSRl, 44 & 45 Vict.

(1.) Such resolution shall only be adopted by a majority of the guardians present and voting at a meeting duly assembled after fourteen days notice given in the manner required by the general regulations of the Local Government Board;

(2.) Such resolution shall not relieve the guardians of the union from any liability under the Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880, as amended by the Belief of Distress (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1880, in respect of any special rate made, or which ought to have been made, before the adoption of the resolution by the board of guardians.

Where any special rate is so divided under this Act, the repayment by the guardians of the union to the Commissioners of Public Works of the loan in respect of which the special rate was leviable shall be made by equal instalments, in this Act referred to as reduced instalments, which shall correspond in number to the number of the reduced seed rates authorised to be made, and shall be payable to the Commissioners of Public Works in consecutive years on the first day of August in each year; the first of such reduced instalments shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Seed Supply (Ireland) Act, 1880, requiring the payment to be made at some other time, whether before or after the passing of this Act, be due and payable to the Commissioners on the first day of August after the date of the resolution of the board of guardians.

Where the board of guardians of any union have failed to make provision for the levying of the special rate, which should have been made in respect of all or any of the electoral divisions of the union at the same time as the first ordinary rate made for the relief of the poor in the union after the first day of August one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the Local Government Board may, if they think fit, by order direct the board of guardians to make a special seed rate for the purposes of the said Act, at the same time as the first ordinary rate for the relief of the poor in the union after the making of such order: And in such case the repayment by the board of guardians to the Commissioners of Public Works of the first instalment of the loan shall be made on the first day of August following the making of such order. In the case of any such union the provisions of this Act relative to the division of special rates shall only apply to the second of the special rates leviable in such union.

2. The second section of the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1880, shall be amended as follows:

(1.) Any grant which the Commissioners of Public Works are empowered to make under that section may be made by them, on the recommendation of the Local Government Board, signi-'fied before the first day of April one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, to the board of guardians of any union in which outdoor relief was at any time authorised to be given under the third section of the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Act, 1880, notwithstanding that the order authorising the giving of such outdoor relief has ceased to be in force at the time of the making of such grant;

(2.) The board of guardians of any union to whom any grant is made under this section shall apply the money so granted in

defraying any costs, charges, expenses, or liabilities incurred by them prior to the twenty-ninth day of September one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one in administering the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Act, 1880, or the Acts relating to the relief of the poor in Ireland.

3. Whereas doubts have arisen as to the construction of the Explanation of

Local Government Board (Ireland) Act, 1872, so far as it relates to *

property formerly vested in the Commissioners for administering

the laws for the relief of the poor in Ireland, and it is expedient to remove such doubts, therefore it is hereby declared that all property, real and personal, and all rights of action and other rights relative to property vested in or belonging to the Commissioners for the relief of the poor in Ireland in their capacity as such Commissioners at the time of the passing of the said Act were thereby transferred to and became vested in the Local Government Board for Ireland, subject, however, to any rights, charges, or liabilities affecting the same.

Extinguishment of debts in schedule.

WHEREAS certain advances out of the Consolidated Fund have been made in Ireland for the objects mentioned in the schedule to this Act, and upon each of these advances the amount mentioned in the said schedule is unpaid, and due to the Consolidated Fund:

And whereas no sums have been recovered upon the said advances during a long period of years, and it is inexpedient to keep open for any further period the account of such advances:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Public Loans (Ireland) Remission Act, 1881.

2. The debts due to the Consolidated Fund mentioned in the schedule to this Act shall, after the passing of this Act, be extinguished, and the amount thereof shall be deemed to have been a free grant by Parliament.

SCHEDULE.

Account of Advance and Reason for Remission.

The money was advanced in order to facilitate the execution of the Irish Tithe Composition Act 4 Geo. 4. c. 99. Advances were made in the case of 2, 845 different parishes during the period from 1824 to 1844 for the expenses of the execution of the Act, part of which expenses consisted in the remuneration of the Commissioners appointed under the Act to assess the composition to be paid in the several parishes. One of the Commissioners was appointed in most cases by or on behalf of the tithe-owner, and one by the vestry. The advances were to be repaid by the owners and occupiers of land in five equal yearly instalments, but the sum advanced to pay the Commissioner appointed by the tithe-I owner was to be repaid out of the tithe composition at

such time and in such manner as the Lord Lieutenant should direct. No interest was charged on the advances. Repayments commenced in 1826; but, after the tithe dis-; turbances in 1831, and the passing of 2 & 3 Will. 4.

c. 119., no further steps were taken for the recovery of the advances.

By the Act 3 & 4 Will. 4. c. 100., the issue of 1,000,000l. was authorised to render unnecessary the collection of tithes and compositions for tithes in Ireland in 1833, and of

the arrears of tithes for the two preceding years. 640,000l. was advanced to tithe-owners to be repaid in five equal yearly instalments without interest. The Act 1 & 2 Vict. c. 109. provided for the remission in certain cases of these instalments, and also authorised the application of the instalments which were received, and of a further sum of 260,000l. authorised to be raised, towards indemnifying persons entitled to arrears of compositions for tithes for the years 1834-37. Partly in consequence of the above no instalments in respect of the 640,000l. reached the Consolidated Fund, and no part of the 260,000l. has ever been repaid, leaving a total of 900,000l. unpaid. ThiB 900,000l. was raised by Exchequer Bills which, together with the sum of 31, 862/. 10*. for interest thereon, were converted under 2 & 3 Vict. c. 97. s. 17. into 1, 018, 448/. 1*.

CHAPTER 33.

An Act to amend the Summary Procedure Act, 1864.

[11th August 1881.]

WHEREAS, by an Act passed in the ninth year of King George the Fourth, chapter twenty-nine, intituled An Act to authorise additional Circuit Courts of Justiciary to be held and to facilitate criminal trials in Scotland, provision was made for the summary prosecution of offences before sheriffs of counties in certain cases:

And whereas by an Act passed in the Parliament held in the seventh year of King William the Fourth and the first year of Her present Majesty, chapter forty-one, intituled An Act for the more “ effectual recovery of small debts in the sheriff courts and for “ regulating the establishment of circuit courts for the trial of small “ debt causes by the sheriffs in Scotland, ” herein-after called the Small Debt Act, 1837, provision was made for the recovery of statutory penalties by way of action in the sheriff court, and a scale of fees was fixed for such prosecutions:

And whereas by the Summary Procedure Act, 1864, further provision was made for the trial of offences punishable on summary conviction, and for the summary recovery of penalties:

And whereas by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, additional powers were conferred upon courts of summary jurisdiction in England to mitigate and modify punishments in summary proceedings:

And whereas it is expedient to amend the Summary Procedure Act, 1864, to extend certain of the provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, to Scotland, and also to regulate the costs and expenses of summary procedure in Scotland:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. This Act may be cited as the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act, 1881, and shall be construed as one with the Summary Procedure Act, 1864, so far as consistent with the tenour of these Acts respectively, and these Acts may be cited together as the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Acts, 1864 and 1881, and shall apply to Scotland only.

2. This Act shall commence on the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two.

3. The provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Acts, 1864 and 1881, herein-after called the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, shall apply to all summary proceedings as enumerated and described in the third section of the Summary Procedure Act, 1864, and to all proceedings of the like nature which by any future Act are directed or authorised to be taken summarily, or under the provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, and the thirty-second section of the Summary Procedure Act, 1864, is hereby repealed: And it shall not be necessary in any case to keep a record of the evidence, except so far as may be required by the Act conferring jurisdiction in the matter of the prosecution, or by the sixth section

1881. Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland), 1881, Ch. 33. 69

of the Summary Prosecutions Appeals (Scotland) Act, 1875. 38 39 Vict *

Whereas doubts have arisen whether the third section of the Sum- 63‘ maxy Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1864, includes and applies to prosecutions under the twenty-third and twenty-fourth sections of the Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act, 1868, be it enacted, that the si & 32 Vict. provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts shall apply to such c. 123. prosecutions, and in all similar cases when in addition to a penalty a forfeiture is provided by statute. The provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts shall also apply to prosecutions under the Tweed Fisheries Acts: Provided always, that it shall be in the option of the prosecutor to proceed either under the forms of the Tweed Fisheries Acts, or under the forms of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts: Provided also, that where there is a general or local Police Act in force, it shall be optional in police prosecutions either to use the forms prescribed by such Act, or the forms provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts.

4. The costs and expenses of. all complaints and proceedings Regulation of instituted under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts shall be regulated of expenses, by the table of fees contained in the Schedule A. to this Act annexed, and no other or higher fees shall be allowed on taxation,

and where expenses shall be awarded against a respondent the decree shall be subject to the following limitations:—

(a.) Where the penalty or penalties imposed shall not exceed twelve pounds, the total expenses decerned for shall not exceed three pounds:

(b.) Where the penalty or penalties imposed shall not exceed twelve pounds but it appears to the Court that the reasonable expenses of the complainer's witnesses, together with the other expenses, exceed the sums herein-before allowed, the Court may direct the expenses of such witnesses to be paid in whole or in part out of the penalty.

The directions contained in the schedule shall be deemed to be part of this enactment.

5. In all proceedings under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts in Amount of

every conviction, order, decree of absolvitor, decree dismissing the °

complaint, or other decree disposing of the complaint, and not at viction or any subsequent time, the Court may, subject to the foregoing decree, provisions, when a finding of expenses is competent, find such sum

to be due in name of expenses, if any, as it considers reasonable.

Expenses shall in all cases be recovered as if they formed part of the penalty, and the same diligence shall follow in case of default in payment.

6. In all proceedings under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts — power to miti-

and observing some other condition, or to do any of such things, the Court may dispense with any such requirement or any part thereof:

Provided that nothing in this Act shall authorise the Court to reduce the amount of a fine when the Act prescribing such amount carries into effect a treaty, convention, or agreement with a foreign state, and such treaty, convention, or agreement stipulates for a fine of minimum amount:

Provided further, that this section shall not apply to proceedings taken under any Act relating to any of Her Majesty's regular or auxiliary forces:

In complaints not founded on any special Act the maximum sentence shall continue to be as defined by the first recited Act.

7.

or for rendering such gases harmless and inoffensive when discharged, subject to the qualification, in the case of sulphuric acid works, that no objection shall be taken under this section by an inspector to any discharge of gas by a chimney or flue, on the basis of the amount of acid gas per cubic foot of air smoke or gases, where that amount does not exceed the amount limited by the last preceding section.

If the owner of any such work fails, in the opinion of the court having cognisance of the matter, to use such means, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding, in the case of the first offence, twenty pounds, and in the case of every subsequent offence, fifty pounds, with a further sum not exceeding five pounds for every day during which any such subsequent offence has continued.

10. An inspector may from time to time inquire whether, in any works in which the extraction of salt from brine is carried on, herein-after called salt works, means can be adopted at a reasonable expense for preventing the discharge from the furnaces or chimneys of such works into the atmosphere of sulphurous and muriatic acid gases evolved in such works, or either of such gases, or for rendering such gases, or either of them, harmless or inoffensive when discharged; also whether in any works in which aluminous deposits are treated for the purpose of making cement, herein-after called cement works, such means as aforesaid can be adopted with respect to the noxious or offensive gases evolved from such works.

Where it appears to the Local Government Board that such means can be adopted at a reasonable expense the Board may from time to time by order require the owners of such works to adopt the best practicable means for the purpose, and may by the order limit the amount or proportion, in the case of salt works, of sulphurous or muriatic acid gas, and in the case of cement works of any noxious or offensive gas, which is to be permitted to escape from such works into the chimney or into the atmosphere, and may also by the order extend to such works such provisions of this Act relating to scheduled works as they see fit.

An order made under this section shall be provisional only and shall not be of any validity until confirmed by Parliament, but when so confirmed shall have full effect, with such modifications as may be made therein by Parliament; and the expression “this Act” when used in this Act shall be deemed to include an order so confirmed, so far as is consistent with the tenor of that order.

The Board shall take such steps as they may think fit for giving notice to persons interested of the provisions of any order made by them under this section before any Bill for confirming the same is introduced into Parliament.

An order made under this section may impose fines for a breach of its provisions of like amount as any fines imposed by this Act for offences against this Act.

Remission, . of.

Remission of 4. Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners in the year to*6”* advanced to the Tralee Harbour and Canal Commissioners, on TraiecTHarbour the security of the harbour and ship canal at Tralee, and the tolls and Canal Com- thereof, a sum of six thousand pounds, to be repaid with interest missioners. at the rate of five per cent, per annum:

And whereas on account of such loan there remained due in the month of March one thousand eight hundred and eighty the Bum of five thousand four hundred pounds in respect of principal and eleven thousand and fifty-four pounds nineteen shillings and twopence in respect of arrears of interest, and the net receipts from the said harbour and canal and tolls were insufficient to keep down the interest:

And whereas it was then proposed to make improvements in the harbour at Tralee and to make a railway to such harbour, and thereupon it was arranged by the divers persons interested, with the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and the Treasury, subject to the sanction of Parliament, that the Public Works Loan Commissioners should sell the said canal to the Tralee and Fenit Railway Company for the sum of eight thousand pounds whereof the sum of five thousand four hundred pounds should be forthwith paid to the Exchequer, and that there should be charged as a first charge upon the said canal and the proposed railway the remaining sum of two thousand six hundred pounds, with interest at five per cent, per annum, and that the residue of the said arrears of interest should be remitted:

And whereas in pursuance of the said arrangement the said sum of five thousand four hundred pounds was paid to the Exchequer:

43 & 44 Vict. And whereas by the Pier and Harbour Orders Confirmation c. lxxxv. Act, 1880, provision was made for the said improvements in Tralee Harbour, and by an Act of the session of the forty-third and forty-fourth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter one hundred and seventy-nine, intituled “ An Act for making a railway from “ Tralee to Fenit, in the county of Kerry, and for other purposes, ” the sum of two thousand six hundred pounds with interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum was charged upon the railway and canal therein mentioned in favour of the Public Works Loan Commissioners:

And whereas it is expedient to carry into effect the residue of the said agreement by authorising the Public Works Loan Commissioners to remit the residue of the said arrears of interest, be it therefore enacted that —

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may remit the arrears of interest amounting to the sum of eight thousand four hundred and fifty-four pounds nineteen shillings and twopence due in respect of the above-mentioned loan, and the amount so remitted shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

Remission of 5* Whereas in pursuance of the Drainage Maintenance Act, onhe^n?vea *66, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland were called drainage works, upon by certain proprietors in the Monivea drainage district, in 29 & so Vict. the county of Galway, to put the works of that district, which had

c. 49.

1881.

97

Public Works Loam Ac, 1881. Ch. 38. been neglected by the trustees, in repair, and executed the necessary works, but on the completion thereof it was found that a portion of the works so executed, namely, the underpinning of Chapel Field bridge and a certain work of excavation in connexion therewith, were not works of repair and maintenance, but were new works, and that therefore the sum of one hundred and fifty-five pounds expended on that portion of the works was not properly chargeable on the proprietors or owners of the land within the said drainage district:

And whereas it is expedient to authorise the remission of any claim by the Commissioners of Public Works for the repayment of the same sum, be it therefore enacted that —

10. Whereas by the Merchant Shipping Amendment Act, 1855, provision is made for the levying and recovery of dues to be paid by any ship which passes or derives benefit from a lighthouse erected on or near the coast of any British possession, and the Public Works Loan Commissioners are authorised to advance loans for the purpose of constructing such lighthouse:

(5.) The dues received in respect of the Minicoy Lighthouse shall be carried to and form part of the Basses Light funds, and section six of the Basses Lights Act, 1872, shall be construed as if the Minicoy Lighthouse were one of the lighthouses therein mentioned, and the expense of maintaining the Minicoy Lighthouse shall be defrayed accordingly, and the principal and interest of any loan under this section shall be charged on the said fund next after the sums charged thereon by the said section six.

U. Whereas by the Labouring Classes Dwelling Houses Act, 1866, and the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses and Dwellings (Ireland) Act, 1866, the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland respectively, are authorised to lend to the public bodies, companies, societies, associations, and persons therein mentioned loans for the purchase of lands or buildings, and the erection, alteration, and adaptation of buildings to be used as dwellings for the labouring classes:

And whereas it is expedient to remove certain doubts which have arisen with respect to such loans: Be it therefore enacted as follows:

Any company, society, or association established for the purpose of constructing or improving dwellings for the labouring classes shall be deemed to be and always to have been a company, society, or association to which a loan may be made in pursuance of the Labouring Classes Dwelling Houses Act, 1866, and the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses and Dwellings (Ireland) Act, 1866, and any loan heretofore made to any such company, society, or association shall be deemed to have been validly made, and the security given for the same shall be valid and effectual to all intents.

The period and rate of interest of any loan made in pursuance of either of the above-mentioned Acts may be such as is mentioned either in the Act or in section six of the Public Works Loans Act, 1879, with respect to the like loans by the Public Works Loans Commissioners, and the said section six shall be deemed to have been and this section shall be deemed to be in addition to and not in derogation of the powers under the above-mentioned Acts.

loans for public and other purposes, it is provided that the repay- t? Commis-ment of the loans thereunder shall be completed, and the first p^Hc*Works instalment of such repayment made within the periods respectively in Ireland as therein mentioned from the date of the advance, or from the time to date of when the first advance is made, and doubts have arisen with respect advance* to the construction of such provisions in the case where a loan is advanced by instalments, and it is expedient to remove such doubts:

Be it therefore enacted as follows:

The period of years mentioned in any of the recited Acts as the period within which advances made thereunder by the Commissioners of Public Works are to be repaid shall, as regards each instalment of any loan advanced by the said Commissioners, either before or after the passing of this Act, be reckoned from the date of the advance of the instalment by the Commissioners.

13. Whereas by the Mulkear Drainage District Act, 1880, the Removal of Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland were authorised to ad- ^J^uction «f vance to the Mulkear drainage district board such sum as they 43 & 44 Vict. might think proper, not exceeding the sum of one thousand pounds, c. ccvi.

to be applied for the purpose of discharging and paying a certain MdSr drain-judgment debt recovered in an action therein mentioned, and the age district costs; and whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the costs board, include costs incurred by the board as well as the costs due to the judgment creditor; and it is expedient to remove such doubts, be it therefore enacted that —

The costs referred to in the said Act shall be deemed to include all costs properly incurred by the said drainage board in or incidental to the said action, as well as the costs due to the judgment creditor.

14. Whereas by the ninth section of the Relief of Distress Confirmation of (Ireland) Act, 1880, certain loans made to owners of land by the loans men-Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland in accordance with the Jgvfctc. 4. public notices specified in that section were ratified and confirmed;

but such ratification and confirmation does not apply to any loan of which a second instalment was not paid by the Commissioners of Public Works before the thirty-first day of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty; and it is expedient now to confirm such last-mentioned loans in cases in which the non-payment of the second instalment before the said date was caused by unavoidable oversight on the part of the said Commissioners at a time of unusual pressure on their offices;

Therefore, where a loan has been made by the Commissioners of Public Works to an owner of land under the public notices mentioned in section nine of the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Act, 1880, and a second instalment of such loan though not paid by the Commissioners of Public Works before the thirty-first day of July one thousand eight hundred and eighty, was paid by them, with the sanction of the Treasury, before the thirtieth day of April one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and the Commissioners of Public Works certify to the Treasury that the above-mentioned non-payment of the second instalment before the thirty-first day of July was caused without any delay or default on the part of the borrower, that loan is hereby ratified and confirmed; and all the provisions of the said Relief of Distress (Ireland) Act, 1880, and of any Act amending the same, relative to loans made to owners of

And whereas since the said first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four it has been discovered that certain persons appointed before the said fourth day of June one thousand eight hundred and seventy to subordinate situations in the departments of the Postmaster-General and of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings were, without any default on the part of such persons, omitted from the applications authorised to be made to the Treasury by the Superannuation Act Amendment Act, 1873, and it is unjust that such persons should be deprived of the benefits of that Act:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

(2.) The tenant shall give the prescribed notice to the landlord of his intention to sell his tenancy:

(13.) If the tenant of a tenancy subject to the Ulster tenant-right custom or to a usage corresponding to the Ulster tenant-right custom sells his tenancy in pursuance of this section, the tenancy, unless purchased by the landlord, shall continue to be subject to such custom or usage:

The compensation payable under the said section three in the case of a tenactedisturbed in his holding by the act of a landlord after the passing of this Act shall be as follows in the case of

rent is thirty pounds or under, a sum not exceeding seven years rent:

Where the rent is above thirty pounds and not exceeding fifty pounds, a sum not exceeding five years rent:

182

Ch. 49. Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881. 44 & 45 Vict.

From and after the passing of this Act the thirteenth section of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, shall be and the same is hereby repealed.

Amendment of 33 & 34 Vict c. 46. as to compensation for improvements.

Amendment of Law as to Compensation for Improvements.

7. A tenant on quitting the holding of which he is tenant shall not be deprived of his right to receive compensation for improvements under the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, by reason only of the determination by surrender or otherwise of the tenancy subsisting at the time when such improvements were made by such tenant or his predecessors in title, and the acceptance by him or them of a new tenancy.

Where in tracing a title for the purpose of obtaining compensation for improvements, it appears that an outgoing tenant has surrendered his tenancy in order that some other person may be accepted by the landlord as tenant in his place, and such other person is so accepted as tenant, the outgoing tenant shall not be precluded from being deemed the predecessor in title of the incoming tenant by reason only of such surrender of tenancy by him.

The court, in adjudicating on a claim for compensation for improvements made beforej any such change of tenancy or of tenants, shall take into consideration all the circumstances under which such change took place, and shall admit, reduce, or disallow altogether such claim as to the court may seem just.

A flax scutching mill otherwise suitable to the holding on which it is erected shall not be deemed to be unsuitable to the holding on which it is erected by reason only that it is available for purposes beyond those of the holding on which it is situate.

same periods respectively apply to the court to fix the judicial rent of the holding, but subject to the provisions herein contained such application shall not invalidate or prejudice any such judgment or decree, which shall remain in full force and effect.

(2.) Where the sale of any tenancy is delayed by reason of any application being made to the court or for any other reasonable cause, the court may, on the application of the tenant, and on such terms and conditions as the court may direct, enlarge the time during which the tenant may exercise his power of sale, or in case of ejectment for nonpayment of rent redeem the tenancy.

(3.) Where any proceedings for compelling the tenant of a present tenancy to quit his holding shall have been taken before or after an application to fix a judicial rent and shall be pending before such application is disposed of, the court before which such proceedings are pending shall have power, on such terms and conditions as the court may direct, to postpone or suspend such proceedings until the termination of the proceedings on the application for such judicial rent; and the pendency of any such proceedings for compelling the tenant to quit his holding shall not interfere with the power of the court to fix such rent, or with any right of the tenant resulting from the rent being so fixed; and in such case any order made by the court for fixing the rent shall operate in the same manner as if such order had been made on the day of the date of application.

Provided, that proceedings shall not be taken by a landlord to compel a tenant to quit his holding for breach of any statutory condition, save as follows:

(4.) Where a notice to quit is served by a landlord upon a tenant for the purpose of compelling the tenant to quit his holding during the continuance of a statutory term in his tenancy in consequence of the breach by the tenant of any statutory condition other than the condition relating to payment of rent, the tenant may, at any time before the commencement of an ejectment founded on such notice to quit, apply to the land commission, and after the commencement, or at the hearing of any such ejectment, may apply to the court in which the ejectment is brought, for an order restraining the landlord from taking further proceedings to enforce such notice to quit.

If the land commission or court to which such application is made are of opinion that adequate satisfaction for the breach of such condition can be made by the payment of damages to the landlord, and that the tenant may justly be relieved from the liability to be compelled to quit his holding in consequence of such breach, the commission or court may make an order restraining further proceedings on the notice to quit, upon the payment by the tenant of such sum for damages as they shall then, or after due inquiry, award to the landlord in satisfaction for the breach of the statu-

(5.) The service of a notice to quit, to enforce which no proceedings are taken by the landlord, or the proceedings to enforce which are restrained by the court, shall not operate to determine the tenancy.

(0.) A tenant compelled to quit his holding during the continuance of a statutory term in his tenancy, in consequence of the breach by the tenant of any statutory condition, shall not be entitled to compensation for disturbance.

18. Any person prohibited under this Act from letting or subletting a holding may, after service of the prescribed notice upon the landlord, with the sanction of the court, and with power for the court to prescribe such terms as to rent and otherwise as the court thinks just, let any portion of land in a situation to be approved by the landlord, or failing such approval to be determined by the court, with or without dwelling-houses thereon to or for the use of labourers bona fide employed and required for the cultivation of the holding, and such letting shall not be deemed to be a sub-letting within the meaning of this Act, or to be a letting prohibited by this Act; and notwithstanding such sub-letting the tenant shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be still in occupation of the holding.

Provided, that the land comprised in each letting shall not exceed half an acre in extent, and that where the holding contains not more than twenty-five acres of tillage land, the number of such lettings shall not exceed one, and that where the holding contains more than twenty-five acres of tillage land, but not more than fifty acres of such land, the number of such lettings shall not exceed two; and so in proportion to the acreage of tillage land in the holding after fifty acres.

Where upon any such application the court requires the tenant of the holding to improve any existing cottage, or to build any new cottage, such tenant shall be deemed to be a person to whom a loan may be made under the Landed Property Improvement (Ireland) Acts for the improvement or building of dwellings for labourers, as if such person were an owner within the meaning of the seventh section of the Act of the session of the tenth and eleventh years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter thirty-two; but any such loan may be made for a less sum than the sum of one hundred pounds.

or of default of the tenant in selling, or by operation of law, or reverter, or otherwise. Provided that:

(1.) The surrender to the landlord of a tenancy for the purpose of the acceptance or admission of a tenant or otherwise by way of transfer to a tenant shall not be deemed to be a determination of the tenancy:

(3.) Where a present tenancy in a holding is purchased by the landlord from the tenant in exercise of his right of pre-emption under this Act, and not on the application or by the wish of the tenant, or as a bidder in the open market, then if the landlord within fifteen years from the passing of this Act re-lets the same holding to another tenant, the same shall be subject from and after the time when it has been so re-let, to all the provisions of this Act which are applicable to present tenancies;

(4.) A tenant holding under the Ulster tenant-right custom, or a usage corresponding to the Ulster tenant-right custom, shall be entitled to the benefit of such custom, notwithstanding any determination of his tenancy by breach of a statutory condition or of an act or default of the same character as the breach of a statutory condition.

Whenever a present tenancy is sold in consequence of a breach by the tenant, after the passing of this Act, of a statutory condition, or, in the case of a tenancy not subject to statutory conditions, of an act or default on the part of a tenant, after the passing of this Act, which would, in a tenancy subject to such conditions, have constituted a breach thereof, the purchaser or his successors in title in such tenancy shall not at any time thereafter be entitled to apply to the court under this Act to fix a judicial rent for the holding; but this provision shall not prejudice or affect the right of such purchaser or his successors to hold at such judicial rent during the residue of such statutory term, if any, as the holding may then be subject to, under the provisions of this Act.

2L Any leases or other contracts of tenancy existing at the date of the passing of this Act, except yearly tenancies and tenancies less than yearly tenancies, which said existing leases and contracts of tenancies (except as aforesaid) are in this section referred to as existing leases, shall remain in force to the same extent as if this Act had not passed, and holdings subject to such existing leases shall be regulated by the lawful provisions contained in the said leases, and not by the provisions relating to tenancies in that behalf contained in this Act: Provided that at the expiration of such existing leases, or of such of them as shall expire within sixty years

On the termination of any such existing lease in any holding which if it had been held from year to year would have been subject to the Ulster tenant-right custom, or any usage corresponding therewith, the person who would have been entitled to make a claim under the first or second section of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, in respect of the same holding shall be entitled to do so notwithstanding that the holding was held under any such lease, but this proviso shall not apply to leases in which there is contained a provision expressly excluding the Ulster tenant-right custom or a usage corresponding therewith.

In any case in which the court shall be satisfied that since the passing of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, the acceptance by a tenant from year to year of a lease of his holding containing terms which, in the opinion of the court, were at the time of such acceptance unreasonable or unfair to the tenant, having regard to the provisions of the said Act, was procured by the landlord by threat of eviction or undue influence, the court may, upon the application of the tenant made within six months after the passing of this Act, declare such lease to be void as and from the date of the application or order, and upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as to the court shall seem just; and thereupon the tenant shall as and from such date be deemed to be the tenant of a present ordinary tenancy from year to year at the rent mentioned in such lease. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the court in any proceedings under this section may, by leave of the court, which leave shall be granted unless the court shall consider the appeal frivolous or vexatious, appeal to Her Majesty's Court of Appeal in Ireland, and the decision of the said Court of Appeal shall be final and conclusive.

CHAPTER 53.

An Act for making further provision with respect to the Redemption of the Annuity created under the East Indian Railway Company Purchase Act, 1879; and for other purposes.

[22nd August 1881.]

WHEREAS by the East Indian Railway Company Purchase Act, 1879, (herein-after called the Purchase Act,) provision was made for transferring to and vesting in the Secretary of State in Council of India, herein-after called the Secretary of State, the undertaking of the East Indian Railway Company, herein-after called the Company, and all other the property of the Company, save and except as therein mentioned, and for the creation of an annuity of one million four hundred and seventy-three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds, terminating on the fourteenth of February one thousand nine hundred and fifty-three, to be charged on the revenues of India, and to be paid to the Company as therein mentioned for the purpose of being distributed among the proprietors of stock of the Company:

And whereas by section forty-six of the Purchase Act it was enacted that the Secretary of State might purchase by agreement from any proprietor of stock of the Company the amount of annuity

1881. East Indian Railway (Redemption of Annuities) Act. Ch. 53. 213

to which such proprietor was entitled, or any portion thereof, paying in exchange for the same as thereby provided, to any such proprietor on the register in London India Four per centum stock, and to any such proprietor on the register at Calcutta India Four per centum rupee debt in India, at the respective rates therein specified, subject to the proviso that no such purchase should be made by means of India Four per centum stock unless the Secretary of State should be authorised by Parliament to create and issue such stock for the purpose:

And whereas by the same Act (section forty-eight) provision was made for the registration in the name of the Secretary of State of the annuities so to be purchased, and (section forty-nine) for the retention by the Secretary of State of the amount therein mentioned in respect of the annuity registered in his name, and (section fifty) for the rights and liabilities of the Secretary of State in respect of the annuity so registered:

And whereas by section fifty-one of the same Act the Secretary of State was required to invest one equal ninth part of the amount retained by him in respect of the annuity registered in his name, in order to provide a sinking fund to be applied in the reduction of the public debt of India created under the authority of Parliament:

And whereas by. an Act of the same Session, chapter forty- 42 & 43 Vict. three, “ to enable the Secretary of State in Council of India to c-48<

“ create and issue capital stock in the United Kingdom in exchange “ for so much of the annuity created under the East Indian Railway Company Purchase Act, 1879, and thereby made chargeable “ on the revenues of India, as may be purchased by the Secretary “ of State under that Act ” (herein-after called the Redemption Act), the Secretary of State was authorised to create and issue India four per centum stock for the purposes of the Purchase Act, and such stock has accordingly been created and issued, and paid in exchange for a portion of the annuity created under the Purchase Act:

And whereas by reason of the conversion of the stock of the Company into the annuities created under the Purchase Act there are no longer any proprietors of that stock, and it is expedient that the powers of the Secretary of State be extended to authorise the purchase of the said annuities from the holders thereof:

And whereas it is expedient that the Secretary of State be authorised to create and issue such capital stock, bearing interest at a lower rate than four per centum per annum, as may be required either for the purpose of this purchase, or for the purpose of reducing the liabilities charged on the revenues of India by the redemption of any part of those liabilities which may for the time being bear interest at a rate not lower than the stock so created:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. (1.) The Secretary of State may purchase by agreement from power to pur-any holder of the annuity created under the Purchase Act the chase annuities

Power to create India stock for the purpose of reducing the public debt or liabilities of India.

2. (1.) The Secretary of State may from time to time create and issue so much capital stock, bearing interest at the rate of three and a half per centum per annum, or at any other rate not higher than four per centum per annum, as may be. required either for the purpose of redeeming the annuities created under the Purchase Act by the purchase thereof under this Act, or for the purpose of redeeming any other liability now charged on the revenues of India and bearing interest or involving an annual payment at a rate not lower than the interest of the stock so created; subject, nevertheless, to the following provisoes: —

(a.) The difference between the interest or annual payment in respect of the liability redeemed and the interest on the stock created for redemption thereof shall be set aside and invested in manner directed by section fifty-one of the Purchase Act with respect to the amount of annuity retained by the Secretary of State under that Act, so as to provide a sinking fund to be applied in reduction of the public debt of India created under the authority of Parliament:

(b.) Any stock or securities that may be cancelled or redeemed for the purposes of such reduction shall not be re-issued without the authority of Parliament:

(c.) The amount so set aside shall be sufficient to repay the principal of the stock created at the expiration of the period during which the Secretary of State was liable to pay the interest or annual payment redeemed by means of the creation of the stock, if that period does not exceed ninety-nine years, but if it does exceed ninety-nine years then at the expiration of ninety-nine years from the date of the creation of the stock:(cL) When and so soon as the public debt of India created under the authority %of Parliament shall by the operation of the said sinking fund be reduced by an amount equivalent to the amount of the public debt of India, attributable to the redemption effected under this section, any obligation imposed on the Secretary of State under or by virtue of this section shall cease and determine.

(2.) All the provisions of the Redemption Act with respect to the capital stock created or issued under that Act shall apply to the capital stock created or issued under this Act

inclusive of interest, at the rate of three per cent., and at such time or times as might be agreed on between the Treasury and the Government of India, but the Act provided that the interest so received should be repaid to the Government of India:

And whereas the said sum of two million pounds was advanced to the Government of India, but no sum has been repaid by the said Government in respect either of principal or interest:

And whereas the said annuities were purchased by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt (in this Act referred to as the National Debt Commissioners) on account of trustee and past office savings banks:

And whereas it is expedient to repeal the said obligation on the Government of India to repay the said sum of two million pounds, and to provide for the conversion of the above-mentioned amount of three per cent consolidated bank annuities into terminable annuities and for the payment of those annuities out of the permanent annual charge for the National Debt:

Ch. 57, Regulation of the Forces Act, 1881. 44 & 45 Vict.

12. Whereas under the Acts of 1867 relating to the army and Amendment as militia reserve forces, the men who entered those forces under those Jeserve forws Acts are liable when called out to serve for an indefinite period, and it is desirable to limit that period to the period for which men transferred to the reserve force under the Army Act, 1879, are liable to serve when called out, and otherwise to amend the enactments relating to the said reserve forces: Be it therefore enacted that —

(1.) Men in the army and militia reserve forces when called upon by proclamation of Her Majesty in pursuance of the enactments relating to those forces respectively to enter on permanent service or on army service, as the case may be, shall be liable to serve until Her Majesty no longer requires their services, so, however, that a man shall not be required to serve for a period exceeding in the whole the remainder unexpired of his term of service in the reserve force to which he belongs, and the further period of twelve months during which the service of a soldier of the regular forces may be prolonged under section eighty-three of the Army Act,

1879.

13. Whereas by the Reserve Force Act, 1867, the Secretary of State has power to make regulations respecting the pensions of men belonging to the army reserve force:

And whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the pensions payable to men in pursuance of those regulations can in all cases be awarded and paid by the Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital, and it is expedient to remove such doubts; be it therefore enacted as follows: —

Where, either before or after the passing of this Act, a man in the army reserve force has been called out for permanent service, and at the termination of such service has been returned to the army reserve force, and has become entitled to pension under any regulation by the Secretary of State, made either before or after the passing of this Act, or before or after such calling out or return, then the Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital. shall have the same power to award and pay the said pension, and otherwise in relation to the said pension, as they would have if such man had been discharged from the army on reduction.

4. A magistrate of any part of Her Majesty's dominions may issue a provisional warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive who is or is suspected of being in or on his way to that part on such information, and under such circumstances, as would in his opinion justify the issue of a warrant if the offence of which the fugitive is accused had been committed within his jurisdiction, and such warrant may be backed and executed accordingly.

A magistrate issuing a provisional warrant shall forthwith send a report of the issue, together with the information or a certified copy thereof, if he is in the United Kingdom, to a Secretary of State, and if he is in a British possession, to the governor of that possession, and the Secretary of State or governor may, if he think fit, discharge the person apprehended under such warrant.

A fugitive apprehended on a provisional warrant may be from time to time remanded for such reasonable time not exceeding seven days at any one time as under the circumstances seems requisite for the production of an endorsed warrant.

6. Upon the expiration of fifteen days after a fugitive has been committed to prison to await his return, or if a writ of habeas corpus or other like process is issued with reference to such fugitive by a superior court, after the final decision of the court in the case,

(1.) if the fugitive is so committed in the United Kingdom, a Secretary of State; and

(2.) if the fugitive is so committed in a British possession, the governor of that possession, may, if he thinks it just, by warrant under his hand order that fugitive to be returned to the part of Her Majesty's dominions from which he is a fugitive, and for that purpose to be delivered into the custody of the persons to whom the warrant is addressed, or some one or more of them, and to be held in custody, and conveyed by sea or otherwise to the said part of Her Majesty's dominions, to be dealt with there in due course of law as if he had been there apprehended, and such warrant shall be forthwith executed according to the tenor thereof.

If a fugitive who, in pursuance of this part of this Act, has been committed to prison in any part of Her Majesty's dominions to await his return, is not conveyed out of that part within one month after such committal, a superior court, upon application by or on behalf of the fugitive, and upon proof that reasonable notice of the intention to make such application has been given, if the said part is the United Kingdom to a Secretary of State, and if the said part is a British possession to the governor of the possession, may, unless sufficient cause is shown to the contrary, order the fugitive to be discharged out of custody.

8. Where a person accused of an offence and returned in pursuance of this part of this Act to any part of Her Majesty's dominions, either is not prosecuted for the said offence within six months after his arrival in that part, or is acquitted of the said offence, then if that part is the United Kingdom a Secretary of State, and if that part is a British possession the governor of that possession, may, if he think fit, on the request of such person, cause him to be sent back

The magistrate before whom a person so apprehended is brought, if he is satisfied that the warrant is duly authenticated as directed by this Act and was issued by a person having lawful authority to issue the same, and is satisfied on oath that the prisoner is the person named or otherwise described in the warrant, may order such prisoner to be returned to the British possession in which the warrant was issued, and for that purpose to be delivered into the custody of the persons to whom the warrant is addressed, or any one or more of them, and to be held in custody and conveyed by sea or otherwise into the British possession in which the warrant was issued, there to be dealt with according to law as if he had been there apprehended.

The house No. 24, Upper Merrion Street, in the city of Dublin, now occupied as an office by the Commissioners of Church Temporalities, and all fixtures and furniture therein, may be used by the Irish Land Commission for any of the purposes for which the said Land Commission is constituted. The said Irish Land Commission shall be entitled to the benefits of all covenants, conditions, or agreements in relation to the premises so transferred, express or implied, and to maintain all actions, suits, and other proceedings grounded thereon in their own name; and the said Commission shall in like manner be liable to all payments, reservations, covenants, conditions, and agreements, express or implied, in respect of the same premises respectively, as fully as the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland would have been if this Act had not been passed: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall affect any action or other proceeding which may have been commenced before the passing of this Act, but the same may proceed, with the like consequences and results, as if this Act had not been passed.

(3.) All records and documents in the possession of the Commissioners of Church Temporalities at the time of their dissolution shall be transferred to the Irish Land Commission, who shall retain such of them as are in their opinion necessary for the management of the property transferred to them under this Act.

The annual sum on retirement which any person is qualified to receive under the said forty-fourth section of the Irish Church Act, 1869, shall be ascertained immediately after the passing of this Act, in the manner prescribed by the said section, as if the date of such person's retirement were the thirty-first day of December next after the passing of this Act, and such annual sum shall begin to be paid from that date to the person entitled to receive the same, provided that such person does not receive an appointment under the Irish Land Commission, or any other appointment of which the salary or remuneration is provided out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or out of moneys voted by Parliament.

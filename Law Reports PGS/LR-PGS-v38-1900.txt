Provided always, that in 'estimating the value of any such improvement there shall not be taken into account, as part of the improvement made by the tenant, what is justly due to the inherent capabilities of the soil.

(2.) References in the principal Act to the First' Schedule to that Act shall be construed as references to the First Schedule to this Act.

(3.) In the ascertainment of the amount of the compensation payable to a tenant under the principal Act or this Act there shall be taken into account any benefit which the landlord has given or allowed to the tenant in consideration of the tenant executing Xhe improvement.

(4.) In the ascertainment of the amount of the compensation payable to a tenant in respect of manures as defined by this Act, there shall be taken into account the value of the manure required by the contract of tenancy or by custom to be returned to the holding in respect of any crops sold off or removed from the holding within the last two years of the tenancy or other less time for which the tenancy has endured, not exceeding the value of the manure which would have been produced by the consumption on the Jiolding of the crops so sold off or removed.

<(5.) Nothing in this sect; on shall prejudice the right of a tenant to claim any compensation to which he may be entitled under custom, agreement, or otherwise, in lieu of any compensation provided by this section.

2. — (1.) If a tenant claims to be entitled to compensation, whether under the principal Act or this Act, or under custom, agreement, or otherwise, in respect of any improvement comprised in the First Schedule to this Act, and if the landlord and tenant fail to agree as to the amount and time and mode of payment of such compensation, the difference shall be settled by arbitration in

(3.) Where any claim by a tenant for compensation in respect of any improvement comprised in the First Schedule to this Act is referred to arbitration, and any sum is claimed to be due to the tenant from the landlord in respect of any breach of contract or otherwise in respect of the holding, or to the landlord from the tenant in respect of any waste wrongfully committed or permitted by the tenant, or in respect of breach of contract or otherwise in respect of the holding, the party claiming such sum may, if he thinks fit, by written notice to the other party given by registered letter or otherwise not later than seven days after the appointment of the arbitrator or arbitrators, require that the arbitration shall extend to the determination of the further claim, and thereupon the provisions of this section with respect to arbitration shall apply accordingly, and any sum awarded to be paid by a landlord or tenant shall be recoverable in manner provided by the principal Act for the recovery of compensation.

(4.) Where any claim which is referred to arbitration relates to an improvement executed or matter arising after the determination of the tenancy, but while the tenant lawfully remains in occupation of part of the holding, the arbitrator may, if he thinks fit, make a separate award in respect of such claim.

(5.) An arbitration shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, be before a single arbitrator.

(6.) If in any arbitration under this Act the arbitrator states a case for the opinion of the county court on any question of law, the opinion of the couit on any question so stated shall be final, unless within the time and in accordance with the conditions prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court either party appeals to the Court of Appeal, from whose decision no appeal shall lie.

(7.) Any person who wilfully and corruptly gives false evidence before an arbitrator or umpire in any arbitration under this Act shall be guilty of perjury, and may be dealt with, prosecuted, and punished accordingly.

2. — (I.) As soon as possible after the passing of this Act the Ascertain-Land Commission shall ascertain, from the appendices to their meet and reports as presented to Parliament in pursuance of section fifty-five of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, by what amount in each of ratataf* county during the period commencing with and including the in judicial year covered by the annual report dated the twentieth day of vict

with that presented last before the passing of this Act, the rents of holdings in respect of which judicial rents have been fixed for a first statutory term, whether by order or by agreement, have, for the entire of such period, been varied by the fixing of such judicial rents, and shall certify the average percentage which such variation represents.

(2.)

(3.) The Land Commission shall publish their certificates under this section in such manner for giving information to all persons interested, as they think most convenient.

(4.) A copy of every certificate of the Land Commission under this section shall be published in the “ Dublin Gazette.”

(2.) During each subsequent period of fifteen years the like variation shall be deemed to be made in all tithe rentcharges from the amount at which they respectively stood immediately before the commencement of such period, in accordance with the average percentage of the variation of judicial rents certified by the Land Commission for the period of fifteen years terminating last before the commencement of each such first-mentioned period respectively and all tithe rentcharges shall be payable accordingly.

5. Any payments of tithe rentcharge made before the passing of this Act in pursuance of any order subsisting at the time of such payments of a court of quarter sessions shall be deemed valid and sufficient, notwithstanding any noncompliance with the provisions of any Act with reference to the variation of tithe rentcharges.

6. — (1.) The amount of tithe rentcharge payable by any person as from the first day of November one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight shall be deemed to have been and shall hereafter be reduced in respect of every pound in value thereof: —

(a) if the tithe rentcharge is payable out of hereditaments situate within a rural district, by one-half of the standard rate of poor rate certified under section forty-nine of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, as having been levied off those hereditaments; and

(b) if the tithe rentcharge is payable out of hereditaments situate within an urban district, by the whole of such standard rate so certified as having been levied off those hereditaments:

Provided that from the first half-yearly payment so reduced which accrues due next after the passing of this Act, there may be deducted in respect of every pound thereof one-half of such standard rate, if the tithe rentcharge is payable out of hereditaments situate within a rural district, and the whole of such standard rate if the tithe rentcharge is payable out of hereditaments situate within an urban district.

Provided also that if the total amount paid in respect of any tithe rentcharge accruing due after the first day of November one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and before the gale day next after the passing of this Act, exceeds the amount which would have been payable if this Act had come into operation before the said first day of November, the difference may be deducted from such first half-yearly payment as aforesaid, and if such total amount is less than would have been so payable, the difference shall be paid together with such half-yearly payment.

(2.)

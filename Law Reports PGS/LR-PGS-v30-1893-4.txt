It shall be lawful for Her Majesty^ from time to time, by Order in Council, to revoke and vary any Order in Council made under this section.

Every such Order shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within one month after it is made if Parliament be then sitting, or if not, within one month after the beginning of the then next session of Parliament, and while in force shall have effect as if it were enacted in this Act.

(10.) A Secretary of State may from time to time make, and when made revoke and vary, the forms of orders for sending a child to a day industrial school, and the manner in which children are to be sent to such school.

(11.) If a Secretary of State is of opinion that, by reason of a change of circumstances or otherwise, a certified day industrial school ceases to be necessary or expedient for the proper training and control of the children of any class of population in the neighbourhood of that school, he may, after due notice, withdraw the certificate of the school, and thereupon such school shall cease to be a certified day industrial school.

Provided that the reasons for withdrawing such certificate shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within one month after notice of the withdrawal is given if Parliament be then sitting, or if not, within one month after the then next meeting of Parliament.

4.

CHAPTER 40.

An Act to make provision for certain purposes relating to Local Loans. [12th September 1893.]

EE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

1. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several Certain debts local loans specified in the schedule hereto should, to the extent r«kone°i as of the amount specified in the last column of that schedule, not assets of local be reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under loans fund, the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887, therefore the principal of the said loans shall, to that extent, be written off from the account of assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

2. Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners advanced Provision as under the Harbours and Passing Tolls, &c. Act, 1861, to the trustees of Mevagissey Harbour, in the year one thousand eight 25" vLt' hundred and eighty-seven, and subsequent years, sums amounting c. 47. c * to twenty two thousand pounds, for the purpose of constructing the breakwater and works authorised by the Mevagissey Harbour Order, 1886, and the repayment of those sums with interest is secured by mortgages of the harbour undertaking wherebj* the said sums are made repayable with interest by half-yearly payments within forty years, interest only being payable during the first three ylars:

And whereas the sum of two thousand pounds (part of the said sum of twenty-two thousand pounds) is further secured by the guarantee of John Charles Williams, Esquire, M.P., as to repayments falling due in respect thereof, within a limited period:

And whereas the whole of the said sum of twenty-two thousand pounds now remains unpaid with arrears of interest on twenty thousand pounds (part thereof), the interest on the said sum of two thousand pounds, guaranteed by the said John Charles Williams, having been duly paid:

And whereas in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one the breakwater wa» practically destroyed and the harbour has been thereby rendered uiifit for navigation:

M

88 & 39 Vict. c. 89.

Provision as to Bosslare Harbour debt. 24 & 25 Vict. c. 47.

50 & 51 Vict. c. 37.

And whereas the reconstruction of the breakwater and other works necessary for the improvement of the harbour are estimated to cost thirty-two thousand pounds, and it is expedient to raise further loans and to empower the Treasury to authorise such arrangements with reference to the said advance of twenty-two-thousand pounds and the securities held by the Public Works Loan Commissioners for the same as are herein-after mentioned; therefore —

(1.) The Treasury may authorise the Public Works Loan Commissioners to agree that, notwithstanding anything in the Public Works Loans Act, 1875, any loan or loans to be borrowed for the new works for the restoration of the harbour shall to such amount not exceeding in the whole the sum of twenty-two thousand pounds, and on such conditions as may seem expedient, have priority over the advances made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners before the passing of this Act, and the interest thereon, and that the guarantee given by the said John Charles Williams as aforesaid, may be released, subject to such conditions as may seem expedient, with a view to a new guarantee for a limited number of years being given by the said John Charles Williams for any new loan or some part thereof.

(2.) The Public Works Loan Commissioners may advance the said new loan or loans if they are satisfied with the sufficiency of the security for the same, irrespectively of the advances and interest hereby authorised to be postponed.

(3.) The principal sum of twenty-two thousand pounds, owing by the Mevagissey Harbour trustees as aforesaid, shall be written off from the account of assets of the local loans fund, and the provision of section fifteen of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887, shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners advanced under the Harbours and Passing Tolls, &c. Act, 1861, to the Rosslare Harbour Commissioners in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and subsequent years, sums amounting together to seventy-five thousand pounds, for the purpose of constructing the viaduct, pier, and works authorised by the €tosslare Harbour Order, 1869, and those sums were made repayable with interest at three and a quarter per cent, per annum by annuities in-fifty years:

And whereas the whole of the said principal sum of seventy-five thousand pounds, with arrears of interest, now remains unpaid, and was, by the Public Works Loans Act, 1887, written off from the account of assets of the local loans fund :

And whereas the harbour is at present producing no revenue and further money is necessary for the repair and upholding of the harbour works, and negotiations are pending for the transfer by the harbour commissioners and the Public Works Loan Commissioners of the harbour undertaking free from incumbrances to a company to be constituted for the purpose of developing the

VjOO^lC

harbour and working the same in connexion with the Waterford and Wexford Railway and the Fishguard Bay Railway and Pier Undertakings; therefore —

The Public Works Loan Commissioners may transfer the said harbour undertaking to such persons and subject to such conditions as to the Treasury may seem expedient, free from the said debt of seventy-five thousand pounds, and all interest due and to become due in respect thereof, and upon such transfer being completed the said debt shall be extinguished, and the amount thereof shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

4. This Act may be cited as the Public Works Loans (No. 2) short tirie* Act, 1893.

Whereas the Public Works Loan Commissioners, in the years eighteen hundred and sixty-seven and eighteen hundred and sixty-eight made advances amounting to fifty-nine thousand pounds to the Athenry and Ennis Junction Railway Company (herein-aftea referred to as the Athenry Company), towards constructing their railway, and the loan was made repayable with interest at five per cent, per annum by instalments in twenty years ;

And whereas under the Waterford and Limerick Railway Act, 1893, the undertaking of the Athenry Company has been sold to the Waterford and Limerick Railway Company, and the said loan has become a charge upon the purchase money for the undertaking;

And whereas payments have been made to the Public Works Loan Commissioners in part discharge of the interest and instalments of principal, but the income of the undertaking has been insufficient to pay the whole of such interest and instalments;

And whereas it is expedient that the rate of interest on the loan of fifty-nine thousand pounds should be reduced, therefore —

‘The Public Works Loan Commissioners may accept in full discharge of the said loan of fifty-nine thousand pounds, such a sum as will, after allowing for the payments already made, discharge it with interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum, and the sum shall be calculated in the same manner as if the loan had borne interest at the rate of four instead of five per cent, per annum, and as if the payments already made had been applied first in payment of interest at such reduced rate, and the balance in reduction of the principal, and all necessary corrections in the books of the Public Works Loan Commissioners shall be made accordingly. The interest so remitted as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a free grant by Parliament.

CHAPTER 71.

An Act for codifying the Law relating to the Sale of Goods. [20th February 1894.]

BE it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

PART I.

Formation of the Contract.

Contract of Sale.

1. — (1.) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration, called the price. There may be a contract of sale between one part owner and another.

(2.) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.

(3.) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer the contract is called a sale ; but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled the contract is called an agreement to sell.

(4.) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.

2. Capacity to buy and sell is regulated by the general law concerning capacity to contract, and to transfer and acquire property.

Provided that where necessaries are sold and delivered to an infant, or minor, or to a person who by reason of mental incapacity or drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a reasonable price therefor.

Necessaries in this section mean goods suitable to the condition in life of such infant or minor or other person, and to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and delivery.

Formalities of the Contract.

3. Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any statute in that behalf, a contract of sale may be made in writing (either with or without seal), or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, or may be implied from the conduct of the parties.

Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the law relating to corporations.

4. — (1.) A contract for the sale of any goods of the value of ten pounds or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the buyer shall accept part of the goods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment, or unless some note or memoranda(g of

the contract be made and signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf.

(2.) The provisions of this section apply to every such contract, notwithstanding that the goods may be intended to be delivered at some future time, or may not at the time of such contract be actually made, procured, or provided, or fit or ready for delivery, or some act may be requisite for the making or completing thereof, or rendering the same fit for delivery.

(3.) There is an acceptance of goods within the meaning of this section when the buyer does any act in relation to the goods which recognises a pre-existing contract of sale whether there be an acceptance in performance of the contract or not.

(4.) The provisions of this section do not apply to Scotland.

Subject matter of Contrad.

5. — (1.) The goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or goods to be manufactured or acquired by the seller after the making of the contract of sale, in this Act called “ future goods.”

(2.) There may be a contract for the sale of goods, the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen.

(3.) Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods.

6. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the seller have perished at the time when the contract is made, the contract is void.

7. Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods, and subsequently the goods, without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer, perish before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided.

The Price.

8. — (1.) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.

(2.) Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions the buyer must pay a reasonable price. What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.

9. — (1.) Where there is an agreement to sell goods on the terms that the price is to be fixed by the valuation of a third party, and such third party cannot or does not make such valuation, the agreement is avoided; provided that if the goods or any part thereof have been delivered to and appropriated by the buyer he must pay a reasonable price therefor.

(2.) Where such third party is prevented from making the valuation by the fault of the seller or rbtrvei; the party not in

fault may maintain an action for damages against the party in fault.

Conditions and Warranties,

Whether any other stipulation as to time is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the terms of the contract.

(2.) In a contract of sale “ month ” means prima facie calendar month.

1L — (1.) In England or Ireland —

(a.) Where a contract of sale is subject to any condition to be When con-fulhlled by the seller, the buyer may waive the condition, or ^°“dt®8bc may elect to treat the breach of such condition as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for treating the contract as repudiated.

(6.) Whether a stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition, the breach of which may give rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated, or a warranty, the breach of which may give rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated, depends in each case on the construction of the contract. A stipulation may be a condition, though called a warranty in the contract:

(c.) Where a contract of sale is not severable, and the buyer has accepted the goods, or part thereof, or where the contract is for specific goods, the property in which has passed to the buyer, the breach of any condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there be a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect.

(2.) In Scotland, failure by the seller to perform any material part of a contract of sale is a breach of contract, which entitles the buyer either within a reasonable time after delivery to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated, or to retain the goods and treat the failure to perform such material part as a breach which may give rise to a claim for compensation or damages.

(3.) Nothing in this section shall affect the case of any condition or warranty, fulfilment of which is excused by law by reason of impossibility or otherwise.

12. In a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of the contract Implied under-are such as to show a different intention, there is — RS to

(1.) An implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has a right to sell the goods, and that in the case of an agreement to sell he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass :

quiet possession of the goods:

14. Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows : —

(1.) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose, provided that in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose :

(2.) Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality; provided that if the buyer has examined the goods, there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have revealed:

(3.) An implied warranty or condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed by the usage of trade.

(2.) In the case of a contract for sale by sample —

Rule 2. — Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods, for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing be done, and the buyer has notice thereof.

Rule 3. — Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing be done, and the . buyer has notice thereof.

Rule 4. — When goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or “ on sale or return ” or other similar terms the property therein passes to the buyer: —

(2.) Where goods are shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller or his agent, the seller is primi! facie deemed to reserve the right of disposal.

(3.) Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price, and transmits the bill of exchange and bill of lading to the buyer together to secure acceptance or payment of the bill of exchange, the buyer is bound to return the bill of lading if he does not honour the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill of lading the property in the goods does not pass to him.

20. Unless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the seller s risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but when the property therein is transferred to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer's risk whether delivery has been made or not.

Provided that where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either buyer or seller the goods are at the risk of the party in fault as regards any loss which might not have occurred but for such fault.

29. — (1.) Whether it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the seller to send them to the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, between the parties. Apart from any such contract, express or implied, the place of delivery is the seller's place of business, if he have one, and if not, his residence: Provided that, if the contract be for the sale of specific goods, which to the knowledge of the parties when the contract is made are in some other place, then that place is the place of delivery.

1. —(1) For the purpose of local loans, there may be issued by, the National Debt Commissioners the following sums, namely:—

(a) For the purpose of loans by the Public Works Loan

Commissioners, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of one million pounds;

(b) For the purpose of loans by the Commissioners of Public

Works in Ireland, any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds.

(2) The sums so issued shall be issued during a period ending on the day on which a further Act granting money for the purposes of those loans comes into operation, and in accordance with the provisions of the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.

2. Whereas it is expedient that the principal of the several local loans specified in the tables contained in Part I., Part II., and Part III. respectively of the Schedule to this Act should, to the extent specified in the last column of those Tables, not be reckoned as assets of the local loans fund established under the National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887, and that the several sums specified in the second column of the Table contained in Part IV. of the said Schedule should not be reckoned as assets of the said fund :

Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the extent aforesaid and the said sums shall be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.

3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland :

And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay the said loan, and, in consequeuce thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan :

And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees, as defined in clause three of the said memorandum, was pledged in security for the repayment of the said loan with interest by the instalments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was

provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal

And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees, so pledged as aforesaid, was in the year ending the thirty-first day of March nineteen hundred and eighteen insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in that year, and the principal sum of two hundred pounds, with interest amounting to one hundred and sixty-two pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence, now remains unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable:

Now, therefore, the said principal sum of two hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and 6ixty-two pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence shall be remitted.

4. For the purpose of removing doubts it is hereby declared Explanation of that the power of the Treasury under section one of the Public 7^8 Geo. 5.of Works Loans Act, 1897, as amended by section four of the c. 32.

Public Works Loans Act, 1917, to fix rates of interest on loans 60 * 61 Vict-made out of the local loans fund otherwise than on the security

of local rates includes (subject always to the provisions of the said sections) a power to fix rates of interest differing from the rates fixed for loans made out of that fund on the security of local rates, and a power to fix different rates of interest in respect of different loans, and that in fixing the rate of interest the Treasury may take into account the nature and value of the security for the loan.

2. —(1) During the period of five years immediately after the termination of the present war and thereafter until Parliament otherwise determine no banking business shall be carried on within the United Kingdom—

(a) by a company which is an enemy controlled corporation within the meaning of this Act; or

(h) by a firm or individual, if the business carried on is one with respect to which, if a state of war still continued, an order for the winding up thereof could have been made under section one of the principal Act;

lieu of tithes (other than a tithe rentcharge confirmed under the Tithe Act, 1836), or to any composition for tithes, pays or satisfies out of the amount thereof any such public local rates, taxes or assessments charged upon the same;

*3. If the assessor is satisfied with the amount contained in any account or statement of the annual value of properties to be assessed under this Schedule delivered under this Act, he shall make an assessment on that amount, and if he is not satisfied, or if no such account or statement has been delivered, he shall estimate to the best of his judgment the annual value of the property and make an assessment thereon.

6.—(1) In charging the profits or gains of a trade under this Schedule, such deduction may be allowed as the commissioners having jurisdiction in the matter may consider just and reasonable, as representing the diminished value by reason of wear and tear during the year of any machinery or plant used for the purposes of the trade and belonging to the person by whom it is carried on.

(2) Where machinery or plant is let to the person by whom the trade is carried on, on the terms of his being bound to maintain the same and deliver it over in good condition at the end of the lease, the machinery or plant shall be deemed to belong to that person for the purpose of this rule.

(3) Where full effect cannot be given to any such deduction in any year owing to there being no profits or gains chargeable for that year, or owing to the profits or gains chargeable being less than the deduction, the deduction or part of the deduction to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, shall, for the purpose of making the assessment for the following year, be added to the amount of the deduction for wear and tear’for that year, and deemed to be part of that deduction, or, -if there is no such deduction for that year, be deemed to be the deduction for that year, and so on for succeeding years.

(4) Any claim in respect of the aforesaid deduction shall be included in the annual statement required to be delivered under this Act of the profits or gains of the trade for which the machinery or plant is used, and the additional commissioners, in assessing those profits or gains, shall make such allowance in respect thereof as they think just and reasonable.

No such claim shall be allowed unless made within twelve months after the expiration of the year of assessment.

(6) No deduction for wear and tear, or repayment on account of any such deduction, shall be allowed for any year if the deduction, when added to the deductions allowed on that account for any previous years to the person by whom the trade is carried cn, will make the aggregate amount of the deductions exceed the actual cost to that person of the machinery or plant, including in that actual cost any expenditure in the nature of capital expenditure on the machinery or plant by way of renewal, improvement, or re-instatement.

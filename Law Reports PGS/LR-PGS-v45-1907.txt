We pray that Your Majesty may be graciously pleased to cause a measure to be laid before the Imperial Parliament at its present Session repealing the provisions of section 118 of the British North America Act, 1867, aforesaid, and substituting therefor the scale of payments above set forth, which shall be a final and unalterable settlement of the amounts to be paid yearly to the several provinces of the Dominion for their local purposes; and the support of their Governments and Legislatures.

Provided that, whenever any such payment is made at more frequent intervals than once in a quarter, the Treasury may dispense with the production of more than one declaration in respect of each quarter.

(a) This section shall not apply to steam ships constructed for the purpose of towing vessels so long as they are exclusively employed as tugs, but if and when employed for the carriage of passengers, cargoes, or stores, or using graving docks or dry docks or places provided for the repairing of vessels, the register tonnage, on which dues based on register tonnage may be levied by any harbour or dock authority, shall be ascertained in manner provided by the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1906, as amended by this Act; and

1907,

m

(b) This section shall not come into operation until the first day of January nineteen hundred and fourteen in the case of the following ships (in this Act referred to as existing ships), namely, sldps constructed, or the construction of which has been commenced, before the first day of May nineteen hundred and seven, and ships a contract for the construction of which has been made before the first day of May nineteen hundred and seven, though the construction has not actually commenced before that date.

2. Nothing in this Act shall affect any power which any dock or harbour authority have under any Act or Order confirmed by Parliament or having the effect of an Act of Parliament to charge tonnage rates, dues, or charges otherwise than on registered or register tonnage.

3. — (1) Where, in ascertaining the tonnage of an existing ship, a deduction has been made for the space occupied by the propelling power of the ship greater than the maximum deduction allowed under this Act, the tonnage of the ship shall, before the date on which this Act comes into operation as respects that ship, be recalculated on the basis of allowing the maximum deduction under this Act instead of that previously allowed, and the necessary alteration of the particulars and certificate of the registry of the ship shall be made and shall take effect on that date.

(2) The registrar of every port of registry shall make any alteration in the particulars of the registry of any ship registered at that port, which is required for the purposes of this section, and shall send notice of the alteration so made to the managing owner of the ship.

(3) The managing owner of the ship, on the receipt of any such notice of alteration, shall forthwith transmit the notice to the master of. the ship, and the master of the ship on receipt of the notice shall produce it to the registrar of the port at which the ship is when the notice is received, if that port is a port having a registrar, and, if not, to the registrar of the first port having a registrar at which the ship arrives after the notice is received, and the registrar shall alter the certificate of registry of the ship in accordance with the notice.

(4) If the managing owner or master of a ship fails to comply with the provisions of this section, the managing owner or master, as the case may be, shall be liable on summary conviction, in respect of each offence, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.

This will be the repo for texts and code related to The Statutes Project:

www.statutes.org.uk

It currently contains seven folders, containing the OCR of different series of collections of English/Welsh, British, Irish and U.K. statutes. The text has been OCR'd, using Abbyy FineReader 12, and is in the process of being run through word checking and normalizing software. Check the folders and the changelogs for more detail and current status.

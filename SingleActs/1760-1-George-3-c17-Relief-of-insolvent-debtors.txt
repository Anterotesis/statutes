Provided also, That every Person and Persons intitled, or to be intitled to the Benefit of this Act, shall obtain their respective Discharges, on or before the Thirty first Day of March, One thousand seven hundred and sixty three, or shall be excluded from all Benefit of this Act.

And whereas it may happen that several Persons who may claim and be intitled to the Benefit of this Act, are seised of an Estate Tail, in some Freehold or Copyhold Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments; which Entail, with the Remainders thereupon expectant, they have by Law Power to defeat and bar, either by levying a Fine or Fines, suffering a Common Recovery or Common Recoveries, or by Surrender or Surrenders thereof, whereby such Person or Persons said Freehold or Copyhold Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, would be liable to the Payment of their Debts, and be delivered up, according to the Terms of this Act, for the Benefit of their Creditors; be it therefore enacted by te Authority aforesaid, That, in every such Case, such Person or Persons so seised, as aforesaid, and who shall be intitled to, and claim, the Benefit of this Act, shall, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever, in Law, be deemed and taken, and is and are hereby declared, to be seised of such Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, in Fee, provided the same shall be delivered up to the Creditor or Creditors of every such Prisoner, in the same Manner as if such Person or Persons had actually levied a Fine, suffered a Common Recovery or Recoveries, or made a Surrender or Surrenders thereof, and thereby had become so seised in Fee; any Law, or Construction of Law, to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

And whereas many Prisoners who may be intitled to, and claim the Benefit of, this Act, have been great Dealers, or otherwise engaged in large Transactions, whereby they may be intitled to sundry and great Debts and Demands of various and intricate Natures, and they may be intitled to Equities of redemption of Estates, subject and liable to Mortgages, Judgements, or other contingent Estates in Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, or to other trusts or Interests in Estates, both Real and Personal, which may not be sufficiently described or discovered in the Schedule or Inventory before directed to be delivered in, upon Oath, by the Prisoner to be discharged as aforesaid, or which may want his Aid or Assistant to adjust, make out, recover, or manage, for the Benefit of the Creditors; be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the respective Assignees of the Estate and Effects of such Prisoner or Prisoners who shall obtain his, her, or their Discharge, in pursuance of this Act, or any other Person or Persons duly authorized by them for that Purpose, from time to time, to apply to any Two or more of the Justices of the Peace for the County, Riding, Division, City, Town, Place, or Liberty, where such Prisoner or Prisoners shall be then residing, thereby desiring, that such Prisoner or Prisoners may be further examined as to any Matters or Things relating to his, her, or their Estate or Effects; whereupon such Justices shall send for, or call before them, such Prisoner or Prisoners by such Warrant, Summons, Ways or Mean, as they shall think fit; and upon such Prisoner's appearing, shall examine him, her, or them, as well upon Oath as otherwise, as to such Matters and Things as such Assignee shall desire, relating to the Estate or Effects of such Prisoner or Prisoners; and if any Prisoner or Prisoners (on Payment or Tender of Payment of such reasonable Charges as such Justices shall judge sufficient) shall neglect or refuse to come and appear, not having a lawful Excuse, to be made known to such Justices and by them allowed, or, being come before them, shall refuse to be sworn, or to answer to all such Questions as by such Justices shall be put to him, her, or them, relating to the Discovery of his, her, or their Estate or Effects so vested, or intended to be vested, in such Clerk of the Peace, or in such Assignees, as aforesaid, that then it shall and may be lawful to and for such Justices, by Warrant under their Hands and Seals, to apprehend such Prisoner or Prisoners so offending as aforesaid, and him, her, or them, to commit to the County Gaol, there to remain without Bail or Mainprize, until such Time as he, she, or they, shall submit him, her, or themselves, to such Justices, and answer upon Oath to all such lawful Questions as shall by such Justices be put to him, her, or them, for the Purposes aforesaid.

And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every such Person and Persons who shall, within Twelve Months after the Discharge of such Prisoner or Prisoners, voluntarily come in and make a Discovery of any Part of such Debtor or Debtors Real or personal Estate as shall not be comprized in such Schedule as aforesaid, before any such Justices aforesaid, shall be allowed after the Rate of Twenty Pounds per Centum, out of the net Produce of such Debtor or Debtors Estate, which will be recovered on such Discovery, and which shall be paid such Person or Persons so discovering the same, by the Assignee or Assigness of such Prisoner's Estate and Effects.

And whereas many persons who are Prisoners for Debt, too often chuse rather to continue in Prison, and spend their Substance there, than discover and deliver up to their Creditors their Estates or Effects towards satisfying their just Debts; be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful to or for any Creditor or Creditors of any Prisoner committed, or who shall hereafter be committed, and charged in Execution in any Gaol or Prison, upon Twenty Days Notice in Writing for the Purpose to be given to such Prisoner who now is charged in Execution, or who, at any Time after the passing of this Act, shall be charged in Execution, and also to the Gaoler or Keeper of the Prison in whose Custody such Prisoner is, to require the Sheriff or Sheriffs, Gaoler or Gaolers, or Keeper of the Prison wherein any such Prisoner is or shall be detained, to bring any such Prisoner before the Justices at their next General or Quarter Session of the Peace, or any Adjournment thereof, for the respective County, Riding, Division, City, Town, or Liberty, in the Gaol or Prison of which any such Prisoner shall be detained, after any such Notice shall be given, together with a Copy or Copies of the Cause or Cause of his or her Detainer; and such Prisoner coming before such Justices at their said General or Quarter Session held as aforesaid, shall, at the Desire of any Creditor or Creditors at whose Suit he or she shall be detained, be obliged to take and subscribe the Oath herein after directed to be taken, and also to deliver in and subscribe a Schedule of his or her Estates and Effects, in like Manner as Persons desiring to take the Benefit of this Act are required to do; and every such Prisoner, upon taking the Oath herein after directed, and subscribing such Schedule as aforesaid, and discovering his or her Estates to the Satisfaction of the said Justices in their said General or Quarter Session held as aforesaid, or the major Part of them, shall be discharged and set at Liberty, in the same Manner, and with the same Benefit of making use of their Discharge, as is hereby provided for Prisoners who shall be discharged under this Act; and if any such Prisoners, who shall be so brought up as aforesaid, and be required to deliver up his or her Estates or Effects as aforesaid, shall neglect or refuse so to do, and to deliver in and subscribe such Schedule within Forty Days after he or she shall be so brought up, or shall wilfully conceal any of his or her Estate or Effects, to the Amount of Twenty Pounds or upwards, or any Books, Papers, or Writings thereto belonging, with Intent to defraud his or her creditors (and being thereof lawfully convicted by Judgement or Information, shall be deemed and adjudged to be guilt of Felony, and shall suffer Death as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy) and in any such Case such Felon's Goods and Estate shall go and be divided amongst his or her Creditors in proportion to each one's respective Debt.

Provided always, and be it further enacted, That the Creditor or Creditors who shall design to compel any such Prisoner to deliver in any such Schedule of their Estate and Effects, and surrender up the same, shall give public Notice of such his or her Intention in the London Gazette, if the Prisoner is in Custody in any Gaol in London, or within the Weekly Bills of Mortality, and if not, then also in some News Paper which shall be published in or near the County, Riding, Division, City, Town, Liberty, or Place, where the Gaol is in which any such Person shall be a Prisoner, twenty Days at least before any such General or Quarter Session shall be so held as aforesaid, to the End the other Creditors of every such Prisoner may be apprized thereof, and come in for their respective distributive Shares of the Estate and Effects of every such Person; and which Estate and Effects shall be disposed of with all convenient Speed, after any Person or Persons shall be chose Assignee or Assignees of the Estate and Effects of any such Prisoner, by such Assignee or Assignees; and the neat Produce thereof shall be equally distributed between and amongst all the just Creditors of any such Prisoner, in proportion to their respective Debts, who shall ascertain the same, on Oath, in like Manner as creditors of Persons seeking their Discharge under this Act are required and directed by this Act to do: And if any Dispute shall arise touching the Reality or Fairness of any such Debt, the same shall be determined by the Justices at the next General or Quarter Session which shall be held for the County, Riding, Division, City, Town, Liberty, or Place, wherein the Gaol or Prison in which any such Prisoner was in Custody, when required to surrender up his Estates and Effects in pursuance of this Act, is; and if, after paying all the Debts of any such Prisoner, and all necessary Charges, any Overplus shall remain from his Estates or Effects, the same shall be paid to such Prisoner, his Executors, or Administrators.

And be it further enacted, That every Prisoner who shall be required to deliver up his Estate and Effects as aforesaid, shall, at the General or Quarter session at which he or she shall be required to appear as aforesaid, take an Oath to the Effect following; that is to say,

I A.B. upon my corporal Oath, in the Presence of Almighty God, do solemnly swear, protest, and declare, That the Schedule now delivered in, and by me subscribed, doth contain, to the best of my Knowledge, remembrance, and Belief, a full, just, true, and perfect Account and Discovery of all my Real Estate, either in Possession, Reversion, Remainder, or Expectancy, and of all the Goods, Chattles, and Personal Estate, which I, or any in Trust for me, or for my Benefit or Advantage, now have or am intitled to; and of all Debts as are to me owing, or to any Person or Persons in Trust for me; and of all Securities and Contracts whereby any Money now is, or will or may hereafter become payable to, or any Benefit or Advantage may accrue to me, or to my Use, or to any Person or Persons in Trust for me; and the Names and Places of Abode of the several Persons from whom such Debts are due and owing; and of the Witnesses that can prove such Debts or Contracts; and also a true Account of all Books, Papers, Decrees, Writings, and Evidence relating thereto, in my Custody or Power; and that neither I, nor any Person or Persons in Trust for me, have, to my Knowledge and Belief, any Lands, Money, Stock, or other Estate, Real or Personal, in Possession, Reversion, or Remainder, other than what is or are in the said Schedule contained; except the Wearing Apparel, Bedding for myself and Family, Working Tools, and necessary Implements for my Occupation and Calling, and these in the Whole not exceeding the Value of Ten Pounds; and that I have not, nor any Body for me hath, directly or indirectly, sold, lessened, or otherwise conveyed, disposed of in Trust, or concealed, all or any Part of my Messuages, Lands, Money, Goods, Chattles, Stock, Debts, Securities, Contracts, or Estates, Real or Personal, or any Books, Papers, or Writings, concerning the same, whereby to secure the same, or to receive or expect any Profit or Advantage to myself or my Family, or with any View or Design to defraud or deceive any Creditor or Creditors, to whom I am indebted, or was indebted when committed to Gaol, in any wise howsoever.

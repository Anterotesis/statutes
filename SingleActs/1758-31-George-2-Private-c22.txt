1758: 31 George 2 private act 22: An Act for Establishing Agreements between Charles Brandling, Esquire, and other Persons, Proprietors of Lands, for laying down a Waggon-Way, in order for the better supplying the Towns and Neighbourhood of Leeds, in the County of York, with Coals.

Whereas Charles Brandling, Esquire, Lord of the Manor of Middleton, in the County of York, is Owner and Proprietor of divers Coal-works, Mines, Veins, and Seams of Coals, lying and being within the said Manor of Middleton, and Places adjacent; and hath proposed, and is willing to engage and undertake, to furnish and supply the Inhabitants of the Town of Leeds with Coals for their necessary Use and Consumption, at the Rate or Price of Four Pence Three Farthings a Corf, containing in Weight about Two hundred and Ten Pounds, and in Measure Seven thousand Six hundred and Eighty cubical Inches, for the Term of Sixty Years, to commence from the Second Day of January One thousand Seven hundred and Fifty-eight, and for such further Term, or longer Time, as the said Mines, or any of them, shall continue to be used and wrought; and, at his own Charge and Expense, to carry and convey, or cause to be carried and conveyed, from

[ 2 ]

his said Coal-works yearly, and every Year, Twenty thousand Dozen, or Two hundred and Forty thousand Corfs, of Coals at the least; and to lay up and deposit such Coals, or cause the same to be laid up and deposited, upon a certain Field or open Place called Casson Close, near the Great Bridge, at Leeds, in order to be there sold and delivered, at the Rate and Price aforesaid, unto the Inhabitants of the said Town of Leeds, or to such other Persons as shall purchase the same; and, as the said Coal-mines and Coal-works lie at the Distance of Twp Miles and upwards from the said Field or Place called Casson Close, intended for a Coal-yard or Repository for the said Coals so to be sold and disposed of, and it will, therefore, be absolutely necessary, for carrying the said Proposal into Execution, that a Waggon-Way (such as is used for and about the Coal-works and Coal-mines in the Counties of Durham and Northumberland) should be made, framed, laid down, and continued, between the said Coal-works and the said Casson Close Coal-yard and Repository, in, over, and through, divers Fields, Lands, and Grounds, in the Parish of Leeds, which belong to, and are the Estate and Property of, divers Persons; as the several Owners and Occupiers whereof have consented and agreed that the said Charles Brandling, his Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, shall and may have the Liberty and Privilege to make, place, and lay down, such Waggon-Way or Ways, for the Carriage and Conveyance of Coals, in, upon, and over the same, or any Part or Parts thereof respectively, as to him and them shall seem proper and requisite; and also to continue, and, from time to time, to repair, maintain, and support, the same Waggon-Way or Ways during the Term aforesaid, as he and they will think necessary and expedient; and the said Charles Brandling hath agreed to pay such yearly Rent, or other Considerations, for the said Liberty and Privilege, as will not only exceed the Damage to be thereby done to the said Lands and Grounds, but confidently increase the yearly Rent and Value thereof, and be manifestly for the Benefit of the Owners thereof for the Time being.

And whereas the carrying the said Proposal and Agreement into Execution will be a great Advantage, not only to the Inhabitants of the Towns of Knaresborough, Ripon, Boroughbridge, Aldborough, and Ripley, in the West Riding of the said County of York, who are many of them supplied with Coals from the said Coal-works at Middleton, by saving the Length and Expense of Carriage, through very bad Roads, for Five Miles and upwards, but also to the Inhabitants of the Town of Leeds aforesaid, where Two hundred and Forty thousand Corfs of Coals and upwards

[ 3 ]

are computed to be yearly consumed, by effecting a very considerable Reduction in the Price of Coals to the said Inhabitants, which will be a great Ease and Relief to the Persons employed in the Woollen Manufactory, and tend to the Encouragement and Improvement of Trade and Commerce in that Country; But, as some of the Owners and Proprietors of the Lands and Grounds so to be used and employed for the said Waggon-Way, and Purposes herein before mentioned, may happen to have only a limited and not an absolute Interest and Property therein, and may be under other Disabilities to assure to the said Charles Brandling, and his Assigns, the Enjoyment of the said Powers, Liberties, and Privileges, necessary to render the said Agreement effectual for the Purposes aforesaid, without the Aid and Authority of an Act of Parliament:

I am firmly persuaded, that the Love and good Affection of my Subjects h the surest Pledge, of their Duty and Obedience, and die truest and justest Suppoi t of the Throne; and as 1 am resolved to delend and maintain the Church, as by Law' established, and to protect you in the full Enjoyment of all your Rights and Liberties, so I rely upon your Care of me.

The late Disappointment at Cadiz does the more affect us, because it gives your Majesty so much Trouble; but this Misfortune cannot make us forget, that the Protection and Security of our Trade, the vigorous Support of your Majesty's Allies, and the wonderful Progress of your Majesty's Arms, under the Conduct of the Earl of Marlborough, have signally retrieved the ancient Honour and Glory of the English Nation.

High Price Sir Walter Clarges reported from the Committee, to ef Coala. whom it was referred, to enquire into the Reasons of the excessive Price of Coals within the weekly Bills of Mortality; and to consider of some Means, for. lowering the ' same, and preventing the like excessive Prices for the future ;the Matter, as it appeared to the Committee, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

That it appeared to the Committee, upon the Examination of several Master Colliers, and other Persons, that one Reason of the excessive Prices of Coals is from the high Wages, that are now paid; vis. a Boy, of Seventeen Years of Age, has 46 Shillings a Month; and a Man (though old) 7 or 8 /. a Voyage, who formerly had but 30 s'.

But, that a further Reason appeared also to the Committee, from a certain Contract that was made near two Years ago, and is now in force, between several Owners1 of Collieries at Newcastle, and the Body of Lightermen at London; whereby the Proprietors oblige themselves to pay the Lightermen 3 d. per Chaldron, for all Goals, they should sell for them; in Consideration of which' Reward, the Lightermen are to pay the Proprietors Six-pence per Chaldron, for all other Coals, they shall at any time sell, before the Proprietors Coals are sold oft.

Vot. 14.

That, under the Advantage of the said Contract, the Proprietors at Newcastle have raised the Price of their Coals there, 12 d.and 18 d.per Chaldron; which the

Masters of the Vessels are forced to pay them, although they ban have as good Coals so much cheaper, otherwise they cannot sell their Coals here, till the Proprietors Markets are over; which has been very detrimental to iseveral of the Masters who have loaded with Sunderland, and other good or better, Coal3, than the Proprietors in Contract, by being often obliged to lie many Days in the River here, waiting, until the Contract Coals are all bought up, before they can sell any.

And whereas the Proprietors, before the Contract, used to allow the Masters Three, Four, and sometimes Five, Chaldrons to the Score, how they will allow none.

That one Mi . Rickards, one of the Contractors for the Lightermen, keeps an Office, from whence the Proprietors Agent distributes and pays the Three-pences per Chaldron to the Lightermen.

The said Mr. Rickards (being summoned) attended tbfr Committee, and owned the said Contract, and produced Two Papers, purporting the same; one, under several Proprietors Hands, to the Lightermen; and the other, a Copy of that, under the Lightermen's Hands, to the Proprietors:

But said, the Proprietors had not collected any of the Six-pence per Chaldron Forfeitures, if any were due:

That the Reason of the Contract was, to prevent the mixing of good and bad Coals, together (whereby all People were cheated) by the Fitters, or Coal-brokers, ai the Collieries:

For that now the Proprietors have their own FitterS/ and send up Coals, without Mixture, for them to sell and they do prefer the Proprietors Coals, for which they are paid the Three-pences per Chaldron, in selling them off before any others:

And that the high Price upon Coals was partly occasioned by the Fleet missing the making of Two Voyages! the last Season, upon the Account of an Embargo, that was then laid upon all Skipping.

That, upon Consideration of the whole Matter, the Committee came to the Resolutions following; viz.

Resolved, 1. That it is the Opinion of this Committee;

That the Agreement between several Coal-owners of Newcastle, and the Lightermen in London, is a great Discouragement to the Coal Trade, tends to the Prejudice of Navigation, and is an Occasion of the Advancement of the Price of Coals in London.

Resolved, 2d. That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That, to allot a competent Number of Seamen to the Colliers, Press-free, and to have a competent Number of Ships appointed for Convoys and Cruizers, will be si sure Means to lower the Price of Coals, and prevent the like excessive Price for the future.

The fir t Resolution being read a Second time;

An Amendment was proposed to be made therein, by leaving out “ Agreement;” and inserting “ Combination' instead thereof:

And the same was, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, so amended, That the Combination between several Coal-owners of Newcastle, and the Lightermen in London, is a great Discouragement to the Coal Trade, tends to the Prejudice of Navigation, and is an Occasion of the Advancement of the Price of Coals in London.

The Second Resolution, being read a Second time, wad, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill, upon the said Resolutions; and that Sir Walter Mr.

Chancellor Of the Dutchy, Mr Smith, arid Mr. Crosse, do prepard, and bring in, the same.

Upon the Petition of John Lade Esquire, complaining of an undue Election of Charles Cox, and John Cholmley, Esquires, to serve for the Borough of Southwark:

That the Counsel for the Petitioner insisted, that the Election was void, because a Riot was committed by the

Servants and Agents of the Sitting Members, at the Time of the Election; and to be heard to the Right of Election.

That they called several Witnesses, who said, that on Thursday, the 16th Day of July, being the 2d Day of the Poll, there was a great Tumult and Riot, occasioned by about Ten, or more, of Mr. Cox's Draymen, who were distinguished by grey Hats, with red Ribbands: That, being joined with the Servants of Mr. Malyn (Mr. Cox's Brother-in-law) and many others, they did, with their Hats in their Hands, strike divers Persons, and cleared St. Margaret s Hill (where the Poll was taken) of those, that came to vote for Mr. Lade, and hindered many of them coming to the Poll, and Others could not come to it, without Hazard and Difficulty: That, for this Reason, the Poll was closed sooner, than it had been the Night before; and that the Constables were not able to do their Duty, in keeping the Peace. On? of the Constables said, he saw a Man, that owned, he belonged to Mr. Cholmley, beat another: He would have carried him to the Compter, had he not been rescued by others, that were for Mr. Carand Mr.

He Said, the place of Polling was pretty clear, though tli? Fighting was not far from it: That Mr. Cholmley called upon him, to keep the Peace; but he durst not venture among them. Another Constable said, the Disorders were from the Zeal of both Parties; but that the Men w ith the grey Hats were most remarkable in them; and that he was called upon, either by one of the Sitting Members, or by the head Bailiff, to keep the Peace,

Rowland Jones said, that, speaking to one of the Men, with a grey Hat, and red Ribband, to take care, not to make a Riot, he answered him, that they did nothing, but what they were ordered.

That Mr. Lade did, on Friday Morning, protest against their Proceedings, and went away; but all Tilings were at that Time very quiet.

That the Witnesses for the Sitting Members spoke, in the First place, to the Bailiff's impartial Behaviour.

They said, that, after the Disorders began, the Voters came not so fast to poll, as before: That several were polled, during the same, but not any, as they remember, that were for the Petitioner; That they thought this as quiet an Election, as ever they saw in the Borough, unless one of Mr. Bcwyer's: That on the Friday Morning all was sp quiet, one might freely come to poll.

That they saw one IValker, who w as for the Petitioner, and had been drinking, very disorderly, and striking several, with his Hat and Peruke in his Hands: Which some of the Petitioner's Witnesses had owned; but said, that IValker was first pushtby others, and that then, they believed, he might do, as they did; and that the Friends of Mr. Cox and Mr. Cholmley began the Disorders. Some of the Constables said, they heard Mr. Cholmley propose to Mr. Lade the Adjournment of the Poll, for fear of Mischief; and that it was done with his Consent

Josiah RatcUffe said, he was abused for voting for the Sitting Members, and invited to poll afterwards for the Petitioner.

Whereupon the Committee came to these Resolutions:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That there was a great Tumult, and Riot, at the Election of Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Southwark, in the County of Surrey.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the said Tumult, and Riot, was committed by the Servants and Agents of Charles Cox and John Cholmley, Esquires.

That, after this, the Counsel for the Petitioner spoke to the Right of Election.

They said, that the Inhabitants at large had been admitted to vote at this Election; under which Pretence, the Prisoners of the King's Bench had sometimes voted, and so many others, that it was impossible ever to have a fair Election, or any Scrutiny; That none, of common Right, ought to vote, but such, as were liable to pay Wages to their Members; and those were only such, as paid Scot and Lot.

This they insisted on, but produced no Evidence.

That

i Ann. io Novembris.25

That, for the Sitting Members, several Witnesses were produced, who spoke to the Elections for 20, 30, and some of them for 40, Years past; and all of them affirmed the Usage to be, for all the Housekeepers, not receiving Alms, to vote. They desired, the Resosulution of the House in the Convention Parliament, upon a controverted Election, might be read; where the House agreed with the Committee, That the Right of Election was in the Housekeepers, not receiving Alms.

That then the whole Report was desired by the Counsel for the Petitioner to be read; who observed from thence, that this was no new Claim, now set up; and that, in Mr. Thompsons Election, those only, that paid Scot and

Lot, voted; and urged, That, at former Elections, the Householders, not receiving Alms, had been let in to vote, -by Articles, agreed on betwixt the Candidates; which ought not to alter any Right. Some of the Witnesses for the Sitting Members owned, they had heard of Articles at former Elections, but did not remember what they contained.

That then they proceeded to another Allegation in their Petition, of indirect Practices; and, to prove them, produced a great many Notes, under the Hands of Mr. Cox, and another Justice of the Peace, for discharging several Persons, that were rated in Levies to the Poor; and some of these Notes had Postscripts, to this Effect; “ That they were taken off, at the Instance of Mr. CholmlySeveral of which Persons voted for the Sitting Members.

That the Vestry-book of St. Parish was pro-

duced; where an Entry is made of the Irregularity of this Practice; and the Persons, so discharged, are there ordered to be put into the next Poor's Rate.,

That these Notes did all bear Date long before this last Election, and none of them later than the 3d of April, 1702.

And that, upon the whole, the Committee came to the following Resolutions; viz.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of electing Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Southwark, in the County of Surrey, is only in the Inhabitants thereof, paying Scot and Lot.

But the Counsel for the Petitioner objected, that Five of those {viz. Thomas Taylor, James Butler,

mage, Thomas Mason, and Fra. S-) who voted for the Sitting Members, had no Right to vote; that the Votes of Four others were obtained by corrupt and indirect Practices; and that the Sitting Members voted for themselves.

Evidence was given, that Tho. Taylor confessed, when he was polled, that he had no Conveyance, in Writing, of the Land he voted for. His Father said, he had given him the Land a Year and a Half before the Election; that his Son had built an House upon it, at his own Charge; and that the Conveyance was ordered to be drawn before, though not executed till after, the Election.

That James Butler was only a Mortgagee of Burgage Land, for a Term of Years, and not in Fee. It was answered, he had been Four Years in Possession, and voted at the former Election.

That Richard Talmage had not a Title to his Burgage Land, because his Mother, whose Land it was, had not joined in the Conveyance.

That Thomas Mason voted for Land that was not within the Borough.

There were Witnesses, said, that he paid a Burgage Rent, of one Penny, to the Mayor; and that the Owners of this Land had voted in former Elections, for Thirty Years, without Exception.

Bunny, who sold the Land to Mason, said, it was not Burgage Land; and, as to the Rent, that he contracted with him, to pay One Penny yearly; which was Part of that Rent he was obliged to pay for other Burgage Land.

And that Francis Sawyer voted for Burgage Land, that is an Idiot's Estate, not his own.

That then they proceeded to prove the obtaining Votes for the Sitting Members, by indirect and corrupt Practices.

That Thomas Powell and his Wife were treated with Meat and Drink by the Sitting Members, at Andover, the Saturday before the Election; but the Landlord of the House said, it was his Treat to Mr JVooland Colonel Shrimpton, who had bought a Hogshead of Wine of him, and that, seeing Powell in the Yara, he sent him to them.

James Haslet was called; who informed the Committee; that, upon his asking William Read, how he could be such a Villain, to vote against Mr. Park and Mr. Dean, when he had heard him promise them his Votes, he told him, he got more by voting for the Sitting Members; for Colonel Schrimpton had promised to make him a Serjeant in the Guards, and to give him Five Guineas, to vote for Mr.

Woollaston; which he had received.

Haslet and Read were confronted: They positively contradicted each other; but Read said, Colonel Park had promised to keep him in Work, if he would vote for him, and to make him a Governor of his Negroes in Virginia.

Haslet further said, Read told him, he would not give false Testimony: That Colonel Schrimpton had asked him, if he could not testify, that Colonel Park had offered him 201, for his Vote. He owned Mr. JVoollaston had lent 50 /. to his Brother, which his Father was to repay; who told him, he would not have voted for Mr. Woollaston, but upon account of this Money. There w as no Obligation under his Fathers Hand, neither did Mr. JVoollaston demand the Money before the Election, or threaten him.

That a Buck was sent to the House of Tho. Long, an Inn-keeper at Whitchurch, after the Teste of the Writ:

That Mr. JVoollaston told Long, that, if he would vote for him, and for Colonel Schrimpton, the Buck should be spent there; otherwise not; and that it was carried from his House to Phillips's.

But Phillips said, the Buck was carried by Mistake to Long's; that he was spoke to by Mr. Woollaston, and had Notice of it, 3 or Days before the Buck came in; and made other Provision for the Entertainment of the Duke of Bolton, and the Gentlemen of the Countiy: That no Elector dined with them; that the Dinner is not yet

Mr. Bromley, from the Commissioners for taking the Earl of public Accounts, presented to the House a Narrative or Ranekgh' Representation of their Proceedings, in relation to the Ac- AccounP counts of the Earl of Ranelagh, Paymaster of the Forces; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was read, and is, as followeth; viz.

WHEN your Commissioners entered upon the Execution of the Trust, lodged in them by Act of Parliament, they applied themselves, in the first Place, to the Examination of the general Receipts and Issues of the public Revenue, for as long Time past, as, they supposed, their Commission would allow, and to the Inspection of the particular Management of those Offices, through which the Treasure of the Nation is conveyed into the Exchequer.; and though it is little more than Seven Months, since they were first constituted, and some Time was necessarily spent in many previous Preparations, before they could enter upon Business, as well as lost afterwards by that Interruption, which the calling of a new Parliament occasioned, yet they will in a few Days be ready to make you a Report of their Proceedings upon these Matters.

They resolved also to enquire into the Management of the Receipts at the Exchequer, and the Distribution of the Money afterwards; but this being a large Field, and a Work of great Extent, they chose chiefly to apply themselves to the two great Branches, the Army, ana Navy; for the Services of which, 47,674,089 /. l 3frf. , have been paid to the several Treasurers and Paymasters, between the 5th of November, 1688, and Michaelmas last; of which the greatest Part has not been at all accounted for.

Ranelagh's

Accounts.

8 ii° Novembris. \ 1702.

Of this Stun the Earl of Ranelagh, Paymaster of the Army, has received 19,518,452/. 4 1

Your Commissioners began, as early as they could, to call upon his Lordship, and the other Officers concerned with the Army, for those Materials, they thought necessary, in order to the examining and stating his Accounts; and l>eing very sensible of his long Experience, and great Abilities, as well as of their own little Practice in Things of this Nature, they endeavoured to collect such Papers, and ask such plain Questions, as must, if fairly complied with, and punctually answered, lay all open to their View.

That your Commissioners might the better judge, what was proper for them to ask of his Lordship, they writ to him, April the 15th, for a true Copy of his Commission, together with such Instructions, as he had at any time received, for the Execution thereof.

May the 15th, your Commissioners issued a Precept to his Lordship, for Accounts to be exhibited, on Thursday, the 25th of June, according to the Schemes they prescribed him, of the Balance remaining in his Hands on the 5th of November, 1688; of all Money he had received, between that Time, and the 25th of December, 1701; of all Deductions made from the Regiments; and also of all his Payments whatsoever.

His Lordship, in Return to this Precept, brought to your Commissioners general Abstracts of Accounts, with gross Items of his Payments, and such, as were in no Respect conformable to the Method they prescribed; and, among other Things, his Lordship urging the great Pains, and Expence of Time, it would require, to be so particular, as they desired, that therefore the least Trouble possible might be given him, your Commissioners only insisted, that he should make up for them such Regimental Accounts, to the last of March, 1692, inclusive, as from that Time he had been obliged to do by Act of Parliament. With this his Lordship was sometimes pleased to say, he would comply, and immmediately afterwards to affirm it to be impracticable. They argued, that it was impossible for him to make out Debentures, for clearing the Regiments to this Time, if he had not had all his Payments upon Account to them before him; and that the gross Sums, delivered in to your Commissioners, must arise from Particulars. At last his Lordship owned, that in the Books of his Office they were contained, with all his Payments to, and for the Use of, the Forces, digested regimental ly. Much Time having been unprofitably spent in Conferences and Letters, that more might be lost, nor his Lordship put to the Trouble of picking (as he called it) these Payments out of his Ledger, they desired, he would please to let them have the Originals, and promised to take that Labour off his Hands.

His Lordship then began to dispute their Authority to require any of these Accounts, which had been laid before former Commissioners, and some of which had been passed by the Auditors: Though your Commissioners must beg Leave to observe, that his Lordship had already brought them Abstracts of these Accounts, and never disputed their Authority, till they called upon him to lay before them such further Particulars, as they thought absolutely necessary for the perfect examining, and true stating, of them; and that his last Account, for 15 Months, ending the 31st of March 1692, was not declared, till after they had sent to him for his Accounts, and very few Days before he made his Return.

That your Commissioners might be able to judge, whether the Ledgers, in his Lordship's Office, would answer what was expected from them, they sent, July the 2d, a Member of this Commission, with one of the Ac-comptants, to inspect them; but his Lordship refused to suffer it, and, after taking more than seven Weeks, to consult his Counsel (which he had promised to do in Two or Three Days) whether, by Law, he was obliged to comply with what your Commissioners had desired, at last, August the 19th, he sent them Two Books, but at the same Time acquainted them by Letter, that he thought it both reasonable, and necessary, to take such Abstracts, as might readily inform him, what they contained, should any Misfortune happen to them: Upon which.

your Commissioners, taking into Consideration his Lordship's great Care and Caution, and the Jealousies he seemed to have of them, directed the Books to be scaled up, and no Use to be made of them, till the Abstracts had been examined and compared.

His Lordship's Clerks were so uncertain in their Attendance, and so often ill, or out of Town, that Three Weeks passed before this could be finished; and then, upon your Commissioners [a] looking into them, it soon appeared, they were in no Sort what they expected, or what his Lordship had given them Reason to believe they were.

These Disappointments discouraged not your Commissioners, who desired his Lordship once more to give himself the Trouble of coming to them. With this he wa3 pleased to comply; and they acquainted him, that they thought it impossible for them to discharge their Duty faithfully, and to your Satisfaction, unless they had the Credits of the several Regiments more particularly stated; and unless he was pleased to distinguish, what he paid in Cash, and what he had deducted for Poundage, Hospital, Arms, Ammunition, Transportation, Bread, fyc. His Lordship said, that, if your Commissioners would name any Regiment, he could soon give them such an Account of it: They then replied, if his Lordship could do it in one Instance, he must be able, in a little more Time, to do it in all the rest; and pressing him for such Accounts, he thought fit again to insist, that he was not obliged to give them any for this Time; but being asked, if that was his final Resolution, he said, he would look for those Scraps of Paper (to use his own Expression) which Mr. Abbot perhaps might have left behind him, and endeavour to give them Satisfaction. They let his Lordship know, he should have immediately a Precept, to this Effect, from them; and accordingly, as soon as it could be dictated, and writ, it was dispatched to his Lordship's Office; but he had just before taken Coach, and was gone to Cranbomc; and from that Time they have had no such Account from him.

notwithstanding all these Difficulties, that your Commissioners have laboured under, from the Delays, Neglects, and imperfect Accounts, they have received from the Paymaster of the Army, and the little Satisfaction they have met with, in their Enquiries, from those other Offices, that were chiefly instituted, as Checks and Controls upon the Paymaster; yet, that nothing might be wanting, on their Part, to discharge the Trust reposed in them, they have examined, as well as they have been able, the Paymaster's Accounts between the 1st of January, 1687, and the last of March, 1692; and though they cannot pretend [to present ] you with a perfect State of them, yet they shall humbly lay before you, what Method they have taken, and what Observations have occurred to them upon the said Accounts.

They have examined the Earl of Ranelagh's Charge, which appears' to consist of the following Particulars:

His Lordship's Answer to the Charge of Interest, received on Tallies, is, that these Tallies were assigned over to several Persons, who received the Interest; and therefore he ought not to be charged with it He alleges, that it has been his constant Course, to write his Name upon the Back of the Orders, without any formal Assignment; that these Orders were then delivered to such as had a Right to receive them, with all the Interest due from the Date of them; and that, upon Examination, it appears, that when the Money, due on such Orders, has been received at the Exchequer, Acquittances have been written over the Paymaster's Name, as if he had received both Principal and Interest. Upon which, your Commissioners observing what his Lordship affirmed, they thought it proper to write to him, to come prepared with Evidence,

to justify this Answer to their Charge of Interest; in Return to which his Lordship acquainted them, that Mr. Pigeon,his Clerk, being out of Town, he could

not so soon be ready: And since that Time they have never heard from him.

Your Commissioners have still charged him with this Interest; and they beg Leave to take notice, that the Method, his Lordship uses in his Assignments of Tallies, appears to them a Practice very liable to Fraud, and capable of covering any; and since no Date of Assignment appears, nor other Name, but his Lordship's, or his Agents, your Commissioners conceive it their Duty to charge him with all Interest received upon the same.

If they are right in these Particulars, then his Lordship's Charge for this Time, as far as it has been in their Power to state it, amounts to 4,344/. 8j. 3d. more, than he has made it.

As to his Lordship's Discharge, they have at present, for the Reasons before mentioned, only these following Observations to lay before you:

First, That all the Regiments, Troops, and Companies, which were in the Service of the late King and which, it is notorious, had many popish Officers and Soldiers in them, and were broke, and dispersed, upon the Earl of Fecersham's disbanding the Army on the 13th of December, 1688, are, by Warrant upon his Lordship's Certificate of Debentures, paid compleat to several Days in January, February, March, and April, following.

Secondly, That the Warrants, for several such Payments, bear Date, some a Year, others Two Years, after the said Regiments, Troops, and Companies, were disbanded.

Thirdly, That there are several Warrants, for paying compleat Numbers allowed on the Establishment, notwithstanding any Defect in, or Want of, Muster-rolls.

Fourthly, That there is a Warrant, dated the 17th of October, 1689, to the Auditors of the Imprests, to allow his Lordship the Sum of 172,340/. which he had Direction from his Majesty to pay to several Persons, without Deductions. The Auditors are not to charge the Persons aforesaid with these Sums, or any Part thereof; his Majesty reserving the Examination of the particular Disbursements to himself or to such, as he shall appoint for that Purpose.

F ifthly, That his Lordship discharges himself of several Sums, paid for levying the Lord Mor jaunt's (now Earl of Peterborow) and Sir John Guise his Regiments, although your Commissioners find, one of the Articles in the Account, laid before this House, of the Charge, the States General had been at in the Resolution, and upon which you paid them 600,000l. is for raising the Regiments of the Lord Mordaunt, Sir J Peyton, Sir

John Guise, and others. And here your Commissioners must observe, that the Earl of Regiment is paid

from the 5th of November, 1688, the Earl of Monmouth's, from the 1 oth, and that of Colonel from the

23rd, of the said Month, though his late Majesty landed in England on the 5th of November, Five Days before the Second, and Nineteen Days before the last. Besides, as to the Payment of 1,582/. 2 to the Earl of Monmouth, your Commissioners find the Vouchers signed, and, they believe, writ, by the said Earl himself; in which it is expressed, that Part of this Sum was received from Mr. Row, Part from the Dutch Paymaster, and the rest from the Earl of RanNow his Lordship hath surcharged himself with what was paid by Mr. Rote, but not (as he ought to have done) with what was paid by the Dutch Paymaster.

Sixthly, That, whereas his Lordship discharges himself of several Sums, paid by Warrant to Captain w

Smith, Captain Anthony Power, and Captain Henry Davies, and has passed his Account for the same, by Vouchers under their Hands, the said Captains Smith and Davies have made positive Oaths, that their Hands are forged; and your Commissioners have reason to suspect, that Captain Powers's Hand is so too; and, as Vot. 14.

an undeniable Evidence of this Fact, in what concerns garl of Captain Smith, it appears to your Commissioners, that, Ranelagh” after his Lordship had made use of the Voucher, in order Account , to stop a Complaint, which was coming into this House, he made up Captain Smith's Account, and paid him the Balance.

Seventhly, That some of his Lordship's Vouchers for Payments are only loose Papers, put into Warrants, with a Name, and nothing more, writ on them.

Eighthly, That the Payments differ very much, in many Particulars, from the Establishments< That there are Rasures in some Warrants, and very extraordinary Payments directed in others; of which your Commissioners will give you the Instances, when you please to require them.

Ninthly, That his Lordship charges himself, for Interest received, 916/. due intermediately upon Tallies, transferred over to Sir Joseph Heme:Your Commissioners

find a Warrant, signed by the late King, for allowing the Earl of Ranelaghthis Sum, as paid to George Clark,

Esquire, for secret Service, together with another Sum, paid to Rudolph Kiett,of Two thousand Pounds, without Account; and also a Privy Seal, dated the 18th of June last, for the Auditor to allow' his Lordship the same upon his Accounts; And, upon further Enquiry, it appears to your Commissioners, that the said Sum of 916/. (the only Interest his Lordship brings to Account) was never paid, as is pretended, to George Clark,

Esquire, but his Name was only used in Trust for his Lordship, who had the same to his own proper Use.

Tenthly, That, whereas his Lordship discharges himself by Payments to Colonel Cunning, and to Lieutenant-colonel St.John, each 2,000l. your Commissioners are not very well satisfied with his Lordship's Vouchers for the same, and are making further Enquiry into that Matter; but, in the mean time, they think themselves obliged to acquaint you, that Colonel Cunningham hath made Oath, that he re-paid to the Earl of 1,500l. or thereabouts, in Part of the 2,000l. which had been imprested to him; and this, your Commissioners conceive, his Lordship ought to have surcharged himself with.

To their Observations, upon these Accounts, your Commissioners have only this further to add, that the Earl of Ranelagh makes the Balance of his Account, due to himself, 185,268/. 14s. od.

The Army w as cleared to the last of March, 1692; and therefore your Commissioners made this the First Period of Time for their examining the Paymaster's Accounts. They have not been able to proceed much further upon those, which follow, and which seem to be laid before them very confused and imperfect; for, upon the little Inspection they have made into them, they observe, his Lordship's Discharges are generally by Payments of gross Sums, upon Account:

Others, by Payments to several Persons, for several Services, and on Several Occasions, without specifying the Services, or Occasions.

Particularly, he discharges himself, in some Instances, thus;

Paid to several Persons, for especial"

Services, and for sundry Disburse-! ments for especial Services, relating ( to the Forces -

Paid to several Persons, for Con tin-} gencies of divers Natures -To Monsieur Schuylen burg, for several i Sums advanced by him, for several> 76,477 Services, relating to the Forces -)

There are several other very great Sums, charged for I-oss by Remittances, and for Secret services, without Account; but with these, and others of the like Nature, your Commissioners will not at present trouble you: They only beg Leave further to observe, that his Lordship has forgot to carry a Balance, due from him, of 20,792/. 7s. id.

As your Commissioners, from these, and other the like, Instances, see, that these subsequent Accounts are as ex traordinary, and no less imperfect, than the former; so they have great Reason to apprehend, that, when they shall call upon his Lordship, to lay others before them, in such a Method, as they conceive most necessary, for their due examining and stating of them, it cannot be complied with; because, when thevsent Two of their own Members with a Precept to his Lordship, to see, whether he had kept such a Register of his regimental Accounts, as he was required to do by a Clause in an Act, passed in the 4th and 5th of the late King and Queen (for punishing Officers, and Soldiers, who shall mutiny, or desert) and continued, by several other Acts, till the 10th of April, 1698, they reported, that there was no such Register kept; that neither his Lordship, nor those he employed, owned, they knew of the Clause; but that his Lordship desired to know, where it was to be found, and said, he would read it, before he slept. They reported also, that his Lordship seemed as ignorant of the like Clause, passed in another Act of the last Session, against Mutiny and Desertion; % nd that he has kept no such Register in his Office.

This Narrative, and these Observations, your Commissioners humbly submit to the Consideration of the House.

Sir George Rook,

Y O U are now returned to this House, after a most glorious Expedition. Her Majesty began her Reign with a Declaration, that her Heart wasiutirely English, and Heaven hath made her to triumph over the Enemies of England. For this, Thanks hath been returned, in a solemn Manner, to Almighty God: There remains yet a Debt of Gratitude to those, that have been the Instruments of so wonderful a Victory; the Duke of Ormondf and yourself, who have had the Command of the Sea and Land Forces. In former Times, Admirals and Generals have had Success against France, and Spain, alone; but this Action at Vigo hath been a Victory over them confederated together. . You have not only spoiled our Enemies, but you have also enriched your own Country.

Common Victories bring Terror to the conquered; but you have brought Destruction upon them, and additional Strength to England. France had endeavoured to support its Ambition by the Riches of India; your Success,

Sir, hath only left them the Burthen of Spain, and stripped them of the Assistance of it. The Wealth of Spain, and Ships of France, are by this Victory brought over to our juster Cause. This is an Action, so glorious in the Performance, and so extensive in its Consequence, that, as all Times will preserve the Memory of it, so every Day will more and more inform us of the Benefit

No doubt, Sir, in France you are written in remarkable Characters, in the black List of those, who have taken French Gold; and 'tis a Justice due to the Duke of Ormond, and Your Merit, that you should stand re-

corded in the Registers of this House, as the Instruments of this glorious Victory: Therefore the House have come to this unanimous Resolution:

Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That the Thanks of

this House be given to his Grace the Duke of Ormond, and Sir George Rook, for the great and signal Services, by them performed for the Nation, by Sea and Land.

Which Thanks, Sir, by their Command, I now return you.

And Sir George Rook returned the House his Thanks, His Reply, for the great Honour they had done him, as followeth; viz.

Mr.

Thanks from Convocation for recarding their Privilege in the Case of Mr, Lloyd.

40 ai° Novembris. A. 1702.

Mr. Speaker,

I am now under a great Difficulty, how to express myself upon this very great Occasion. I think myself very happy, that, in my Zeal and Duty to your Service, it hath been my good Fortune to be the Instrument of that, which may deserve your Notice, and much more the Return of your Thanks. I am extremely sensible of this very great Honour, and shall take all the Care I can, to preserve it to my Grave, and convey it to my Posterity, without Spot or Blemish, by a constant, affectionate, and zealous Perseverance in the Queen's and your Service.

Sir, no man hath the Command of Fortune, but every Man hath Virtue at his Will; and though I may not always be so successful in your Service, as upon this Expedition, yet I will presume to assure you, I shall never be more faulty.

I must repeat my Inability to express myself upon this Occasion; but as I have a due Sense of the great Honour the House hath been pleased to do me, so I shall always retain a due and grateful Memory of it; and though my Duty and Allegiance are strong Obligations upon me, to do my best in the Service of my Country, yet I shall always take this as a particular Tye upon me, to do Right and Justice to your Service upon all Occasions.

Mr. Speaker acquainted the House, that there had been with him, this Morning, the Prolocutor of the Lower House of Convocation, and also the Dean of Canterbury, Archdeacon Ottley, and Mr. Moor', and brought him the following Order; viz.

Die Veneris, Novembris 20°, 1702.

ORDERED, That the Prolocutor, the Dean of Canterbury, Archdeacon Ot, and Mr. Moor, do attend Mr. Speaker of the honourable the House of Commons, and return our most humble Thanks to him, and to that honourable House, for the great Favour to the Church, and Convocation, which they have on all Occasions been pleased to express; and particularly, for the late Regard, which they, of themselves, without Suggestion, or Solicitation, were pleased to have to the Privilege of this House, in the Case of one of our Members, who had the Misfortune to fall under their Displeasure.

Resolved, That this House will, upon all Occasions, assert the just Rights and Privileges of the Lower House of Convocation.

Mr. Secretary Hedges acquainted the House, that he had a Message to this House, signed by her Majesty: And he presented it to the House; and the same was read by Air. Speaker, and is, as followeth; viz.

A NNER.

HER Majesty, considering, that there is but a very small Provision made for the Prince her Husband, he shall survive her Majesty, and that her Majesty is restrained from increasing the same, by the late Act of Parliament, for settling her Revenue, thinks it necessary to recommend the making a further Provision for the Prince to your Consideration. St. November

the 20th, 1702.

Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That this House will,

upon Monday Morning next, take into Consideration her Majesty's said gracious Message.

Mr. Conyers (according to Order) reported fi-om the Committee of the whole House, to whom it was referred, to consider further of Ways and Means, for raising the Supply, granted to her Majesty, the Resolutions, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Duties upon Coals and Culm, granted by an Act of the 9th Year, and the Duty upon Cynders, granted by

an Act in the 10th Year, of the Reign of his late Majesty King William the Third, be further continued.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the said Duties be continued for Five Years, from the 15th Day of May, 1703.

The first Resolution being read a Second time; and a Debate arising in the House thereupon;

And a Motion being made, and the Question being put, That the Debate be adjourned;

Mr. Thompson:

Mr. Moncton,

So it passed in the Negative.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, That the Duties upon Coals and Culm, granted by an Act of the 9th Year, and the Duty upon Cynders, -granted by an Act in the 10th Year, of the Reign of his late Majesty King William the Third, be further continued.

Hie Second Resolution being read a Second time;

Resobced, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, That the said Duties be continued for Five Years, from the 15th Day of May 1703.

Ordered, That a Bill be brought in, upon the said Resolutions; and that Mr. Solicitor-general, Mr. Conyers, and Mr. Lowndes, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Mr. Bromley (according to Order) reported, from the privUej Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it a Mem appeared to the said Committee, upon the Petition of the Suit. Earl of Sandwich, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition of the Earl of Sandwich, praying that he might not be hindered proceeding in Chancery by any Privilege of Parliament of Sidney Wort-ley, Esquire, for the Matters therein set forth:

That the Committee had heard Counsel on both Sides; and that the Counsel for the Earl stated his Case thus:

That the late Earl, his Father, did, by his Will, make several Executors, of whom Mr. Wort ley is the only acting Survivor.

That he devised several Legacies, and, among others,

50/. to Mr. Woi'tley, and made him only an Executor in

Trust for the Residuum; and that the Earl of Sandwich enjoyed some Goods, Part of this personal Estate; but an Action hath been lately brought by Mr. Woi'tley for the same, and a Verdict obtained; upon which the Earl of Sandwich hath been advised to bring his Bill in Chancery, to stop Proceedings at Common Law, and to have this Matter settled there: He has also brought another Bill in Chancery, for Mr. Wortley to account as a Trustee.

That the Counsel for Mr. Wortley acknowledged the late Earl of Sandwich's Will, and the Case, upon that, to be, as stated, only with this Difference; that the Residuum was to be divided betwixt this Earl, and his Brother, Mr. Richard Mountague; to whose Share he is now entitled in his own Right, as his Executor. That, out of Respect to the Earl, Mr. Wortley let him have some of the best Goods, but took Security, from him, of 1,000l. for them. That he brought his Action, and recovered 710/. but the Earl insisting on his Privilege, he has had no Benefit of the Verdict.

To this Mr. Saunderson was called; who said, he spoke to the Earl's Attorney, who would not say, the Earl waved his Privilege; and therefore they deferred going to Trial, till Privilege was out. He did not speak with the Earl, and cannot directly say, that what his Attorney said, was' by his Order. They further alleged, that Mr. Worthy has now a Right of his own, and therefore is not barely a Trustee: That the Earl has given a Release, as to his- Father's

Father's Will; and one of the Bills iri Chancery calls in question the Validity of Mr. Richard s Will;

which is to defeat what Mr. JVortley claims in his own Bight.

That the Counsel for the Earl of Sandwich denied his having insisted on his Privilege, and, in his Name, declared his waving it in all Suits with Mr. Worthy. They said, if there is any Release, it was obtained unduly, and by Surprize, and one of the Bills in Chancery is to be relieved against it; and that, by the other, he only desires a just and fair Account of the Trust Estate.

And that, upon the whole, the Committee came to these Resolutions; viz.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Sidney Worthy, Esquire, ought not to have the Privilege of this House, as to the Bill exhibited against him in Chancery by the Earl of Sandwich, to be relieved against the Verdict obtained at Common Law.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Sidney Worthy, Esquire,"ought not to have the Privilege of this House, as to the Bill exhibited against him by the Earl of Sandwich, to bring him to an Account for the personal Estate of the said Earl's late Father.

The First Resolution being read a Second time; an Amendment was proposed to be made therein, by adding, “ unless the said Earl shall insist upon, or resume, his Privilege.”

And the same Was, Upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, so amended, That Sidney Worthy, Esquire, ought not to have the Privilege of this House, as to the Bill exhibited againsbhim in Chancery by the Earl of Sandwich, to be relieved against the Verdict obtained at Common Law, unless the said Earl shall insist upon, or resume, his Privilege.

The Second Resolution being read a Second time; an Amendment was proposed to be made therein, by adding, w unless the said Earl shall insist upon, or resume, his Privilege.”

And the same was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, so amended, That Sidney Worthy, Esquire, ought not to have the Privilege of this House, as to the Bill exhibited against him by the Earl of Sandwich, to bring him to an Account for the personal Estate of the said Earl's late Father, unless the said Earl shall insist upon, or resume, his Privilege.

Mr. Bromley also reported, from the said Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of Colchester in the County of Essex, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are as follow; viz.

Upon the Petitions of John Potter, Esquire, and of several Freemen of the Borough of Colchester, complaining, that Sir Isaac Rebow and his Agents, by treating, and corrupt Practices, did procure several of the Electors to vote for him at the last Election; as also upon the Petition of several other free Burgesses of the said Borough, complaining of the like ill Practices by Sir Thomas Cook, and his Agents:

That the Committee began with the Two first.

And it was admitted, that Sir Isaac had the

Majority, on the Poll, of Mr. Potter; but insisted, that several Voters were procured by Treats, and corrupt Practices: And to prove this, the Petitioners Counsel called several Witnesses:

{Some of which said, that John Weely, Edward Johnson, Joseph Pierce, and Anthony Hill,were busy Men for Sir Isaac Rebow; and that they went from House to House, to ask Votes for him.

That Weely and Hill promised to hel p Cornelius Worren

' Yol. 14.

to a Loom's Work: That Joseph Piei'tc said, he Should carry Sir Isaac Rebow in the Chair; or, that B should have a Crown, if he did not: That, the Day before the Election, he was in Company with Sir Isaac Rehow, and others, and staid an Hour with them, and drank Wine, without paying for it: That, the Day of the Election, he. went to the Red Lion, being invited thither by Joseph Pierce; that he was drinking the re an Hour and Half, but was not then asked for his Vote. It was testified by several Witnesses, produced by the Petitioners (and nqt contradicted by Sir Isaac Rebows Witnesses) that the Red Lion was a Place of general Entertainment On the Day of Election, many going thither, and eating and drinking; only, that it was alleged by the latter, that those, who eat and drank there, paid for what they had, and were not treated by Sir Isaac Rebow, or his Agents: And therefore some were called, to testify, that they were at the Red Lion, and did not pay.

One Witness said, he laid down a d. at his Daniel Browne, first coming the re, though his Share in the Wm. \ Reckoning came to more. It appeared,

John Johnson.I SOme of these voted for Sir Thomas Cook, as

[_well as for Sir Isaac Rebow; and 1 Locegate acknowledged, that, on the Election Day, he was invited by Hill, who appeared for Sir Thomas Cook, to the Queens Head, and did not pay. William Johnson said, that, going out of the Red Lion, Joseph Pierce spoke to him, saying, he hoped, he would give his Vote for Sir Isaac; and then he went in, and drank again. The Two Johnsons received 5 s.a-piece, about Three Weeks before the Election (they think) by Sir Tho. Cook's Order, but said, this was what they looked upon as due to them ever since the preceding Election, they having carried him in the Chair, and received nothing before for it.

James Aldway, another Witness, said, that Joseph Pierce treated him at the Red Lion, and desired his Vote for Sir Isaac Rebow.

Jane Swan, a Maid Servant, that lived at the Red Lion, testified, that John Weely and Edmond Johnson promised to see her Mistress paid the Reckoning.

That the Counsel for Sir Isaac Rebow insisted, that every one paid their Share in the Reckoning at the Red Lion; and called Witnesses, who said,

That the Reckoning was chalked to every particular Company; and that they had only Ale, and Bread and Cheese; and every Man, as far as they observed, paid his own Share; and one of the Witnesses gathered 4 or 51, of the Reckoning.

John Sheldrake said, that he saw John Weely and Joseph Pierce give 205. to Four Men, Two Days before the Election, to vote for Sir Isaac Rebow.

Samuel Deacon said, he lived at Ipsicich; and Mr. ling, of Ipswich, sent for him, and desired him to go to Colchester, and vote for Sir Isaac Rebow, and carry what Friends he could with him, and not let them want Money; Meat, or Drink: And he said, one Samuel Crockett had 35. 6d and another 15. by Sir Isaac Rebozo's Order, being poor, and having nothing to entertain themselves: Which was owned by Crockett.

James Betts, another, said, that the Night Sir Tho. Cook came to Town, several were drinking at the King's Head; and Tho. Thompson offered to give 20 Crowns to 20 Men, that would vote for Sir Isaac Rebow.

Sir Isaac Rebow's Counsel called one Abraham Dutch,

to speak to the Reputation of James Betts; who affirmed, that Betts had said, speaking of his giving Evidence to the Committee, that he would swear right or wrong: But Dutch being asked particularly to this Matter, owned himself to have been present, when Thompson pulled Money out of his Pocket, and said, “ Here is 20 Crowns for 20 Men, to vote for Sir Isaac

Abraham Wyat spoke to the Reputation of John Sheldrake. '

And that, upon this Evidence, the Committee came to these Resolutions:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Agents of Sir Isaac have been guilty of

Treating, and other corrupt Practices, in order to procure the said Sir Isaac Rebow to be elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Colchester, in the County of Essex.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Sir IsaacRibcw is not duly elected a Burgess, to

serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Colchester.

That then the Committee proceeded to hear the Evidence upon the Petition against Sir Tho. Cook.

And first, to prove, who were Agents to Sir Thomas Cook, they called a Witness; who said,

f That Alderman Boyce, Bcrtj. Cock, with m/ «i»Xu jAothers> went out to meet Sir Thomas Cook, {when he came to Colchester:And another

said, that they both desired his Vote for Sir Thomas Cook.

He spoke also to several Sums of Money, due from Sir Thomas Cook, upon Account of the former Election;

which were promised a little before, though not paid till some Days alter, this Election.

That the Counsel insisted, that there had been Treating on Sir Thomas Cook's behalf; and called several Witnesses, to prove it.

WMlctm llau kins, one of them, said, Mr. Potter gave him a Shilling, to drink his Health; and put him in mind, to keep close to Sir Thomas Cook. That, the N ight before the Election, he gave Notice to several, to meet at Alderman Cox's, and other Houses; w here a great many, that

voted for Sir Thomas Cook and Mr. Potter, were entertained, and some, that voted for Sir Isaac. Rebow.

Thomas Smith, another, said, that Sir Tho. Cook's Friends were also entertained at Alderman and Widow

Cars, on the Election Day: And Samuel JVoodall said; further, that those, who drank there, did not pay; and that Broun declared, he had Order to give every one of Sir Thomas Cook's Friends a Flagon of Drink.

Abraham Byer, another, said, he was at the White Hart, and the Queen's Head, on the Election Day; and that several of Sir Tho. Cook's Voters were entertained in both Places.

George Wood, another Witness, said, profered

him a Loom's Work, to poll for Sir Tho. Cook; and Mr. Potter gave him 1 s. to poll for Sir Tho. Cook, and himself; which i«. was stopped afterwards out of his Wages, because he voted for Sir Tho. Cook and Sir Rebow.

Richard Howell,another, said, that, the Morning of the

Election, he believed, there were about 16 of Sir Thomas Cook's Friends at the Shoulder of Mutton; and one IT all advised him to give a single Vote for Sir Thomas Cook, and gave him a by Chain, and said, he would pay the Beckoning: Himself voted for Sir Isaac; but, he said, the rest voted, or promised to vote, for Sir Tho. Cook.

Ja. Morris, another, said, he came from Chelmsford to Colchester, to vote for Sir Thomas Cook and Mr. Potter, and had Half a Crown given him by Mr. Potter, for the Charges of his Journey.

Others, viz.John Hedgethorne, Andrew Musson, spoke

again to their receiving 5 s. a-piece, not long before this Election, for having carried Sir Tho. Cook in the Chair at the former Election.

And that, upon the whole Matter, the Committee came to these Resolutions:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Sir Thomas Cook is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Colchester, in the County of Essex.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That John Potter, Esquire, is not duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Colchester.

The said several Resolutions being severally read a Second t:m?, the same were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the Charge of Sir Isaac Rebow against Sir Thomas Cook, a Member of this House, for Bribery, is false, and groundless.

Ordered, That John Weely, Agent for Sir Isaac Rebow,

for his corrupt Practices, in endeavouring to procure the said Sir Isaac Rebow to be elected a Burgesj|.for the said Borough of Colchester, be taken into the Custody of the Serjeant at Arms attending this House.

Mr. Bromley also reported, from the said Committee of Privileges and Election-, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of in the County of Bucks, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are as follow;

Upon the Petition of Richard Esquire, com-

plaining of an undue Election and Return of Sir Roger Hill, to serve for the Borough of

That the Poll was agreed to stand thus:

For Sir Roger Hill, 89.

For Mr. Crawley, 76.

That the Right of Election was agreed to be in the Inhabitants, being Housekeepers, and not receiving Alins within a Year.

That the Petitioner's Counsel insisted, there was great Partiality in the Constable, Mr. Ginger; and that they should object to several, that voted lor Sir Roger Hill, either, because they were not Inhabitants and Housekeepers, or because their Votes were obtained by Corruption and indirect Practices.

That, in the first Place, they offered Evidence, to prove the Constable an Agent to Sir Roger Hilt, and partial; and to that they called several Witnesses;

George Ilumphryes, Phil. Hughes, James IJaijward, John Sly, Thomas Davy, Mr. Sheldon, Mr. Boheme, u no spoke to his ordering Drink to be drawn, to entertain Sir Roger Hill's Friends; to his taking an Account of what Drink was drawn on Sir Roger Hill's Account; to Ins putting a Man into a House, that promised to vote for Sir Roger Hill, and telling him, he should pay no Rent; to the appointing the Friends only of the Sitting Members to attend the Court; to his refusing any Scrutiny 01 Examination of the Poll; and to his declaring, he w ould return right or wrong.

That then the Petitioner's Counsel proceeded to their Exceptions to several, who voted for Sir Roger Hill.

And, as to Six of them, it appeared, they only came to Wendover, by Certificates from other Parislies.

And a Question arising betwixt the Counsel, whether they were such Inhabitants, as were entitled to vote; the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Persons, coming by Certificate to live in the Borough of Wendover, have not thereby a Right to vote for the Election of Members, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough.

Then another was objected to, as being an excommunicated Person.

Mr. Sheldon, another, said, That s Mother has

told him. She was the Housekeeper, and not her Son.

Mr. Boheme, John Aldridge, spoke to Henry Baling: That he was a melancholy Man, and scarce compos mentis; that his Vote was carried by others to the Place of Polling, he being at some Distance from it; and that he only named Mr. Hampden: Though a Witness for the Sitting Member said, he named Hill, short.

Mr. Bromley (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the Elections for the Borough of Wilton, in the County of Wilts, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; and which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition o iJohnGauntk Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of Sir John Hawks, Knight, and George Esquire, to

serve in Parliament for the Borough of Wilton, in the County of Wilts:

That the Right of Election was agreed to be in the Mayor and Burgesses.

That, upon the Poll, there were,

For Sir John Hawks, 37

For Mr. Bodington, 37

For Mr. Gauntkt, 24

That the Petitioner's Counsel argued, that the Mayor and Burgesses constituted the Corporation, and did all corporate Acts; and therefore, according4 to the Act of 130 Car. II. for the well governing and regulating of Corporations, they ought to have received the Sacrament, according to the Rites of the Church of England, within One Year before they are elected Burgesses. The Counsel said, they should, on this Head, object to several; viz. to 20, that had voted for Sir Hawks, and to 21, that had voted for Mr. Bodington; and that they had long since delivered a List of their Names to the Sitting Members. That, of these, 19 had been made Burgesses between the 1st of September 1701, and the 25th of June 1702; that John Lee and Joseph Ckevs were made Burgesses, in 1697, and John Carpenter before that Time. Some Witnesses were called to the Manner of making these Burgesses; viz.

Thomas Danet said, he was at the former Election of Parliament men, and that, as soon as it was over, the Mayor and Burgesses returned to the Council-house, where the Mayor spoke to this Effect: That Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr Gauntlet, had then carried the Election; but, before another Election, he would make so many new Burgesses, there should be no Occasion for the old to attend.

William More, another, testified, he had heard the Mayor say, that he would make none Burgesses, that were not Dissenters from the Dam's Teat; for if they chose Churchmen, they would be always against them.

That it also appeared, by the Testimony of the Witnesses, that, according to this Constitution of the Corporation, the Mayor summoned the Burgesses to do every Corporation Act; that they had all a Right to come to these Meetings; that 16 must be present, to make any Act valid; and that, at such Meetings, they let Leases, and made By-laws, for the better Government of the Corporation.

Vol. 14,

That it was likewise by them testified, that most of the Burgesses, so excepted to, were generally reputed Dissenters, and others of them were seen veiy rarely at Church; and therefore it was insisted, that they had not received the Sacrament, according to the 13th Car. II. a Year before they were chosen Burgesses; which made such their Election void.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Members argued, that the Office of a Burgess, in this Case, was an inferior Office, and the Act did not extend to it; however, if it did, and that they were only Burgesses de facto, all Acts by them done, while in Office, were valid.

That they also insisted, that there was no Evidence offered by the Petitioner, to prove, that the Burgesses, who voted for him, had qualified themselves according to the Act.

To which it was replied by the Petitioner's Counsel, that, if they had made this Objection before, and given the Petitioner any List of Names (as was done on the other Side) that they intended to except to on this Head, he would have taken care to have come prepared to justify his Electors, and to have proved them qualified.

And that the Committee came to these Resolutions:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That the Election of any Person, to be a Burgess of Wilton, in the County of Wilts, who has not taken the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites of the Church of England, within One Year before such Election, is a void Election.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, /

That Sir John Hawles, Knight, is duly elected a Burgess,

to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Wilton, in the County of Wilts.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That George Bodington, Esquire, is not duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Wilton.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That John Gauntktt, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Wilton.

The said Resolutions, being severally read a Second time, were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Ordered, That the Clerk of the Crown do attend this House upon Monday Morning next, to amend the Return for the Borough of Wilton, in the County of Wilts, by rasing out the Name of George Bodington, Esquire, and inserting John Gauntlet, Esquire, in the stead thereof.

Ordered, That the ingrossed Bill, for preventing occa- Occasional sional Conformity, be ifead the third time this Day, after the Conformity. Report from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, touching the Election for the Borough of East Retford.

Mr. Bromley (according to Order) reported, from the East Retford Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it Election, appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of East Retford, in the County of Nottingham, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; and which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition of Sir Willoughby Hickman, Baronet, and William Levinz, Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of John Thornhagh,

Esquire, and Thomas White, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of East Retford, in the County of Nottingham:

That, upon the Poll, the Numbers were thus:

For Mr. Thornhagh, 77

For Mr. White, 74

For Sir Willoughby Hickman, 39 For Mr. Levinz, 3 8

But the Petitioners Counsel insisted, that they should take off so many of the Sitting Members Votes, as would give the Petitioners a Majority.

That the Right of Election was agreed to be in the Bailiffs and Burgesses; but they did not agree, how they were qualified to be Burgesses.

The Answer of Richard Earl of Ranelagh, Paymaster general of her Majesty's Forces, 8$c. to the Narrative, and Objections, relating to his Accounts, con tained in a Paper, under the Hands and Seals of the Seven Commissioners of Accounts, and by them delivered to this honourable House on j

the 1 ith Day of this instant November, 1702.

THE said Paymaster, in the First Place, returns his humble Thanks to this House, for their having ordered him a Copy of the said Narrative, <§ c. and a Time to answer it.

In the next Place, he must say, that he cannot but think himself very unhappy, to fall under so severe Animad versions, as are contained in the said Narrative, after his having been 17 Years in his Office, without any material Objection made to his Management, either by the Six former Commissioners of Accounts, or by any other Person whatsoever.

In the 3d Place, he must observe to this honourable House, that his Office of Paymaster is altogether ministerial: That, though, by Virtue of it, he hath received vast Sums of the publick Revenue, no less than One-and-twenty Millions, and upwards, between the 1st of January, 1685, and this Day, yet he hath no Power to issue the same, but according to Establishments, Regulations of Subsistence, and Warrants signed by the Crown, or according the Directions of the Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of the Treasury: That he never receives any Money from the Exchequer, but by Orders of the Treasury; and most commonly, if not always, the Uses, to which the Sum, so ordered, is to be applied, are particularly set down and expressed in the same Order.

In the 4th Place, he must observe, that, during the said Seventeen Years of his Management, he hath had the Misfortune to bury Three Deputies, and all other the Officers, which he found in his Office, when he first entered upon it; by which means his Books are not in so good Order, as he heartily wishes they were; byt, whatsoever Trouble this creates to him, he will use his utmost Care, that the Publick shall not suffer by it.

Runelagh's

Accounts.

52 30 0 NovembrisA. 1702.

In the 5th Place, he must observe, that several Millions of the aforesaid Sum, received by him, were issued and paid out by his Deputies in Holland, Flanders,

and the West Indies:That this Variety of Payments, in so many Places, hath, as may easily be believed, begot some Confusion in his Vouchers; which, howsoever, he doth not doubt to set right, though with great Trouble.

What the said Paymaster hath next to observe, is, that the Paper, to which he is to answer, contains, First, A Narrative of Proceedings between the Seven Commissioners, and him: Secondly, Ten Observations of theirs upon his Accounts, passed, and declared: Thirdly, Some Animadversions, not numbered, on his Accounts, not yet passed.

As to the Narrative, the said Paymaster answers, that, pursuant to a Letter of theirs, dated the 15th of April last, desiring a true Copy of his Commission, he sent them his Two original Patents, under the great Seal of;

the one from the late King ;the other, from the late King William.

He owns, that he received a Precept from them, dated the 15th of May last, requiring him to exhibit to them, on Thursday, the 25th of June following, according to the Schemes therein prescribed, the Balance remaining in his Hands on the 5th of November, 1688, and Accounts of all his Receipts, and Paymfents, between that Time, and the 25th of December, 1701.

He saith, that, in pursuance of his Precept, he attended the said Commissioners on the Day appointed, and then delivered to them a Paper, intituled, A State of the Accounts of Richard Earl of Ra, Paymaster-general

of her Majesty's Forces, dSpc. from the 1st of January, 1685 (on which Day he first entered upon the Execution of that Office) to the last of March, 1692, inclusive, being Six Years and Three Months; as also a State of the Poundage, deducted by him within the same time: The said Paper telling them, that, by that State, they might see, at one View, the whole of his Receipts, and Payments, within that Time; which could not be clear to them by any State, beginning from the 5th of November, 1688, as they desired; since the Balances of his Accounts, preceding that Period, would not appear. He likewise told them, that his Accounts, for the said Six Years and Three Months, were, in Number, Seven, and were all actually passed, and declared; and that he had a upon

each of them: And he then delivered to them true Copies of the said Seven Accounts; as also an Abstract of his Account, lying before Mr. Auditor Bridges, from the 1st of April, 1692 (being the next Day after his last Account declared, ended, as aforesaid) to the last of September,

1695, inclusive; and an Abstract of his Account, lying before Mr. Auditor Done, from the 1st of October, 1695, to the 25th of March, 1699, inclusive; each of the said Two Accounts being for Three Years and an Half, in all, Seven Years; his Receipts, and Payments, for that Time, being' divided into the said Two Accounts, by Order of

the then Lords' Commissioners of the Treusury, that so

both the Auditors might proceed to examine, and state the said Two Accounts, at one and the same Time, for the more speedy Dispatch of them. He also then told them, that lie was making ready Three further Accounts, which should contain all his Receipts, and Payments, from the said 25th of March, 1699, to the 25th of December,

J 701, being Two Years and Three Quarters: So that, by these Twelve Accounts, viz. the said Seven declared Accounts, the said Two Accounts, lying before the Two Auditors, and the said Three Accounts, preparing, they might see all his Receipts, and Payments, from the 1st of January, 168.5, to the 25th of December, 1701, being 16 Years; he desiring nothing more, than to lay all his publick Transactions plainly before them: And at the same Time he delivered to them a current Account of his Receipts, and Payments, from the said 25th of December, 1701, to the 24th of June, 1702; he being required so to do by Two Precepts of theirs: And, on the 29th of June last, he sent them, as they desired, the original Parchment Duplicates of his said Seven declared

Accounts; which the said Commissioners, however, are pleased to call general Abstracts of Accounts, with gross Items of his Payments.

On the 26th of September last he sent to them the Three Accounts, which, he told them on the 25th of June, he was making ready; which contained his Receipts, and Payments, from the said 25th of March 1699, to the 25th of December, 1701; and which he could not possibly make ready sooner, by reason of the Multiplicity of his other publick Business; particularly, by his being obliged, by Act of Parliament, to make out all the Debentures, payable out of the forfeited Lands in by the 30th of September last; which was a very tedious, troublesome, and voluminous, Work: And, on the said 26th of September last he likewise sent them a current Account of his Receipts, and Payments, from the 24th of June last, to the 1st of September last: So that he can safely say, he made as much Haste, as possibly he could, to comply with their several Precepts; and he did then think, that, having thus laid all his Accounts before them, they would have applied themselves to examine, and state such of his Accounts, as were not passed, and declared; which were Five in Number, and contained, as aforesaid, all his Receipts, and Payments, from the 1st of April, 1692, to the 25th of December last, being Nine Years and Three Quarters; his Receipts, for that Time, amounting [to] 14,798,215/. os. 5 But the said Paymaster soon found, that the Commissioners, instead of proceeding upon his said Five Accounts, not yet passed, were resolved to lay open and unravel Four of his Seven Accounts, passed, and declared, and upon each of which he had a Quietus est; the said Four Accounts beginning from the 1st of January, 1687, and ending the last of March, 1692; for, on the 27th of June last, being but Two Days after he had delivered them so many of his Accounts, as aforesaid, they sent him a Precept, to make up regimental Accounts, for die Time of the said Four Accounts, in the same Manner, as he was required to do by Act of Parliament, and had done from the 1st of April 1602, to the 25th of March 1699; and the next Day, when, by Summons, he waited on them in their Office, they insisted upon this Direction: To which the Paymaster answered, that the Act, which required regimental Accounts for the Time aforesaid, did not look back beyond the 1st of April, 1692: That the Reason of its requiring such Accounts for that Time, was, because the Army had not been cleared between the said 1st of April, 1692, and the said 25th of March, 1699; which Reason could have no Operation in what they now directed, since the Army was cleared to the last of March, 1692: That, when he passed the said Four Accounts before the Auditors, he had delivered up all his Vouchers, relating to them; which made it almost impracticable for him to comply with their Directions: That, though his Books might, in some measure, guide his Compliance, yet, he could not, in Justice to himself, and Family, consent to lay open his Accounts, upon which he had his Quietus est. He likewise told them then, or soon after, that he did not think (with great Submission to them) that they had any Authority to unravel passed and declared Accounts; and thatuone of the Six former Commissioners of Accounts had ever pretended to do it

Upon this they required him to send them the original Leidgers of his Office, from the 1st of January, 1687, to the last of March 1692; that so they might extract and frame out of them such regimental Accounts, as they desired. To this he answered, That he had no distinct Leidgers for that particular Time: That Leidgers were no publick Books, but only Helps to an Accomptant, to settle Accounts with his Cashier: That they could neither charge, nor discharge, an Accomptant, before an Auditor; and therefore they were never offered/or accepted, as Vouchers: And after many other Arguments, of this Kind, he told them, that, since it was plain, they required them, in order to ravel into, and lay open, his said Four Accounts, passed, declared, and

upon

53

upon each of which he had a Quietus est, he could not part with them; neither did he think (with great Submission) they had any Authority to require them,. none of the Six former Commissions of Accounts having ever demanded them.

On July the 2d they sent one of their Number to his Office, with a Precept, directing the Paymaster, and his Deputy and Deputies, his Clerk or Clerks, belonging to his said Office, to per mit and assist the said Commissioner, and Mr. Cartwright,their Army Accomptant, to inspect

the Leidgers and Journals of the Office, which contained the Receipts, and Payments, from the said istof January, 1687, to the last of March, 1692: To which Precept he returned an Answer, which the said Commissioners writ down; the Substance of which was, That he hoped, they would not take it ill, if he did advise with Counsel, whether any of his Accounts, passed . by the Auditors, could be laid open by their Authority, especially, since the said Accounts, before declared, had been laid before former Commissioners of Accounts. Nol withstanding this Answer, they sent another Precept to him, dated the very next day, requiring the said Books to be laid before them the next Morning; and by a Letter, dated the Day following, being a Saturday, he was summoned to attend them in their Office on Monday Morning; where and when they repeated their Earnestness to have the said Leidgers, and he still insisted to have Time to advise with his Counsel: lrpon which they told him, that, from that Day, they intended to make a Recess for Three Weeks, or a Month; that they hoped, he would advise with his Counsel in the mean time; and that, if he was advised to deliver the said Leidgers, their Secretary, Mr. King, would be in the Way, to receive them, and to give a Receipt for them. To this he answered, he would lose no Time in taking Advice, nor in delivering his Books, if advised thereto. Accordingly, the Wednesday following, he endeavoured to meet w ith

Two Gentlemen, who have always been his Counsel, but found, they were both gone out of Tow n, to attend their Elections; where they staid till the Beginning of August; on the 4th of which Month the Commissioners, being likewise returned, sent him a Precept, requiring him, on Saturday following, to exhibit his said original Leidgers to them, or his Reasons, in writing, why he refused them; which Order they repeated in their Letter of the 10th of that Month. On the 19th of that Month he sent them a Letter, which told them, that the Reason, they had not sooner heard from him, was, his Counsel's being out of Town: That, though, upon their Return, they had both agreed in Opinion, that the present Commission of Accounts gave no Authority to lay open any Account, passed, and declared, which had been before the former Commissions of Accounts, nor to demand the Leidgers of any Accomptant (they being not publick Books) yet, to shew his Readiness to give them any Satisfaction he could, he had sent them his '1 wo original Leidgers, from the 1st of January, 1685, to the last of March, 1092; and, that he should have sent them sooner, had he not thought it reasonable to take such Abstracts of them, as might inform him, what they contained, should any Misfortune happen to them: Which Word “ Misfortune,” he solemnly avers, was not used by him, out of any Jealousy of the honourable Commissioners, but for the sake of their Army Accomptant, who hath most maliciously and scandalously behaved himself towards the said Paymaster for some Years past.

The foregoing Particulars, though many, the said Paymaster thinks necessary to lay before this honourable House, that they may be thereby truly informed, from whence the Disputes and Differences have arisen l>etween the Commissioners, and him. As to his Part, he humbly leaves it to your Judgment (to which he will always readily submit) whether he was in the right, to insist, that they have no Authority, by their Commission, to lay open any Account, passed, and declared, and which hath heretofore been examined by any of the Six former Commissions of Accounts: But, that it may not be thought, he starts this Question, in order to shelter himself against

As to the Charge of his Four declared Accounts which begin from the 1st of Januar, 1687, and end the last of March, 1692, the Commissioners make it

consist of the following Particulars:

What his Lordship voluntarily) charges y

To this the said Paymaster answers, That he makes no Objection to the First of the said Four Sums, being 3,985/. 13s. 8 id.nor to the Third of the said Sums, being 64,359/. 6s. 3d. but to the Second, being 3,838,540/. 18 . oJ</. he objects; and saith, that this Sum, by the Auditors Charge, is but 3,791,080/. os. 8 which is short of the Commissioners said Sum of 47,460 L i~s.4</. The Reason of which Difference is, because the said 47,460 /. 17 s.4 d.though received from the Exchequer in January, 1687, yet it was issued to him, to clear the Establishment to the last of December, 1687,

and he is charged with it in his Account then ending; and consequently, he ought not to be charged with it in his Account from that Day: And the right honourable the Lord Haiti fax, when he delivered to the Commission- ers his Account of the Paymaster's Receipts, between the 1st of January, 1687, and the last of March, 1692, told them, that this was the Truth of the Fact; and, for a further Confirmation of it, the Total of the Paymaster's Charge from the Exchequer, between the 1st of January, 1685, and the said last of March, 1692, agrees, to a Farthing with the Total, charged by the Auditors for that Time which is all taken into his Seven declared Accounts.

To the 4U1 Sum he likewise objects, being 4,344/. 8s> 3 d. alleged to be received by him for Interest on Tallies, more than he hath accounted for; because he is positive, he never received that Sum, nor any Part of it; but the said Sum was received by the several Persons, to whom these Tallies were assigned by him; who had a Right to receive them, with all the Interest due from the Date of them. He further saith (as the Commissioners have very faithfully reported) that his constant Course hath been, as it ala ays w as in the Pay-offices of the Army and Navy, to write his Name only upon the Back of the Orders, without any formal Assignment; and that, upon Examination, it appears, that, when the Money, due on such Orders, hath been received at the Exchequer, Acquittances have been written over the Paymaster's Name, as if he had received both Principal and Interest. This he hath discovered in several Orders, which, in Part, make up the said,344/. 8$. 3 d.and he is in pursuit of the rest. In the mean time he humbly conceives, he ought not to be charged with that Sum, in regard that, bva Clause in an Act, for making good Deficiencies, passed in the last Parliament, the Account of Interest, received by Paymasters (if any) is to be brought into their final Accounts.

And this is all the said Paymaster hath to offer, in Answer to that Part of the Commissioners Narrative, which relates to the Charge of his Four declared Accounts, from the 1st of January, 1687, to the last of March, 1692.

As to the Discharge of his said Four Accounts, their Observations, and his Answers to them, are here set down in Order, as follows:

First, That all the Regiments, Troops, and Companies, which were in the Service of the late King James, and which, it is notorious, had many popish Officers and Soldiers in them, and were broke, and dispersed, upon the Earl of Fever sham's disbanding the Army on the 13th of December, 16.S8, are, by Warrants upon his Lordship's Certificates of Debentures, paid compleat to several Days in January, February, March, and April, following.

To this Observation the said Paymaster answers, and O agrees,

Cti! of Ita-nelagh's Accounts

Jo° Novembris. A. 170

54

agrees, That thereWere several popish Officers and Soldiers, in the Regiments, Troops, and Companies, which were in the Service of the late King James: He likewise agrees, that several of the said Regiments were dismissed by the Earl of Feversham on the 13th of December, 1688: Rut he said), that the late King, the then Prince of Orange, did the very next Day issue a Declaration, setting forth, that, he being informed, that divers Regiments, Troops, and Companies, had been encouraged to disperse themselves in an unusual and unwarrantable Manner, whereby the publick Peace was very much disturbed, he had thought fit thereby to require all Colonels, and Commanders in Chief, of Regiments, <§x\ to call together the several Officers, and Soldiers, belonging to their respective Regiments, in such Places, as they should find most convenient for their Rendezvous, and there to keep them in good Order and Discipline.

That, in pursuance of this Declaration, most (if not all) of the said Regiments, so dismissed, did re-unite, and were kept in good Order and Discipline; and when his late Majesty did think fit, soon after, to disband several of the late King James's Forces, none of the said disbanded Regiments, Troops, and Companies, were paid compleat, but a Deduction was made, for what was due to their popish Officers, according to the Method prescribed by his said late Majesty; and the same care was taken, in paying the Remainder of the late King James's Forces, which his late Majesty thought fit to continue in his Service; none of which were paid compleat (as this Observation alleges) there being a Deduction made also, for what [was] due to their popish Officers, as by a List of their said Deductions will appear: And all the Certificates of Debentures, made by the said Paymaster, for the Payment of the said Forces, contrary to the usual Method (of which this Observation seems to complain) were so made pursuant to several Warrants under his late Majesty's Hand, positively directing them to be so; as by Copies of the said Warrants will fully appear, the Originals thereof being in the Hands of the said Commissioners. Secondly, That the Warrants, for several such Payments, bear Date, some a Year, others Two Years, after the said Regiments, Troops, and Companies, were disbanded.

To this the said Paymaster answers, That the private Soldiers of a Regiment always receive, by way of Subsistence, their full Pay, except what reserved for their Clothing; and the Clothing, and Subsistence, of the non-commissioned Officers, leaves but a small Matter due to them; which, if paid, as generally it is, before, or upon, their disbanding, there remains only a Debt due to the commissioned Officers; for the Payment of which, Warrants are seldom, or never, prepared, till there is Money ready to pay them; which many times there is not, till a Year or Two after the disbanding: Witness the Regiments, disbanded upon the Peace at Reswick; where only the Subsistence was cleared to the common Soldiers, and a Bounty-money given them; and the non-commissioned Officers being cleared, and a Bounty-money given them also (which a small Sum effected) the commissioned Officers were left unpaid; and so they are to this Hour, there being no Warrants to clear them, although it is full Five Years, since they were disbanded.

Thirdly, That there are several Warrants, for paying compleat Numbers allowed on the Establishment, notwithstanding any Defect in, or Want of, Muster-rolls. To this Observation the said Paymaster answers, That Warrants, for paying the Forces, are never prepared by the Paymaster, that being the Work of the Secretary at War; and, if Warrants are signed, directing the Paymaster to pay compleat, according to the Establishment, notwithstanding Defects in, or Want of, Muster-rolls, it is his Duty to obey such W arrants, and to pay accordingly.

Fourthly, That there is a Warrant, dated the 1 "th of October, 1680, to the Auditors of the Imprests, to allow his Lordship the Sum of 172,340/. which he had Direction from his late Majesty to pay to several Persons, without Deduction. The Auditors are not to charge the Persons aforesaid with these Sums, or any 12

Part thereof; his Majesty reserving the Examination of the Particulars to himself, or to such, as he shall appoint for that Purpose.

This Observation seejns to complain of the Warrant, mentioned therein, and not of the Paymaster; who certainly paid all the Sums, contained in the said Warrant, upon proper Directions, and delivered to the auditor authentick Vouchers for the same: And though he need say no more, to justify himself, yet, for the Vindication of the Warrant, he begs Leave to set down here the particular Sums, mentioned therein, which, together, make up the said 172,340/. and the Nature thereof. The Sums are, as follow:

To my Lord Portland, by the Name of William -tinck, 1,000l.

This Sum was paid to his Lordship on the 22d of February, 1688, for the Use of his Majesty's privy Purser by Direction, in Writing from the then Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

To George Lord Dartmouth, 700 /.

This Sum was paid to his Lordship on the said 22d of February, 1688, and by the like Direction, for transporting the late King James's Horses, who had desired they might be sent after him; which his late Majesty readily agreed to.

To Henry Powle Esquire, Speaker, 1,140/.

One thousand Pounds of this Sum was paid on the 26th of January, 1688, for his Equipage-money, as Speaker of the then Convention; and the remaining 140/. was paid him for his Allowance, as such, for 28 Days, at the usual Rate of 5 /. a Day; the whole being paid by Direction, in Writing, of the Treasury.

To Peter Isaac, 6,000 /.

This Peter Isaac was Steward to his late Majesty's House, when Prince of Orange; and this Sura was paid him, for that Use, by Three several Payments, in the Month of January, 1688; all by Direction, in Writing from the then Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

To Mrs. Anne Van Golstein, 1,000 /.

This Gentlew oman was one of the late Queen's Dressers; and this Sum was paid her on the 22d of February,

1688, for her said Majesty's Service, by an Order of his late Majesty in the Treasury Chamber.

To Jacob Vander Esch, Esquire, 162,500l.

This Gentleman, as every body knows, was Paymaster to his late Majesty's Dutch Forces, from the Time they first landed in England; and the aforesaid Sum was paid to him by the English Paymaster, for their Use, at several Times, between the 31st of December, 1688, and the 12th of April following, by Directions, in Writing, from the Treasury.

So that the Sums, mentioned in this Warrant, are Six in Number. The Five first (which make together 9,840/.) may seem improper to be paid out of the Pay-office; but the Reason, they were so, was, because there was no Privy Seal in being, but that of the Paymaster's of the Army, when these Payments were directed; and no body can think, that any of these Five Sums were proper to be accounted for but to his late Majesty, or such, as he should . appoint for that Purpose: And as to the 6th Sum, being the great Sum, paid to Vander Esch, it is well known, that his late Majesty would not, for many Years after his Accession to the Crown, suffer his Dutch Forces either to be mustered, or paid, but according to their own Method; and therefore, not only in this Warrant, but in several subsequent Warrants, relating to the Payment of his said Dutch Forces, his said Majesty always reserved the said Vander Esch's Accounts to his own Examination.

Fifthly, That his Lordship discharges himself of several Sums, paid for levying the Lord Mordant's (now Earl of Peterborough) and Sir Guise' Regiments, although your Commissioners find, one of the Articles in the Account, laid before this House, of the Charge, the States General had been at in the Resolution, and upon which you paid them 600,000 /. is for raising the Regiments of the Lord Mordant, Sir Robert Peyton, Sir John Guise, and others. And here your Commissioners must observe, that the Earl of

Regiment

V

i Ann. 36 0 Novembris$$

Regiment is paid from the 5th of November, 1688, the Earl of Monmouth's from the loth, and that of Colonel Lutt roll's from the 23d of the said Month, though his late Majesty landed in England on the 5th of November, Five Days before the 2d, and Nineteen before the last. Besides, as to the Payment of 1,582/. 2.?. to the Earl of your

Commissioners find the Vouchers signed, and, they believe, writ, by the said Earl himself; in which it is expressed, that Part of this Sum was received from Mr. Rozv, Part from the Dutch Paymaster, and the rest from the Earl of Ranelagh: Now his Lordship has surcharged himself with what was paid by Mr. Row, but not, as lie ought to have done, with what was paid by the Dutch Paymaster. To this Observation the said Paymaster answers. That be has lately seen an Account, laid before the House of Commons on the 14th of March, 1688, of the Charge, the States General had been at in his late Majesty's Expedition lor England, for which that House paid them 600,000l. in which Account there was this following Article:

“ Several Charges to those, that followed his Majesty,

* and to the Forces, that came over, and also to the raising the Regiments of the right honourable the Lord “ Mor daunt, Sir Robert Peyton, Sir John Guise, and “ others, Two hundred and Fifty thousand Guilders.”

But the Paymaster never yet heard, nor indeed was it any ways material for him to esquire, what Part of that Sum was paid to the Three Colonels, mentioned in that Article, for raising their Regiments. Sure he is, that what he charges, a3 paid for Levy Money to the said Three Colonels, was a very inconsiderable Sum, and not sufficient, according to the lowest Allowance, to raise Three Companies; for what he charges in his Sixteen Months Account, ending the lust of April, 1689, to which this Observation refers, is in all but 300l. viz. 100l. to my Lord Monmouth, 100l. to Sir John Guise, and 100l. to Colonel Francis Luttr ell; and his late Majesty's Warrant, which directs the Allowance of these Three Sums, saith, that he was graciously pleased to allow the said Three Colonels the said 100l. each, as Levy Money, for completing their respective Regiments: So that nothing is charged by the Paymaster, for raising the said Three Regiments. And as to that Part of this Observation, which saith, that my Lord Levins Regiment is paid from the 5th of November, 16F8, the Earl of Monmouth's from the 10th, and that of Colonel Luttrell's from the 23d, of the said Month; the Paymaster answers, that he was positively directed, by Warrant under his late Majesty's Hand, to compute the s (id Three Regiments from these respective Days, as by the said Warrants will appear. And as to the Objection, which Closes this 5th Observation,

That the Paymaster ought to have surcharged himself with what the D itch Paymaster paid my Lord Monmouth, in Part of the i,;582/. 2 s.as well as he hath surcharged himself with whatt paid by Mr. in part of that Sum; the Paymaster an swers, that he cannot imagine, how the Dutch Paymaster's Name came to be mentioned in the said Earl's Acquit tance; nor can the said Farl (who has been spoke to in t his Matter) recollect, how he came to mention him therei n: Besides, it appears by a Certificate, hereunto annexed, 1 mder the Hand of Mr. Sohinus, who was Deputy to the Dutch Paymaster from the 5th of November, 1688, tl at the said Paymaster never paid my Lord Monmouth an y Money whatsoever, for his Regiment, between the sa id 10th of November, 1688, and tire last of April, 1689.

Sixthly, That, wb ereas his Lordship discharges himself of several S urns, paid by Warrant to Captain Mathew Smith.t Japtain Anthony Power, and Captain Henry Davis, & id hath passed his Account for the same, by Vouch rs under their Hands, the said Captains Smith and 1 )avis have made positive Oaths, that

their Hands are forged; and your Commissioners have some Reasc n to suspect, that Captain Parer's Hand is so too; and, as an undeniable Evidence of this Fact, in what concerns Captain Smith, it appears to your Commissioners, that, after his Lordship had Vot. l i.

made use of the Voucher, in order to stop a Com- Earl of ( plaint, which was coming into this House, he made up J Captain Smith's Accounti, and paid him the Balance. '

To this Observation the Paymaster answers, That there was a Warrant, signed by his late Majesty, dated the 28th of February, 1688, directing him to pay to the aforesaid Three Captains, for the Pay of themselves, and the Three independent Companies milder their Command, from the several Days in October, November, and December,

1688, on which they were first mustered, to the Time of their disbanding (which was on or about the 7th of January, 1688) the Sums following t vis.

s. d.

To Captain Math. Smith - - 237 13 2 To Captain Anth. Power - - 221 15 8

To Captain Henry Davis - - 253 7 4

In all - £.712 16 2

That the said Sum of 712 /. i-6 r. 2 is charged, as paid to the said Three Captains, according to their respective Proportions aforesaid, in his Account for Sixteen Months; which ended the last of April, 1689: That the said Sum, so charged, was vouched by the original Warrant of his late Majesty, upon the Back of which the said Three Captains Names were endorsed: That his said Sixteen Months Account has been passed, and declared, many Years since, and none of the said Three Captains ever complained, or pretended to say, that their Names, endorsed upon the said Warrant, were not their own Hand-writing, till those, who had been employed by the Paymaster in the Management of the Business of his Office, in the Years 1688, 1689, and 1690, Were all dead, but who, when living, were known to be Men of undoubted Integrity; and therefore it cannot be presumed, either in Justice, of Reagon, that such Alen, through whose Hands this War rant passed to the Auditor, could be guilty of counter- feiting Names upon the Back of it. Besides, it is to be observed, that Captain Anth. Power, one of the said Three Captains, never made any Complaint, that his Name was counterfeited, or that there was any one Farthing unpaid of the 221/. 15 . 8 d.charged to his Account} and that, when Captain Mathezv Smith, another of the said Three Captains, did pretend, in the Year 1695, that his Name was counterfeited, and that he had not received the full of the said 237/. 135. 2 charged to his Account, he then claimed but 50/. 5 11 as unpaid of

that Sum; which 50/. 5 . 1 id. the said Paymaster's Deputy, Mr. Mordecai Abbot (being tired with his clamo rous Importunity) paid him out of the said Paymaster's private Money; telling him, when he did so, that he thought, it was-better for his Service, to give that Sum, than to have his Name brought into the House of Com- mons, with a Complaint from so scandalous a Man, as Captain Smith; who, upon receiving that Sum from the said Mr. Abbot, gave this following Acquittance, ready to be produced:

“ Received from the right honourable Richard Earl of “ Ranelagh the Sum of 50 /. 5 s. 11 d.being the Balance

“ of a Warrant, for my independent Company's Pay?

“dated the 28th of February, 1688; his Lordship “ having formerly paid it in his own wrong, without “ my Acquittance, or my Agent's, but upon an Acquittance, to which my Name was set, but was not “ my Hand-writing; whereby both his Lordship, and “ I, have been abused. Witness my Hand this 25th “ of March, 1695. M. Smythe."

This is the Truth, as to Captain Smith; who certainly confirms the ill Chafacter he has in the World, by his complaining of, and swearing against, the Pay-office, after he had been so well used there. As to Captain Henry Davis, the Third of the said Three Captains, and one of the Two late Swearers, his Case is as follows: He, being made a Captain of an independent Company in October,

1688, did, by a Letter of Attorney, in the usual Form, dated the 17th of that Alonth, c0nstitule.one Mr. Roderick Mackenzie his Agent; which Letter of‘ Attorney is entered at large in a Book of the Pay-office; and when the said Captain did, about Two Years since, pretend, that his

Name,

Earl of

Ranelagh'g

Accounts.

5<S 3 o° Novembris. 1702.

Name, on the Back of the said Warrant, was counterfeited, and that some Part of the said 253 /. 7 4 directed for

him by the said Warrant, was still unpaid, and due to him, he was shewn the Entry of his said Letter of Attorney, and the original Receipt, signed by his said Agent, Mr. Roderick Mackenzie, for the said full Sum of 253/. 75. 4 d.and at that Time there was a Gentleman present, who had been his Lieutenant, who very well knew the said Mr. Mackenzie, was acquainted with his Hand, and declared, before the said Captain Davis, and several others in the Office, that he verily believed, the Body of the Acquittance, and Name, w ere Mr. Mackenzie's own Writing; to all which the said Captain then made no Objection. This being the Matter of Fact, which your Commissioners might have known, had they been pleased to have heard the Paymaster upon this Observation, before they made it, he must now humbly desire this House to consider, of what fatal Consequence it may be to the Publick, if Men be allowed to swear themselves into a Claim of Money, by denying their Hands to Vouchers, delivered by an Accomptant to his Auditor 12 or 13 Years ago, and for which he has a legal Discharge; and how improbable, or rather incredible, it is, that an Office, which, during the said Paymaster's Management, has received, and paid, more than One-and-twenty Millions, without any Reflections upon it, should be guilty of the Forgery, pretended, for so inconsiderable a Sum as 50/. 5#. 11 d.To which he has this only further to add, that it is neither just, nor reasonable, to asperse any principal Officer for Miscarriages, supposed to be committed (nor indeed, though actually committed) by any of his inferior Officers; since it cannot be presumed, that any principal Officer can be always inspecting their Proceedings, nor can any Paymaster pretend to judge of the Variety of Hands, which go through his Office.

Seventhly, That some of his Lordship's Vouchers, for Payments, are only loose Papers, put into Warrants, with a Name, and nothing more, writ on them.

To this Observation the Paymaster answers, That such, as are acquainted with Business of this Nature, know it to be no unusual Thing; and the only signing the Back of a Warrant, or writing a Name on a loose Paper, to put into a Warrant, by a Person, who is impowered to receive the Money, has always been esteemed a good Voucher, and allow ed as such.

Eighthly, That the Payments differ very much, in many Particulars, from the Establishment: That there are Rasures in some Warrants, and very extraordinary Payments directed in others; of which your Commissioners w ill give you the Instances, when you please to require them.

To this Observation the Paymaster answers, That, no doubt, in some Cases, he has made Payments, which differ very much from the Establishment; which ought not to be reckoned as a Fault in him, when it is visible, that the said Difference is occasioned by Warrants: For, though he is obliged strictly to pursue the Establishment, where no Warrant interposes; yet where Warrants direct him otherwise, he is obliged to obey the Warrant; since, [as] one Establishment supersedes another in the whole, so a Warrant, signed by the same Authority, supersedes any Establishment in Part, and hath ever been accounted, for what it contains, as authentick as the Establishment itself: And, where there are Warrants, which direct very extraordinary Payments, the Paymaster is not to be blamed; since he has nothing to do, either with preparing, or procuring, those Warrants. And as to the Rasures, which, this Observation says, are in some Warrants; the Paymaster knows nothing of it; and he dares aver, that, if any such be, they were made, before they came to his Office; and do not, in any material Matter, alter the Intention of the Warrant; for then he should have taken notice of them so far, as not to make any Payment upon them.

Ninthly, That his Lordship charges himself, for Interest received, 916/. due intermediately upon Tallies, transferred over to Sir Joseph Heme: Your Commis-

sioners find a Warrant, signed by the late King, for allow ing the Earl of Ranethis Sum, as paid to George Clark Esquire, for secret Service, together with another Sum, paid to Rudolph of 2,000l. without Account; and also a Privy Seal, dated the 18th of June last, for the Auditor to allow his Lordship the same, upon his Account: And, upon further Enquiries, it appears to your Commissioners, that the said Sum of 916/. (the only Interest his Lordship brings to Account) was never paid, as is pretended, to George Clark Esquire, but his Name was only used in Trust for his Lordship, who had the same to his own proper Use.

To this Observation the Paymaster answers, That lie freely owns, whatsoever is said in it, relating to the 916/. particularly, that the said Sum was granted by his late Majesty to George Clark Esquire, in Trust for him: He further saith, that the Warrant, granting this Sum, was dated the 4th Day of March, 1692, and countersigned by the then Lords of the Treasury: That his Petition, desiring it, was publickly read in the Treasury Chamber; and the Consideration, upon which he desired it, was the great Loss he had suffered by the late War in Ireland; having had his Two Castles of Athlone and Roscommon utterly-destroyed, his Mansion-house in Dublin pulled down, and upwards of 12,000l. of his Rents in that Kingdom entirely lost. And as to the 2,000l. mentioned in this Observation, as paid to Mr. Rudolph Kein, without Account; he saith, It was for his late Majesty's own private Use; that he, the said Paymaster, never saw one Shilling of it; and that the Warrant, which allowed him the Payment of this Sum in his Account, was dated the 8th of February, 1692, and countersigned by the then Lords of the Treasury, who well knew, that his said late Majesty had then a pressing Occasion for that Sum.

Tenthly, That, whereas his Lordship discharges himself by Payments to Colonel and to

Lieutenant-colonel St. John, each 2,000l. your Commissioners are not very well satisfied with his Lordship's Vouchers for the same, and are making further Enquiry into that Matter; but, in the mean time, they think themselves obliged to acquaint you,

that Colonel Cunningham has made Oath, that he repaid to the said Earl of Ranelagh 1,500l. or thereabouts, in Part of the 2,000 /. which had been imprested to him; and this, your Commissioners conceive, his Lordship ought to have surcharged himself with.

To this Observation the Paymaster answet s, That, pursuant to Two Warrants, signed by his [latej Majesty, and countersigned by the then Lords of the Treasury, the one, dated the 14th of March, 1688, and the oth er, the 10th of April, 1689, he paid to Colonel John Cunningham, and Lieutenant-colonel Thomas St. John, 2,000 /. each without Account, he being directed by the said W/arraut so to do; that their Receipts for those Sums are e ndorsed ©n the Back of the said W arrants, and are passef 1, and allowed to him, in his 16 Months Account, ending the last of April, 1689, which has been passed, and declared, many Years since; and therefore he cannot well understand, what the Commissioners mean, by saying, they are not very well satisfied with his Vouchers, and that they are making further Enquiry into that Matter: An</| as to their saying, that Colonel Cunningham has made O ath, that he repaid the said Paymaster 1,500 /. or there abouts, in Part of the said 2,000 /. the Paymaster answers, That, though, in the paying out more than One-and- twenty Millions of Money, he has paid many and great Sums to several Persons, without Account, yet he never knew any one of those, who received it so, return any one Farthing of it again: And he further says, That Ciolonel Cutminghams Oath (w ho has been for many Years lin great Distress and Want, and is still a Prisoner for Debll) is not to be regarded; for certainly, if he had repaid tine Sum pretended, he would have produced the said Pay! master's Acquittance for that Sum; it being altogether irj credible, that such a Sum, as 1,500l. or thereabouts.shouj Id be paid by any one Man living to another, without a U/eceipt for it.

And now the Paymaster, having thus humbly offered, to this honourable House, his Answers to the Ten Observations of the Commissioners of Accounts, must beg Leave to observe to you, That all the said Ten Observations relate to Four of his Seven Accounts, which are passed, and declared, and upon each of which he has a Quietus est; and therefore, with great Submission, he is humbly of Opinion, that the said Commissioners had no Authority to unravel them, for the Reasons, which he shall humbly ofter to your Consideration and Judgment at the End of this Paper: In the mean time he will apply himself to answer that Part of the Commissioners Narrative, which, though not numbered, follows the said Ten Observations.

The First Paragraph is, That to their said Observations they have only this further to add, That the Earl of Ranelagh makes a Balance, due to himself, of

185,268/. 14#. o d.

To this short Paragraph, which seems to imply, as if the Paymaster was rich enough to credit the Government with so great a Sum, the Paymaster answers, That, at the Foot of his Inst declared Account, which ended the 31st of March, 1692, there is written, “And then the “ said Accomptant will be in Surplusage 185,268/. 145.” which, in the Language of an Auditor, is saying, that the Payments, in that Account declared, do exceed the Sum, received within the Time of that Account, so much; and it is the Auditor, who always makes the Balance, and not the Accomptant: And, when the Payments, in any declared Account, do exceed the Receipts, it is well known, that those Payments have been made with publick Money, received after the Period of Time, which ends the said declared Account; and no Accomptant is one Penny the richer, for being in Surplusage, nor one Earthing the poorer, for having a Balance due from him, except it be his last and final Account; for, in the first Case, he tnakes his Surplusage Part of his Discharge in his next succeeding Account; and, in the other Case, he makes the Balance, due from him, Part of his Charge: And, for Proof of this, the Paymaster needs only to observe, that, though that great Sum of 185,268/. 14J. was his Surplusage on the last of March, 1692; yet, in his next succeeding Account, which k now under the Examination of Mr. Auditor Bridges, he is Debtor, as far as yet appears, somewhat above 20,000l. And to this he must add (though with Grief lie says it) that he Was never yet in a Condition to lend Money, his Folly having always led him to spend his Income.

The next Paragraph saith, That the Army was cleared to the last of March, 1692; and therefore they made this the first Period of Time for examining the Paymaster's Accounts: That they have not been able to proceed much further upon those, which follow, and Which seem to be laid before them very confused, and imperfect; and, upon the little Inspection-they have made into them, they observe, the Paymasters Discharges are generally by Payments of gross Sums, upon Account; others, by Payments to several Persons, for Services, and on several Occasions, without specifying the Services, or Occasions: Particularly, he discharges himself, in some Instances, thus: Paid to several Persons, for especial4 ,

Services relating to the Forces - )

To this Paragraph the Paymaster answers, That the Words, “ very confused ana imperfect,” are not commonly applied to Accounts, till the said Accounts have been thoroughly examined; which, the Commissioners are pleased to say, they have not yet been able to do: That the Army has not been cleared between the First of April, 1692 (to which Day they are cleared) and the 25th of March, 1699, is certain; and therefore, whatsoever Vol. 14.

hath been paid theni within that Period of Time (being Earl Seven Years) was paid them upon Account, and must iUwl consequently be charged, as so paid, in the Paymaster's Acco Accounts. And as to the Three Instances given, that the Paymaster charges Payments to several Persons, and on several Occasions, without specifying the Services, or Occasions; the said Paymaster answers, That the first Sum instanced, being 27,150/. i6$. 3 is an Article in his Account, which begins from the First of October,

1695, and ends the 25th of March, 1699, now Under the Examination of Mr. Auditor Done, of which he delivered an Abstract to the Commissioners bn the 25th of June last; and though, in that Abstract, this Sum is mentioned only in general, to avoid Perplexity, yet in the Account, delivered to the said Auditor in December, 1701, the Particulars, making up that Sum, are enumerated, being about Seventy in Number.

That the Two other Sums instanced, being 50,929/.

17 s.3 id.and 76,477/, 8s. are contained in his

Account, which begins the First of April, 1692, and ends the last of September, 1695, now under the Examination of Mr. Auditor Bridges, of which he also delivered an Abstract to the Commissioners on the said 25th of June last; and though, in that Abstract, the said Two Sums are ouly mentioned in general, to avoid Perplexity, yet in the Account itself, delivered to the said Auditor in November,

1701, the Particulars, making up those Tw'o Sums, are enumerated, befog 210 in Number, or thereabouts.

And the Paymaster further saith, that the Commissioners have not only an Abstract, before them, of his Accounts delivered by him, as aforesaid, to Mr. Auditor Bridges, but they have also had, for some Months past,

the original Acoouut itself, they having sent to the said Auditor for it; by which they may be easily satisfied of what is here averred.

The Third Paragraph, which speaks particularly, is,

That the Paymaster has forgot to carry a Balance, due from him, of20,792/. 7 id. and that in another Account he makes the Balance, due to himself, 58,88 61. 12 s.but has carried to the following

Account 98,4 9/. 13$. 11-f-rf. which, according to lik own Calculation, k more, than it ought to be, 39>5431 is. uid.

To this Paragraph, the said Paymaster answers, First, in general, That no Accomptant can ascertain the Balance of any Account, whilst it is under Examination, since it is the Auditor, as before hath been observed, who alone settles the Bailance, due either to, or from, the Accomptant; and it is a Justice, which hath been always shewn to an Accomptant, to leave his Account open, for some time after the Delivery of it to an Auditor (especially when the Account is for great Sums, and for a long Period of Time) that so the Accomptamt may have Time, and Liberty, to add any Articles omitted in the first Delivery, either to his Charge, or Discharge.

He further saith, That he never yet knew an Auditor forget to carry the Balance, due at the Foot of one Account, to the Charge of the next succeeding Account; nor did any Auditor, as he hath heard, ever allow a Balance due to an Accomptant, beyond what his Discharge, well vouched, made it. And the Paymaster, having said this in general, hastens to answer the particular Instances in this Paragraph.

In order to which, he must first humbly acquaint this honourable House, that he hath delivered to the said Commksioners Five Accounts of his Receipts, and Payments, from the First of April, 1692 (to which Day his Seven declared Accounts go on) to the 25th of December, 1701, none of which are yet passed, and declared; the two first of them depending before the Two Auditors, as before hath been said, and the Three last not befog yet delivered them, by reason they cannot properly take them into their Examination, till the said Two first are ready for Declaration; and the said Three last Accounts were framed pursuant to the Commissioners Precepts, and for their present Satkfaction, in order to shew them the State of his Receipts, and Payments, from the 25th of March, 1699, to Christmas, 1701; which, as far as the said Paymaster P cai>

Earl of stanelagh's

Account, *

30° Novembris. A. 17021

Can compute, will very near balance each the other: And he further saith, that the Balance, due from him, of 20,792/. 7 s. 1 d. (which, this Paragraph saith, he hath forgot to carry to his next succeeding Account) relates to the Fiistof the said live Accounts; that the Balance, due to him, of 58,886 /. 12 s.relates to the 2d of the said Five Accounts; and the Increase of that Balance, from 58,886/. 12 s.to 98,429 /. 13J. 1 i-I (which, tins Paragraph saith, is an Addition to it of 39,543/. 1 1 i\d.

according to his own Calculation} relates to the 3d of the said Five Accounts: To all which he answers, that, when he delivered his 2d Account to Mr. Auditor Done, in December, 1701, he then delivered to him an Abstract of it, at the Bottom of which there was a Memorandum, acquainting him, that he had other Articles to add to the Discharge of that Account, which were not then ascertained; but which he hath since added, and make his Discharge, upon that 2d Account, not only sufficient to answer the Charge of it, but also to clear the said 20,792/. 7 s. 1 d. (said to be forgot, as aforesaid) and still to leave a Balance, due to him, of 98,429/. 13s. 11 which therefore is carried to the Discharge of his 3d Account. And this whole Matter was fully explained to the Commissioners, before they delivered in their Narrative to this honourable House, by a Letter, which the said Paymaster writ to them, and of which he hath a Copy ready to produce.

In the 4th and last Paragraph the Commissioners are pleased to say, That, as they see, from these, and other the like, Instances, that the Paymaster's subsequent Accounts are as extraordinary, and no less imperfect, thau the forrqpr; so they have great Reason to apprehend, that, when they shall call upon him, to lay others before them, in such a Method, as they conceive most necessary, for their due examining and stating of them, it cannot be complied w ith; because, when they sent Two of their own Members with a Precept to him, to see, whether he had kept such a Register of Ins regimental Accounts, as he was required to do by a Clause in an Act, passed in the 4th and 5th of the late King and Queen (for punishing Officers, and Soldiers, who shall mutiny, or desert) and continued, by several other Acts, till the 1 oth of April, 1698, they reported, that there was no such Register kept; that neither he, nor those he employed, owned, they knew of the Clause; hut that he desired to know, where it was to be found, and said, he would read it, before he slept: They reported also, that he seemed ignorant of the like Clause, passed in another Act of the last Session, against Mutiny and Desertion; and that he had kept no such Register in his Office.

To this Paragraph he answers, That a Precept was brought him, to his Office, dated the 13th of October last, by Two of the Commissioners of Accounts; by which he was required to permit the said Two Commissioners to inspect such Offices, Books, and Papers, as they should think lit. Upon Sight of this Precept, the Paymaster assured them of his Readiness to comply with it. Upon this they asked him, whether he had kept such a Register of his regimental Accounts, as he w as required to do by a Clause in an Act, passed in the 4th and 5th of the late King and Queen (for punishing Mutiny and Desertion) and continued, by several other Acts, to the 10th of April, 1698. To this he answered, That, pursuant to the Clause aforesaid, he had, with great Labour and Pains, made up all the said regimental Accounts, belonging to his Office, from the first of April, 1692, to the 25th of March, 1699; that he had given out the said regimental Accounts, so made up, to the several Colonels, or their Agents; and that, before he did so, he had caused them all to be fairly entered, or registered, in large Books, prepared for that Purpose. Whereupon they desired to see those Books, which were immediately laid before them; and after tiiey had inspected them some time, and taken notice, how fairly they were entered, they told him, that he was obliged, by the Clause aforesaid, to attest, undpr his own Hand, or that of his Deputies, that each regi-

mental Account, so entered, was a true Account To this the Paymaster aqswered, that he, or his Deputy, had signed all the original Accounts, delivered, as aforesaid, to the several Colonels, or their Agents; and that, having done so, lie thought, there was very little need of signing the Copies of them, entered in those Books: And when they replied to this, that the aforesaid Clause required such signing, he told them, that he had not read that Clause of a long Time, but that lie would read it, before he slept; and that he thought, he had fully complied with the Intention of it, by signing the original Accounts; given out to the Colonels, or Agents; and, if it were thought necessary, he would have the sevei al Entries of them signed by such of his Clerks, as had both entered; and examined, them; adding, that, though he entered all his Letters of Business in Books, yet he never thought it necessary to attest, or sign, those Entries. After this they asked him, whether lie had made up such regimental Accounts, pursuant to the like Clauses, passed in another Act, of the last Sessions, against Mutiny and Desertion: To which he answered, That he.had not as yet much minded that Clause, thinking, there was no great need of it, since the Forces, under his Care, were now paid regularly, as soon as the Rolls for any Muster were brought into his Office; and that, though the Letter of this last Clause had not been,1 as yet, exactly complied with, yet he had the Vouchers and Warrants, belonging to each Regiment, from Christmas last, ready to shew them, though that last Clause was to take Effect only from the 1 st of Mtu ch last.

This is a true Narrative of what passed between the said Two Commissioners, and him, on the Day aforesaid; and therefore the Paymaster cannot but wonder, that this Paragraph should so positively suggest, that he had kept no Register of the regimental Accounts, required by the aforesaid First Clause, and that even he had forgot, there was such a Clause; though he can safely say, that it cost him very near Two Years constant Trouble, in making up, and entering, the said Accounts.; which were made up with that Exactness, that the Five Commissioners of Accounts have grounded all their Certificates for Debentures upon them; and as to the last Clause, now in being, he hath since punctually complied even with the very Letter of it, from Christmas last.

These are the Answers, which the said Paymaster humbly offers to all the material Observations, contained in the Narrative of the Commissioners of Accounts; to w'hich he begs Leave now to add the Reasons, why he hath, and still doth insist, that the said Commissioners have no Authority to ravel into, or lay open, any of his Accounts, passed and declared, upon which he hath his Quietus est in due Fbrm of Law, and which have been heretofore under the Examination of any of the former Commissions of Accounts.

The First Act, appointing Commissioners of Accounts, passed in the 2d Year of the late King and Queen: The Commissioners, thereby appointed, had a general Power and Authority to examine all Accounts of publick Money between the 5th Day of November, 1688, and the 25th of January, 1691: Which Act was revived to the 25th of April, 1693, by the last Clause in the Act, granting a quarterly Poll to their Majesties, in the 3d Year of their Reign.

The next Act, appointing Commissioners of Accounts, passed in the 4th and 5th Years of their said late Majesties Reign. That Parliament, thinking, that it was no Ways reasonable, to give such Persons, as had delivered in their Accounts to the Commissioners, appointed by ' the said first-recited Act, the Trouble of accounting over again, for the same Matters, before the Commissioners, appointed by this Act, did not give them a general Power, as in the First Act, but confined and limited their Power, to take Accounts of all Monies, issued between the said 5th of November, 1688, and the 24th of April, 1694, not accounted for by virtue, or in pursuance, of the said first-recited Act, or the last Clause, touching publick Accounts, enacted in the aforesaid Act, granting a quarterly Poll.

Mr. Bromley (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared- to the said Committee, touching the Election for the Borough of Westbury, in the County of Wilts, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition of Henry Bertie, and Robert Bertie, Esquires, complaining of an undue Election and Return of William Trenchard and Thomas Phipps, Esquires, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of West bury:

That the Poll stands thus:

For Mr. Robert Bertie, 24.

For Mr. Henry Bertie, 22.

For Mr. Trenchard, 30.

For Mr. Phipps, 28.

That the Petitioners Counsel insisted, that this is a Borough by Prescription; and that the Right of Election is in the Owners of Burgage Houses, either Freeholders, or such, as hold immediately of the Lord for Lives, or by Lease for Years, and reside in the Borough.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Members agreed, the Right to be, as opened; only denied, the Leaseholders for Years had any Right to vote, unless their Leases were determinable upon Lives.

That they further agreed. Burgage Houses were known, by paying a Burgage Rent.

Several Witnesses were called, to speak to the Right of Leaseholders, for Years absolute, Robert Cat. to vote at the Election of Members, to serve enj. oune. parijament for this Borough; who said, they had known the Borough several Years; and that such Tenants were always reputed to have a right, if they lived in the Borough; and that one Brown, who had only a Lease for Years, had voted: And Robert Cox said, he knew Bi'own's Lease was for 99 Years absolute, because

he bought it of him, and there were but Nine Years to coine, when he bought it.

John Coward, That, in Answer to this, Witnesses were Tho. Mtin. called, who said, they had known this Borough many Years: That Freehold, and some Copyhold, Leases, if they paid a Burgage Rent, had a Right to vote; but that they had not heard, that Leaseholders, for Years absolute, had any Right to vote: And one of them said, he believed, Brown's Lease was for Lives.

That the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Tenants of Burgage Houses, by Lease for Years absolute, have a Right to vote in the Election of Members, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of West bury, in the County of Wilts.

That the Petitioners Counsel then objected to several, that did not reside in the Borough at the Time of the Election.

Jane Hough said, that Edward Patient's Family was in the Town, and not in the Borough, at the Time of the Election; and that she had heard him say, he would lodge in the Borough, to pleasure Mr. Phipps and Mr. Trenchard in voting; and wished the Election over, that he might return to his Family again.

Ben. Ror«csaid, that JohnCoward and Nicholas Coward lived out of the Borough, but were often in the Borough, and lived in a Tenement with one Moor: But it was owned, they had always a little Shop in the Borough, being Card-makers by Trade.

That it was affirmed on the other Side, that John Cowdrd lived in the Borough, and his Daughter lived with him; and that Nicholas Coward had lived in the Borough since April: But it was affirmed, that in Moors House there was room only for Two Beds; and yet, at the Election, he pretended to have 12 Persons in his Family.

That Matthew Neat was at Moor's House, but pretended to an House in the Borough.

That, on the other Side, it was answered, that he, and his Family, had lived in the Borough ever since April.

Ben. Borne, Sam. Switters,said, that John Cockle lived

in the Tything, out of the Borough, and only lodged at his Brother's at the Time of the Election: But on the other Side it was affirmed, that John Cockle had a Burgage House.

JamesEdgill said, that Samuel Wherat's Estate was a Copyhold, and his Father was to enjoy it for his Life.

That to this it was answered, that was admitted

Tenant at the last Court.

Ben. Borne said, that Henry Murjitt had no Burgage House; and that what he paid, was only a Year for an Encroachment, not for Burgage Rent, which he had collected on that Account

That, on the other Side, it was affirmed to be a Burgage House; and that one Thomas Holdway voted for it formerly.

Edward Taylor said, that Richard Clarey lived in a Burgage House with his Mother, whose House it was: But an Assignment was produced from his Mother, 4th May last.

Cox said, that John Withers lived only in Part of an House: But it was affirmed, his Grandfather had given him the Inheritance of the whole.

Ben. Borne said, that Walter Smith's Mother is in Possession of the House, where he lives, and stands in the Rent-roll, as Tenant: But there was produced an Assignment to him from his Mother, dated the 1st of May last.

That after this the Petitioners Counsel proceeded to shew, that several Votes wrere obtained by Bribes.

Samuel Sicklin said, that there was a Debt owing long

since from John Phips, deceased, which Mr. the

Sitting Member, paid a little before the Election.

To which it was answered, that he was his Administrator, and had Effects in his Hands, to pay his Debts.

Samuel Sweetlandsaid, his Father, William Sweetland,

had a Bill from one Paul Phipps, a Relation of Mr. Phips, for 20/. and that his Father told him, he had some Money lent him, in Consideration of his voting: But one Robert Downing said, it was only a Bill of Exchange, and that he had repaid the Money.

John Humphreys said, that Jonathan Axford, the Mayor, voted for the Sitting Members; and that he declared, he had been out of Pocket 20/. in his Mayoralty, and whosoever he returned, should reimburse him, and give him Security, to indemnify him in making the Return.

That Witnesses were called to ill Practices in general.

John Hancock said, Mr. Phipps, at his own House, about a Month before the Election, proferred him 20/. if he would vote for him; and that he was offered half a Tun of Iron, being a Blacksmith: But Robert Downing and Henry Murjitt testified, that Hancock told him, Three Days after the Election, Mr. Phipps never asked him for his Vote, nor offered him any Money.

John Sly said, that, about Two Months before the Election, Mr. Phipps told him, that if he would vote for him, he would give 80/. or \ool. amongst the Voters.

Richard King said, that Mr. Phipps asked him for his Vote, and told him, he should have what Money he wanted. William Pierson testifyed, that King, Three Weeks after the Election, solicited him to be a Witness against Mr. Phipps, and told him, he should have 30/. to pay Mr. Bates, to whom he was indebted.

William

William, Jordan said, that, about Two Months before the Election, Mr. Trenchardasked him for his Vote; and

that, being a Tallow-chandler, Mr. Trenchant told him, he had an Interest in Ireland, and would help him to 2 or 300l. worth of Tallow in Ireland, from a good Hand, and pass his Word for it.

But I ViUiam Cockle,being examined on Mr.

Behalf, said, he was with Jordan at Mr. Trenchard's House, and when the Discourse was; and that it was only a general Discourse about helping him to Tallow in Ireland, but with no respect to his voting.

That the Sitting Members Counsel insisted, that it did not appear, what Residence was necessary to give a Right to vote at this Election; but produced several, who said, that, at the Election to the Oxon Parliament, they remembered, some had voted, and were not objected against, that had lived only Two or Three Days, or a Week, in the Borough.

William Ficrton, They afterwards endeavoured to rccrimi-Fn>. Amyett. nate. an(j called Witnesses, who said, that Robert Cox and Ben. Borne offered to Pierson

Two Trees, worth 5/. to vote for the Petitioners; and that Samuel Gibbs and John Humphryes threatened, he should have no further Estate iu his House, if he did not vote for the Petitioners.

That Gibbs was an Agent for the Earl of Abingdon, and threatened, that, if he voted against that Lord's Interest, he should never have his Lease; neither has be it yet, though granted.

Austin, Robert Forster, said, that Samuel Gibbs declared, that, if the Petitioners had only Ten Votes, they would carry it in the Parliament-house.

Dozening said, that John Millis offered him Two Lives in this House, if he would be for the Petitioners; and to give him a Bond of 30/. to make it good.

Martin Taylor said, that John Davis told him, he had a mind to renew his Estate, and was kept off from it; and that Mr. Moor, the Earl of Abingdon's Chaplain, promised him, he should renew; which was the Reason he voted for the Petitioners.

That some Witnesses s|K>ke to their having Leases, granted by the Lord of the Manor, but that they were detained from them: To which it was answered, they were so detained, either, because they had not paid all their Fines, or their Fees to the Steward, or else, because no Court had been held, since they were granted.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Members called one Thomas Browne,to speak to some Bonds, of 20 /. being

iven by the Tenants, to vote for the Earl of Abingdon's nterest, as long as they lived: He said, he had given such a Bond to Edmund Bay ley; and that Bayley told him, if his Father and he did not give it, they should have no Lease.

John Amyett spoke to the same Effect; and that they had voted for Mr. Trenchard and Mr. Phipps, but the Bonds were not sued.

That the Petitioners Counsel offered to call Witnesses, to prove, that these Bonds were given above Years since, and had been all of them publickly cancelled, and destroyed, long before this last Election, in the late King's Life-time, in the Presence of those that gave them, and others, by the Direction of Mr. Robert Bertie, one of the Petitioners, as soon as the said Petitioner had any Notice of those Bonds. '

And then they withdrew'.

And the Memorial was read, and is, as followeth; viz.

To the honourable the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses,

in Parliament assembled:

The humble Memorial of John Baggs and John Trenchard, Two of the Trustees of the forfeited Estates in Ireland,

Sheweth,

THAT many great Estates (and particularly the forfeited Estate of the late Earl of Clancarthy) are subject to one intire Quit-rent, that may be levied upon any Part of it; which does obstruct the Sales of such Forfeitures, few Persons being willing to purchase Lands, subject to he distrained for Rents greater than their Value.

2. Many Estates (whereof an Interest for Life only remains vested in the Trustees) are subject to great Incumbrances, which were contracted, before the Estates were settled, and will swallow up the whole Interests for Lives, unless some Power be given, to throw a proportionable Part of the Tncumbrances upon the Reversions, according to the Course of Courts of Equity.

3dly, Many Statutes, Judgments, and other Debts, as also great Part of the Rents, that shall become due from this Time, will (we fear) be lost to the Publick, unless some Summary Method be directed, for the Recovery of them, the Trustees being objiged to sue for them in the ordinary Courts of Justice, where it will not be difficult to make Delays, till the Expiration of our Commission.

4thly, There is a Notion industriously spread about in Ireland, that the Adjudications, made by the Trustees, and the Titles of those Lands they shall sell, pursuant to them, are subject to the Re-examination of other Courts there: And though we conceive, the Act of Resumption leaves little Colour to countenance that Construction; yet such an Opinion, generally promoted, and believed, may have the same ill Consequences upon our Sales, as if it was better grounded.

All which the Trustees are apprehensive may tend to the depreciating the Forfeitures; and therefore thought it their Duty, and accordingly have directed us, to represent the same to your Honours; that such Provision may be made for the Remedy thereof, as to your Honours, in your great Wisdom, shall seerrt meet.

J. Baggs,

John Trenchard.

And the said Schedule of the Books, and Papers, is as followeth; viz.

Sir Godfrey Copley, from the Commissioners for taking, examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, acquainted the House, that he had their Reply to the Answer of the Earl of to their Narra-

tive, or Observations, in relation to his Lordship's Accounts } and he read the same in his Place, and afterwards delivered [it] in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was read, and is, as followeth; viz.

The Reply of the Commissioners, appointed by Act of Parliament to take, examine, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, to the Answer of Richard Earl of Ranelagh, Paymaster-general of her Majesty's Forces, to their Narrative, or Observations upon the said Paymasters Accounts.

YOUR Commissioners do, in the first Place, return you their humble Thanks, for having ordered them a Copy of the Answer of the Paymaster of her Majesty's Land Forces to their Narrative, and Observations on his Accounts, and for your allowing them so short a Day to deliver in their Reply to the same; whereby they have an early Opportunity of justifying themselves, and their Proceedings.

Your Commissioners knew, that they had reported Matter of Fact so faithfully to you, and that their Observations were so well grounded, that little Time could be requisite for their Reply. In this Opinion they are abundantly confirmed by his Lordship's Answer; and therefore shall not offer you other Reply in Writing, than this, that follows.

That, in relating Matter of Fact, his Lordship is very much mistaken, and has plainly misrepresented it in many Particulars.

That, in his Answers to your Commissioners Ten Observations, some of the Facts he owns, and justifies; upon which you only are to judge betwixt his Lordship, and your Commissioners: As to others, his Answers are generally evasive. Where he denies any thing, charged by your Commissioners, they are ready to make good the same.

His Lordship's Answers to their Animadversions on his Accounts, not passed, are in the like Manner.

As to what his Lordship relates of the Two Commissioners, who were sent to see the Register, he was required by Act of Parliament to keep in his Office, they crave Leave to lay the Report of those two Commissioners before you, as they agreed it, immediately upon their Return from the Pay-office, and as it was then entered in their Books.

Mortis, 13 Octobris, 1702.

“ Two of the Commissionershavingattended the Earl of u Ranelagh at the Pay-office, with a Precept to his Lord-‘‘ ship [to permit ] them to inspect such Offices, Books, “ and Papers, as they should think fit, they reported, “ that, delivering the Precept to his Lordship, he asked,

“ what Books they did desire to see; he was very willing “ to shew them any he had. Then his Lordship was “ acquainted, the Books, the Commissioners of Accounts “ had desired them to inspect in his office, were tire “ Regimental Accounts, which the Paymaster of the Army, or his Deputy, was obliged (by the Act, that “ passed Anno 4 et 5 JV. et for punishing Officers, and Soldiers, &;c. and was afterwards yearly con-

tinued to the 10th of April, 1698) to make up on the

ist of July, 1693, or within Six Days after, with the Colonel of every Regiment in their Majesties Service,

£] These Words are Supplied from the Original.

“ or his Agent. His Lordship said, he knew not, whether any such Books were in his Office; he trusted “ to Mr. Abbott, who was a very careful Man; he would “ esquire, what Books there were, and would soon wait “ on the Commissioners, and give them an Account.

“ We desired, we might now see, what Books were in the Office. His Lordship then said, there were Two “ large Books, in which these Accounts, for that. Time,

“ were kept; and called for Mr. Pigeon, who was asked “ for such Books. Mr. Pigeon seemed a Stranger to this “ Clause in the Act of Parliament; mentioned the Two “ great Books, and, at our Desire, brought them to us.

“ We looked into them, and found them to contain Accounts of his Lordship's Payments to several Regiments;

“ and were told, they were from the 1st of April, 1692,

“ to the 25th March, 1699; but none of the Regimental “ Payments were so signed, as the Act directed. His “ Lordship desired to know, where the Clause was to be “ found; and said he would read it over, before he slept:

“ That, if his Books were not kept in the Method ex- pseted, he could easily make them up so, and would do “ it: He had made up Regimental Accounts, which were “ before the Commissi ers in Convent-garden-, and had much Trouble in them.

“ His Lordship was further acquainted, that there was “ the like Clause in the Act against Mutiny and Desertion, that passed the last Session of Parliament; and “ asked, whether he had made up his Accounts with the “ Regiments, as he was thereby required. His Lordship, and Mr. Pigeon, were shewn the said Clause;

“ and his Lordship answered, be had taken care to make “ up his Accounts, as the Musters were sent him in, and “ to pay accordingly, since the 2.5th of March, 1699;

“ but that there was a great Neglect in that Office; that “ he was forced often to call upon them for the Musters;

“ and it was with Difficulty, and late, he had them:

“ That he would take notice of this Clause, and endeavour to comply with it.”

Whether his Lordship is merely a ministerial Officer, is submitted to you; but your Commissioners apprehend such Doctrine must be attended with very absurd, as well as very fatal, Consequences, to the Publick.

Ana lastly, as to his Lordship's disputing the Authority of your Commissioners of Accounts, in what they required, they shall humbly offer you their Reasons, to support it, whenever you please to enter into the Consideration of that Matter. You are the best Expositors of your own Act, and your own Intentions.

Your Commissioners, for the avoiding Prolixity (which they conceive may be more proper in a Reply, than in the framing of Accounts, which are to be examined, and stated) and that they may not engage in an endless Paper War, will not trouble you with any thing further in Writing; but humbly beg, they may have the Liberty to make good their Narrative, ore tenus.

tions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition of John Pitt, Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of Richard Chandler, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of St.Ives, in the County of Cornwall:

That the Petitioner's Counsel insisted, that the Borough of St. Ives was a Corporation and Borough by Prescription.

That the only Thing, in question, was, the Right of Election; which, the Petitioner's Counsel said, was in the Burgesses or Inhabitants at large; but the Sitting Member's Counsel said, it was in the capital Burgesses only.

That the Petitioner's Counsel called several Witnesses, and delivered in several Returns to Parliament for the said Borough.

That the Witnesses, viz. Mr. Henry Richard

Trenkay, Richard Swaite, Tho. Cockaine, James Mortice, said, they had been acquainted with this Borough 14, 23,

40, and 60, Years; and that they had known several Elections; and that the Burgesses at large had voted; and they never knew them denied.

That they produced the following Returns; viz.

Two Indentures of Return, of the 16th of April, 1660; by one of which, John St. Aubin, Esquire, by the other,

James Praed, Esquire, is returned a Burgess, tp serve in Parliament for the said Borough. The first Indenture is expressed to be made between the Sheriff, of the one Part, and the Mayor, Burgesses, and Commonalty, on the other Part; which was signed by a certain Number of capital Burgesses, and Common-council-men, and about too others, called Gentlemen, and Freemen;, and is said to be under their Hands and Seals: The other Indenture is expressed to be made between the Sheriff, and the Burgesses, and the Commonalty; and that the Burgesses and Commonalty, of their own unanimous Assent, and Consent, had chosen Mr. Praed;. and was under the Hands and Seals of the Burgesses and Commoualty, and signed by above J50.

1 o° Martii, 130 Car. II. another Return, to which the Mayor and Burgesses are Parties; by which it is expressed, that the Mayor and Burgesses had unanimously elected Daniel Oneale, Esquire: It is under the Common Seal, and signed by 48.

Nosworthy, Esquire, in the same Form, signed by 58.

10 Martii, 2° IVillielmi et Maria, another Return by John Hicks, then Mayor, who also made the Return now in question; and the Indenture is between the Sheriff, of the one Part, and the said Mayor, Burgesses, and Commonalty, of the other Part; and it is expressed, that the said Mayor, Burgesses, and Commonalty, liad unanimously elected the said Mr. Praed: It is under the Common Seal, and signed by 166.

That the Petitioner's Counsel also desired Two Resolutions of the House to be read; One,

16th July, 1660, That the Freemen at large had a Right

to elect Members, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of St. Ivesm, and that Mr. Nosworthy was duly elected:

18th December 1C61, another, That the House do agree with the Committee, That the Burgesses at large had Right of Election; and that Mr. Basset had the Majority of Voices; and that Mr. Election was

void; and that the Indenture, whereby Mr. Nosworthy was returned, should be taken off the File, and cancelled.

That then the Petitioner's Counsel called some Witnesses, as to the Proceeding of this Election.

John Busvargus said, that he was present at the last Election, and the Burgesses at large appeared; and that the Mayor, Mr. Hicks, recommended Mr. Chandler, as another Person did Mr. Praed', and his, the said Busvar-gus's, Master recommended Mr. Pitt, and told the Mayor, he hoped, that he would not exclude the Burgesses, as he did the last Time; and the Mayor said, he would proceed by King James's Charter: That the Mayor called over the Aldermen, and then went out of the Hall, the Burgesses at large declaring, they were for Pitt and Praed; and one Mr. Veale took their Poll, and had polled about 20, before the Mayor went away.

John Busvargus, Jt was also testified, that, after the Poll CArts. Harris. was thus taken, an Indenture was signed by a great Number of Burgesses, or Inhabitants; and that the Mayor refused to return according to it

That it was further said, that it was not Mr. Hick's Turn to be Mayor, but Mr. Pollard's; and that the said Mr. Hicks desired Mr. Pollard not to take it amiss, for he was made Mayor by the Duke of Bolton's Order.

That the Sitting Member's Counsel insisted, that the ancient Returns were only by the Mayor, or Portreeve, and Burgesses; which could be construed only of the Freemen of the Corporation; but those, that voted for the Petitioner, were only Inhabitants.

To which the Petitioner's Counsel replied, that the Inhabitants ofa Borough, by Prescription, were the Burgesses.

That the Returns, by the Sitting Member's Counsel produced, were,

14 Eli$. Warden, and Burgesses, elected: Return signed by the Warden, and eleven others.

26 Eliz. Warden, and Burgesses, elected: Return signed by about Eight or Nine.

39 Eliz. Warden, and Burgesses, elected: Return signed by Seven.

1 Jac. I. Warden, or Portreeve, and Burgesses, elected: The Return signed by the Portreeve, and about Six others.

21 Jac. I. Portreeve, and Burgesses, elected.

3 Car. I. Portreeve, and Burgesses, elected: The Return signed by Twelve.

Mr. John Newman produced an ancient Book of the Corporation; whereby it appeared, the Corporation con-

sisted of a Portreeve, 12 capital, and1 24 other, Burgesses;. and said, he had searched in that Book, and found, that those, who made the Returns formerly, were of the capital Burgesses.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Member further alleged, that, by a Charter from the late King James, the Election of Burgesses was placed in the Mayor and capital Burgesses; which they made use of, to excuse the Mayor, making a Return otherwise than according to the last Determination in Parliament.

That the Committee came to these Resolutions: Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of Election of Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of St. Ives, in the County of Cornwall, is not in the Inhabitants of the said Borough, not receiving Alms.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Richard Chandler, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Ives.

And the same was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Another Amendment was proposed to be made, by leaving out, “not receiving Alms,” and inserting instead thereof, “ paying Scot and Lot:'

And the same was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, so amended, That the Right of Election of Burgesses, so serve in Parliament for the Borough of St. Ives, in the County of Cornwall, is in the Inhabitants of the said Borough, paying Scot and Lot The 2d Resolution being read a Second time;

And the Question being.put, That the House do agree with the Committee in the said Resolution, That Richard Chandler, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the sakl Borough of St. Ives.

Mr. Bromley also (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the double Return and Election for the Borough of Milborne Port, in the County of Somerset, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which lie read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz

#Upon the Petition of John Henley, Esquire, as also upon the Petition of John Hunt, Esquire, mutually complaining of the undue Election and Return of each other for the Borough of Port, in

the County of Somerset:

It appeared, upon the Evidence, that Mr. Hunt was returned by.one of the Bailiffs, and Mr. Henley by the other.

That, upon the Poll, the Numbers between, the Petitioners stood thus:

For Mr. Henley, 77

For Mr. Hunt, 46.

That both agreed this to be a Borough by Prescription. 2 ' But

I Ann. 8° — 90 Decembris. 75

But the Counsel for Mr. tien insisted, that the Right of Election was in the Inhabitants, paying a Quit-rent to the Queen Dowager, and not receiving Alms.

And the Counsel for Mr. H insisted, that the Right of Election was in the Nine capital Bailiffs, their Two Deputies, in the Nine Commonalty Stewards, and in the Inhabitants paying Scot and Lot.

That, as to the Point of Right, Mr. Henley's Counsel called several Witnesses; viz.

John Raymond, Richard Gerard; who could speak to

40, and 50, Years; and they testified, that the Usage had been, to admit all Housekeepers, not receiving Alms, to vote.

Richard Hymore said, he had been Steward Ten or a Dozen Years; and the Method was, to call over the Voters by a List; which he did at tins Election; and that the Inhabitants, not receiving Alms, had always been admitted to poll; but he owned, that, at several Elections, Objections had beeu made to such as did not pay Scot and Lot.

That the Counsel for Mr. admitted, that, for 40 Years, the Inhabitants, not receiving Alms, though they did not pay Scot and Lot, had been generally permitted to poll, to prevent any Disturbance by the meaner Peo-' pie; but that they had been objected to, and there never had been any Determination upon their Right.

They said further, that the Inhabitants at large were permitted first to poll in Oliver's Usurpation; but insisted, that the Usage, before that Time, was only for such as paid Scot and Lot to vote.

That they produced several Returns, and called several Witnesses, to make this appear.

The Return, 40 Car.I. which is expressed to be made between the Sheriff of Somerset, of the one Part, and the Bailiffs, Six others, Burgesses of , cum

The Return, 16 Car. I. made between the Bailiff, and Burgesses: And therein it is expressed, that the Bailiffs, and Burgesses, subscribing, with the whole Assent and Consent of the Burgesses there, elected: Signed by the Two Bailiffs, and Six others.

Cakb Barret, aged 73, said, that the capital Bailiffs, and Commonalty Stewards, and such as paid to Church and Poor only, voted, till Olivers Time; and particularly spoke to the Oxford Parliament, when those, that did not pay Scot and Lot, were rejected. And being examined as to those, that signed the Return 16 Car. I. he was positive to all, but Two, paying Scot and Lot. lie said, others did vote, besides those named in the Hetum to 16 Car. I. but they were the substantial Men of the Borough.

That they also produced a Return, t Jac. II. which concludes, That the said Burgesses, and Electors, being the greatest Part of the said Burgesses, and Electors, Inhabitants, Householders, and Payers of Scot and Lot in the £aid Borough, had put their Hands and Seals to the Return.

Edward Pranke said, that such Members, as were returned, to serve in Parliament for that Borough, had alw ays the greater Number of the Bailiffs, and their Deputies, of the Stewards, and Burgesses, though those, that did not pay to Church and Poor, have been permitted to vote: That himself could speak for 30 Years; and he has heard his Futher, and several old Men, say, the Right was so; and that Mr. Hunt, and other Gentlemen, had always objected to them, that did not pay Scot and Lot; and that, in the several Elections of- Mr. Hunt, he had always the Majority of such as paid Scot and Lot.

Mr. Bull, a Servant of Mr. , said, his Master always objected to such, as did not pay; but their Poll was taken, to prevent a Mutiny; and that Mr. Hunt at this Time demanded a Return, according to the Majority of such, as paid Scot and Ix>t; and so did Mr. Henley, at first.

Upon which Evidence the Committee came to this Resolution:

Vol. 14.

Resolved, That it is the O[anion of this Committee, Milbome That the Right of Election of Burgesses to serve in Par- P°rt Elec-Iiarnent for the Borough of Milbome Port, in the County tlon' of Somerset, is only in the capital Bailiffs, and their Deputies, in the Commonalty Stewards and the Inhabitants thereof, paying Scot and Lot.

That upon this Head, of not paying Scot and Lot

Mr. Henley took off 21 of Mr. Hunt's Voters. Some Evidence was given, as to others, who voted for Mr.

Hunt, and did not pay; but it was answered that they were capital Bailiffs, or their Deputies.

That Mr. Hunt, upon this Head, of not paying, took off 58 of Mr. Henley's Voters.

That thereupon the Committee came to this Resolution:

Brooks, and will be no considerable Benefit to any Persons, unless the present Undertakers; that the prosecuting the present Bill is a Surprize upon the Petitioner: And praying, that some competent Time may be allowed, to inform the Persons interested (who, for the most part, live at a great Distance) with the Particulars of the said Bill, and to shew, how much their Properties and ju3t Rights will be prejudiced thereby, if it should pass, and not be of Advantage to the Publick; and that, in order thereunto, the Petitioner may be heard by his Counsel against the said Bill.

Mr. Bromley reported from the Committee, to whom Occasional it was referred, to draw' up Reasons, to be offered to the Conformity. Lords at a Conference, for disagreeing with their Lordships to some of the Amendments, made by them to the Bill, intituled, An Act for preventing occasional Conformity; that they had drawn up the same accordingly; which they had directed him to report to the House:

Which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are as follow; viz.

To the First Amendment, made by your Lordships to the Bill, intituled, An Act for preventing occasional Conformity, in Skin the 1st, Line the 6tb, the Commons do agree.

To the 2d and 3d Amendments, Line the 10th and 11th, the Commons disagree;

First, Because that the Recital, that every Person, to be admitted into any Office, or Employment, should be conformable to the Church, as it is by Law established, is confined to such Laws, as enact, that every such Person shall receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and Usage of the Church of England.

2dly, Because the Corporation and the Test Acts, which have been frequently evaded, and are, by this Bill, intended to be made effectual, do provide, that all Persons, to be admitted into any Office or Employment, in pursuance of those Acts, should receive the Sacrament of the: Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and Usage of the Church of England;and all Persons, under such Obligation to receive the Sacrament, the Commons conceive, are obliged to be conformable to the Church, as it is by Law established.

To the 4th Amendment, Line the 20th, the Commons disagree; because it depends upon the former.

To the 5th Amendment, 2 Skin, Line 4th, the Commons disagree;

Because yourLordships admit this Bill to be reasonable, as to the Officers, and Persons, described in the former Part of this Clause; and the Commons see no Reason, why this Bill should not equally extend to the Persons, and Officers, described in the latter Part thereof, left out by your Lordships in this Amendment.

Secondly, Your Lordships leaving out, in this Amendment, these Words, viz. “ who, by the Laws, are obliged “ to receive the Sacrament of the Lord 's Supper, acc.ording to the Rites and Usage of the Church of England," may countenance an Opinion, that the Persons, described in the Words, left out by your Lordships, are not obliged to receive the Sacrament.

Thirdly, Those Words do equally refer to the Persons, described in the former Part of this Clause, to which your Lordships have agreed, as to the Persons described in your Lordships Amendment; and the Commons take it to be very evident, that every Person, described in this Clause, as sent up to your Lordships, is obliged to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and Usage of the Church of England.

To the 6th Amendment, Line the 20th, the Commons do agree.

To the 7th Amendment, Line 33. the Commons have agreed, w ith some Amendments.

-To

84 15° — 16° Decembris. 1702.

To the 8th Amendment, Lane 34th, the Commons have disagreed; because (though many other Reasons might be offered, from which the Commons can never depart; yet, at this l ime, they think it sufficient to say) that the Penalties, left out by your Lordships, in tins Amendment, are reasonable, and no more, than what are necessary to make this Bill effectual.

To the 9th Amendment, Skin 3d, L. 9. the Commons disagree; because they think, the Penalty of Incapacity, a3 qualified by the subsequent Proviso, is a proper Punishment for this Offence; and the Commons conceive it necessary to increase the Penalty, upon a Second Offence, as has been practised in many other Cases.

To Clause A, the Commons agree.

To Clause B, the Commons disagree; because, as this Bill takes away no one Privilege, that the Dissenters have by Law, so the Commons cannot think it fit to give them any new Privilege by it.

To Clause C, the Commons disagree; because the Commons conceive, there is no Occasion for it.

To Clause D, the Commons disagree; because the Commons think it necessary, that the Bill should equally extend to all Persons, before recited, as obliged to receive the Sacrament, and see no Reason for the Distinction made thereby.

To Clause E, the Commons disagree; because, if such Persons are obliged to receive the Sacrament, there is no Reason to exempt them out of this Bill; and, if they are not obliged, the Clause is unnecessary.

The said Reasons, being severally read a Second time, were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Conference Resolved, That a Conference be desired with the Lords, desired with upon the Subject Matter of the said Amendments.

Lords. Ordered, That Mr. Greoill do go to the Lords, and

desire the said Conference.

Supply Tiill; Ordered, That the ingrossed Bill, for granting to her

LumITux. Majesty a Land Tax, for prosecuting the War against France and Spain, be read the Third time this Day, after the Report, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, touching the Election for the Port of Rye.

ttyc Elec- Hr. Bromley (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to the Committee, touching the Election for the Port of Rye, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the 1 louse; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition of Southwell, Esquire,

complaining of an undue Election and Return of 'Iho. Fagg, Esquire, and Jos. OJfley, Esquire, to serve as Barons in Parliament for the Port of Rye, in the County of Sussex:

That the Poll was agreed to stand thus:

For Mr. Fagg, 40.

For Mr. Off ley, 38.

For Mr. 1Southwell, 25.

That the Counsel for the Petitioner insisted, that the Right of Election was only in the Mayor, Jurats, and in the Freemen, inhabiting in this Port, and paying Scot and Lot.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Members denied Residency to be necessary, or the paying Scot and Lot That, as to the Point of Residency, Evidence w'as given, and not pretended to be contradicted, unless in an Instance or two, of Gentlemen, that had served in Parliament for the said Port, and did not inhabit there, and yet, at the next Election after such Service, had been allowed to vote.

Then, as to the paying Scot and Lot, the Oath of a Freeman was produced; where, among other things, every Freeman swears to pay all Scots and Lots, which shall be due, or happen to be due, or granted to be levied, within the Port. Afterwards Witnesses were called, who spoke to this Matter; that they looked upon the paying Scot and Lot to be necessary; and that they had known those objected to, that did not pay Scot and Lot: But it was proved by others, and not denied by the Petitioner's Witnesses, that one Mr. Radford, who had been a Justice of Peace, and was fallen into Decay, had voted, when he did not pay Scot and Lot

Wahh, That Two or Three were made free, and did Sharp, not pay Scot and Lot, when they voted; one of Palmer, which was an Apprentice, the other a Journeyman, and the last was excused, by reason of his Poverty.

But it w'as said, those were not disputed Elections: And no other Instances, than these, being given, the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of Election of Barons, to serve in Parliament for the Port of Rye, is only in the Mayor, Jurats, and in the Freemen, inhabiting in the said Port, and paying Scot and Lot.

That the Right of Election being thus settled, the Petitioner's Counsel excepted against Twenty-three, who voted for the Sitting Members; Five of which, they said, were Dissenters (vis.Mr. Tucker,

mal, John Dixon, Daniel and John Waite) and

had not received the Sacrament w ithin a Year, before they were made free; and therefore were not qualified, according to the Corporation Act of 13 Car. II. to be Freemen of the Port, since, by the Constitution thereof) all the Freemen are concerned in the Government of it To which this Answer was given, that all the Freemen had a right to be summoned to their Assemblies; at which Meetings all Matters, relating to the Government Vol. 14.

of the Port, were transacted: That indeed one Mr. Jeke, and other Dissenters, formerly did not look upon themselves legally qualified to vote, and act, at these Meetings; and therefore, though they came sometimes to them, being desired, to give their Advice, they always withdrew, as soon as they had given it. It was urged, that the Election of Barons, to serve in Parliament, was not at these Assemblies, but at another Court, called the Hundred Court; and they had used to vote there. It was replied, that the same Persons, that constituted the Court of Assemblies, likewise constituted the Hundred Court; and that, if they had no Right to be Members of the one, they could not be Members of the other, nor consequently to vote there.

That it w as further offered for the Petitioner, that there were Three Ways of making Freemen for this Port; viz. 'Fhe eldest Sons of Freemen, born after their Fathers were free, had a Right at Tw enty-one Years of Age, and might demand their Freedom: Secondly, Every Mayor might make One: Thirdly, Any Person might be made free, with the Consent of the Majority of the Freemen at an Assembly; but the Usage of this Port was, that, if any Person, so put up to be made free, w'as rejected, he could not be put up again in the same Mayoralty.

That several Witnesses were called, to prove this Usage; and no Evidence offered to the contrary, but in the Case of Allen Olive, who was rejected, and made free afterwards in the same Mayoralty: And to that it was replied, that he was made free by the Mayor, as his Freeman.

That then Evidence was given of Four (viz. Wa. Walters, 7 ho.Hills, Thankfull Bishop, and John Young) that

had been rejected the last Year, and were put up again, and made free in the same Mayoralty.

And that these Four, with the Five Dissenters, made Thirteen others (viz. ft'. ChiszceGeo. Bura arth, Morgan Warner, Hen. Parker, Peter Collins, Tho. Thompson, Robert Hounslet, Tho. Greble, John Dad, Wm. Osborne, Eaw. Swaine, Jos. Breads, and Robert Smith) free by the Majority of their Votes; which, it was therefore insisted, were not duly made Freemen.

Robert Swain, another, who voted for the Sitting Members, was also excepted against, as not paying Scot and Lot.

That, on the other Side, it wa offered for the Sitting Members, and in Excuse for the making of Freemen, that were rejected, and others, that they were Men of good Substance: That the Mayor had several times declared his Intention of making more Freemen, and had mentioned to them, that he understood, that the House of Commons designed the increasing the Number of Electors in those Places, where they did not exceed 50; and thereiore thought it a prudent Precaution in them to make the Freemen of this Port at least 50.

That then they proceeded to prove indirect Practices; and Witnesses; viz.

Wm. Osborne, John Hicknal, were called; who said, that the Lord Ashbumham came to Rye, and treated the Freemen about a Month before the Election, and before the Dissolution of the last Parliament: That he then recommended the Petitioner to them, and told them, That would be the Way to have a good Harbour, and to have Convoys, and Protections; in which the Petitioner, being at Court, would be more capable, than another, to serve them: And they said, some of their Neighbours told them afterwards, they had Protections.

That the Counsel further said, they could object to several, that voted for the Petitioner, as having not received the Sacrament; but named none: And said, that he had not proved, any of them were so qualified.

That they supposed, the Committee would not examine into the making of Freemen some Years since, they being in Possession, and not made free upon this Occasion.

That then they withdrew, and the Committee came to the following Resolutions:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Tho. Fagg, Esquire, is duly elected a Baron, to serve in Parliament for the Port of Rye, in the County of Sussex.

Z Resolved,

Anne R.

HER Majesty, having received several Letters from the States General of die United Provinces, as also several Memorials from their Ambassadors, setting forth the great Apprehensions they lie under, from the extraordinary Preparations of France to attack diem early in the Spring, and the Necessity, as they conceived, of making an Augmentation of the Forces of England vaA.Holland, as the only Means to prevent the immediate Ruin, which threatened their Country, was pleased thereupon to propose some Expedient to the States General, which, she hoped, might have been of Advantage to the common Interest, and relieved diem, in some Measure, from their just Apprehensions, without having Recourse to her Parliament: But those Expedients, proposed by her Majesty to the States General, not having produced the Effect she hoped for; and the States having again renewed their Applications to her Majesty, with more Earnestness than before, to assist them, in this Time of their Danger, with an Augmentation cf her Forces, as the only Means to disappoint the Effect of these great and early Preparations, which the French are making against them; her Majesty has commanded the several Letters, and Representations, which have passed between her Majesty and the States General, upon this Subject, to be herewith transmitted to you, that you may the better judge of the Danger which threatens them.

Her Majesty conceives this Matter to be of such great Consequence, as indispensably obliges her to acquaint you with the present State of it, that she may have your Advice upon it; not doubting, but you will take such Measures upon this Occasion, as may be most for the Honour and Advantage of her Majesty, the Safety of her Kingdoms, and die necessary Support of her Allies.

And the said other Papers, relating the reunto, were also read, and are, as follow; viz.

N I. The States General's Letter to the Queen.

Madam,

AS soon as the last Campaign was at an end, and that the Troops were marched into Winter Quarters, we sent Orders to our Ambassadors with your Majesty, to return you Thanks for die considerable Succour of Troops which your Majesty hath sent, and entertained, on this Side the Water, for the Good of the common Cause; to express to your Majesty the Satisfaction we have received in the Prudence and wise Conduct of the Earl of Marlborough, whom you had intrustedwith the Command of them, and who, upon all Occasions, has given Proofs of hi Valour and Zeal for the publick Good, as well as die Troops of their Bravery; and to congratulate your Majesty upon the glorious Success of your Arms. We do not doubt, but our Ambassadors have already performed their Duty herein; but to make appear to your Majesty, more particularly, our Acknowledgment, we have thought it proper to renew our Assurances thereof, and to reiterate our Congratulations, by this letter, and to add thereunto those, which we make with all our Hearts, by reason of the Victory, which die confederate Fleet has obtained at Vigo, whereof.we have since received the News beseeching God to bless more and more your Majesty's sacred Person, and all your just Undertakings. But as we rejoice with your Majesty, upon so happy and glorious a Beginning of a War, into which we are entered with your Majesty, and the other Allies, for maintaining the Liberty of 1 " Eurojye,

Europe, and restoring the publick Tranquillity; we cannot, at the same time, but look forward, and consider of the Means, we think necessary for preserving, and carrying on further, the Advantages, we have gained over the Enemies in the last Campaign, and to communicate our Thoughts to your Majesty, as the strongest Support of the common Cause, and the Protestant Religion, in whom we have an intire Confidence.

Your Majesty will, no doubt, agree with us, that, next to God's Blessing, the good Success, we have had, is chiefly to be attributed to the Superiority in Number of Troops, that we had over the Enemy; from whence it follow eth, that, for maintaining, and improving, the Advantages obtained, and to oblige the Enemy to the Terms of a general, secure, and honourable. Peace, it will be requisite, aliove all Things, to keep up the same Superiority of Forces: Rut, since the French King is resolved to augment considerably his Troops, and that they are now actually about it in France, and that it appears from all Parts, that, the next Year, our Enemies intend to do their utmost Effort, to regain their Loss, and retrieve the Reputation of their Arms; we are persuaded, that voer Majesty, according to your great Prudence, is of the same opinion with us, that it will be absolutely necessary to augment likewise considerably the Forces of the Allies in these Parts; that we may not be in danger ot losing the Glory, and the Advantages, gained in the last Campaign; the ill Consequences whereof are so evident, that we should wrong your Majesty's great Wisdom, if we should relate them more at large: \Vc only beseech your Majesty to reflect seriously upon it, as you are used to do on all things, that concern the publick Good; and, since it is so absolutely necessary, that you will please to increase your Troops on this Side, by a considerable Number, so as that they may be in a Condition to act early in the Field. Your Majesty is very sensible, how much we are already over-charged, even above our Strength; however, if we are encouraged by your Majesty's Example, we shall endeavour to make another Attempt upon ourselves, and People, and to augment likewise our Forces above the Number we have at present; that so, in Conjunction with your Majesty, and the other Allies, we may maintain a Superiority, which is so absolutely necessary, and carry on foe War with so much Vigour, that it may be soon and happily ended; to restore Peace to , and to your

 Majesty's Kingdoms, as well as our State, a sufficient Se-, entity for their Liberty and Religion: And as we may expect all things from your Majesty's renowned Zeal lor the common Cause, we protest, that we will endeavour to concur therein, to the utmost of our Power, and to give on all Occasions, Proofs of our inviolable Adherence to your Majesty's Interest In the mean time we pray God, Madam, that he will fill your Majesty's lteign with Happiness, and bless your royal Person with Health, and along Life.

which your Majesty has been pleased to employ the last Campaign in Favour of the common Cause: Their High and Mightinesses are in like manner obliged to acknowledge your Majesty's great Goodness, in sending the Earl of Marlborough to command; whose Valour, Prudence, and Zeal, they cannot enough extol: The said States General do also congratulate your Majesty, from the Bottom of their Hearts, upon the great and glorious Success of Voi.. 14.

your Arms, and those of your Allies, on that Side the Water; and lastly, for the happy Success of the confederate Fleet at Vigo: But as the great Advantages, which they obtained in the Lon' Countries, ought, next to the Blessing of God, to be attributed chiefly to the Superiority, in Number, of foe Troops, which were employed in those Parts, it will be of foe greatest Importance to preserve those Advantages, and 10 carry them further; which cannot be better done, than in making your Troops complete, that are on that Side the Water, in augmenting them, and having them ready to act early; forasmuch as the Enemy will make a much greater Effort the next Year, than they have done this; since they already begin in France not only to raise their Recruits, but also to increase their Troops; having that for a constant Maxim, to open the Campaign early in the Spring. Wherefore the underwritten Ambassadors, and Envoy extraordinary, beseech, your Majesty will be pleased to complete your Troops in foe Low Countries,to augment the Number of them, and to cause them to be provided with all, that they may want, to act offensively; as dso to give the necessary Oiders, that all these Matters may be done, as soon as is possible.

extremely pleased, that their Successes have turned so much to the Advantage of their High and Mightinesses, in enlarging, and strengthening, their Frontiers: That her Majesty congratulates them also upon this Occasion, as well as for the Part their Fleet, and Troops, have had in the glorious Action at Vigo: That she will take Care, that her Troops in the Law Countries shall be effectually recruited, and provided with alFThings necessary, to the end they may be early in foe Field next Year: That the Measures, touching the Number of her Majesty's Troops, which are to be employed, in Conjunction with those of their High and Mightinesses, in the Low Countries, having been determined in Parliament, before any Men- tion was made of increasing them, that Matter, according to the Rules and i\lethod of their Proceedings, cannot be brought before them again; but that all the Care possible shall be taken, that the rest of her Majesty's Troops, both by Sea and Land, be employed in such manner, as shall appear to be most likely to give the greatest Diversion to the Arms of the Enemy in other Places, and to compass foe End proposed by their High and Mightinesses; and, for this Purpose, her Majesty wishes, that the most proper Means might be concerted between her, and their High and Mightinesses, and that they will please forthwith to instruct some Persons, to regulate the Actions of such Expeditions, as may most annoy foe Enemy, and be of greatest Advantage to the common Cause.

N IV. The Dutch Ambassadors Memorial, the yT of December, 1702.

Madam,

BESIDES what the States General, our Masters, have already acquainted your Majesty with, by their Letters of the 25th of November, and of the 5th of December, and what the Underwritten Ambassadors, and Envoy extraordinary, have proposed to your Majesty by word of mouth, they are still expressly ordered to represent to your Majesty, by this Memorial, how absolutely necessary it is, to preserve, next Year, the same Superiority over the French Troops, as we had the last Campaign, and of what Importance it is, to augment the Number of Troops in the Low Countries; without which it will be impossible to preserve the said Superiority, as well by reason of the Augmentation of Troops in , as

the Diversion made by the Duke of Bavaria, who is entered into the Interest of that Crown; so that the Enemy becoming Masters of the Field, the Places may be lost in as little Time, as they were taken: Wherefore the said Ambassadors, and Envoy extraordinary, leave it to your Majesty, to consider, whether it would not be convenient to fix this Augmentation to 25,000 Men; and most humbly pray, your Majesty will be pleased to condescend thereto.

The said States General, finding themselves, after the Death of the late King of Spain, in very great Danger, and destitute of a sufficient Number of Troops for their Defence, were obliged on a sudden to seek for some (where-ever they could find them) for their Preservation; and, the Want they were in of them being well known, they paid very dear for them; moreover, not being sure of such speedy Assistance from their Allies, as the Condition of their Affairs required, they could not keep just Measures, both as to the Number of Troops, they have newly ' taken into their Pay, and those, they have raised; so that their High and Mightinesses have engaged them-

o o r> o

selves in maintaining a greater Number of Troops, than they did in any of the former Wars: Besides, their Frontiers, having been formerly covered, a great many Years' since, by the Spanish Netherlands, were in an Instant exposed, by the French invading the said Barrier.

Your Majesty will be pleased to consider, that the said States General, in order to put their Frontiers in a reasonable State of Defence, have been put to very great Charges; which happening all at once, their Provinces have been, and are still, extremely burdened therewith; without mentioning the Losses sustained by their Subjects, as well by great Inundations, as the Encamping of their own Troops, and those of the Enemy; whereby Part of their said Subjects, and even of the Provinces, have been ruined. That, for these Reasons, although it be almost impossible to burthen the said Provinces more, than they are; nevertheless, their High and Mightinesses, to shew their Zeal for the common Cause, and considering, how necessary it is, to be superiour in Troops, and what Advantages may be thereby reasonably expected, especially if, by Means of a vigorous War, and a Second happy Campaign, they may hope to come to a good and lasting Peace, and that thereby the Charges will be saved, which will be occasioned by a longer War, they will endeavour to make their last Effort, in case your Majesty will be pleased to consent to the said Augmentation, by bearing a Proportion of the said 25,000 Men; in Hopes, nevertheless, that your Majesty will be pleased to take their overburdened Condition into your Consideration.

N V. Translation of the Answer to the Memorial of

the Ambassadors of the States General, 3d December

1702.

THE Queen, having seen and considered your Excellencies Memorial, dated the first of this Month, has ordered the following Answer to be given to it: That her Majesty has no other Intention, but to do all, that lies in

her Power, to support the Interests of the States General, which she shall always look upon as her own; and though by the Forms of Parliament, we cannot hope for any Effect, by proposing to them, to raise new Levies for the Service of the Low Countries, without a Prorogation, which would entirely defeat all, that has been already done, and would be of irreparable Mischief; yet her Majesty has thought of such other Methods, as may effectually support them, or plainly shew, that nothing, on her Part, shall be wanting, to assure them of her true Concern for their Welfare and Happinessr In order to this, her Majesty being assured of the Concurrence of her Parliament to support her in any new Alliances, which she shall make, for the Interest of her, and her Allies, she earnestly desires the States to concur with her immediately, in sending Ministers to the King of Sweden, to induce him to a Peace; in which Case her Majesty will, jointly with them, take into Pay 12,000 Swedes, and 8,000 Saxons; and considering the present Circumstances of the King of Sweden, her Majesty hopes, this Negociation may be finished so soon, as that the said Troops may be in Holland, as soon as will be necessary for the next Campaign.

The next Thing her Majesty proposes, is, to endeavour, by all Means, to bring over the Elector of Bavaria, by an amicable Accommodation; and, in order to it, to persuade the Emperor to gratify him in those Things, that, are likely to give him Satisfaction: And her Majesty is willing, in Conjunction with her Allies, to contribute such Subsidies, as may enable that Duke to maintain his Troops in the Service of the Allies, and thereby give such a Diversion to France, as may effectually disappoint their Designs against the States.

And further, since the Success of such Negociations is uncertain, as also that with Portugal, tho' her Majesty has Reason to hope, it is in a fair Way of being happily concluded, bsr Majesty does earnestly desire the States General to join, with all possible Expedition, such a Number of their Ships to those of her Majesty's, as that a Detachment may be sent to the Mediterranean; her Majesty being inclined to embark, on board her Ships, all the Troops she can spare from England, which, together with some of the States General's, may make such Attempts, as shall be agreed upon, to be most likely to give the greatest Diversion to France, and most effectually prevent their Superiority in the Low Countries.

And, if there be any other Expedient, which may occur to the States, and that is practicable for her Majesty to join in, she will gladly receive it, being resolved to omit nothing, that can contribute to their Safety and Satisfaction.

N VI. The States Generals Letter to the Queen, the 5th December, 1702.

Madam,

BY the Memorial, that Mr. Stanhope, your Majesty's Envoy extraordinary, has presented to us Today, we have seen with Pleasure, that the Marks of our Acknowledgement, and the Congratulations, that our Ambassadors have made your Majesty in our Name, on Account of the Supplies sent us by your Majesty, and of the glorious Success of your Majesty's Arms by Sea and Land, have not been unacceptable; and we pray, your Majesty would be entirely assured of the Sincerity of our Minds, and Respects, towards your Majesty, insomuch that we shall never forget the Proofs, that we have received of your Majesty's good Inclinations to our Republick, and that we shall always interest ourselves in every thing, that may increase the Glory, Advantage, or Content, of your Majesty. We also thank you, Madam, with all our Heart, that you have been pleased so readily to consider our Instances, in relation to the Recruits of your Majesty's Forces on this Side of the Water; but, as we understand by the said Memorial, that, as to the Augmentation of the said Troops, that Matter would meet with some Difficulties, it having been already settled by the Parliament,

Ve most humbly pray, your Majesty will give us Leave, besides the Representations our Ambassadors having already made, and besides what we have had the Honour to mention to your Majesty, in our Letter of the 26th of the last Month, to take the Liberty, as an Effect of our Zeal for the publick Good, to repeat again our former In stances on that Subject, and to lay before your Majesty the Danger there will be if the Troops are not considerably augmented, which are to be employed the next Campaign in these Parts. It is certain, Madam, that France and Spain are stung to the Quick, by the Losses they have suffered this Year, by the Arms of your Majesty, and those of your Allies; it is likewise certain, that they are preparing to make extraordinary Endeavours to repair that, which they have lost this Year; and to that Purpose, France is very busy, at this present, in augmenting very considerably the Numbers of its Troops, with Intention to come into the Field, in Flanders, with much more numerous Armies, than they have had there heretofore: 'Which being certain, and visible, on all Hands, as well as by Advices from all Parts, it is evident, that, in case the high Allies do not likewise augment the number of their Troops, they will not be able, with those they had the last Campaign, to maintain the Superiority in Number, which, by the Blessing of God, has given us the Advantages, for which we rejoice at this Hour; and that thereby we shall be in danger to lose the Advantages, and much more too, so far are we from being to improve them, in order to the putting a speedy and good End to the present War, The Consequences seem to us so inevitable, and at the same time of so great Weight, and Danger, that we could not, satisfy ourselves, without representing them once again to your Majesty, since you are pleased to honour us with your Friendship, and that we profess ourselves to be your most faithful Allies. We are ingaged in oue common Cause; we have entered into the War together, for the Maintenance of the Religion and Liberty of both Nations, and for the Re-establishment of a farm Peace throughout Europe; it is equally our Interest, that the War should not be prolonged, but that it should be made with Vigour, that so we may expect a speedy and happy Issue of it: We have to do with a powerful and formidable Enemy; we cannot be ignorant, that he is preparing to do the utmost, that possibly he can; that he is strengthened by the Elector of Bavaria, and that thereby he will be stronger the next Year, than he has ever hitherto been; it is therefore undoubtedly prudent, and necessary, that the Allies should do something more, than they have yet done, if they have not a mind to lose their Superiority in Number, which is so requisite, and to give Opportunity to the Enemy to triumph in their turn. We beg your Majesty, with all possible Earnestness, to give a fresh Attention to this Matter, seeing the Importance of it so much requires, that it should be considered more than once; and, though the Parliament has already resolved upon the Number of Troops, the Business being of such great Consequence, as it is, we do not doubt, but they will take it into their Consideration anew; and that, seeing the pressing Necessity, your Majesty, w'ith your Parliament, will resolve to augment your Forces on this Side the Water, according to the Exigency of the present Conjuncture. It is w hat we once more most passionately desire, being persuaded; that it i3 absolutely necessary for the putting a more speedy and happy End to the War, we are jointly engaged in; and although our State be charged with more, than it can bear, as we can make evidently appear; nevertheless, being persuaded, that [it] is better running, than walking slowly, through the Fire; if your Majesty would be pleased to resolve to make an Augmentation of your Forces here, we will endeavour to animate ourselves, and our People, to do something extraordinary, and even beyond our Strength, to make an Augmentation on our Side; that we may so much the sooner come with Honour and Safety out of this present War, trusting, that God, of his infinite Goodness, will bless our just Designs. We most heartily pray him, Madam, to fill your Majesty's Reign with Happiness, and to bless your royal Voi. 14.

N® VII. The Queen's Letter to the States General, 4® Decetnber, 1702.

High and mighty Lords, our good Friends, Allies, and Confederates,

WE have received, with much Satisfaction, the Two Letters, you have been pleased to write us, of the 26th past, and 5th instant, finding therein acceptable Assurances of the Pleasure you receive, by our Adherence to, and Zeal for, the common Cause, by the Success of our Arms, and the Conduct of our General, which Things we are both alike concerned in; and therefore we have Reason to congratulate you, on our Side, for them, as we most sincerely do: And whereas we desire nothing more earnestly, than to do all, that lies in our Power, to support your Interests, which we shall always look upon as our own, we wish, the Augmentation of our Forces, which you desire, could be made the next Year: but the Parliament having settled the Number of our Troops, and the necessary Funds for their Entertainment, we must acquaint you, that, by the Forms of that Assembly, no Good can be expected, in proposing to them to raise new Forces, without coming to a Prorogation; which would utterly destroy all, that is already done, and would occasion an irreparable Mischief. To avoid that Evil, we have turned our Thoughts to other Means, wdiich, we believe, may be as Advantageous to you, or at least convince you, that nothing shall be wanting on our Part, to assure you of the real Care we take of whatsoever may contribute to your Safety and Happiness; and as we are assured of the Concurrence of our Parliament to the Maintenance of the Alliances, we shall think fit to make, for our Interest, and that of our Allies, so we desire, you will please to concur with us, in sending Ministers, without loss of Time, to the King of Sweden, to induce him to make Peace with the King of; and, if our Endeavours have the Success, we desire, we will take, in Conjunction with you, into our Pay, 12,000 Swedes, and 8,000 Saxons; and we hope, that this Negociation maybe perfected in so good Time, that thoseTroops may be early enough in Holland, to be employed there the next Campaign: And, believing, it would be more for the [Benefit, of the] common Cause, if the Elector of Bavaria could be reduced by fair Means, rather than by Force, we shall be ready, not only to join our good Offices with yours, to persuade the Emperor to give nim all reasonable Satisfaction, but also to contribute, in concert with our Allies, towards such Subsidies, as may be necessary to put that Duke in a Condition to maintain his Troops in the Service of the Allies; to the end that, by that Means France may not only be deprived of the Assistance, it expected from him, but likewise, that they may be employed to break its Designs against your State. But the Success of all Negocia-tions is uncertain, and that it is requisite, at the same Time, to make use of all Means, to do the utmost Damage, that may be, to the Enemy, we desire, you will join, with as much Expedition, as is possible, a Number of your Ships to some of ours, in order to send speedily a Detachment into the Mediterranean, which may make such Attempts there, as may give a considerable Diversion to France, and at the same [time] afford great Encouragement to our Allies: And if there is any thing else, that may tend to the Advancement of our Common Interests, which you can think of, and wherein our Con currence is necessary, we shall not fail to give you, on all Occasions, manifest Proofs of the Sincerity of our Friendship, and of our Intentions to contribute, whatever is in our Power, to your Safety and Satisfaction.

N VIII. Translation of the States Letter to her Majesty, 20 December, 1702.

Madam,

AMONGST the Maries, that we have received, from time to time, of your Majesty's most valuable good Will, we reckon the Honour, that you have been pleased to do us, by a speedy Answer to our Letter, concerning the augmenting, the Forces, which we took the Liberty to propose to your Majesty, only in Consideration of the plibljck Good. We find ourselves obliged, Madam, very humbly to thank you, for the serious Attention you have given to our well-meant Representations upon this Subject, as well as for the repeated and favourable Testimonies, that you have given of your constant Inclinations for the Support and Welfare of our State; which we shall endeavour to preserve, by an inviolable Adherence to all your Ihterests; which we pray your Majesty to be entirely convinced of As to the Business in Agitation, we very Well understand, that it would be too great a Damage and Prejudice to the Affairs of your Majesty, and those of the common CauSe, if, in order to lay the Affair of Augmentation of Troops before the Parliament, it is necessary to come to a Prorogation, whereby all, that has been done already in this Assembly, must be annulled; which we should not desire: But we hope, that some Expedient may be found, to introduce this Point into the Deliberation of the Parliament, without falling into this great Inconvenience; and 'if'this be any way to be done, which we must leave to your Majesty's great Wisdom, we would pray you, Madam, still to think of it, and to chuse that Method, which, you shall find, will best answer this End. Nevertheless, we have seriously considered of the Means, that it has pleased your Majesty to propose, for the Augmentation of Troops, which we have desired; an Agreement between the Kings of and Poland, in

order afterwards to treat with them for a good Number of their Troops, and a Negociation with the Elector of Bavaria, to bring him over by gentle Means to the right Side, that we may make use of his Troops against the common Enemy. We cannot deny, but that both these Methods might be of great Advantage, and we are ready to employ, together with your Majesty, all our good Offices, and all possible Endeavours, to these Purposes, since we look upon it as a very considerable Advantage, if wC could in this Manner obtain a good Number of Troops; "but ycWr Majesty yourself looking upon the Event of the Negociations, as very uncertain, we judge the same of them, and we consider them, as these Sort of Affairs Should be, which are more to be wished for, than likely to succeed': In all Cases we foresee, that a great deal of Time will be lost, before such an Agreement can be made; and that the Succour, that may be expected from thence, cannot come time enough to secure us against the Storm, we are thfeatehed with: As to the sending a Detachment towards the Mediterranean, we also apprehend, that this Method will not be effectual enough; nevertheless, we are resolved to send our Lieutenant-admiral, monde, to concert Measures, in relation to it, with your Majesty's Ministers, and upon other Sea Expeditions for the next Year. But, since you have been pleased to give us Leave to propose someother Method, we take the Liberty to desire your Majesty to settle some certain Fund with your Parliament, for making an Augmentation of Troops, which we may negociate either with Sweden, Poland, or Bavaria, or with other Princes, where we may get them most readily and advantageously. We do not doubt, but we may obtain them this Way; and your Majesty shall find us ready to concur with you herein, with all Equity, although we are already charged beyond what we can bear. Your Majesty will reflect, according to your great Prudence, that the Winter will be soon gone; and therefore we ought not to lose a Moment's time. And here we must repeat, what we have said before, that we have certain Intelligence, which is confirmed every Day, that our Enemies make exceeding and very extraordinary Preparations for the next Campaign, and that France is resolved to make its utmost Effort next Year; so that we cannot help

being under the Apprehensions, that we are, from thence; for we foresee, and hold it for certain, that, if the English Allies do not carry into the Field a more numerous Army, than they had this Year, and early too, that our State, and the common Cause, will, by the Enemy's Force, receive such a terrible Blow, as afterwards they shall not be able to repair at double the Charge, for which they may, by God's Blessing, prevent it, if they make use of sufficient Means in time. For these Reasons we intreat your Majesty to consider this so necessary an Augmentation, as earnestly recommended by us; to the end that it may have its Effect, by the most speedy Method. We have charged our Ambassadors to explain our Thoughts more fully; to which we refer ourselves; and pray to God, Madam, to preserve your Majesty's royal Person in perfect Health, and in a long and happy Life.

N" IX. Translation of the Memorial of the Ambassadors, and Envoy extraordinary, of the States General, the -rijr January, 170-J-.

Madam,

THE underwritten Ambassadors, and Envoy extraordinary, of the States General of the United Provinces, are ordered by their Masters to accompany the Letter, which they have had the Honour to deliver to your Majesty, with this Memorial, and to represent to your Majesty, that their High and Mightinesses perceive by the Answer, your Majesty has been pleased to order to be given to them, that you are of the same Opinion with them, about the Necessity of an Augmentation of Troops, your Majesty proposing to take a good Number of them into the Service; but they are afraid, lest, according to those Proposals, none should be got so speedily, as Necessity requires, since they cannot but expect to have to do with a formidable Army of the Enemy, who will act in the Spring: That, on the other hand, the Design of taking Troops from the Kings of Sweden and Poland, as also of bringing over the Elector of Bavaria to the good Cause, seems both very uncertain, and remote, to their High and Mightinesses, notwithstanding the earnest Desire they have to see the same accomplished: That, as to Sweden and Poland, the Affairs of those Two Kings seem still so much embroiled, and their Minds so irritated, that there is no Reason to hope for a speedy Accommodation: It would take up much Time, before one could enter upon a Negociation, which might be drawn out in Length; and although it should be happily concluded, the King of Sweden, who might still be at War with the Czar of covy, could not, on a sudden, part with a Number of his Troops; and the King of Poland having given 8,000 Men of his to the Emperor, it is much to be doubted, whether he could spare any to the Confederates. Besides these Obstacles, the negociating of Troops cannot but go on slowly, by the Distance of Places; and it would require much Time, before Recruits could be made, and that those Troops could arrive in the Low Countries; and therefore, in all appearance, they would be very little serviceable, during all the next Campaign.

As to the Elector of Bavaria, their High and Mightinesses would look upon it as a very desireable Thing, if, by some amicable Way, he could be brought off from the Interest of France, and induced to employ his Troops for the Good of the common Cause; but their High and Mightinesses, considering the said Elector's Conduct of late, are very much afraid, it cannot be done, but by more effectual Means; for which Reason, they think, his Imperial Majesty must be induced to use all possible Ways, to withdraw the Elector of Bavaria from the Engagements with France, and, if possible, to bring him over to the Interest of the Confederates; and that no Time is to be lost in performing the same. The Statoe General, before they received your Majesty's Letter, had already sent Orders to

their

l Ann. . 4°r-5° J

their Minister at Vienna, to act in Concert, in this Matter, with your Majesty's Minister there; but as these Means, which have been proposed, are both uncertain and remote, and that there is a pressing Necessity, the Underwritten humbly pray, your Majesty will take, without any Loss of Time, a good Resolution about this Augmentation, which is so necessary; and, in order to it, that your Majesty will be pleased, with your Parliament, to provide a Fund for that Purpose; so as that Care may be taken afterwards, to look out for Troops in Sweden, Poland, and Bavaria, in case there be a Likelihood of getting them there in a convenient Time; and, if it be impossible to get them so soon, as the Necessity of this present Conjuncture requires, that one might treat somewhere else for other Troops. Their High and Mightinesses doubt not, but a good Number may be found in JVolfenbuttle, Hesse,

A funster, and with other Princes of the Empire, with whom one might treat forthwith, and, by Provision, take their Troops, without any Prejudice to the Negociations, that may be entered into with Sweden, Poland, and the Elector of Bavaria; which nevertheless might be carried on with Vigour, and, in case of Success, there will be Means enough of employing those Troops, without their being very chargeable, those in actual Service diminishing daily.

The underwritten Ambassadors, and Envoy extraordinary, are ordered, most humbly to represent to your Majesty, in the most pressing Terms, the Necessity of the aforesaid Augmentation; and that England, and their States, being engaged in a common War, the good or bad Success thereof will occasion the Safety or Loss of both Nations: That it is for that Reason, that the Alliances mention, that the one shall assist the other with all their Forces: That, as the Seat of War is chiefly on the Frontier of the Republick, their High and Mightinesses fear, lest, notwithstanding all their Endeavours, they should not be able to make Head against the Enemy's Power, without a greater Assistance from your Majesty; they having received fresh Advices, that France is assembling all the Troops they can, to make a last Effort next Year, and to venture all, in order to overthrow the said Republick. For preventing such a Misfortune, and the evil Designs of the Enemy, the Underwritten are obliged once more to repeat to your Majesty the absolute Necessity of such an Augmentation; and therefore their High and Mightinesses hope, your Majesty will, on this Occasion, forthwith take a vigorous Resolution, that, for want of a sufficient and speedy [Assistance], the Republick may not receive an irreparable Loss to herself, and the common Cause. Done at Westminster, the January, 1704.

It appeared to foe Committee, that the Sum of 100l. arising by the First Act of Parliament, had been received by Mr. Weedon, and demanded by the said Sir John Thornier of I, and Air. Bridges; but Mr. Weedon insisted to retain the said 100l. towards reimbursing him what he had expended, in defraying the Costs and Charges for making the said new Way, and Passage, over and above the Produce of the last Act of Parliament.

Also the Inhabitants, and Proprietors, of the Houses, next adjoining to those, that were pulled down, who are reported to have sustained Damages, by reason thereof, to the Amount of 455/. and were likewise to be paid out of the Monies, arising by the supplemental Act, declared, that they have not received any Part of the said Sum.

That, by the said Acts,several Persons, therein named, are appointed Commissioners, for the Management thereof; but it appeared to the Committee, that the said Mr. Weedon has chiefly acted in that Affair.

It also appeared to the Committee, that one of the Collectors of the said Duties is insolvent, and hath not answered the Monies by him collected, but is gone off with 40/. and his Security proving also insolvent, that Money is likely to be lost

That the Account of the Charges, which Mr. Weedon has delivered in to the Committee, for collecting the said Duties, and other Charges in the Management of these Acts, seem to be extraordinary, there being near one half of the Profits, arising by the Cars, Carts, Tumbrels, and Drays, deducted for collecting and managing the same.

So that, upon the whole Matter, the Committee do humbly conceive, that, if a Slop be not put to the Proceedings in the Management of the Duties, arising by the

Resolved, That the Bill do pass; and that thd Title be, An Act for making the River Darwent, in the County of Derby, navigable.

Ordered, That Mr. Harpur do carry the Bill to the Lords, and desire their Concurrence thereunto

Ordered, That the Members, who managed the last Conference with the Lords, upon 'the Bill, intituled, An Act for preventing occasional Conformity, do manage the Conference to be this Day with the Lords.

And the Managers went to the Conference:

And being returned;

Mr. Bromley reported, that they had met the Lords at the Conference; and that the Lords do insist upon all their Amendments to the Bill, which this House hath disagreed unto; for which they gave their Reasons; and that to the Amendments, which this House made to one of the Amendments, made by the Lords, the Lords do agree to those Amendments, with an Amendment, to which they desire the Concurrence of this House.

Which Reasons, and Amendment, are, as follow; viz. THE Lords insist on the Second and Third Amendment in the Preamble of the Bill.

Because the Words, left out by this Amendment, are introductive to the Clause, left out by their Lordships in Vox.. 14.

the 5th Amendment: Besides, as the Law now stands there are many Offices and Employments, to which Persons may be admitted, without being under an Obligation to receive the Sacrament on that Account; and therefore they cannot agree to let a Clause stand, wherein a Matter of Fact is positively affirmed, which they take to be otherwise.

The Lords insist on the 4th Amendment, because it depends on the former.

The Lords insist on their 5th Amendment;

Because the Act of the 25th of King Charles the 2d, called The Test Act, which has been found, by Experience, to have been an effectual Security against Popery, and which their Lordships are willing to enforce yet further by this Bill, as to the Dissenters, is known to every body, and it is generally understood, to what Employments it does extend; and therefore their Lordships think it reasonable to rest there, and not to subject Men to the Penalties of this Bill, upon general or uncertain Words.

2dly, The Lords do not go about to take away the Force of the Corporation Act, or to lessen any Security the Church of England has by it; but cannot agree to extend the Penalties of this Bill to the general Words of that Act, which, by Construction hereafter, may serve' Purposes, which are not owned, at present, to be the Intent of this Bill.

The Lords insist on their 8th Amendment, which relates to the Punishments, as they stood, when the Bill was sent up from the House of Commons.

Whatever Regard their Lordships may have to Reasons, which the House of Commons are resolved never to depart from, they hope, it will not seem strange, that they are not convinced by such Reasons, as are not thought fit to be offered. But, in Justification of their Amendment, their Lordships think fit to say, that, as they have an undoubted Right to begin Bills with pecuniary Penalties, and to alter and distribute pecuniary Penalties in Bills, sent up to them by the House of Commons (which Right their Ancestors have always enjoyed, and from which their Lordships can never depart) so they are convinced, there never was a more just Occasion of making use of that Right, than in the present Case.

2dly, They conceive the Penalty of 100l. and 5/. a Day for every Day after the Offence committed, to be excessive; and the Whole being given to the Informer, would prove a dangerous Temptation to Perjury, and of pernicious Encouragement to Informers (the most odious Sort of Persons) which would be a Blemish on the best Reign.

Their Lordships have given a sufficient Proof of their Willingness to make this Bill as effectual, as will consist with Reason, by agreeing to such a pecuniary Penalty (besides the Loss of Office) as maybe a proper Encouragement to Informers to swear the Truth, though not perhaps a sufficient Temptation to go farther.

As to the gth Amendment;

The Commons say, they disagree, because they think Incapacity a proper Punishment for this Offence. The Lords insist upon their Amendment, because they think directly the contrary.

idly, Their Lordships observe, that, as the Law now stands, any Person, having an Office, may be present at Mass, upon much easier Terms, than he might be present at a Conventicle, if the Lords should depart from this Amendment

3dly, The Lords think, an Englishmen cannot be reduced to a more unhappy Condition, than to be put by Law, under an Incapacity of serving his Prince and Country; and therefore nothing, but a Crime of the most detestable Nature, ought to put him under such a Disability. They, who think the being present at a Meeting to be so high a Crime, can hardly think, that a Toleration of such Meetings ought to continue long; and yet the Bill says, the Act of Toleration ought to be kept inviolable.

The Lords do not think it at all necessary, to make an Increase of Punishment for a Second Offence; because the

plaining of an undue Election and Return of Haskenstilcs, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Sudbury, in the County of Suffolk:

That the Right of Election w'as agreed to be in the Freemen, not receiving Alms.

That a Copy of the Poll was produced; whereby it appeared, that the Sitting Member had a Majority of the Petitioner, by 15; to 32 of which it was, on his Part, objected, that they were not duly qualified to vote, because of their receiving Alms, or Nonage, or polling twice, or because they were not Freemen.

That then they delivered in a List of 35, who, they insisted, were good Votes, and had been refused to be polled for the Petitioner.

Upon which a Question arising, as to the Admission of those to their Freedom, who had a Right to demand it, Evidence was heard on both Sides, to that Point; and the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That the Sons of Freemen, born after their Fathers were made free, and those that have served Apprenticeships in the Borough of Sudbury, in the County of Suffolk, have a Right to vote in the Election of Members, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough, without any Admission, in Form, to their Freedom, or taking the Oath of Freemen.

That, after this, they went through the List: They gave Evidence to the Freedom [a] of most in it, and waved the rest.

That the Evidence given by the Petitioner, as to the Partiality of the Mayor and Town-clerk, and the Bribery, and other ill Practices, of the Sitting Member, and his Agents, was, as follows:

Mr. Hull said, that the Mayor declared, that no Mart should have a Vote, whose Name was not inrolled according to a late Order, he had obtained from the Corporation, to oblige all Freemen to inrol themselves; and, for want of Inrolment, the Mayor refused several, that had voted 30 Years; and that several, for Mr.

his Friends; and that it was generally enquired, who the Voters were for, before the' Inrohnent was searched, whether they were free.

William Belgrove said, he offered himself four times to poll for Mr. Dash wood singly; and the Mayor struck him, and bid the Constable and Serjeants carry him to Gaol.

Robert Soul said, he was allowed by the Mayor, as an Inspector for Mr. Dashxcood; yet the Mayor abused him, and took him by the Hair, because he spoke against John Smith's polling, who was not free.

Andrew Fletcher said, that Tho. Foster offered to vote for Mr. Dashxcood two or three times; and insisting on his Right, the Mayor said in the Court publickly, Right or wrong, he should not poll: Sir Cordell also swore, he should not poll.

Edward Bowtell said, that he offered to poll singly for

Mr. Dashxcood i and that he was struck and abused in

Court.

Dauel Bantock said, he offered to poll for Mr. Dash-wood, a'o the Mayor would not let him, because he was an Apprentice. He did not deny his being an Apprentice; but said, he was born free, and was 23 Years of Age.

John Till said, that he was present at the Poll, but not a Freeman; and saw a Man (whose Name he did not remember) offer to poll for Mr. Dashxcood, whom the Mayor refused; and the Man insisting on his Right, the Mayor (at Sir John Cordell's Desire) threatened to send him to Gaol, and afterwards polled him for the Two Sitting Members.

John Gosling, Henry Golding, Thom. Elden, Robert

Golding, of London, Barber, had been Agents, in the procuring several Votes for Mr. at this

Henry So>nersettsaid, he received 20$. of Samuel Golding, in London, to go down, and vote for Mr. Haskenstiles: That he gave Golding a Note for the Money; but Golding promised him, if he polled for Mr. Haskenstiles, it should be destroyed; otherwise, he was told, he must repay the Money; That he did poll for Mr. Haskenstiles, and the Note was tore; and afterwards he received 5 s. more of one Darby, that lived at Sir Jo. Cordell's.

Robert Golding confirmed Henry Somerset's Evidence; and that William Woodward and Tho. Webb received 205. a-piece on the same Condition; and that, the Wednesday following, about 12 Freemen received 5 s. a-piece, at Sir John Cordell's House, from Samuel Golding.

Tho. Webb confirmed Robert Golding's Evidence, as to himself; and said, he would have been for Mr. Dash-wood, but he could not get any Money of Mr. Cole.

Sam. Jones said, that one Smith went round the Town, and gave 3 s. a-piece to 2 or 300 Freemen; but he could

not say, he spoke to them about the Election; only he had a List of their Names, and, as he paid them, cros-ed them out. It was observed, that Smith had not been proved an Agent for Mr. Ilaskcnstyles.

He further said, that Sir John Cordell asked him to be a Witness against Mr. Dashwood, but did not say, to what; and told him, he would pay a Debt of 10/. which he owed to Mr. Cole's Client; and that Mr. Ray, the Steward, told him, that he would put him out of the Parish Rate, if ho would come up with him; which, he understood, was to be a Witness against Mr. Dashwood: That Two Guineas were offered to Robert Olive, to be a Witness for Mr. Haskenstiles; but it was not mentioned, to what; and Olive said, he could say nothing.

That the Counsel for Mr. Haskenstiles recriminated, and called several Witnesses; viz.

Mr. John Pen; who said, that Mr. Dashwood and Mr. Cole came to his House, about the 18th of May, and

desired his Vote; and that Mr. Penn answering, they had Two good Members already, Mr. Dashwood replied, if they would ebuse him, he would give 200l. towards making the River navigable, and 200l. more for a Work-house: That Mr. Perm proposed it to him, to pay the Money down; and Mr. Dashwood said, he did not know, but he might, before he was 24 Hours older: That Daniel Haste was by, when it was said; and being examined, confirmed the same.

Mr. Tho. Paris said, that, upon the 18th of May, as he remembered, his Brother told him, that Mr. Dashwood had given him a Bill for 200l. drawn upon Mr. Hayes, payable within Ten Days; and that the Money was to be kept, till the Election was over, and then was to be applied towards making the River navigable: That he knew Mr. Dashxcood'sHand, and is confident, it was

signed by him; and that he carried the Bill to Mr. Hayed Chamber; where he saw Mr. Dashwood, and was told, he might come Three or Four Days after for the Money; but he returned the Bill to his Brother.

Robert Gurling said, that, in May last, Mr. Dashzooood

and Mr. Cole came to his House, and Mr. Dash-wood asked him, if he had heard the Parliament was come home [a]; and desired his Vote and Interest: That he told Mr Dashwood,he thought, it would be to no Purpose

for him to stand; for Work was scarce, and poor People would not be against them that employed them; and thereupon Mr. Dashwood said, that he would give such a Gift among the poorer Sort, as should oblige them, and he would oblige the rest, by giving 200 more towards making the River navigable; and offered to pay down the Money into his Hands; but he recommended him to Mr. Paris; and Mr. Cole said, if they questioned the

Money, he would give his Note for it: That Mr. Dush-woodfurther said, “ The Town is poor, and let us make “ the best of it: And Gurling objecting, this would be Bribery, Mr. Dashwood replied, if he got into the House, let them get him out, if they could.

Upon the Petition of Henry Manaton, Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of the Lord James Russell, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Tavistock, in the County of Devon:

[a] Sic. Orig.

Vol. 14.

For the Petitioner:

Samuel Carter, who had known Tavistock 60 Years, and had been at all Elections since 1660; who said, that the Presentment by the Jury was not a Question, till the last controverted Election, about 6 or 7 Years since: That he voted, before he was presented; and, when he has been of the Jury of Enquiry, he did not make any such Presentment

James Cowper said, he had been at the Elections for 15 Years; and that, in the Year 1688, there was a great Contest, and a Scrutiny: and all the Votes were strictly examined, and the Copies of Wills and Deeds were produced; and no Objection made to any Person, that had not been presented; nor was it an Objection, till the last Resolution of the House. He said, the Jury had been partial to the Duke of Bedford's Interest; and gave some Instances of it.

Dan. Mattacol said, he had known Tavistock 14 or 15 Years; and that the Right of Election was in the Freeholders of Inheritance, living within the Borough; but it weis never reckoned necessary, to have them presented, till the last Resolution of this House; and that at the last Court he carried in, to the Jury, the Names of 12 or 13 Freeholders, who were ready, either at the Door, or in the Court, with their Deeds, to make out their Freeholds; but the Jury refused to present them; and Cunningham and Spry said, “ Why should they alienate those “ Fellows? They did not think them for their Turn.” But Mattacol acknowledged, that several were presented, the last Court, who voted for Mr. Manaton.

Zac. Rowell said, that, sifter he came home from the hearing of Mr. Manaton's Election, about 6 Years sigo,

Mr. Cunningham asked him, “ What will become of your “ Alienations?” And the Stewrnd said, he-would alienate none, but who were for them: That three, who were of the Jury at that Time, declared they would alienate none, that were for Mr. Manaton;and those three, he thinks, have been constantly of the Jury since that Time. He owned; that the Jury consisted of 24; and, that they were some of the most sufficient Men of the Town.

That the Petitioner's Counsel urged several Resolutions of the House in Favour of their Right; vis.

17 Dec. 13 Car. II. when the House agreed with the Committee, That the Freeholders of Inheritance only had Voices.

8# Dec. 3 Gul. et Mar. when it was reported, that it appeared to the Committee, That the Right of Election was in the Freeholders of Inheritance, inhabiting within the Borough.

13° Mar. 8® Gut. when 'twas resolved, That the Right of Election is in the Freeholdeis of Inheritance, inhabiting within the Borough.

To answer which Evidence, the Sitting Members Counsel called several Witnesses.

Mr. Cunningham said, he had known Tavistock 50 Years, and his Father and himself had been Portreeves; and that the Freeholders of Inheritance, living within the Borough, ought to be presented by the Jury; and so he has heard his Father say; and they were CEdled the Abbot's Burgesses: That the jury is returned by the Bailiff, who is upon his Oath; and that the Steward gives strict Charge,

H h to

to present all Persons, that have a Right; and that, as far as he has observed, all Persons Titles have been presented, unless there was a very good Objection against them; as, particularly, upon the splitting of Votes; so that sometimes 40 s.a Year has been split, to make Half a dozen Votes. He said, as to the 12 or 13, mentioned by Mat taco/,there was only a Note given of their Names;

but they never presented themselves to the Jury, nor produced their Deeds. He said, he could not remember any formerly refused to vote, for not having been presented; but they did not reckon their Estates very good, till they were presented.

Wa.Shellihurn said, that he had known Tavistock 20 Years; and gave Evidence to the like Effect with Mr. Cunningham.

H'iHiam Spry said, he had known Tavistock 32 Years; and that himself, and one , were presented 20

Years ago; and he had heard old Men say, that those Persons, that claimed Lands, by Descent, or Purchase, ought to be presented; and that he thinks, the Jury present all Persons impartially.

That then the Resolution of this House, 4 Feb. 8 Gul. was produced; That the Right of Election is in the Freeholders of Inheritance, in Possession, inhabiting within the Borough, who have been, or shall be presented, as such, by the Jury of Enquiry of the Borough.

Upon which, the Committee came to this Resolution: Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of electing Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Tavistock, in the County of Devon, is in the Freeholders of Inheritance, in Possession, inhabiting within the Borough, who have been, or shall be, presented, as such, by the Jury of Enquiry of the Borough.

That the Petitioners Counsel then proceeded to give Evidence, to set aside several of the Lord James s

Votes; and called several Witnesses; who said, that Hockaday, David Serjeant, Elias Geo.

Rich. Farewell, William Knight, Ralph Carter, gesse, Tho. Kelly, and Ed. W had no Votes; one of them being non compos, and the others having no Freehold of Inheritance; and besides, that the two last had Money given them, for their Votes, by the Duke of Bedford's Bailiffs; one 51, the other 6 /.

That the Petitioners Counsel would have gone on to give Evidence of some Persons, who had Freehold Estates, and had not been presented by the Jury of Enquiry, though they tendered themselves; but this was opposed, because of the Resolution of the Committee; and not being allowed, thdy offered nothing further.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Member only called Witnesses to the Reputation of who had given

Evidence to the 51, mentioned before.

Mr. Cunningham, John Edgccmbe, said, that Daniel

Mattacol had been charged with the stealing of Cloth from his Master, when he was an Apprentice; and had been prevailed on by his Friends to go to Virginia.

And then they withdrew, and the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Lord James Russell is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Tavistock, in the County of Devon.

The First Resolution being read a Second time;

And the Titles of the said Answers were read.

And the said Answers were read, and are, as follow'; viz.

The Answer to the said Observations.

To the honourable the Commons, in Parliament assembled:

WITH all due Acknowledgmerit to this honourable House, for the Favour of being allowed to answer the Observations of the Commissioners of Accounts, on the Revenue under our Management, we the Commissioners of her Majesty's Customs, whose N ames are hereunto subscribed, humbly crave Leave, for the clearer Satisfaction of the House in every Article, to offer what we have to say in our Defence, Paragraph by Paragraph.

First Observation:

As to the Constitution and Management of her Majesty's Revenue of the Customs, your Commissioners observe, that, tho' the Cash Account of the Customs is yearly passed, the general Accounts are far behind; which, in their Opinion, is chiefly to be imputed to toe great Re-missriess of some of the Examiners, in not giving due Dispatch to the Examination and Comptrolof the several Accounts of the Out-ports, as well as the Inability of others for the discharging that Trust To toe First Article, Concerning the general Account: ist, That the general Cash Account of the Customs is made up to Christmas, 1702; which is nearer by Three Months, than ever it was, or could be, done, till some df the present Commissioners proposed, in their A. Presentment of the 30th of November, 1697 (a Copy whefeof is hereunto annexed) a Regulation of the Method»the Receivers-general were in before that Time, of making double Certificates, for many Weeks together, at the Close of every Y ear; and that the general £ross Account is made up to Christmas, 1699; which is as near, as it used to be fdrriieHy, when it did not require One-third of the Examination, that it does now, by the Multiplicity of Duties, whereof the Receiver-general keeps 31 Accounts: That there are about 70 Collectors Books of the Out-ports, to examine for every Quarter; and that, great Precipitation, in a Matter of so much Difficulty, as is the present Computation of the several Duties at the Custom-house, with the different Discounts, and Allowances, would not be for the Service of the Revenue; and yet it is certified to us, upon Enquiry, that the Four present Examiners have carried in their Books to the Comptroller-general, to Midsummer last, excepting only of Two or 1 hree Ports, where, by the Death of the Collectors, the Books have happened not to be yet sent up in due Form: So that we find no Reason to complain of the Remissness of these Officers, or to doubt of their Submission to the Authority of the Board; and, as to their Ability; Two of them have been above 12 Years in the Service; and, for the other Two, though we can't say, they have equal Experience, we hope, they may attain to a better Dispatch, by their Diligence. The repeated Orders of this Board to the Collectors, to send up their Quarter Bodks, and other Accounts, and to the Examiners, to dispatch their Observations upon them, as well as to all the other Officers under our Direction,

whose llemissneSs has been taken Notice of in any of toese Articles, must have been ob<1oiiS to these Gentlemen, from our Minute Books, which were before them.

Second Observation:

That the Charges of the Management, which amounts to a very great Sum per Annum, are chiefly borne by the Duty of Customs for Deficiencies; whereas clivers Acts, granting the other Impositions, direct, that they shall also bear their Proportion.

2. As to the Second Article, concerning the Charge of the Management:

The old Establishment of Officers, and ordinary Incidents, continue to be paid out of the Customs, as the more certain Revenue; but where it has been necessary to set up new Officers, on Occasion of any of the additional Duties, the Charge of such new Officers has been paid out of the respective Duties (as Debentures and Allowances always are) which is as much as, we humbly presume, was intended by the several Acts; where we find the additional Charge, necessary for Management of such Duties, generally excepted out, of tire Appropriations: But the Word Proportion, as it is mentioned in this Article, does not occur to ns in that Part of any of the said Acts of Parliament; besides, that tire making the several Funds bear the Salaries, and other incident Payments, in Proportion to the Produce of them (though perhaps tis barely possible to be done, by a retrospective Account, yet) would be a Work of great Trouble, and no manner of Use, now the principal Duties are all united into one common Fund. And the Commissioners w ere 60 far from apprehending themselves liable to any Imputations, upon their Management in this Particular, that they thought it might be a proper Evidence of their good Service, to represent very lately, in another Places that, although the Revenue had increased from about 500,009/. to 1.640,000l. per Annum, for each of the Two last Years of the Peace, by the several additional Duties, which have been put under the Management of this Board, and although in most of the Acts, granting such Duties, there have been Clauses of Allowances for Management, yet we have not charged the Publick with 500l. a Year for all the Duties together, excepting only in the Coal Duty (wherein Meters are appointed by Law) fqr the 15 per Cent, (which being according to the Value, by toe Candle, requires a distinct Management, and at a Distance from the Custom-house) and besides some Allowances to the Clerks, necessary to be added to the ReCeivefr-general, for the great Increase of Business in that Office.

Third Observation:

That there has not been due Care taken in the discharging of Debentures; in particular, your Commissioners find, that, till about toe Year 1697, the Debentures, due upon the Silk, were paid out of the Duties of Customs, to the great lessening the Revenue arising from thence; and, consequently, very much to the Prejudice of those, wiio were entitled to the Produce of it.

To the 3d Article we answer; That, by the special Care of some of the present Commissioners (though after a very Fong Struggle) the Number of Parchments, on which Debentures are made out, have been reduced above orie Half of what they were before; for, whereas there were Four Debentures, formerly, for the same Quantity of Tobacco, there are now but Two; and for that, aa also for other Goods, where the Duties are all paid, but One; except for the 15 [a] per Cent. So that, though the Merchant has better Dispatch, and it is at less Charge, than formerly; yet the several Officers have more Time to examine, and compare with the Entries in their Books, that the Debentures are fight. And w'e crave I eave to appeal to all the fair Merchants of England, whether the Officer, w'ho has had for some Years past, the Charge of examining Debentures, has not been more exact for the Interest of the Revenue, and yet given them better Satisfaction in their Dispatch, since this Method took place, than ever they had before. The Instance, brought to confirm this Article, with great Submission, relates to toe [aj Sic Qng. “ 14 Journal.

charging

i Ann# 25 JanuariL 133

charging Debentures to Account, and not to the Payment of them: And, as to this, we say, that the Commissioners got it altered, by the Second Paragraph in their Presentment, before-mentioned, which is above Five Years since; and hope, they shall not be now blamed, because they could not get it done any sooner: And though we do not pretend to excuse the then Receiver-general, in such Misapplication of the Customs, as is alleged, which, no doubt, is a Lessening of the net Produce of that Fund; yet, in the last Appropriation of them for 1,200,000l. there arose a very great Surplus out of this Fund, after all the Debt paid.

4th Observation:

That it does not appear, there is a sufficient Check upon some Parts of the Management of this Revenue, where there is most Occasion for it: As, for Example, your Commissioners do not find, there is such Care taken, as is requisite, to secure Duties upon Importation of Goods; the Jerquer, whose proper Business it is, to coniptrollthe Masters Reports by the Land waiters Books, and to see, that all the Goods, imported, are duly entered, often contenting himself w ith the Account, the Merchant gives in, without ever looking in the Landwaiters Books, to see, whether they agree with the Masters Reports; and many of the Landwaiters Books are found not to agree, as to the Species, or Quantities, of Things imported.

To the 4th Article; We have examined the Jerquers, whereof there are Three in this Port; who all understand their Business, and have satisfied us, that their Practice, in jerquing of Ships, is never in the manner objected agaiiiat them in this general Charge, without examining the Masters Report by the Warrants, and comparing both with the Landwaiters Books: And as to what is said of the Landwaiters; unless we had the Names of the Ships, and Time of Importation, and the Species of Goods, supposed to be delivered, we cannot be informed, whether it docs bear upon any of them, or no.

5th Observation:

That the Collectors in the Long Room are not so punctual in their Discharge, as your Commissioners conceive they ought to be; for, though they are obliged weekly to pay the Receiver-general, not only all the Money they receive, but likewise to deliver over all the Bonds, that are taken by them in the preceding Week, yet, it appears, they detain Part of the Money longer in their Hands; and as it B seldom, that any of the Bonds are delivered up, so soon as they should be, to the Receiver-general, so many of them are not delivered up at all, but kept by the under Receivers, till they become due, and then the Money is by them received thereupon; the Consequence of which is, that, by this means, it is exceeding difficult to find out, whether they duly bring to Account all they receive, or not, the Bonds being very numerous, and the Receipts, upon this Revenue, of a very great Bulk; and, unless there be a Check upon them weekly, to inspect the State of the Bonds, taken by them, and see, that they charge themselves with the Money, as soon as they receive it, without keeping it in their Hands, to make any indirect Use of it, it is impossible todiscover, whether those Officers perform the Duty of their Places wiih that Fidelity, that is necessary for the publick Service.

As to the th Article; The Receivers in the Long Room bring their Accounts of Money, as near as they can, to a Balance every Week; but, as the Receiver-general closes his Accounts on , and Comp-

trolls do not give the particular Collectors their certain Charge till Monday, or Tuesday,they can't balance always

to a Shilling: And as to the Bonds; those for Wine, and Tobacco (which are the most considerable; have of late, pursuant to the Commissioners Directions, been delivered over to the Receiver-general, as soon as the Col-lebtors have had time to enter them in their Books; but the Bonds, taken from the East India Company, can't be brought to a regular Account, till the Sights are perfected for the Importation Duty, or the Goods sold by Vol. 14.

the Candle for the 15 per Cent, which, being a Transaction the Receiver-general has no Cognizance of, is more readily done by the proper Collector, who acknowledges to have kept the Bonds for other Duties also of that Receipt, in his Hands, till discharged: But we must give him this Testimony, that, in an Account of many hundred thousand Pounds, which have passed through his Hands yearly, for several Years past, it does not appear to us, that ever this Officer made a bad Debt to the Crown._

6th Observation:

That it does not appear, there is greater Care taken in the appointing sufficient Checks, to comptroll the Accounts of the Receivers-general, either as to his Charge, or Discharge: For, as to what regards his Charge, your Commissioners do not find, there is any Comptroll over that Part of his Receipts, which arises from Remittances from the Out-ports, the Collectors there sending up only quarterly, or monthly, Remittances of what the several Duties produce in those Ports; and the Bills being many in Number, and paid at different Times, it is impossible, they conceive, till a better Method is taken for the keeping those Accounts, to discover, whether the Receiver-general charges himself with the Receipt of any, much less of all, the Money, so soon as it comes to his Hands.

As to this 6th Article; If the Commissioners of Accounts had been pleased to take Notice Taper A. of our Presentment, of the 30th of No-N VI. vember, 1697, they might have observed that, what they mean by this Article, was therein more particularly proposed; and, if they would have sent for the Comptroller-general of the Accounts of the Customs, they would have Form of Ab- known, it has been practised accordingly stract, D. ever since: So that, if this Care did not appear to those Gentlemen, we hope, it shall not be imputed to us; that, which we had proposed for the publick Service, being actually putin Practice in this Instance.

7th Observation:

In like manner, that Part of his Charge, which proceeds from Bonds turned into Money, appears not to be sufficiently taken care of; since, according to the present Management, it seems impracticable to discover, whether the Money, arising from thence, is duly charged in his weekly Certificates; there being no one Officer in that Revenue, who thinks it his Business to inspect that Matter, and, by examining the Bonds, and seeing, whether he has them all by him, or not, to find out, whether the Sums, for which they have been taken, have not been received much sooner, than they have been brought to Account.

The 7th Article must receive the like Answer. Some of the present Commissioners first proposed insisting upon Interest at the Custom-house, where Bonds were not paid in time: The Merchants petitioned against it, but were over-ruled at the Treasury, on the Commis-Scheme B. sioners Report: A Scheme is framed, for Report E. making it practicable, and the Officers, concerned, directed to make their Objections, if they had any, or to propose some other Method; and if we should be blamed, because the Merchants are with Difficulty brought to comply, and the Officers to execute, 'twill be a very great Discouragement to all future Endeavours for advancing the Revenue.

8th Observation:

Besides these Defects in the Management of this Revenue, with regard to the Receiver's Charge, your Commissioners are humbly of Opinion, there are others in his Discharge; it not appearing to them, that the Comptroller hath any Power, or at least ever makes use of it, to inspect and examine weekly, whether the Receiver has actually in his Possession all the several Debentures, which he craves Allowance for in his Certificates, and whether he does not sometimes discharge himself of many Sums, as paid upon that Head, before

they are actually paid: However, your Commissioners think, that, in Justice to the present Receiver-general, they ought to let you know, they do not find, he has made any indirect Use of these Opportunities; but that they thought it became them to submit these Observations to your Considerations, not knowing, what Advantage may be made by these, who shall succeed him, from the Latitude there is for Corruption, and Abuse, in the Receipt of those Revenues.

That this Observation, in some respects, is true; yet we must crave Leave to do that Right to the Management, that we proposed a Regulation of it in our C. Presentment of the 14th of August, 1696 (Copy w hereof is hereunto annexed) to which we pray to be referred, for justifying our Endeavours to have it rectified; which appear again in the first Para-A. N® I. graph of our Report, of the 30th of November, 1697. And some of our Applications were so far from resting in a Matter (as was conceived) so necessary for the Security of the Revenue, that, on a Petition of One of our Number, in the Year 1701, the then Lords of the Treasury agreed to propose to his Majesty this, with the other Part petitioned for, and received his Majesty's Approbation of bath; pursuant to which, the said Petitioner entered into that Province, which was allotted to him; and how the Direction for the other Part came not to be pursued at that time, was not under our Observation.

9th Observation:

That, whereas there was an Order made by the Commissioners for managing this Revenue, and approved by the Lords of the Treasury, that no Merchant should be suffered to enter new Ponds, before he had cleared those formerly given; yet your Commissioners find, That Order has been frequently broke, and no just Account made of the Interest due upon the Bonds, under Pretence, that the Merchants refuse Payment, when by Law they might be compelled to it.

This is a prudential Order, frequently repeated by us; and we humbly hope, we shall not be charged with the Officers Neglect of our Orders, when we take all the Care we can, to have them duly observed; it being impossible for us to watch every one, in all the Acts of his Duty. As to the Account of Interest, mentioned in this Article, we hope, it is sufficiently answered in our Observation on the 7th; and we are informed by the General Receiver, that, where the Merchant disputes the Payment of Interest, he refuses to cancel the Bonds, though the Principal be received, and the Time of Payment mentioned thereon.

10th Observation:

That there is no due Care taken, in quickening the Merchants in thfe Payments of their Bonds; it appearing, that many Bonds have not bceu put into the Solicitor's Hands, till long after they became due, to the great Detriment of the Publick.

The Time of the Bonds growing due is under the immediate Observation of the Receiver-general; and, if these Gentlemen do not find, in their 8th Observation, that he makes any indirect Use of these Opportunities, we hope, they will be pleased to observe also, that he was obliged to charge himself with the Interest, from the Times, that the Bonds were due.

1 ith Observation:

And that, when they have been put into the Solicitor's Hands, your Commissioners observe, that they have not been prosecuted with such Dispatch, as the publick Service required.

We do not desire to excuse any Neglect, that has been in any Part of the Business; nor could we justify ourselves, if it did not appear, that we have frequently excited this Officer to more Diligence.

12 th Observation:

ThisRevenue has also suffered veryconsiderably, for w ant of sufficient Care in inspecting the Securities usually given.

The taking Securities, if it be meant upon Merchants Entries, is the proper Business of the respective Collectors. We have frequently repeated our Orders of Caution to

them, in this Particular; and as soon as it was represented to us, that One of the Receivers was negligent in this Part of his Duty, he was dismissed by the Board. And we humbly crave Leave to observe, upon this Occasion, that the Sums, that may fall short, at the Foot of the Customhouse Account, for Ten Years past, will be but very inconsiderable, in proportion to the many Millions accounted for in the whole Receipt of that Time.

13th Observation:

Your Commissioners, upon a particular Enquiry, find further, that, for several Years, during the late War with France, and after wards, a clandestine Trade was

carried on, for importing French Wines from St. Sebastian, and other Ports of Spain: That, though his late Majesty gave Notice thereof to the Commissioners of tire Customs in April, 1695, yet no Seizures were made or prosecuted, till tire Year 1700: That this clandestine Trade was carried on by a notorious Confederacy between the Importers, the Consuls abroad, and some Officers in the Customs: That mean Appraisements, and undue Compositions, have been made for Seizures: That the Inspector of the Fines and Forfeitures, on Seizures (the Duty of whose Office is to take care, the Publick is not defrauded) has not regularly attended the Appraisements, Compositions, and Sales by Inch of Candle, and owns, he kept no Account of the same; and that, when personal Informations have been entered, and Offenders prosecuted, at the Charge of the Informers, they have been greatly discouraged, and pros, entered, not only to the Injury of thelnformers, but the Prejudice of the Publick: By all which unfair Practices, it appears to your Commissioners, this Revenue has suffered considerably.

As to the 13th Article, concerning the

Trade, we do humbly offer, that it does appear by

F. our Solicitor's Schedule of the particular Causes, hereunto annexed, that there were Seizures,

Prosecutions, and Trials, for importing French Wine from St. Sebastian, in the Years 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99, though without any Success, Verdicts being all against the Crown: That, by our Presentment to the

G. Lords of the Treasury, of the 9th of March, 1095 (hereunto also annexed) we did represent the

Difficulties we were under relating to this Trade; which we humbly pray may be read, for our Justification in this Matter: And although, by his late Majesty's Direction, pursuant to our said Presentment, Two Officers were sent to St. Sebastian, in order to discover, and prevent, this Trade, and carried with them a Commission to examine Witnesses, touching the Ship Revenge, then under Seizure in this Port, on Supposition of her having imported French Wine from St. Sebastian, and whereof, they presumed, they had sufficient Evidence; yet the Jury gave their Verdict against the Crown. And, for the Continuance of our Endeavours to prevent this Trade, notwithstanding the ill Success in Jwe crave Leave to appeal to many Gentlemen, now in this honourable House, whether, on the Commitment of a Bill, for preventing the Sophistication of Wine, One of our Number did not propose a Clause, for preventing sophistical Importation, mentioning the Sebastian Trade; and whether there were not many Clauses, to the same Effect, in the Bill, we brought in the next Session, for preventing clandestine Trade. If there was any Collusion in this Matter with any Officers of the Customs, no Proof of that kind was ever produced at the Custom-house Board; and, if there be any, we could wish, such Officers might be named, that innocent Persons may not suffer in their Credit under a general Charge. That we took all the Care was possible for us, by many repeated Orders to our Inspector, to see such Wines, as were seized, duly appraised, and also by recommending it to the Commissioners for Appraisements, that Men of Skill and Substance should be sworn for that Purpose, we hope, the Commissioners of Accounts will do us that Justice lo acknowledge, from our Minutes of this Transaction, which are all before them; and that any undue Compositions have been made by Direction, or Allowance, of this Board, or Non pros.

proposed, but in stich Cases, where the King had compounded, is what we absolutely deny; and the entering Aon pros, for the King's Part, could not hihder the Prosecutor from going on for his own, if he thought fit And, for the Proceeding of the Custom-house Board, 'with relation to the several Compositions for St. Sebastian \V ine, we pray to be referred to our particular

H. I. Reports upon this Subject, of the 21st and 27th

K. L. of June, 1700, the 23d of November, 1700, and the 20th of November, 1701; all which are hereunto annexed: Nor can w e imagine, how the Terms of the Composition, on the Seizures by our Prosecution, could be construed injurious to the Publick, where the Crown received the whole Benefit of the Composition; whereas a private Informer would have been entitled to Half; which, in that Case, could be only of the appraised Value, the Court of Exchequer seldom refusing Writs of Delivery. And a# for the Composition, on the personal Information, the Quantum was

M. submitted wholly to the Lords of the Treasury, and the Modus, in both, to the Judgment of his

 Majesty's learned Counsel. All which, we humbly hope, w ill suffice to justify us in this whole Transaction.

14th Observation:

Your Commissioners must acquaint you further, that they are not able to say, what answer the Commissioners of the Customs can make to any Part of these Observations; because, though they have deferred laying this Report for some time before you, in order to hear them upon these, and several other, Matters, as those Commissioners themselves desired; yet they have not thought fit to suffer themselves to be examined, or to answer the several Queries, designed to be proposed to them: However, this Justice must be done them, that they have had no great Encouragement to endeavour the Reformation of Abuses, since, upon Representations, formerly made by them to the Treasury of Defects in the Management of the Customs, your Commissioners do not find any great Notice taken, or any thing done to remedy the most material Abuses.

To this we humbly offer, that, from the time we knew, that the Commissioners of Accounts were making Enquiries, relating to our Management, we were desirous to give them all the Satisfaction w-e could, in Ease of their Examination; and although we are not charged with One Shilling of the publick Money, and have therefore no Account of our own to be taken, stated, or examined; yet we thought it our Duty to submit to an Authority, so derived, as that Commission is, as may be seen

N. in a Transcript, herewith humbly presented, of all that passed between us, and that Board;

wherein it will also appear, that these Commissioners, in Obedience to their Precept, have had carried to their Office daily (as long as they thought fit) all our Presentments from ifiqi, our Minute Books from 1692, and our Reports from 1O93; in which Books are entered the most material Transactions of the Custom-house Board: And as there can be no doubt, but that these honourable Gentlemen have believed it incumbent upon them to represent, for the publick Service, w hatever they judged proper to be altered in our Management; so we hope, that, in whatever Part they have been silent, we shall have the Advantage, from their Enquiries, , to be reputed blameless. If therefore what the Commissioners of Accounts, have, in their Observations, thought fit to be regulated, agrees intirely with the Proposals w'e have made from time to time (us will appear from Papers, referred to in this Answer, which were under their View) we hope, they will be pleased to make us some Allowance, for the Advantage we have in concurring with their Opinion; and if what remains imputed to us, in their Charge, is, that our Orders have been sometimes neglected, we will hope for their Pardon, since they themselves are sensible, we wanted Support, and Authority, to keep our Officers to their Duty. Upon the whole Matter, we humbly refer to the favourable Consideration of this Honourable House (with regard to our sincere, steady, and visible Vo l. 14.

successful Kndeavours for the Advantage of the Revenue, Pubiirk and the publick Service) what we have been able, in so Account , short a Time, to recollect for our Defence, with all possible Respect and Submission; further humbly praying, we may have Leave to verify, by our Books, any such Papers, as may heed it, and Opportunity to answer any new Matter that may be objected to us.

The Papers, to which the Answer refers, are bound up with the other Papers of this Session.

The Commissioners of the Customs said Answer to the Petition of Nathaniel Senior;viz.

To the honourable the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled:

THE Commissioners of her Majesty's Customs having, by the Favour of this honourable House, obtained a Copy of a Petition of Nathaniel Senior, relating to this Board, with the Order of this House, to make Answer thereunto upon Monday Morning next; the said Petition also referring to a former Petition to the honourable the Commissioners, for taking and stating the publick Accounts of the Nation; the Petitioner thereby suggesting, that, after great Industry, and Ex pence, in discovering a clandestine Trade by a considerable Number of Merchants, by importing French Wine, and Brandy, from . St. Sebastian, and other Places in Spain, he was greatly hindered and discouraged in the Prosecution of those Offences by the Commissioners and Officers of the Customs: The said Commissioners, for Answer, humbly pray Leave to be referred to Two Reports, made by this Board the 22d January, and 11th of February,

1700, upon the Petition of 'lho. Bellamy; wherein the State of those Prosecutions is plainly and at large set forth; which said Reports are hereunto annexed: And the said Commissioners do herewith also humbly lay before this honourable House the Proceedings of the said Senior (together with his Kinsman, Mr. Stisted, who is supposed to have been joined with him in the Prosecution of all the Informations, mentioned in the Petition) in the Court of Exchequer; whereby, upon the Oath of Stephen Creagh, and Michael Fallet, and Benjamine it

does appear, that, soon after Mich Term 1700, a Verdict of 480/. being obtained against Stephen Creagh and Mich. Fallet, upon an Information, exhibited in the Name of one Bellamy, for the Forfeiture.. Nine Ton of Brandy, being Aliens Goods, which they had entered in . their own Names, the said 480/. being, the Value recovered for the said Brandy; that the said Mr. Stisted and Mr. Senior appeared to treat with the said Creagh and Fallet about the Verdict, and about compounding another Information, then depending, for the Forfeiture of several Quantities of Wines, which had not paid the French Duties; and, after several Meetings, the said Stisted and Senior received 240/. being the Informers Moiety of the Verdict, and 360/. to discharge the other Information, then depending, for Wine, and all other Informations whatsoever; and promised to indemnity, and save them harmless, from the King's Part of the said Informations for Wines, frequently giving them a Caution, to keep their own Counsel, a: l not to make the least Discovery of the said Treaty and Agreement: That Mr.

Creagh and Fallet afterwards pressing Capt. Stisted, to give a Receipt for the said Money, he did assure them, they never should be troubled about those Informations, for that he would go to the Exchequer-Office, and burn and destroy the original Informations, that they should never come in Judgment against them; and that the said Creagh and Fallet, being Defendants in the said Informations, whose Concern it was to take out the said Licences, never did order or direct any Licence to be taken out; neither at the Time of the said Treaty, was it pretended by the said Stisted and ,that any Licences were taken out.

And

Accounts.

And we beg Leave to observe, that long after the said 360/. paid, as aforesaid, viin Hilary Term, 1701, being above 12 Months after the Composition was made, a Licence was taken out, and a Composition swore to, by the said Bellamy, for the Informer's Part: Upon which we pray Leave further to observe, that upon the Informations, exhibited by this Board against the Defendants,

Creagh and Pallet, the Crown has received, for Com-

position, at the Rate of 4/. per Too, the Sum of 693/. which is above double more, than would have been paid in upon Mr. Senior and Stisted's said Comjjosition, if they

bad meant fairly.

There is also another Licence, entered by Mr. Stisled, or Mr. Sailor's Clerk, the same Term, to compound with Joseph Moor, for 22 Tons of French Wine, and taken out in the same Manner, and with the same Appearance of Fraud, as the other; and the Composition-money is 31/. 10s. which is under 30 per 'Jon; whereas, upon the Information, exhibited by Order of the Commissioners, the Composition was 92/. 10 s.

There was also another Licence, to compound with John James David, which was in like Manner, as the former, fraudulently taken out by or Senior; and,

though the Licences mention no more than 30 Tons, the Information, being for 55 Tons, the Defendant in this Case (as in Creag/i and Fallett's) is cheated notoriously.

It is also to be observed, that the said Mr. David had paid to the Crown, upon the Informations exhibited by this Board, 4601, which is more by 350 /. than would have been recovered upon Sen Composition.

By all which, the Commissioners humbly hope, will appear to his honourable House, the Unfairness and Insincerity of the said Stisted and Senior's Proceedings; and that the Informations, exhibited, or pretended to be exhibited, by the Petitioner, and the said Stisted, were intended to defend and skreen the Offenders from the King's Process, and not for the Service and Advantage of the Publick, as is suggested in the Petition.

And the Commissioners humbly crave Leave further to represent to this honourable House, that, in the whole Course of their Proceeding in the Compositions with the Merchants, they have acted with all Fairness and Caution imaginable; having first represented the Case to their Superiors, who always, upon such Presentment, consulted the King's learned Counsel, what was fit to be done; and, upon mature Deliberation with those learned Gentlemen, it was thought best and safest for the publick Service, to accept of Composition, according to the Course of the Court of Exchequer, rather than to hazard the Success of a 2d Tryal, which if unsuccessful, the Sum of upwards of 30,000l. gained by Composition, must have been lost to the Crown, and that Trade have been carried on, without any Disturbance for the future; for that there having been Prosecutions, in such like Cases, in 1695, 1696, 97, 98, 99, 1700, and still Verdicts against the Crown.

And, until we had actually compounded with those Merchants, whose Wines were under Seizure, and were prosecuting others, whose Wines had escaped the Officers Hand, we never heard of Mr. Bellamy, Mr. Stisted, nor Mr. Senior, nor any Informations of theirs depending in the Court of Exchequer.

And we crave Leave further to observe to this honourable House, that the Crovm received the whole Benefit of these Compositions; whereas, upon Mr. Senior's Information, the Crown could have been entitled but to a Moiety; and in all the Compositions, made by Mr. Senior and Stisted, the Commissioners Compositions are upwards of two Thirds more to the Crown, than theirs.

Moreover it appears by Entries in the Custom-house Books (a Copy whereof is hereunto annexed) that the said Stisted was dismissed from his Employment in the Customs, 19 Years since, for certifying Debentures, to entitle the Merchant to a Drawback for Goods, which were never sliipt.

And it further appears by Matter of Record (Copies whereof arc hereunto annexed) that these pretended Com-

positions, made by Senior and Stisted with and

Fallett, were made without Licences, inasmuch as the Licences, pretended for the said Compositions, were not taken out, till above a Year after; which Offence, by the Statute of 18 Queen Eliz. Cap. jth, is punishable with Pillory: And therefore we humbly submit to the Consideration of this honourable House, how far the Charge of Persons, concerned in such Practices, shall affect the Reputation of a publick Commission of the Revenue.

The First Report to the Treasury, referred to in the said Answer, as followeth;

May it please your Honours,

In Obedience to your Lordships Commands, signified to us by Mr. Loutides,upon the several annexed Petitions

of Thomas Bellamy, and of Stephen Creagh, and Michael Pallet; the former setting forth, that the Petitioner, being wrell informed of a clandestine Trade, set on foot, and carried on, by a great Number of Merchants of ,

viz. from Bourdet tuzin France, and Sebastians in Spain, to the Port of London, w hereby his Majesty hath been defrauded, in his Customs, great Sums of Money, and Trade thereby greatly injured, and retarded, did, at his own Charge, send over a Person to and St.

Sebastians, in order to make a full and perfect Discovery thereof:

That the Petitioner, by virtue thereof, and by other his great Diligence, hath made a large Discovery, of what Wine, and Brandy, was so traded for, and imported into England, between the Months of July and latter End of February, 1C99; and hath exhibited Informations against the several Offendants, for the Values of the said Wines, and Brandies, in his Majesty's Court of Exchequer:

That the Petitioner hath also brought to Tryal, at his own Charge, on.e of the said Informations, for 18 Pieces of Brandy, against Michael Pallet and Stephen Creagh; and recovered therein, for his Majesty and himself, 480/. wherein there did appear, upon Tryal, to have been Three notorious Frauds committed; 1st, That they were French Brandy, and entered at the Custom-house for Spanish Brandy: 2dly, That the said Creagh and Pallet did enter them in their own Names, and paid English Duties only; whereas they were the Goods of an Alien: And 3dly, The said Pallet did'enter them Spanish Brandy, upon Oath, ad Valorem 301, per Ton; and they were afterwards sold for French Brandy, for upwards of 1001, per Ton:

That the Petitioner doubts not, but to prove great Frauds committed to his Majesty, upon all the rest of the said Informations; but, inasmuch as your Petitioner hath good Reason to believe, that he shall meet with great Opposition from so great a Body of considerable Merchants, as are herein concerned, as well as from those Officers of the Customs, through whose Hands they passed, besides the Dangers he may be presumed to run, as to his Person, his Solicitor having been already publickly menaced, for persisting in the Prosecution of the said Informations; and forasmuch as this Undertaking of the Petitioner is greatly for his Majesty's Service;

Humbly praying your Lordships Favour, and Protection, in the Premises, and, as a Compensation of his great Zeal, and Charge already sustained, and, in some measure, the better to enable him to goon in so good and serviceable an Undertaking for his Majesty, and the Publick, that your Lordships will be pleased to grant him his Majesty's Part of the said 480/. recovered against the said Creagh and Pallet, as aforesaid, or otherwise encourage and protect your Petitioner in his said Undertaking, as to your Lordships great Wisdom shall seem meet:

And the latter Petition setting forth, that in the Month of August, 1699, the Petitioners had consigned to them (being Partners) by Messieurs David and Lasseurs, Merchants

chants in St. Sebastians, in the Kingdom of Spain, Eighteen

Pieces of Brandy, which the Petitioner entered at

the Custom-house in the Port of in his own and

the Petitioner Creagh's Names, and paid all Duties to his Majesty for the same, according to the best of his Knowledge:

That one Thomas Bellamy, who is altogether unknown to the Petitioners, exhibited an Information in the Court of Exchequer against the Petitioner, for'entering the said Brandy in their own Names; alleging, that the said 18 Pieces of Brandy were the proper Goods of an Alien; and came to a Tryal with the Petitioners thereupon, the Sitting after the last Term, and recovered against them 480/. a Moiety whereof belongs to his Majesty:

That the Petitioner, Siefthen was, at the Time of the said Entry, in Holland, and knew not thereof; and the Petitioner Mick. Fattett, being a Frenchman horn, and wholly ignorant of the Law in that Case, did make the said Entry in both their Names, but without any Intention of defrauding his Majesty of the Aliens Duty; which is but Eight Shillings per Ton over and above die Customs paid for the same, and amounts to, in the Whole, but 3 /. 12 s. So that the said Duty is but inconsiderable, and could not be any Inducement to the Petitioners to run so great a Hazard, as the Forfeiture of the Value of the said Brandy:

That the Petitioners, in the Year 1699, paid to his Majesty Customs, for Goods, by diem imported into the Port of London,upwards of 6,000l. Humbly praying, your Lordships will remit to them his Majesty's Part of the said 4801.

We do humbly report to your Lordships, that, though the Prayers of the said two Petitions seem to be very different, yet, because they both relate to one Forfeiture, the former praying the Grant of the King's Part of the said Forfeiture, and the latter the Remission thereof, we have taken the Liberty to join them together in one Report; and, because both of diem have Relation to that collusive Trade, of bringing French Goods from St. Sebastian, we crave Leave to make a short Deduction to your Lordships, of what has been transacted at this Board, for the preventing that Trade, and the detecting and punishing the Offenders therein, from the Vintage of the Year 1699, which is as much as relates to the present Case. And we do humbly inform your Lordships, that in December, 1699, the Commissioners, having Reason to suspect, that French Wines were colourably imported from St. Sebastians, called the Surveyors before them, and directed them strictly to examine, and taste, all Wines then delivering; and the Surveyors at that time acquainting the Commissioners, that they had tasted the Wines, and thought, there might be a Suspicion, in the Taste, that there might be a Degree of French Wine in them, yet it seemed not so evident to them, to adventure to make Seizure, they were directed to continue their Diligence, in examining, and tasting all Wines from St. Sebastian, and other Parts of Spain, and wait for a more certain Opportunity to seize, in order to a Tryal for the Forfeiture of the Goods, or Recovery of the French Duty; and the 29th January they acquainted the Commissioners, they had tasted a Parcel of Wines, belonging to Mr. Cairnes, from St. Antonio, which they believed to be French Wine, or to have a great Mixture of Wine in them: They were directed to lay their Hands on them, the Commissioners being resolved to try the Point at Law; and after that, divers Instances of the same Kind fell daily in, from Bilboa, St. Sebastian, and other Ports of Spain; and the Wines were seized, and put into a Course of Tryal; and soon after, the Commissioners gave the same Directions to the Out-ports, strictly to examine, and taste, all Wiiies, that had the Semblance of French, and to seize all such, as might be reasonably suspected to be French, or mixed with French', and divers Parcels of Wines were thereupon seized, cs well in the Out-ports, as in the Port of London; and in Easter Term following, the Causes were ready for Tryal against the several Proprietors of the said Wtnes, many Vo l. 14,

of which are the same Persons, againstwhotn the Petitioner Pubiitk Bellamy pretends to have exhibited the Informations, men- Accuttnu tioned in the Schedule annexed to his Petition; and one Cause was brought to Tryal that Term, for a Parcel of Wines, belonging to the Petitioner Creagk; wherein though he obtained a Verdict, against the Evidence, and the Opinion of the Court, yet the Court, being moved for a new Tryal, thought it reasonable to grant it; which was the Cause, that the several Merchants, then under ' Prosecution, came in, and made Proposals to treat, by Licence of the Court of Exchequer, and pay two Thirds of the appraised Value: And we did afterwards, by our Report of the 23d of November, humbly offer our Opinion to your Lordships, that stroh Importers, as had, in the Beginning of the Year, escaped the Knowledge of the Officers, before the Mystery of this Trade was discovered, should be also prosecuted, as far as the Evidence of the Fact tvould reach; and gave Direction to our Solicitor accordingly: And thus this Matter stood, when Mr.

Battemy's Petition came referred to us from your Lordships; since which we are, upon Enquiry and Search, acquainted, that Informations are entered in the Book of Informations, remaining in die Exchequer Office, against die severed Persons mentioned in the List, annexed to the said Petition; and that the said Informations were entered the 15 February, 1699; and that they had lain dormant ever since, without any Subpands taken out against the Offenders, or any Offence, or Cause of Information assigned, or any thing else done thereupon from that Time, until your Lordship's Reference, and that we had

fiven Direction to our Solicitor, to prosecute the said fersons. And it is not unworthy your Lordship's Observation, that these Informations were secretly lodged in the Exchequer, at the same time, that we were laying our Hands upon the Merchants concerned in that Trade here, and making strict Enquiry after the same in the Out-ports; so that those latent Informations seem to us to be intended, rather as a Skreen, to defend the Offenders from the King's Process, than to be effectually prosecuted for the King's Service; and we see no Reason, why the Petitioner, who is a Person altogether unknown to us, and never appeared to us, but by a common Solicitor, and is already entitled to one Moiety of the Forfeitures, recovered against Creagh and Fallett, should be recompensed with the King's Part of the Forfeiture: Nevertheless if the said Bellamy shall, to prove his Sincerity, discover his Evidence to your Lordships, or the King's Counsel, and assist the King's Process therewith, in that Case he may be rewarded in such Proportion, as your Lordships shall think he may deserve. And we are humbly of Opinion, that there is no Pretence, that the Petitioners,

Creagh and Fallett, should be gratified with the Remission of the King's Part of the Forfeiture; since it is evident, that they incurred Pratnunire,by colouring Strangers Goods, to avoid the Payment of the French Duty.

All which is humbly submitted to your Lordships Consideration.

hereunto annexed, to be delivered to us; wherein he would suggest to your Lordships, that the Services which he pretends to have done the Publick, by the Informations he had exhibited against Merchants, for importing French Wines from St. Sebastians, and other Ports of Spain, had not met with that Encouragement from this Board, which he might have expected, but that we had made use of his list, to exhibit other Informations against the same Persons; and prayed to be heard before your Lord-

for the Reasons mentioned in the said Report (to which we pray your Lordships to be referred) humbly offer it as our Opinion, that the Informations, exhibited in the Name of the said Bellamy, were intended rather as a Skreen, to defend the Offenders from the King's Process, than to be effectually prosecuted for the King's Service; and we can find nothing mentioned by the said Bellamy in his second Petition, that does persuade us to be of another Opinion: And whereas he would insinuate, as if we had made use of his List, to prosecute the same Persons, he had exhibited Informations against; we pray your Lordships to take Notice, that Informations were entered in the Exchequer, by our Solicitor, the 14th of January, pursuant to the Orders of this Board in November last, as may appear by a Certificate, hereunto annexed; which was before we had Notice of any Informations lodged in the Exchequer, in the Name of the said Bellamy: And we look upon this Prosecution to be a Matter of such Consequence to the Publick, as well as Concernment to the Revenue, that we humbly pray your Lordships to take the Opinion of Mr. Attorney and Mr. Solicitor-general, how any Abuse therein may be most effectually prevented; and, if the Petitionor be allowed to be heard before your Lordships, by his Counsel, upon this Subject, we pray, that Mr. Attorney and Mr. Solicitor-general tnay be present on the King's Account

for making Provision for the younger Children of Jonathan Castieman,of Coubcrtlcy, in the County of Gloucester,

Also, their Lordships have agreed to the Bill, intituled, An Act for confirming the Division of a third Part of the Manor of Burton Dasset, in the County of Warwick, heretofore made by the Owners thereof, without Amendment:

Also, their Lordships have agreed to the Bill, intituled, An Act for Sale of several Estates, for Payment of Debts charged thereupon, and for disposing of the Residue of the Money at Interest, for the Benefit of Giles Lotte, and other Infants, pursuant to their Father's Will, with some Amendments; to which they desire the Concurrence of this House.

And then the Messengers withdrew.

Colonel Bierley, from the Commissioners, for taking,

examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, presented to the House their Report, pursuant to the Order of the House of Friday last; by which they were directed to examine the Auditors, and other Officers of the Exchequer, relating to the passing of the Accounts of the publick Money; and to lay before the House, what they should find to be the Cause, that the Accounts are not annually and duly passed, according to the Laws in that Case; and through whose Default it hath happened: And the same was read, and is, as followeth;

IN Obedience to the Order of this House, the 2 2d Instant, requiring the Commissioners, for taking, examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, further to examine the Auditors, and other Officers, of the Exchequer, relating to the passing of the Accounts for the publick Money; and lay before this House, what they find to be the Cause, that the Accounts are not annually and duly passed, according to the Laws in that Case; and through whose Default it hath happened;

Your Commissioners have further examined, upon Oath, Mr. Bridges,one of the Auditors of the Imprests,

and Mr. Moody, Deputy to Mr. Done, (late the other Au-

ditor of the Imprests) and find, that, whereas the said Auditors were required, by the Earl of Rochester's Orders and Instructions (when Lord Treasurer) of the 6 June, 1685, enforcing the ancient Course of the Exchequer, to certify to the King's Remembrancer the Neglects of the several annual Accomptants, that Process might go out against them; they have made only two such Certificates; pne in March, 1685; the other the 17th of February, 1686; and can give no direct and clear Answer, why the same have been since discontinued. Mr. Bridges believes, it was, because the Remembrancer thought it not safe to issue Process, without a particular Order from tlje Treasury; though your Commissioners must observe, the same Orders and Instructions require the Remembrancer, without further Direction, to issue Process against every Accomptant, and not stay Proceedings thereupon, unless by Warrant from the Treasury, or from the Chancellor of the Exchequer: And Mr. Moody says, he was very young in the Office, and dares not take upon him to say, how these Certificates came to be discontinued. They both agree, that, from that time, they have certified the Treasury; but it appears to your Commissioners, upon their Examination, that these Certificates have not been regularly made, no certain stated Times observed for the making of them, and they have been made either to the Treasury, or to the Chancellors of the Exchequer respectively, as they have thought (it to call for them, notwithstanding the Orders and Instructions, beforementioned, require the Auditors to attend the Lord Treasurer every Lent Vacation, with a general Certificate of the State of all Accounts before them.

Your Commissioners have also examined, upon Oath, Mr. Barker, the Deputy Remembrancer; who knows not, w by these Certificates have been discontinued; but, as to the issuing Process against the Accomptants, he has acquainted your Commissioners, the same has been it

often ordered, and in most Cases afterwards stayed; for which he has received only an Order, or Letter, without any Cause assigned: And laying before your Commissioners the particular Instances of Processes ordered to issue, they must let you know', that they liavc been generally against the lesser Accomptants, and Receivers of Taxes, and scarce any against those, who stand accountable for the greatest Sums of the publick Money, and who have been certified, by the Auditors, to be in Arrear with their Accounts.

Your Commissioners, upon this Occasion, took Notice to him, that, by the Act, Anno 8° et 9® of the late King (for the better Observation of the Course, anciently used in the Receipt of Exchequer) the Auditor of the Receipts is obliged to transmit the ordinary Imprest Rolls half-yearly to the Remembrancer; and also examined him, how far the same hath been complied with: Who informs your Commissioners, this hath not been duly and regularly observed: That Two Imprest Rolls have been sent him, since the Order to your Commissioners, to make this Enquiry; and that there are still three in Arrear.

Your Commissioners have further examined the Secretary of the Treasury, upon Oath; who says, that the ancient Course of the Exchequer has been for several Years disused, in the making out the Certificates to the Queen's Remembrancer, and his issuing Process of Course, which, according to the Duty of their Places, they ought respectively to nave done; and he apprehends, this must have proceeded from undue Favour shewn to the Accomptants.

And the first Observation of the said Commissioners being again read;

And a Debate arising, in relation to the Auditor of the Receipt of the Exchequer;

And a Motion being made, and the Question being put, That the Debate be adjourned;

It passed in the Negative.

Resolved, That Charles Lord Halifax, Auditor ofihe Resolution Receipt of the Exchequer, hath neglected his Duty, and against Lord is guilty of a Breach of Trust, in not transmitting the Im- Halifax> prest Rolls half-yearly to the King's Remembrancer, according to the Act, made in the Session of Parliament, held in the 8th and 9th Year of his late Majesty's Reign, intituled, An Act for the better Observation of the Course anciently used in the Receipt of Exchequer.

The Sixth Paragraph of the said Observations being read;

Mr. Bromley (according to Order) reported from the Higham-Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it Fmey appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough ection‘ of Higham-Ferrers,in the County of Northampton, and

the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the Petition of Thomas Wentworth, Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of Tho. Pemberton, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Higham-Ferrers, in the County of Northampton:

That, upon the Poll, the Numbers were thus:

For the Petitioner, - - - - 43.

For the Sitting Member, - - 51.

That the Petitioner's Counsel opened the Right of . Election to be in the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses, at large, and in the Freemen, residing within the Borough, and not receiving Alms.

That the Sitting Member's Counsel insisted, that the Freemen ought to be Householders.

That, this being controverted, several Witnesses were called:

Jos. Hoscott, Tho. Stratton, Rob. Levered, Sam. Richards; who said, they had known this Borough 20,30,-50,

O o and

Higham

4(5

and 60, Years: That they had known Freemen, who were not Freeholders, vote; and some of them had voted as Freemen, when they were not Housholders.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Member, in Answer to this Evidence, insisted, that the Usage was with them; and also a Resolution of the House, the 10th May,

1660; when the House agreed with the Committee, that the Burgesses at large ought to elect; and, that Sir Tho. Dacres was duly elected.

That, as to the Usage, they called several Witnesses;

John Bridgman, Robert , Mr. JVillis, Arthur

Heckly, Peter Satuierson;who said, they had known Higham Ferrers 11, 40, 50, and 60, Years; and that the Right of Election was in the Housekeepers, paying Scot and Lot; and that, as Freemen, none had been permitted to vote, though they had sometimes offered themselves: That they had known them sometimes refused, and at others rejected, upon Scrutinies.

That then the Charter of 2 et 3 Phil, et Mar. was

S reduced; which, in the Recital, calls them, The Mayor, urgesses, and Community, of and, by

that Charter, the Corporation is to cohsist of a Mayor, Seven Aldermen, and 13 Burgesses; and the Privilege is granted them of sending One Burgess to Parliament.

That, upon the Whole, the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of ejecting a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Higham-Ferre in the County of Northampton, is in the Mayor, Aldermen, Burgesses, and Freemen, being Householders, and not receiving Alms.

That, the Right being thus settled, the Petitioner's Counsel proceeded to give Evidence to such, as had a Right to vote, and offered themselves for the Petitioner, and were refused; and to set aside the Votes of others, who voted for the Sitting Member.

That Lists were offered accordingly, and Answers were given to them by the Counsel and Witnesses of the other Side.

Evidence was given as to some Votes, that were gained by indirect Practices.

John Underwood \TVm. Underwood, said, that John

Saunders had promised Mr. Wentworth his Vote; but, a little before the Election, he told him, Mr. Pemberton Lad promised to pay him a Debt of above 30/. if he would vote for him; and that otherwise he would not. To which it was answered, that this was only paying a just Debt; and that John Saunders was formerly in the Interest of Mr. Pemberton, and had voted for him at the former Election.

John Underwood said, that Thomas Jackson had promised to vote for Mr. Wentworth', but that Mr. Pemberton had done Business in the Law for him, and had promised, if he would vote for him, he would come to a fair Account with him: But Mr. Willis being examined, said, that Mr. Saunders promised him to be for Mr. Pemberton;though at the same Time he declared,

Mr. Pemberton had dealt hardly by him, and that he had not Money to pay him: With which he acquainted Mr. Pemberton; who said he would come to a fair Account with him, whether he voted for him, or not.

John Underwood also said, that William Male had promised to be for Mr. Wentworth; but Mr. , at

his House, threatened to stick [a] him, if he would not be for him; and promised to raise his Wages from 12 to 14 d.a Day: But Mr. Willis and Tho. Freeman said, they were present at the same Time, and there was no threatening used to him; and, as to the raising of his Wages, Freeman said, it was promised only in this Manner; That, Male complaining, he had but 12 a Day, when others had 14 d.Mr. Pemberton said, if he would do as much Work, as others, that had 14 a Day, he should have the same Wages.

Edw. Freeman said, that Richard Small told him, he would have been for Mr. Wentworth, but Mr. Pemberton owed him some Money, and Mr. Willis told him, he [a] Sic Orig. “ trick/' Journal.

170a.

would pass his Word for it, if he would vote for Mr. Pemberton. It was proved on the other Side, that Small had been always in the Interest of Mr. Pemberton, and his Friends. t

That there was a great Stress laid upon a partial Distribution of Ilay. The Case was stated thus: That there is a Meadow at Higham-Ferrers, of about 24 Acres, called the Craftsmen's Meadow: That there is a Meadow-reeve, who has always the Hay, growing upon Acres, and he distributes the Hay, that grows upon the other 20 Acres, to the Craftsmen, and Innkeepers, of the Town, and their Widows; and that, when any Person has a Share of this Hay allotted him, he has afterwards continued to enjoy it; and that it has not been usual to take it from him: But it was insisted, that this Trust had been abused by Mr. Pemberton (who was, at the 'l ime of the Election, and still continues, Meadow-reeve) in the Distribution thereof, to make Voices for himself; and that the said Voices, so gained, ought not to be allowed to him: And to this the Petitioner's Counsel examined several Witnesses; viz.

Theophilus May said, that Samuel Goodson voted for Mr. Pemberton, and told him, he was of the right Side; for Mr. Pemberton told him, if he would vote for him, he should have Half an Acre of Grass.

And Rob. Freeman said, that Sam. Goodson had a Rood of Hay last Year, and none before.

Joseph Hoscott, aged 60 Years, and born at Higham-Ferrers, said, that the Freemen, and Innkeepers, who have received this Hay, have looked upon it as their Inheritance; and their Widows have received it after them; and his Father and Mother, and he, received it all along.

Tho. Stratton also testified as to the Custom of Hay being continued to the same Persons, and being distributed to their Widows, after their Deaths; and that he had. Hay for 30 Years together, but none the last Year: He believes, it was, because he was not for Mr. Pemberton; and about Ten of his Neighbours fared so.

Tho. Weston said, that Mr. Pemberton desired his Vote, and promised him Friendship in the;

and a Week before the Election, speaking of the Hay, Mr. Pemberton told him, that they were not of the same Side: Which he takes to have been the Reason, he had no Hay.

Robert Freeman, John Hall, Tho. Stratton, gave an Account of several Persons, that voted for Mr. Pemberton, whose Allowance w$s increased; and of others, who voted for Mr. Wentworth, whose Allowance was lessened, or taken away.

Sam. Edey said, the Mayor asked his Vote for Mr. Pemberton, and threatened to turn him out of a Town-house, he lived in, if he did not give it him; and that he did vote for Mr. Wentworth, and was turned out

That, to the Distribution of Hay, it w'as answered, that the Hay was not distributed till after the Election; That Mr. Pemberton, as Meadow-reeve, had the Distribution of it, in such Proportion, and to such Craftsmen, and Innkeepers, as he thought fit.

Bridgman said, he received the Hay 20 Years ago, and it was taken away from him one Year, upon a Quarrel with the Meadow-reeve's Servant; and that, about the same time, it was taken away from the Widow Langley.

Tho. Freeman said, the Meadow-reeve always disposed of the Hay, as he thought fit; and that some, who voted against Mr. Pemberton, had Hay the last Year: That several of those, who were instanced to have an Increase of Hay, were Mr. Pemberton a Tenants; and that therefore he favoured them.

That Mr. Pemberton's Counsel alledged, that they could take off from Mr. Wentworth's Poll; but they took the Majority to be so clearly with them, they waved it, and only called Witnesses, as to indirect Practices for the Petitioner.

Tho. Freeman, Sam. Richards, said, that the Lord Rockingluim, about 13 or 14 Years ago, had promised the Town 50/. towards renewing the Leases of the Poor's Ladd, which afterwards were taken over their Heads:

That,

28° Janu»

r Ann.. . a 80 fanuari 47

That, about a Month or Six Weeks before the Election, the Lord Rockingham sent 50/. by Mr. his

Steward, to buy a Piece of Land, to be settled to the Use of the Poor: That, as soon as he came to the Town, he sent for several Persons to his Inn, laid the Money before them upon the Table, and told them, for what Use it was intended; but Lands, of that Value, being not to be purchased, he carried the Money back again. It was confessed, that Mr. Ekyns had several Times formerly said,

he would engage, the Money should be ready; and Mr.

Nevison, when be brought the Money, declared, it was not upon Account of the Election; and he carried the Money to Mr. Pembertons House, and enquired of him, if he could sell such a Parcel of Land, as he wanted.

Ann Jervoise, Draper, said, that, at the White Horse, they received each Half a Crown of Mr. Wentworth's Bailiff, to engage their Husbands to be for Mr. Wentworth; and that John Woodley, John Underwood, and Robert Freeman, were present.

To answer which Evidence, the Petitioner called those three Persons; who denied that they saw any Money given to them; but acknowledged that Mr had given 20 s.to be disposed to the Poor, who had no Votes; and that the same was distributed by 1 id. and 6d. a-piece.

That, upon the Whole, the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Thomas Pemberton, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Higham-Ferrers, in the County of Northampton.

The said Resolutions, being severally read a Second time, were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Ilchester Mr. Bromley also (according to Order) reported from

Election. tile Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of Ilchester, in the County of Somerset, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk'sTable; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Upon the several Petitions of Webb, Esquire, and of divers of the Inhabitants of the Borough of Ilchester, in the County of Somerset, complaining of an undue Election and Return of James Anderton, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough:

That there was upon the Poll,

For Sir Fra. Wyndham, - - -72.

For Mr. Webb, ----- - 66.

For Mr. Anderton, ----- 28.

That the Right of Election was agreed to be in the Bailiff, Capital Burgesses, and Inhabitants, not receiving Alms.

That the Petitioner having so great a Majority, his Counsel insisted, that it was from the Partiality of the Bailiff, who had acted contrary to his Duty, he was not returned.

That it was affirmed, and not contradicted, that, at the Time of the Election, some objections had been made to several, who offered to vote, and they were refused; but none to any that were admitted.

That, after the Poll ended, the Bailiff adjourned to his own House (an Alehouse) and, after some Hours, returning to the Hall, declared the Sitting Member duly elected; and that the Bailiff being then asked his reason for it, made Answer, He could look through an Iron Grate.

That the Bailiff, a Fortnight or Three Weeks before the Election, declared, he w»ould return Mr. Anderton, right or wrong, though he had but five Votes. That there was a pretended Scrutiny, after the Election, made at the Bailiff s House; where no Person was present on the behalf of the Petitioner.

Robert Gillet: — That the Bailiff, the Night before the Election, declared, he was to have loo/, to return the Sitting Member, and Security for his Charges; and that, Yot. 14.

if he had but Four Voices, he would- return him: That iich«>Mr Edward Cleeve, the Gaoler, asked his Vote for the Sitting Election. Member; and calling his Wife, she gave him Two Guineas in a Paper. He said, he did not vote for the Sitting Member, but for the Petitioner; because the Sitting Member promised him Three Guineas, and Two Guineas, at Two former Elections, and kept not his Word.

That it appeared, Cleeve voted for the Petitioner, as well as for the Sitting Member. '

That the Answer, the Sitting Member's Counsel gave to this, was, that the Bailiff had done his Duty; for though the Petitioner had the Majority, as is set forth, upon the Poll, yet, upon the Scrutiny, which w'as demanded in the Hall, upon a Suggestion, that most of the Petitioner's Votes were obtained by Corruption and Bri . bery, there was plain Bribery proved upon so many of the Petitioner's Votes, that, when they were taken off, gave the Sitting Member the Majority; and accordingly the Bailiff conceived, he ought to make the Return.

That to these Allegations Witnesses were called:

John Winter-, who said, he was present at the Election; and a Scrutiny was demanded in the Hall, upon a Sug gestion of Brit>ery in the Petitioner; and thereupon the Bailiff adjourned to his House.

He said, that John Burford was an Agent for the Peti tioner, and desired him to write to the Sitting Member; that, if he would send'50/. he should be returned with the Petitioner.

Tho. Cheney said, that, a little before the Election, he went to the Petitioner's House, with 50 or 60 others; and then it was proposed to them by the Petitioner, to give them Two Guineas a-piece; but some of them insisted on Three: That he went over a second Time, with Sift others, and the Petitioner told them, he hoped, they were all his Friends, and he would send the Money; and that Cor and Mather were made choice of, to receive it'

Mary Cleeve said, that one Simcor, who was a Servant to the Petitioner, or to his Mother, about the Middle of May brought 100l. to her House, and left it under a Bed; and afterwards Thom. Smith and John Burford came and desired her to put it up, by Two Guineas in a Paper, and give it to such as had Votes; and accordingly she gave such Papers to 17, at the same Time desiring their Votes for the Petitioner: That Smith took an Account of the Money, with the Names of the Persons she had given it to; and Smith himself gave Two Guineas to one Hopkins; and Smith and Burford ordered her to deliver the rest of the Money to Andrew Sherlock.

Andrew Sherlock acknowledged, he received the Money from Mary Cleeve; and said, he had given Two Guineas a-piece to 17 others, to vote for the Petitioner; though he afterwards said, he was ordered to give them the Money, without saying any tiling; and what was done, be gave an Account of to Burford and Edward Cleeve. Sherlock himself voted for Sir Fra. Windham, and the Petitioner.

Edw. Cleeve confirmed the Testimony, his Wife had given, of Simcox coming to his House, and bringing the 100l. and the Directions given to his Wife, by Burford and Smith, about disposing thereof; and said, Sherlock gave an Account, to Burford, of the Names of those Persons, he had distributed to; and he put down the Names of those, his Wife distributed to; and distributed himself to 5 or 6 others, by the Direction of Burford and Smith; and that it was owned, at that Timr, to be to vote for the Petitioner, to be a Member of Parliament.

Steph. Taszvell s&id, he asked John Sud, w by he would not vote for Mr. Anderton;and Sud answered, they were poor; and he must vote for him, that would give most.

In Answer to that Part of the Evidence, relating to the 50 or 60 Persons going to the Petitioner's House, his Counsel called

. Crawford; who said, he was sent by his Master, the Petitioner, to Ilchester, to forbid their coming to his House; yet, notwithstanding, the same Night, about threescore came to his Master's House: That he could

Mr. Bromley also (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter as it appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of Cheping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks, and the Resolution of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in h£s Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was read, and is as follows; viz.

Upon the Petition of Henry Lord Shelburne, complain- ing of an undue Election, and Return of Fleetwood Dormer, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Cheping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks:

That, upon the Poll, there was,

For the Petitioner, - - - - 32.

For the Sitting Member, - - 55.

That the Right of Election was agreed to be in the Mayor, Bailiffs, Aldermen, and Burgesses, not receiving Alms.

And the Controversy was only upon the Manner of making Burgesses.

That the Petitioner's Counsel insisted, that the Burgesses ought to be made with the Consent of the major Part of all the Burgesses, duly summoned, and assembled at the common Hall.

And the Petitioner's Counsel alledged, that they should take off so many Votes from the Sitting Member's Poll, upon the Account of their not being regularly made Burgesses, as would give the Petitioner the Majority.

' That it was objected, and Evidence given, that 21 were made Burgesses in January, 1698, at a publick House, without due Notice and Summons to several of the Aldermen, or capital Burgesses, and not at the Town Hall, where all such Meetings ought to be held; and these Burgesses voted for the Sitting Member.

That a Protestation was produced, signed by several of the Aldermen complaining of the Proceedings of the Mayor, and the other Aldermen, in the making these Burgesses.

That the making Mr. JVhart and Sir Tho. Skipwith Burgesses, at another Time, at an Entertainment at the Mayor's House without due Summons to the Aldermen, was objected to; as also the making of Alderman Shrimpton a Burgess; who was made a Burgess, and Alderman, the same Day, and in the like Manner.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Member admitted the making of the 21 Burgesses in 1698, and of Three others, who voted for the Petitioner. They said, they were made by the unanimous Consent of the Mayor, and 7 others, who are a Majority of the 15, in whom the sole Power of making Burgesses is lodged: That some of the Aldermen expressing a Dissatisfaction in their not being summoned, a Court was called, to meet the 25th of February following, at the Town Hall, in which all the Forms were duly observed; and, at that Meeting, those present adjourned to a publick House, near the Hall, and elected again these Burgesses, as appeared by an Entry in the Town Book.

That the Town Serjeant testified, that, by the Mayor's Order, he summoned all the Aldermen to this last Meeting; and that the Bell tolled, as usual, to give Notice of it

John Bigg, Tho. Bams, one of the Aldermen, and he, that was Mayor, when these Elections were made, gave Evidence, as to the summoning, to meet at the Town Hall, at the Second Election.

That in the Petitioner's Counsel's Reply they observed, that the same Persons were the Electors, and present at both Elections, and no other.

That, upon the Whole, the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Fleetwood Dormer, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Cheping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks.

The said Resolution, being read a Second lime, was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Mr. Bromley also (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of Andover, in the County of Southampton, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

Election.

i Ann. 28 Janu 149

“ That the Right of Election of Burgesses, to serve in “ Parliament for the Borough of in the County

“ of Southampton, is in the Bailiff, and select Number of “ Burgesses only.”

Whereupon the Committee came to the following Resolutions:

Resolved, That it 13 the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of Election of Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of in the County of

Southampton, is in the Bailiff, and select Number of Burgesses only.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That John Smith, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Andover.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That Francis Sheppard, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Andover.

The said Resolutions, being severally read a Second time, were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Mr. Bromley also (according to Order) reported, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, the Matter, as it appeared to them, touching the Election for the Borough of Plympton in the County of Devon, and the Resolutions of the Committee thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and are, as follow j viz.

Upon the several Petitions of Richard Hele, John JVilliams, and Richard Strode, Esquires, complaining of an undue Election and Return of Richard Edgcomb and Tho. Jerv Esquires, to serve in

Parliament for the Borough of Plympton, in the County of Devon:

That, upon the Poll, the Numbers were thus:

For Mr. Edgcombe 52.

For Mr. Jervoise, 46.

For Mr. Hele, 41.

For Mr. JVilliams, 27.

For Mr. Strode, 5.

That it was agreed, that the Right of electing Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Plympton, was in the Freemen of the Borough: And the Petitioners Counsel insisted, that none, but the Sons of Freemen, when they attained their Age of 18 Years, by the Constitution and Custom of the Borough, ought to be made free: The Counsel for the Sitting Members affirmed, that no Persons whatsoever had any Right to be made free, but that the Corporation might make free, whom they pleased.

John JVitchalls, Nich. Sparke, two very old Men, gave

Testimony, that they had never remembered any, till of late, made free, besides the Sons of Freemen.

John JValtham said, that only the Sons of Freemen used to be made free; but that himself with several other Foreigners, were made free about 26 Years since, to serve Mr. Treby, and had voted in all the Elections, except the first; in which they did not, because they were made free after the Teste of the Writ. That, in the Year 1700, the Aldermen agreed to make each one Freeman: That they had yearly Two Courts in this Borough; one of which is called the Fulfilling Court; and the Town-clerk then gives it in Charge to the Jury, to present the Names of all the Sons of Freemen, above the Age of 18 Years; who are summoned to come in, and take up their Freedom.

Mrs. Mary Spark said, she had known Plympton above 40 Years, and her Husband, who had been Mayor 3 or times; and that it was usual for Freemen's Sons, at 18 Years of Age, to come to the Fulfilling Court, and take of their Freedom; otherwise the Bailiff warns them to come, and take it up: That she has Two Sons made free, and others of her Sons have been denied, about Two Years since; and the Reason was (as Mr. Treby, the

-Voju 14.

Town-clerk, told her) because they would not vote, as the Magistrates would have them.

The Counsel for the Sitting Members called some ancient Men, who had known the Borough many Years:

Chr. Bishop, Tho. Dennis,... Davy; who said, that they looked upon no Persons to have any Bight to be made free, but such, as the Mayor and Magistrates thought fit; and that they had known several Gentlemen, viz. Sir Fra.Drake, Mr. Hilsdon, Mr. Copsall, fyc. made

free, and vote in Elections of Members, to serve in Parliament. One of them, Davy acknow-

ledged, the Jury, at the Fulfilling Court, presented the Sons of Freemen; but that it was at the Pleasure of the Mayor, and major Part of the Aldermen, whether they would make them free, or not.

That, in Reply to this Evidence, a By-law, in an ancient Book of the Corporation, was read; whereby it was declared, that, if any free Burgess born should be presented in the Borough Court, and, being warned to come to be sworn, shall not come to the Court, to be sworn, and claim his Freedom, within Three Months, he shall lose the Possibility of his Freedom, and not afterwards to be admitted thereto, but as a Stranger.

That then the Committee came to this Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of electing Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Plimpton, in the County of Devon, is in the Mayor, Bailiff, and Freemen, of the said Borough, and in the Sons of Freemen, who have a Right to demand their Freedom, and have been refused the same.

That, the Right being thus settled, the Petitioners Counsel insisted, they should add to their Poll, and take off from the Sitting Members, so many, as would give them a Majority; and called several Witnesses;

'

Henry Brooking, John JValtham; — That Edward Tutton and Nath. Blake, who were sworn Freemen, offered to vote, at the last Election, for the Petitioners, but were refused.

That the Petitioners Counsel proceeded to take off, from the Sitting Members Poll, 17, who lived at Exon, who were not the Sons of Freemen of Plimpton, and were made free after the Death of the late King; Jeremy King, Staplehill Heath, Tho. Jeffries, Rich. White, Tho. Turner, John Dodge, Ben. Hawkins, Fra. Lydston, Hugh Palmer, Edw. Evans, John Poole, Tho. Jope, Jos. Cheeke, JValter Langsford, Rob. Tristram, Robert ,

William Hull.

In the next place, Witnesses were called, to the Partiality of the Mayor and Aldermen, and their Design in making Freemen.

Henry Sparke said, that he had heard some of the Aldermen say, they would make none free, but who should vote against Mr. Hele.

John Peirce said, that Alderman Martin, about Six Weeks before the Election, offered him his Freedom, if he would vote against Mr. Hele.

Tho. Perryman said, he asked Mr. Treby, why he made so many Strangers free; and he told him, he would make more, if they were not enough.

Agnes Huntsman said, that there were about 20 Freemen at Dinner at Mr. Aldwyris, about a Fortnight before the Election; and that she saw her Mistress change Two G uineas for Mr. Edgcombe and Mr. Terr owe, after Dinner; and she saw Mr. Edgcombe, put a Crown into one Lang's Hand, and another Crown into the Hands of another, that dined there; and, when the Reckoning was collected, P p they

28° Januarii. A. 1702.

they all paid Crowns a-piece; whereas some of them, she believes, were not worth a Crown; and Mr. Crocker then said, “ What we have done now, they can't call Bribery.” She said further, that she saw Mr. Jervoise put a Crown into the Hands of Roger Crossman, another of them that dined there; and said, he hoped, he would vote for him.

Tho. Freest/ said, that Alderman asked him for

his Vote, and told him, if he would vote for Mr. and Mr. Edgcombe, there was to$. for him: That he took

the 10 s. and was to give an Answer in Three Days. He said, afterwards Mrs. Aldwiti asked him to vote for the Sitting Members, and offered him a Guinea; and Mr.

Alduin coming in, said, what his Wife had promised, he would make good.

In Answer to this Evidence, the Sitting Members Counsel called

Diana Bunsole; who said, That Thomas was

her Father-in-law; and that she knew Mr. owed

him 20 s.and she heard Freest) say, he had received 10 of him: That Freest) told her, he had promised to vote for Mr. Hole, if Mr. Roche would pay a Debt of 18/. he owed to one Lee; and that he had some Place in the Prize Office, which was procured for him by Mr. Hele and Mr. Roches means.

Mary Frecsy said, that, about a Week before the Election, Mrs. Aldwinseut for her, and pressed her to persuade lier Husband to vote for the Sitting Members, and she would give her 5 /. and allow her a Year's Rent in one of her Houses.

That the Petitioners Counsel excepted to Eight others, who lived some Distance from the Town, and had been made free within 2 or 3 Years; viz. Philip Avant, Hugh Price, Tho. Edwards, John Dunning, Mr.

Wroth, James Leer, Mr. PhCrocker, Rich. chetts.

That the Sitting Members Counsel, in Answer to this Evidence, alledged, that the making neither the 8, nor

o o '

the 17, free, was done with any Regard to the Sitting Members; and that the Petitioners, and their Agents, had been guilty of Treating, and other indirect Practices: To which they called several Witnesses.

Andrew Davy said, that formerly there was a Yarn Market in Plimpton; and that these Men were

great Traders in the Woollen Manufacture; and they hoped, the making these Men free would be of some Advantage, in the Recovery of that Trade: But being asked to name such, as were considerable Traders in the Woollen Manufacture, he could name but one; viz. Tho. Jeffries.

He said, of the Exeter Men, that were made free, Mr. Rich. Wood voted for both the Petitioners, and Mr. Car-heel'and Mr. Evans voted for Mr. Hele; and that they were not objected to.

Mr. Pollexfen said, that about the 1 oth of April, there

being a Discourse of a new Parliament, the Town proposed to him, to chuse his Son, and wrote a Letter to him upon that Occasion: That, in July, going thro' the Town, some of the Aldermen acquainted him, they intended to chuse Mr. Jervoise and Air. Edgcombe, Mr. Hele having disobliged them, liecause he would not be satisfied to be chose himself, unless he might bring in, whom he pleased, with him.

Tho. Watts said, that, before the last Election, he was drinking with Brooking, and others, and was sent for by Mr. Hele; and, when he came, Mr. Hele asked him for his Vote; and that, telling Mr. Hele, he was under some Confinement, by reason that he owed Mr. Waltham 30 s. Mr. Hele bill him not trouble himself, for, if he would vote for him, he would take it off; and that he voted for Mr. Hele upon this Promise; but Mr. Waltham, since Christmas, had sent for the Money. He said, this was spoke, when Mrs. Wa It ham and Mrs. Sparks were present, and in a little Room; but Mr. Hele whispered to him; and Mr. Hele said, he had ordered Lux to give them what Drink they would; and that there was drinking with him, besides Brooking, Wa. Warren, Arthur Cook, Tho.

sey, Roger Hingston, and Henry Brooking; and he saw no Money then paid: And that Mr. Rock told Freesey, if he would vote for Mr. Hele, he would take care of him, and his Family; and that Frecsy afterwards told him, Mr. Roch had helped him to his Place in the Prize Office, and, he believed, any of Mr. Hele's Friends might have the like: And Freesy owned, he had a Place by Mr. Roche's means.

That then, at the Instance of the Petitioner's Counsel, Watts was confronted by Mrs. Waltham and Mrs. Sparks. Mrs. Waltham said, she was present most of the Time, and heard Mr. Hele ask Watts for his Vote, but heard nothing said of Mr. Hole's paying Waltham's Money; but Mrs. Waltham told Watts of the Money he borrowed, and Watts said, he was ready to pay it, if she had his Note; and that there was a Discourse between them, of Watts having Air. Hele's Horse; and that Mrs. Sparkes heard

some of the Discourse. Airs. Sparkes said, she heard nothing said by Mr. Hele, of his paying the 30.?. to Waltham; but that Watts said, he was poor, and asked Afoney of Mr. Hele;and said, there was some Discourse of IVatts

having Mr. Hole's Horse; which Watts said, he remembered nothing of.

Walter Bishop said, that Air. Hele sent for him, the Day after the Election, to Mr. Waltham's House, and asked him, if he saw Mr. Edgcomb's Man give Brooking a Guinea; which, he said, he knew nothing of:‘And Air. Hele shewed him 7 or 8 Guineas, saying, he might have them, if he would say so; but he told him, he would not for 1,000/: And that afterwards he was drinking with John Vcale, and another, and was pressed by them to the same Purpose; and Henry Spark threw down Money for the Reckoning; and that he has been in the same manner pressed by Waltham, and others, since.

Air. St. John (according to Order) reported the free Occasional Conference with the Lords, upon Saturday last was Conformity..' Fortnight, upon the Bill, for preventing occasional Coniormity.

Ordered, That the said Report be entered in the Journal, and is, as followeth; viz.

THE Members of this House, who were commanded to manage the free Conference with the Lords, on Saturday, the 16th of January, did meet the Lords.

And the free Conference was begun by the Alanagers of this House; who acquainted the Lords, that the Commons had agreed to the Addition of Words, their Lordships had made to the Commons Amendments to the Lords Amendment in the 2d Skin, Line the 33d; but insisted on their Disagreement to the Lords other Amendments, and to their Lordships Clauses, marked B, C, D, and E; and therefore had desired this free Conference with the Lords, in order to preserve a good Correspondence between the Two Houses.

That the Interests of the Church and State were not to be supported without it; and [that ] the Commons might omit nothing, to maintain a good Correspondence, they had taken this Way, which has been practised w ith so good Success by their Ancestors.

That the Intent of this Bill, for preventing occasional Conformity, is only to restrain, to put a Stop to, a very scandalous Practice; which is a Reproach to Religion, gives Offence to all good Christians, and to the best among the Dissenters themselves.

That this Bill enacts nothing new: That it is only intended to make the Laws in being more effectual.

That

This Word i supplied from the Original Report of this Conference.

i Ann.

That those Laws were thought sufficient to secure our Establishment; but since the Invention, since the Iniquity, of Men bad found out Ways to evade and elude them, the Commons could never doubt, but the Lords would let those Men see, they would not be wanting, on their Part; to maintain and support it That this Bill appears to the Commons absolutely necessary, for the preventing those Mischiefs, which must prove destructive to the Church and Monarchy.

That the Commons were incapable of having any Designs, they were ashamed to own: That they designed nothing, but the Preservation of the Church of ,

and the Monarchy; and doubted not, to meet with a ready Concurrence from the Lords in these Designs.

That an established Religion, and a national Church, are absolutely necessary, when so many ill Men pretend to Inspiration, and when there are so many weak Men to follow them.

That, if a national Church be necessary, the only effectual Way to preserve it, is, by keeping the civil Power in the hands of those, whose Practices and Principles are conformable to it

That, when the Corporation Act was made, the Parliament had fresh in their Minds the Confusions and Calamities, that had been brought upon the Nation by such, as pretended to be at the same Time in the true Interests of Religion, and of their Country: That the Parliament, by that Act, and afterwards by the Test Act, thought, they had secured our Establishment, both in Church and State, and that they had provided a sufficient Barrier, to defeat and disappoint any Attempts against them, by enacting that all in Offices, should receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and Usage of the Church of England; and never imagined, a Set of Men could at any Time rise up, whose Consciences were too tender to obey the Laws, but hardened enough to break through any.

That as, upon the Resolution, the last Reign began with an Act in favour of the Dissenters, so the Commons do desire, in the Beginning of her Majesty's auspicious Reign, an Act may pass in favour of the Church of England \ that the Laws, which have been invaded, may now be effectually enforced; and that those Men may be kept out of Offices, who have shewn, they never wanted the Will, when they had the Power, to destroy the Church.

That nothing has been more misrepresented, than this

Bill.

That this Bill does not entrench on the Act of Toleration, and in no respect affects what is enacted by it.

That this Bill takes not from the Dissenters any one Privilege they have by Law.

That this Bill gives not any one Privilege to the Church of England, which is not (at least) intended her by the Laws, as they now stand.

Your Managers then acquainted the Lords, that the Commons insisted on their Disagreement to the 2d and 3d Amendments, made by the Lords in the Preamble of the Bill, and on their Disagreement to the 4th Amendment; and argued,

That a Preamble is to declare the Occasion of making a Law: It makes no Law; and, if it be proper to the enacting Clause, it is a proper Preamble.

That the Propositions, advanced in this Preamble, are these:

That, whatsoever Persons are enacted to qualify themselves, the Laws intend, should he conformable to the Church.

That, if the Laws provide, they shall receive the Sacrament, and by that iutend a Conformity; then whosoever breaks the Intention of the Law, breaks the Law, or at least evades the Law; and it is fit to provide against such Practice.

That, if it be fit, the Corporation Clause should stand in the Body of the Bill, the Lords Reason for the Amendments in the Preamble will not be of Weight.

That the Preamble mentions such Person, and such Offices; which must be the Persons, and the Offices, the Acts relate to, and can be no other.

Vol. 14.

l8l

That the Word “ enacting” can only be understood Occasional of the Laws, that do so enact; and, being relative, is still Conformity, more plain, and necessary.

That however, if the Lords had pleased, they might, by a very little Amendment, have obviated the Objection they make to these Words, by changing “ every Person!' into “ several Persons;” which would have reconciled them to the most rigid Construction.

Then your Managers acquainted the Lords, you insisted on your disagreeing to their 5th Amendment; and argued,

That the Words in the Test Act are more general and uncertain, than those in the Corporation Act; which your Managers cited, and compared.

That the Words in the Corporation Act have been there more than Forty Years, without any Inconvenience from them, or any Complaint against them, for their being too general and uncertain.

That the Inducements for passing the Corporation Act (according to the Preamble) were, that a Succession in Corporations might be perpetuated in the Hands of Persons, well affected to the King, and the established Gor vemment, and for Preservation of the publick Peace, both in Church and State.

That these were the Purposes the Commons designed in passing this Law.

That these Purposes, the Commons know, the Lords will-with them own, are very proper to be attained; and that the Commons can at no Time disown, because they can at no Time have any other.

That the Lords agree, this Bill should relate to Officer in the Test Act, because the Law intends, those Officers should be conformable; and if the Intention of that Law be the Reason to provide against such Evaders of it, the like Intention, in the Corporation Act, will serve for a Reason to provide against the Evaders of the Corporation Act.

That, by occasional Conformity, the Dissenters may let themselves into the Government of all the Corporations; and it is obvious, how far that would influence the Government of the Kingdom.

That, to separate from a Church, which has nothing in it against a Man's Conscience to conform.to, is Schism.

That Schism is certainly a spiritual Sin, without the superadding of a temporal Law, to make it an Offence.

That occasional Conformity declares, a Man's Con science will let him conform; and, in such a Man, Nonconformity is a wilful Sin: And why should occasional Conformity be allowed in Corporations, when the Lords agree, that, out of Corporations, it ought not to be allowed

That, if it be reasonable, as the Lords allow it is, that he, who hath an Office out of a Corporation, though it entitles him perhaps to very little Profit or Trust, should be conformable; it is certainly much more reasonable, that another, who is trusted with Magistracy and Power in a Corporation, and has thereby a greater Influence, should be conformable.

Your Managers insisted on your disagreeing to the Lords 8th Amendment; and argued.

That, if the Lords were pleased to consider, how much greater the Penalties in other penal Laws were, in many Instances, than in this Bill, they presumed, the Lords could not think those in this Bill excessive.

That, in laying Penalties, the Commons shall always endeavour to make them such, as shall neither tempt to Perjury, nor totally discourage Informations and Prosecutions; which, they thought, this Amendment of the Lords would do, could the Commons agree to it

Your Managers insisted on your disagreeing to the Lords 9th Amendment; and argued,

That the Punishment of Incapacity, the re-capacita-ting, and the Increase of Punishment for a 2d Offence, are warranted by many Precedents of the like Nature in other penal Laws.

Z a That

5® Februa

also 50 Fehrutmi. A. 170 *

Oeeaaienat That an Incapacity, as qualified by the subsequent Coaionnrtjr. 1 Proviso, is a very proper Punishment.

That a second Offence Is a Relapse, an Apostasy; which are Circumstances, that aggravate, and make it more heinous, than the first Offence, and therefore deserve an Increase of Punishment.

That he is indeed reduced to a very unhappy Condition, who is made incapable of serving his Prince and Country; but, in the present Case, our Prince and Country would be in a more unhappy Condition, to be served by such, whose Principles are inconsistent With the Good and Welfare of our Establishment

That the Commons could never imagine, the Lords could infer, from this Incapacity, the taking away the Toleration.

That-the Toleration was intended onlyfbr the Ease of lender and scrupulous Consciences, and not to give a Licence for occasional Conformity.

That conforming, and non-conforming, are Contradictions: Nothing hut a firm Persuasion, that our Terms of Communion are sinful, and unlawful, can justify the one; and that plainly condemns the other.

For your insisting on your disagreeing to the Clauses, marked B, C, D, and E, your Managers offered these Reasons:

That the exempting Protestant Dissenters from serving 'OflSdes, would rather establish occasional Non-conformity, (thanpreventoccasionalConformity; and therefore increase, <i©t cure, the Evil, the Bill was intended to remedy.

That the Act of Uniformity, which establishes the C&urgV «nd Practice of the Church of England, has provided for the Sermons, and 'Lectures, preached, or read, in -the U ni versilSes.

That those Sermons, and Lectures, having been in such manner provided for, it Was not thought necessary, when <tkte Acts passed in the 16th and in the 2 2d Car. to prevent and suppress seditious Conventicles (in both which Ants Conventicles are described, as in this Bill) to have -»tty particular Exceptions for them; and yet they were -never, by any Construction, taken to be Conventicles.

That the allowing an Exemption to such, as should be present at the Exereises in the foreign reformed Churches, would be to open a Door for the evading this Law.

That the Places of Governors of some Hospitals are very considerable Prefenments, and given, as such, to the Clergy of the Church of England; and the Commons can never consent, by any Law, to let in the Dissenters to the Enjoyment of thedi.

The Managers for the Lords, who spoke at this Conference, were die Lord Steward, the Earl of ,

the Bishop of Sttnm,the Lords Sommers, and Halifax.

The Substance of what was said by these Managers for the Lords, was, that the Lords were as desirous, as 4he Commons, to preserve a good Correspondence betwixt the-two Mouses.

That by-their agreeing so for, as they have done, to this Bill, they have gone a great way for the preventing the Evil, this m ;is intended to remedy; and own it to be a Scandal to Religion, that Persons should conform -only for a Place.

That the Lords do not take going to a Meeting to be a malum in se; for that-the Dissenters are Protestants, and differ from the Church of England only in some little Forms; and therefore the Lords think Loss of Office a sufficient Punishment, without an Incapacity.

That it can never be thought, those of the better Sort wiH be guilty of this Offence; if they do, they lose their Offices; and Loss of Office is a severe Penalty on inferior Officers of the Customs, or Excise, who have little else to subsist on.

That Incapacity is too great a Penalty; and that it is hard to imagine, any Offence, that is not capital, cap deserve it.

That there is no more Reason to punish this Offence with Incapacity, than to make it Felony.

That the Dissenters are not so obnoxious to the Government, as when the Corporation Act was made.

That the most considerable Part of the Dissenters are well affected to the present Constitution, and are hearty Enemies to the Queen's and the Kingdom's Enemies.

That, in some Corporations, the Lords take the Election of Members, to serve in Parliament, to be only in such, as are concerned in the Government of them; as at Buckinghami 8$c. and the Lords would not, by this Bill, deprive Men of their Birthrights.

That the Lords do not think tit to bring any greater Hardships upon the Dissenters, since great Advantages haveacCrued from the Act of Toleration.

That the Dissenters had indeed formerly been seditious and had appeared in open Rebellion: They then declared both against Church and State; but, in the greatest Extremity of the Church, they joined with her: When the Bishops were in the Tower, the Dissenters shewed, they had no Prejudice to the Church; and so they have continued to behave themselves.

That there can be no Schism, where the Differences are net in Essentials of Religion.

That the Lords apprehend an Air of Severity in this Bill; and that, though there may be something to be found fault with, yet think it not seasonable to administer Remedies.

That this Bill inflicts a second Punishment on those, who are tied from Prance, for their Religion; and though this may not be a Breach of the Act of Toleration, yet it gives a Jealousy, and cannot be proper at this Time.

That this may be used as an Argument, to justify the Persecution in France, when Protestants can scarce endure

these Men to live among them, who have been so useful to them in point of Trade, and in other Instances.

That thedisagreeingtothe Clause, relating to Hospital?, and Work-houses, seems very hard; because it is not to be imagined, these Men can be hurtful to the Government: What Hurt can there come from Dissenting Bread and -Cheese, or Presbyterian Water-gruel

That the Lords think it but equitable, to excuse the Dissenters from burdensome Offices, when they are not allowed those that are profitable.

That, if the Lords should agree to this BHl, as the Commons sent it to them, the Dissenters would lose their Votes in the Elections of Parliament; which is taking from them their Birthright, and a great Privilege.

That all those, who sit in the House of Commons, must be Churchmen; and the Difference between a Churchman, chose by Churchmen, and chose by Dissenters, is only this, that the former will be for using severer, the fetter for using gentler, Means with the Dissenters.

That the Dissenters ought to have their Liberty of Conscience; but at the same time they ought to be kept nut of Power, or any Share of the Government.

That the Act of Toleration has done good to the Church.

That the Dissenters are coming into the Church; and nothing, but terrifying Measures, can hinder them.

That the Lords are for the Clause, relating to the French and Dutch Churchesto preserve the Reputation, the Church of England has gained, of Tenderness.

That the Penalties in this Bill are much greater, than those were in any the Acts of Uniformity.

That high Penalties will encourage false Witnesses, and that Informers were very odious among the Romans.

That every Man knows the Liturgy of the Church, but none the Practice, there is such Variety in it.

And the Bishop of Sarum further added, he supposed, every Man believed the Two first of the 39 Articles; but there have been many good and learned Men, could not bring themselves up to give their Assents to some of the last

That the Preamble of this Bill is general; when divers are excepted in the Acts, to which it relates.

That the Test Act is a sufficient Measure, and comprehends all the Offices of Consequence in the Government

That the Words in the Corporation Act are general, and uncertain.

Thft an ihnoeent Man is very WfeU secured against the Penalties In the Test Act, because his complying with that Act will appear upon Record; but in this Case he has no Defence, but a negative Proof, that he was not at a Conventicle.

That it is the Apostle's Rule, Omnia; quod

bqnumest, tenete; which would be impossible, should this

Bill pass, as the Commons would have it.

That such a Law as this, in Times Of Popery, had 1 prevented the Reformation, which was: owing tooccdeiorial Conformity.

That the Test Act was made the-more severe, because the Grime1 there is of a nlixt Nature: There is an owning an Allegiance in another Pkuce.

That the Clause for the Sermons, and Lectures, in the Universities, whukl present any Misconstructions.

That the Author of that Book, CalledThe Interest of “tiHolland”which passes under the Nameof Wit, inhis

Chapter of Manufactures, says, They will never mtirely settle in England, becausethere is note Liberty of Religion.

That the Improvements of our Manufactures are much owing to the foreigners, that have come among us; which are so increased, that in the late Reign we exported a Million of Manufactures yearly, for several Years, more than in King Charles's Reign.

Your Managers, by way of Reply to these Arguments, urged by the Lords, said,

That, several of Use Lords Arguments were against the

Bill.

That the Lords had agreed to the greater Part of this £91, and therefore should confine themselves, and speak only, to their own Amendments.

That no Time could be more seasonable for this Bill, than the present; because the Church was now in no Danger of Popery, or Fanaticism; but good Laws are to be made for Posterity, and may be obtained most easily in the best Reigns.

That the Right of Election of Members, to serve in Parliament, is in those, that are concerned in the Government of the Corporations; and if they should, by this Bill, be turned out of their Employments, and consequently lose their Votes in the Elections, yet it cannot be said, they lose their Birthrights; because no Man is born a Magistrate.

That the Commons Penalty bears a just Proportion to the Offence; and that all, above One hundred Pounds, is for an obstinate persisting in the Crime.

That the Offender cannot be guilty through Inadvertency: He must offend knowingly and willingly.

That the Test Act gives 500 /. (a much greater Penalty, than that in this Act) to the Informer: Besides, that Act brings the Offender under very great Disabilities.

That an innocent Man is no more secure under the Test Act, than Under this Bill: The Question must be always upon his acting, or his not acting; winch does not depend upon this Record; and a very violent Prosecution has been known, within few Years, against ah Alderman of Worcester, a constant Conformist, only upon a Nicety,

and when there had been no Fault in the Party.

That the Tryal must be by a Jury; pot in a summary Way, before a Justice of the Peace, as in some of our penal Law's.

That it was very plfcin, good Protestants might be affected by Prosecutions upon the Test Act

That some of the Lords Arguments had been so irre-

Slar, as to defend occasional Conformity; and that your anagers were surprised, to hear a Prelate speak in Defence of such a Practice.

Then your Managers left the Bill with the Lords; and said, they hoped, the Lords would not let the Publick lose the Benefit of so good a Law.

And the Amendments, made by the Lords to the said Bill, and adhered to by their Lordships, heing severally read; and the Question being severally put thereupon, That this House doth adhere to their disagreeing with the Lords in the said Amendments;

It was resolved in the Affirmative.

The Order of the Day being read, for the House to Irish For-resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, upon feiture . the Bill, for advancing the Sale of the forfeited Estates in Ireland, and for securing such, as shall remain unsold or undisposed by the present Trustees, for the Purposes intended by the late Acts concerning the same;

To the honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled:

The State of Sir Redmond Everai'd's Case.

the County of Tipperary, in the Kingdom of Ireland, of the yearly Value of 1,700l. which, being forfeited by him was granted away by his late Majesty and 2 167 Acres, Part thereof, were sold by the Grantee to several Purchasers, to whom the Act of Resumption gaye One Third of their Purchase-money.

The last Session of Parliament Sir Redmond upon his Application, obtained an Act, requiring the Trustees, on Payment of 2,0001, to convey all the Estate, Sir John Everard was seised or possessed of the Second of November, 1688, in Trust, to raise the Sums, necessary to pay off' Incumbrances, and the said 2,000 /. and afterward in Trust for the said Sir Redmond, and his Heirs.

The Protestant Purchasers likewise obtained an Act, the same Session, which required the Trustees to permit all Purchasers under the Grantees of any forfeited Lands in Ireland, their Heirs and Assigns, to have, hold, and enjoy, the Lands, &;c. conveyed to them by the Grantees, paying Thirteen Years Purchase; in which, by the said Act, they were allowed a Discount of One other Third-part of their Purchase-money; and the Trustees were required to convey to them, and their Heirs, the said Lands, and all their Estate and Interest therein. Sir Redmond, and the Purchasers, applied to the Trustees for the Conveyance of the same Lands; and it being impossible for them to comply with the strict Words of both Acts, they did conceive it to be most consonant to Justice and Equity (the Purchasers coming in on the more valuable Consideration) to convey to Sir Redmond only that Part of his Father's Estate, which was not purchased, which consists of 3,778 Acres, let in the Year 1701 for 5.57 /. 14.V. and valued by the Surveyors at 1,118/. per Annum, subject only to 2,200l. Incumbrances(thatappears to die Trustees) and to convey to the Purchasers their Parts. In pursuance of which Resolution, Three of the Five Purchasers have paid 1,844/. 6 . lojt/. and have had their Conveyances; and the Purchasers, amongst them (in Ease of Sir Redmond) are to discharge the general Incumbrances affecting both Estates, to the Value of 1,303/. gs. and the Trustees are come to a Resolution, that 2,000 /. of the said Purchase-money shall be applied in Discharge of the said 2,000l. payable by Sir Redmond.

By this Construction, 'tis conceived, that both Acts will in a great measure have their Effects; whereas otherwise the Purchasers would be deprived of the Benefit of an Act, made expressly in their Favour.

All which is humbly submitted to your Honours.

So it was resolved in the Affirmative.

The Address is, as followeth;

Most gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Subjects,

-the Commons, in Parliament assembled (being deeply sensible, that, notwithstanding the immense Sums, which have been raised for the Service of the late War, the Nation still,labours under a vast Debt of many Millions of Money) do think it our indispensable Duty to lay before your Majesty the unhappy Causes and Instruments, which appear to us to have brought this heavy Burden upon, your People; not doubting, but your Majesty will be graciously pleased, in your great Wisdom and Goodness, to give such effectual Orders, that neither any indirect Practices shall be suffered, nor any Persons intrusted with the Administration of the public!: Affairs, who have been the Authors of all our Miseries.

We therefore humbly crave Leave to represent to your Majesty, that, during the said War, winch was carried on in Defence of the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of Europe, against the common Enemy of both, and therefore chearfully supported by the People of yet even then, when the great Necessities of the Kingdom did require a more than ordinary Frugality, there appears to have been a general Mismanagement of the publick Revenue; w'hich was principally owing to some of the great Officers of the Treasury, who, being more intent on their own private Profit, than the due Execution of their publick Trusts, did neither discharge the Duty of their own Places, nor take are, that the subordinate Officers should discharge theirs.

And we can attribute it to no other Cause, than this Remissness in the Treasury, that many Receivers, in the several Counties of England and Wales, made so long and unnecessary Delays in their respective Payments, into the Exchequer, of the Taxes, given by Parliament, and levied on your Majesty's good Subjects; by which means they made unreasonable Advantages to themselves, whilst

' the

i -

i Ann. i i0 Februarii, 180

the Publick was forced to pay great Interest, and large Premiums, not only for the want of their own Money, but, as we have great Reason to believe, many times for the Loan of it; and several Receivers, in such intermediate Time, have failed, with considerable Sums in their Hands, to the great Loss and Damage of the Publick.

Your dutiful Commons do further humbly represent to your Majesty, that great Sums of Money have been borrowed, and divers Tallies, with Interest, struck unnecessarily, upon the Assessments, and other' Parliamentary Aids, before the publick Occasions have required them; and this Practice hath been pursued, when Votes of Credit have been obtained, upon Representations, made to your Commons, of very pressing Necessities for the same; whereby many Officers of the Revenue, and their Friends, have had an Opportunity to receive great Sums for Interest, which did incur on such Tallies before their Money was paid into the Use of the Publick; for the Advantage of which Interest, we have also reason to believe, that many Accountants, who have received from the Exchequer great Sums of Money, for the Use of the Publick, did industriously delay the Payment thereof to the Seamen, and Soldiers, to whom it was due; and this seems to be the great Inducement, that made such Accountants trust great Sums of the publick Money in the Hands of Goldsmiths, and other Persons, in order to make private Advantages of it, and lend it back to the Exchequer in other Persons Names: All which tended to the great Damage of your Majesty's good Subjects, to the manifest Wrong and Discouragement of the Seamen and Soldiers, and to the great Dishonour of tint-English Nation.

This evil Practice of striking Tallies, with Interest, before the Money was paid in, was also attended with another great Inconveniency to the Publick; that, whenever the Nation had Occasion for ready Money, to answer the present Necessities of the Kingdom, many Persons, who advanced their Money upon Loan, knowing, they should have the same Advantages by Delay, as by prompt Payment, would not bring their Money into the Exchequer, for several Months after the Tallies were struck; whereby the Government was forced, in the mean time, to pay excessive Rates lor Stores, and Provisions, for the ‘Army and Navy, in regard the Merchants and Tradesmen could have no ready Money for their Goods, but remote Tallies, upon a large Discount.

And by these, and other undue Means, a very great Part of all the publick Aids were squandered away in extravagant Interest, large Premiums, and in excessive Rates for Stores, and Provisions; which has been one of the great Causes, that hath brought so heavy a Debt upon this Nation.

Cut here we cannot, in Justice, omit to acknowledge the present good Management of the Treasury; whereby, for the Honour of your Government, and the Advantage of the whole Nation, no unnecessary Tallies, with Interest, are permitted to be struck, nor more Money at any time borrowed, than the Necessities of the Nation do require; and Care is taken, for supporting the Credit of the Course of the Navy, Victualling, and other publick Offices, that all Stores and Provisions, are in good measure, provided with as great Advantage to the Publick, as if the same were purchased with ready Money: Which Frugality, and good Management, will be found to be one of the most effectual Means, to make your Majesty's Government easy at home, and to carry on a vigorous War against the common Enemy abroad.

And we humbly crave Leave further to represent to your Majesty, that, though your Commons (who were always ready to support the Dignity of the Crown) had anrtply provided all those Sums, which (according to the largest Estimates, laid before them) were thought necessary for the Occasions of the Civil List; yet, over and above the said Sums, and out of the Aids given by Parliament (which, by the Law of England, are appropriated, and ought to have been employed, to foe common Profit of the whole Realm) many large Sums of Money, during the time of such heavy Taxes upon the People, have Vor. 14.

been diverted, under the Head of secret Services, and Address — for Salaries, Bounties, and Pensions, to private Persons, Publick which (if proper to be paid at all) ought to have been sup- Accounts, plied out of the Civil List; nay, to so great a Degree did this Profuseness extend, that several Thousand Pounds were paid out of the publick Aid, to purchase great Places for the late Earl of Sunderland, and the present Earl of Albemarle: So little could your Commons depend upon the Integrity of the publick Officers; so little Regard was had, by them, to those heavy Taxes, the People lay under; that nothing less could secure the publick Money from Misapplications, than an express Clause of Appropriation; which, tho' not at all necessary for the Security of the publick Money in general, but only to direct the Application of it in some particular Cases, yet, whenever your Commons made no such particular Appropriation, they seldom failed to misapply the publick Money:

Which has been another great Cause of the heavy Debt; that lies upon the Nation.

And your Commons humbly crave Leave further to represent to your Majesty, that the ancient and established Method of accounting in your Majesty s Exchequer hath been in manner following; that is to say, The Auditor of the Receipt is to make out and transmit the Impress Rolls half-yearly to your Majesty's Remembrancer, in order to the charging and prosecuting of Accountants; which being communicated to the Auditors of the Imprest, they are to certify to the said Remembrancer, what Accountants have not brought in or prosecuted their Accounts; and thereupon the Remembrancer is obliged, every issuable Term, to issue out Process against them: So that the Auditor of the Receipt is the main Wheel, that sets all the rest a going; and when that great Officer is deficient in his Duty, it is not regular, nor indeed possible, for the rest to proceed, but ail Process against Accountants must be at a Stand, and your Majesty, and all your loyal Subjects, must extremely suffer by it. And as to the Clerk of foe Pells, he is to examine the Impress Rolls, but the Auditor is obliged to transmit them to the Remembrancer; and when, through the Neglect, or Corruption, of the said Officers, this ancient Method and Course of the Exchequer was not so strictly observed, as it ought to have been, it was expressly provided by an Act of Parliament, so lately made, as in the 8th and 9th Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King of

glorious Memory, and intituled, “ An Act for the “ better Observation of the Course, anciently used in the “ Receipt of foe Exchequer,” in these Words following; that is to say, “ That the Auditor of the Receipt shall “ transmit the ordinary Imprest Rolls half-yearly to “ the King's Remembrancer, in order to the charging “ or prosecuting of Accomptants, and shall half-yearly,

“ to wit, at Easter and Michaelmas, make out, and “ transmit to the said Commissioners of die Treasury, or “ the Treasurer for the Time being, the Declaration of “ the Receipts, Issues, and Remains, at the Exchequer,

“ for every Half-year successively: All which Matters and Things, and all other Matters and Things,

“ belonging to the Office and Duty of the Auditor of the “ Receipt, shall be faithfully and carefully done and performed by the Auditor of the Receipt, for the Time “ being, in such manner, as hath been anciently accustomed.” And it is thereby further provided, “ That “ the said Auditor do, as frequently as he thinks fit, but “ at least once in every Three Months, carefully examine “ the Tellers Vouchers for the Payments, which he al “ lows in his weekly Certificates.” But so it is, most gracious Sovereign, that, notwithstanding the plain and express Words of the said Statute, so lately made, when Charles Lord Halifax, the present Auditor of the Receipt, w-as himself a Member of that Parliament, yet he hath taken so little Care to discharge the Duty of his Office, for the Interest of your Majesty, and the Security of the Publick, that he hath not duly performed any One of the Particulars above-mentioned; and, for want of examining the Tellers legal Vouchers, the said Auditor hath manifestly deceived your Majesty, and'foe Publick, by inserting

into the weekly Certificates of the Receipts, Issues, and Remains, in the Exchequer, such Sums of Money, as were never actually and paid to the proper

Parties, nor the Crown legally discharged thereof: And as to the Impress Rolls, your Commons cannot, without Grief, observe to your Majesty, that, notwithstanding the re may be Six Impress Rolls now transmitted to the Remembrancer, yet it is well known in the said Office, that none of the said Rolls, from the Eight-and-twentieth of June, One thousand Seven hundred, exclusive, were so transmitted, till very lately, after the Two-and-twentieth of January last, and after the said Commissioners of Accounts had made their Enquiries into that Neglect, by Order of your Commons; which being long after the Time they ought to have been transmitted, the said Auditor was very far from doing his Duty in this Particular; and, by reason of this Neglect, no Charge could be made, in the mean time, upon the respective Accountants, who have received vast Sums of the publick Money, which are unaccounted for to this Day; and by this Means, notwithstanding the Impress Accountants ought annually to account within Three Months after the End of each Year, yet due Process hath not, nor indeed could issue out against them; and many Persons, who have received great Sums, by way of Imprest, from the Treasurer of the Navy, and Paymaster of the Army, are skreened from Prosecution, and, not being set in

the Exchequer, cannot be regularly called to an Account for the Moneys by them received: And we have great Reason to believe, that the Damage to the Publick, by this Neglect in the said Auditor, and his Predecessor, may amount to several Millions of Money; since by Length of Time (during which the principal Accounts have been neglected) many of the Persons, who received the said publick Monies, are either dead, or become insolvent: And the greater the Neglect of the former Auditor was, before the making the said Statute, and before the present Auditor came to his Office, the greater ought to have been his Care, to discharge his Duty, pursuant to that Law, which he himself was present at the making of, and which he has so highly neglected for the Space of Three Years, and upwards, ever since he came into the said Office, to the great Detriment of your Majesty, and all your loyal Subjects.

And notwithstanding it was also provided by another Act, made in the 4th Year of the late King William and Queen Mary, Chap. 3. That, in case any Officer of the Exchequer should demand, or take, any Fee, Gratuity, or Reward, or misapply any of the weekly Sums therein mentioned, or should not perform other Things, which by the said Act they are required to perform, they shall forfeit their Offices, and be uncapable of any Office or Place of Trust; yet the said Auditor hath acted contrary to the said Statute, and hath received several Sums of Money to his own Use, contrary to Law, and the Trust reposed in him; for all which, or any other Breaches of his Duty, as well as for those, formerly laid before your Majesty (for whose gracious Answer to our humble Address on that Occasion, we return your Majesty our most humble and hearty Thanks) we earnestly desire, your Majesty will be graciously pleased to order your Attorney-general effectually to prosecute at Law the said Auditor of the Receipt: And thus as we have seen great and good Actions rewarded by your Majesty, we doubt not, but to see all Deceits and Mismanagements duly punished; since your Comipons can propose no Benefit to themselves by all their Enquiries, unless the Laws are put in due Execution, and those, who have lived so long in Defiance of them, come at last to feel their Weight.

And by the Neglect of the said Auditor, and his Predecessor, the Auditors of the Imprest, and the Remembrancer, and other Officers of the Exchequer, have not been able to proceed in their Duty, according to the Law and Course of the Exchequer; several of which Officers have been also negligent therein; whereby all the publick Accounts of the Nation are far behind: The State whereof (as delivered in to the Commissioners of Accounts) in the Particulars hereafter mentioned, is, as followeth;

The Earl of Rand'agh, late Paymaster of your Majesty's Forces, of Onc-and-twenty Millions and upwards, received in Fourteen Years time, have passed no Account, during all the late lteign, farther than the last of December, One thousand Six hundred and Ninety, nor any other Account, farther than March, One thousand Six hundred and Ninety-two; which was not declared before the 20th of June last, and even that, upon Vouchers, which were not sufficient for a legal Discharge.

The Commissioners, for the Sick and Wounded, have brought in no Accounts, during all the late Reign, and none since, any further than the Orie-and-thirtieth of December, One thousand Six hundred and Ninety.

The late Treasurer of the Chamber, Sir Rowland

Gwyn, the late Master of the Robes, the Earl of Albemarle, and Mr. Parkhurst, Mr. Paschall, and others, Commissioners of the Prize Office, have delivered in no Accounts at all to the Auditors of the Imprest.

Jacob Vanderesche, Esquire, Paymaster of his late Ma-

jesty's Dutch Forces, hath received Three Millions Twenty-five thousand Seven hundred Fifty-three Pounds, Nine Shillings, and Six-pence, which, by Computation, is Fifty-two thousand Nine hundred and Seven Pounds, Six Shillings, and Eight-pence Farthing, more than the Pay of those Troops could have amounted to, if they had been always complete; no Deductions made from them; and upon an English Establishment, which all of them were not: And yet the said Vanderesche hath passed no Account at all; and, though often summoned, hath never appeared before the said Commissioners of the publick Accounts, but stands indebted to the said Troops in One hundred and Twelve thousand Two hundred Twenty-nine Pounds, Nine Shillings, and Eight-pence, which is now demanded, as an Arrear due to them from your Majesty, and the Publick.

The late Treasurer of the Navy, of Seventeen Millions, and upwards, received, hath brought in several Accounts to the last of December, One thousand Six hundred and Ninety-eight: His Account, for the Year One thousand Six hundred and Ninety-two, was declared the 3d Day of July last; since which the Accounts of the Three following Years only have been declared.

The said Treasurer. by Mr. Cashier of the

Victualling-office, hath passed no Account, during all the late Reign, farther than the One-and-thirtieth of December, One thousand Six hundred and Ninety-six; which was not declared till the 19th of May, One thousand Seven hundred and One; and on the Foot of that Account he remained indebted Five hundred Thirty-four thousand Twenty-seven Pounds, Three Shillings, and Three-pence.

And many other Accountants, who it would be too tedious to enumerate to your Majesty, are either far behind in their Accounts, or have never brought in any Accounts at all; insomuch that, although Forty-five Millions Five hundred Sixty-eight thousand Seven hundred Twenty-five Pounds, Nineteen Shillings, and Twopence Farthing (a Sum'never known to be raised in very many Reigns before) hath been levied on your Majesty s good Subjects, and issued out of the Exchequer to the several Paymasters and Treasurers of the Navy, Army, and Ordnance, for the Service of the late War, between the Fifth of November, One thousand Six hundred and Eighty-eight, and the Eighth of March last past (besides the several Millions of Money raised for other publick Uses) yet the far greatest Part thereof hath not been accounted for to this Day; to the great Dissatisfaction of your People, and the great Dishonour of the English Nation.

By these Neglects, and Delays, all Accounts have been rendered so intricate and confused, that the several Accountants have had great Opportunities of defrauding the Publick; the Discovery of their Frauds has been made very difficult; and p. Hindrance thereby is given to the passing all succeeding Accounts.

Hence it is, that so many publick Officers, and Accountants, have raised great Estates to themselves, at the Expence of the Publick, when it is evident, they have had no (awful Means to attain them; and several Persons,

whose

whose Duty it was to hinder such Exorbitances, measuring their Requests rather by their own Avarice, than their Merit, have obtained for themselves Grants, to such a Value, as, in foregoing Reigns, have been esteemed large Supplies towards great and publick Services: Which has been another great Cause of the Debt, that lies upon the Nation.

And your Commons do further humbly represent to your Majesty, that, notwithstanding such vast Sums, issued out to the said late Paymaster, and Treasurer, whereby your Commons had amply provided for all those Services, and for the effectual carrying on the War against France, yet they find, to their great Sorrow, that not only the Officers, but the Seamen, and Soldiers, who on all Occasions have behaved themselves bravely in Defence of their Country, have not been paid, during the late War, and that great Sums are still owing to many of them; whereas, if the publick Money had been duly applied to the Uses, for which it was given by your Commons, instead of those many Hardships, that, were endured by your Majesty's most faithful Subjects, and their Families, who served so well in your Fleets, and Armies, they would have had Justice done them, during the last War, and been encouraged more chearfully to engage themselves in this.

But, instead of Justice, we have too much Reason to believe, that those very Persons, who, by long and unnecessary Delays, had compelled them to accept of remote Tallies, and Paper Securities, have (amongst others) taken Advantage of their Necessities, and employing Brokers; to buy up those Tallies, and Securities, at a low Rate, have afterwards paid thefnselves with that ready Money, which they should at first have distributed to the Seamen, and Soldiers.

And such was the mysterious Trade upon Tallies, and Exchequer Bills, which was formerly carried on by common Brokers, betwixt the Exchange and the Exchequer, and which did, as it were, prey upon the very Vitals of the Government, and so great Gain was made thereby, at the Expence of the Publick, that vast Sums of Money were employed in it; which did very much lessen the true Trading Stock of this Nation; whereby both the Exportation of the Woollen and other Manufactures of this Kingdom, and the Importation of Bullion, and other Commodities of foreign Countries, to be manufactured in England, have been very much obstructed, to the great Prejudice of your Majesty's Customs, the Loss of the Balance of Trade, and the general Impoverishment of the whole Kingdom.

And though the said late Paymaster, and Treasurer, by long and unnecessary Delays in settling their Accounts, have, in great measure, prevented any Discovery of their undue Proceedings, and have endeavoured to protect themselves from a just and fair Account to the Nation, by Privy Seals, and other unjustifiable Warrants, surreptitiously obtained, for passing their Accounts without proper Vouchers, contrary to the Law and Course of the Exchequer; yet your Commons, by the great Fidelity and Diligence of the said Commissioners, for taking, examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, have not only discovered the several Mismanagements above-mentioned, but also some of the unwarrantable Proceedings, used by the said late Paymaster of your Majesty's Forces; by whom a considerable Part of the Alone}', which came to his hands, and which ought not to have been applied to any other Purpose, than the Payment of the Army, hath been diverted to his own and to other private Uses; for all which, upon a full and fair Hearing in his own Defence, lie hath justly incurred the Censure of this House, and been declared guilty of a high Crime and Misdemeanor.

And we find, to our unspeakable Grief, whilst his late Majesty was engaged in the Prosecution of the glorious Design of preserving the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of Europe, and was thereby necessitated to commit the Care of the publick Affairs in this Kingdom to particular Ministers, whereof a very few were more par-Vol. 14s

ticularly intrusted with the chief Administration, and who Address — have been the great Causes of all the unhappy Differences Pobhck amongst us, this general Mismanagement of the publick Accounts Affairs did actually spread itself over the whole Kingdom, and seems to be owing (amongst other Things) to a Disposition of Offices and Places, where Men were rather chosen for their Inclinations to serve a Party, than for their Qualifications to serve the Publick.

And these Men, being conscious to themselves of the many Frauds and Offences committed against the Publick, have no other Hopes to shelter themselves from Justice, but by taking away the Reputation of those, who desire to do Right to their Country, by detecting their Iniqui? ties; and being united in Guilt, and Interest, they endeavour to amuse and impose upon those, whose Posterity, we have too much Reason to fear, will groan under the sad Effects of the Wickedness of the one, and the too great Credulity of the other.

These, dread Sovereign, are divers of the Causes of those Mischiefs, your Kingdom suffereth by the late Mismanagements, and which your loyal Commons could not omit thus humbly to represent, in all dutiful Manner, without being unfaithful to your Majesty, and to the Country, by whom they are intrusted.

From hence your Majesty will be graciously pleased to take Notice, that the great Debt, which lies upon the Nation, and all the Arrears, which are owing to your Majesty's Forces, do not arise so much from the Deficiencies of the Funds, as for want of Care in the Management, and Fidelity in the Application, of them.

But since it hath pleased Almighty God to place your sacred Majesty on the royal Throne of your Ancestors, we have so intire a Confidence in your Majesty's Goodness, that we can no longer fear to see the publick Revenue mismanaged, or misapplied, the Accounts neglected, or the Forces unpaid; and we chearfully depend on your Majesty's Wisdom, that all our Grievances, by your Grace and Favour, will in due time be redressed, and removed, by punishing those, who have been the Causes of them, and by instrusting none in the Administration of the publick Affairs, who, for their own private Advantage, have manifestly contributed to the Calamity of their Country.

This, most gracious Sovereign, will be the onl v effectual Means to prevent tl>« like Mismanagement for the future, and thereby to make your Majesty's Reign happy at home, and prosperous abroad.

This will be the best Means to enable and encourage your dutiful Commons to raise those Supplies, which shall be necessary to support your Majesty against all your Enemies.

And we humbly crave Leave, upon this Occasion, to repeat our Assurances to your Majesty, that we will always stand by and assist your Majesty, to the utmost of our Power, in preserving the established Government, both in Church and State, maintaining the ancient Glory of the English Nation, and in defending the Liberties of Europe against the boundless Ambition of France.

Resolved, That the said Address be presented to her Majesty by the whole House.

Ordered, That such Members of this House, as are of her Majesty's most honourable Privy Council, do humbly know her Majesty's Pleasure, when she will be attended by this House.

Their Lordships, or any Five of them, are to meet Tomorrow, at Ten a Clock in the Forenoon, in the Prince's Lodgings, near the House of Peers; and to adjourn, as they please.

It is Ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, That the Queen's Remembrancer do bring to the Lords Committees, appointed to consider of the Observations, delivered by the Commissioners of Accounts, Tomorrow, at Ten a Clock, the imprest Rolls, transmitted to him since the 20th of April, 1697.

It is Ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, That the Commissioners for pub-' lick Accounts have Notice, that this House hath appointed a Committee, to consider of the Observations, delivered into this House by them, Tomorrow, at Ten a Clock in the Forenoon, in the Prince's Lodgings near the House of Peers.

Die Mercurii, 30 Februarii, 1702.

THIS Day Mr. Barker, Deputy to her Majesty's Remembrancer, brought the other imprest Rolls, as ordered Yesterday; which were delivered to the Committee.

The Duke of Somerset reported, that the Lords Committees, appointed to consider of the Observations from the Commissioners of Accounts, that they had taken the First Observation into Consideration, in relation to the Auditor of the Exchequer; and that the Commissioners of Accounts had Notice of the Committee's sitting, yet none of them attended; and therefore the Committee is of Opinion, that a Message be sent to the House of Commons, that they may have Leave to attend: To which the House agreed.

Then a Message was sent to the House of Commons, by Sir John Pranklyn, and Sir Richard to acquaint

them, that this House hath appointed a Committee, to consider of the Observations in the Book of Accounts, lajd before this House, by the Commissioners of Accounts, the 15th of January last, and also those, delivered Yesterday from the said Commissioners: That the Committee met Yesterday in the Morning, and had proceeded upon the first Observation, and the additional Observation, relating to the Auditor of the Receipt of the Exchequer; and those Commissioners being Members of the House of Commons, the Lords do desire, that the House would give Leave, that those Commissioners, or some of them, should attend the said Committee, on Friday next, at Ten a Clock in the Forenoon.

Die Jocis, 4“ Februarii, 1702.

THE Messengers, sent to the House of Commons Yesterday, return Answer, That the Commons will send an Answer by Messengers of their own.

Die Veneris, 5 Februarii, 1702.

HIS Grace the Duke of Somerset reported from the Lords Committees, appointed to consider of the Observations, delivered into this House from the Commissioners of Accounts, that the said Commissioners had not attended the Committeej but, upon Consideration of the whole Matter, the Committee had ordered him to report, as followeth:

The Committee appointed to consider of the Observations in the Book of Accounts, delivered into this House

the

Examidifig Members by Lords.

13° Februarii. . 1702.

Examining the 15th Day of January last, and the 2d of this Instant Lord February, have made some Progress in considering the said Observations, and do humbly take Leave to acquaint the House, that they have examined into the first of those Observations, and also the further Observation, delivered into this House the 2d Instant, relating to the transmit ting the ordinary imprest Rolls to the Queen's Remembrancer: They have inspected several of the original imprest Rolls, delivered into the House by Mr.

Deputy to her Majesty's Remembrancer; they also examined divers Officers of the Exchequer, and others, upon Oath, and do find, that, by the ancieut and uninterrupted Course of the Exchequer, two imprest Rolls are to be made out for each Year; the one comprehending all Sums imprest from the End of Trinity Term, to the End of Hilary Term, the other containing all such Sums from that time, to the End of Trinity Term; which Rolls are commonly called half-yearly Rolls, though improperly: They find, that, by the ancient Course of the Exchequer, these imprest Rolls, being made out by the Auditor of the Receipt, are to be delivered by him to the Clerk of the Pells, whose Duty it is to examine and sigu them; and this being done, the Clerk of the Pells delivers them to the Remembrancer.

This Usage was, by Degrees, discontinued in the Reign of King Charles the Second; and the Remembrancer, or his Agent, used to come to the Office of the Auditor of the Receipt, and take aw ay the imprest Rolls from thence immediately; but in the Time, w hen the Earl of llochester was Treasurer, the ancient Usage was restored; and he did order, that the imprest Rolls should be carefully examined and signed by the Clerk of the Pells, before they should be transmitted to the Remembrancer; and accordingly, since that Time, the anaent Custom has been observed, as well before, as since, the Act of Parliament, made in the Eighth and Ninth Year of his late Majesty, for the l>etter Observation of the Course, anciently used in the Receipt of the Exchequer; that is to say, the said half yearly Rolls, when made out, and signed by the Auditor, have been by him transmitted to the Clerk of the Pells; and when the Clerk of the Pells has examined and signed them, he, or his Deputy', has delivered them to the Remembrancer: And this appears by the Remembrancer's Endorsements upon the Rolls.

The Committee finds, that Charles Lord Halifax has been Auditor of the Receipt, from the End of November 1(199; since which Time Six imprest Rolls have been -transmitted to the Remembrancer; and there is a Seventh Roll now under Examination of the Office of Pells; and no other Roil can be prepared till after the Twelfth of this Instant February.

Upon the whole Matter, the Committee are humbly of Opinion, that Charles Lord Halif ax, Auditor of the Receipt of the Excliequer, hath performed the Duty of his Office, in transmitting the ordinary imprest Rolis to the Queen's Remembrancer, according to the ancient Custom of the Exchequer, and the Direction of the Act 8, and 9, GulitMi Tertii llcgis, intituled, An Act for the better

Observation of the Course, anciently used in the Receipt of the Exchequer; and that he hath not been guilty of any Neglect, or Preach of Trust, upon that Account.

Which Repoit being read, as also the Examinations taken upon Oath by the Committee; as also the Dates and Endorsements of the several imprest Rolls, delivered, by Mr. Barker, Deputy to the Queen's Remembrancer; it was proposed to agree with the Opinion of the Committee, in this Report.

Then the Question was put. Whether this House will agree to the Opinion of the Committee in this Report?

It was resolved in the Affirmative.

It is Resolved and Declared by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, That Charles Ix>rd Halifax, Auditor of the Receipt of the Exchequer, hath performed the Duty of his Office, in transmitting the ordinary imprest Rolls to the Queen's Remembrancer, according to the ancient Custom of the Excliequer, and the Directions of the Act 8 and 9 Tertii

Regis, intituled, An Act for the better Observation of

the Course, anciently used in the'Receipt of the Exchequer; and that he hath not been guilty of any Neglect, 0 % Breach of Trust, upon that Account.

It is Ordered, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled. That the Proceeding of the House, and of the Committee, appointed to consider of the Observations in the Book of Accounts, delivered into this House the 15th of January last, and the 2d Day of this-Instant February, and the Resolution of this House there-' upon, shall be forthwith printed and published.

It is Ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled,-That it shall be, and is hereby, referred to the same Committee, w ho are appointed to consider of die Observations of the Commissioners of Accounts, to draw up, and give Directions, what shall be printed and published.

The Committee has also inspected the Journals of this House, and what they conceive to be most material, is in the Journal, beginning the 2 2d of October, 1691; and in the Journal, beginning the 3d of December, 1697; to which they humbly refer themselves, and desire, those Passages may be read: W hich were read accordingly, and are, as follow; viz.

Veneris, 29 die Januarii, 3‘Gulielmi et Mari®.

MIL Herbert reports, that the Members, appointed, had prepared Reasons, to be offered at a Conference with the Lords, touching the Amendments, made by their Lordships to the additional Bill, for die appointing and enabling Commissioners to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom; which Reasons they had directed him to report to the 1 louse: And which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Table; where the same were read, and agreed unto by the House, and are, as follow;

1. This Bill is for reviving the Act, passed in the last Session, in order to perfect the stating of the Accounts, in which the Commissioners, named by the Commons, have already mtide a considerable Progress.

2. In all Acts, that have ever passed, for taking Accounts of publick Money, the Commissioners have been always named by the Commons only: And, in particular, in an Act passed 19 Car. 2. intituled, An Act for taking the Accounts of the several Sums of Money, therein mentioned; which Act impowers the Commissioners, therein named, to take Account, not only of Money, granted by the Commons, but also other Sums of the publick Revenue: And although that Act requires an Account to be given to the King's Majesty, and to both Houses of Parliament; yet all the Commissioners, thereby constituted, were named solely by the Commons.

3. The Commons, by this Bill, appoint those, whom they name Commissioners, to do that out of Parliament, which, during the Session of Parliament, is the proper Work of the House of Commons; in whom, by the Law's and Customs of the Kingdom, the Power of granting Supplies to the Crown is vested, as an essential Part of their Constitution; and the taking and examining the Accounts thereof is of Right in them also; and they being the Representatives of all the Commons, no Commoner can be named, but by them.

4. The Disposition, as well as granting Money, by Act of Parliament, hath ever been in the House of Commons; and these Amendments, relating to the Disposal of Money to the Commissioners, added by the Lords, do intrench upon that Right: And therefore the Commons, for these Reasons, do disagree with their Lordships in all their Lordships Amendments to the said Bill.

Resolved, That a Conference be desired with the Lords, upon the Subject-matter of the Amendments, made by the Lords, to the said BilL

Ordered, That Mr. Herbert do, upon Monday Morning next, go to the Lords, and desire the said Conference.

Conference, upon the Amendments made by their Lordships to the Bill, intituled, An additional Act, for appointing and enabling Commissioners to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, the Lords do agree to a Conference presently, in the Painted Chamber.

Ordered', That the Members, who prepared the Reasons, to be offered at the said Conference, do manage the said Conference.

And the Managers went to the Conference accordingly:

And being returned;

Mr. Herbert reported, that they had attended the Conference, and given the Reasons, why this House doth not agree with the Lords in the said Amendments.

Veneris, 5 die Februarii, 30 Gulielmi et Mari®.

A Message from the Lords, by Sir Miles Cooke, and Sir James Astry:

Mr. Speaker,

The Lords do desire a Conference with this House, this Morning, at Eleven a Clock, in the Painted Chamber, upon the Subject-matter of the last Conference.

And then the Messengers withdrew.

Resolved, That the House doth agree to a Conference with the Lords, as they desire.

And the Messengers were called in again, and Mr. Speaker acquainted them therewith.

Ordered, That the Members who managed the last Conference, do manage this Conference.

Then the Managers appointed, w®nt to the Conference:

And being returned;

Sir Joseph Tredenham reports, that they had attended the Said Conference; and that the Lord Rochester managed the Conference, on the Part of the Lords, and acquainted them, that the Lords had desired this Conference, for the Continuance of the good Correspondence between the Two Houses; and that the Lords werfe not satisfied with the Reasons, given by this House, touching the Amendments to the Bill, intituled, An additional Act, for appointing and enabling Commissioners to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom; and that they do insist on all their Amendments to the Bill; and that, in Answer to the Reasons, given by this House, against the said Amendments, the Lords gave the Reasons following; viz.

To the First and Second Reasons, offered by the Commons, the Lords answer, that the Commissioners, named by the Commons, having already made some Progress in the stating the Accounts, the naming of some new ones can be of no Prejudice to the perfecting that Work, the Nature of taking and stating Accounts being such, that new Men, being joined with others, may be vety capable of going on with the Remainder of that Work.

The Lords do agree, that in the Act, passed in the 19th of King Charles the 2d, for taking Accounts, the Commissioners, thereby constituted, were named by the Commons, and the Lords did agree to it, both because they approved of the Number, and Quality, of the Persons, and because, they being not Members of the House of Commons, they might always be sent for, at the Pleasure of the Lords, to explain dny Matters relating to those Accounts; but the Lords having now had Experience by the last Act, which constituted no Commissioners, but only such, as were of the- House of Commons, that their Lordships cannot have those Commissioners at any time before them, to answer such Questions, or explain such Doubts, as their Lordships tnay have Occasion to enquire into; or even to intimate such Point9, as seem to have been omitted, either in the Accounts, or the Observation, made thereupon, is one very great Reason, why the Lords have found it necessary to mime such ih this Bill, as their Lordships may, from time td time, receive Informations from; without which, their Lordships examining into the Accounts, Will prove defective, and dilatory.

To die Third and Fourth Reasons their Lordships reply, that they are unwilling to enter into any Dispute with the Commons, what is the propet Work of either House,

Vol. 14.

in relation to the granting Supplies to the Crown, Examining

or taking or examining the Accounts thereof, because Members by

they would avoid any Controversies, of that kind, w ith Loids-

the House of Commons, especially at this time, having,

by Experience, found, that such Debates have frequently

been attended with ill Consequences to the Publick; but,

upon tills Occasion, their Lordships conceive, 'tis very

plain, that, since this Bill provides, that the Accounts

shall be laid before the Lords, it must be likewise owned,

that it is the proper Work of this House to examine them.

And by no means can their Lordships acquiesce in the Reason, given by the House of Commons, that they being the Representatives of all the Commons, no Commoner can be named, but by them; because that would, by the same Parity of Reason, deprive their Lordships of the Power of assigning Counsel to any Man, impeached by the House of Commons, which, in case of Misdemeanour, they have always done; and by the late Bill, for regulating Trials in Cases of Treason, it was agreed by both Houses, that Counsel should be allowed in Cases of Treason, even upon Impeachments; which Counsel must have been assigned by the Lords, and out of the Commoners.

Lastly, the House of Lords cannot allow the Disposition, as well as Granting, of Money, by Act of Parliament, to have been solely in the House of Commons; and much less can their Lordships consent, that the Lords have not always had a Right of naming any Persons, to be employed in the publick Service by Act of Parliament, and assigning them such Salaries for their Pains, out of the Exchequer, as should be agreed on in that Act of Parliament.

And, for these Reasons, their Lordships do insist on all their Amendments to the said Bill.

And, after Consideration had of the said Report, it M'as Resolved, That this House doth insist upon their Disagreement with the Lords in the Amendments to the said Bill.

Resolved, That a free Conference be desired with the Lords, upon the Subject-matter of the last Conference.

Ordered, That the Members, who managed the last Conference, do meet tins Afternoon, at Four a Clock, in the Speaker's Chamber, and prepare for the said Conference.

Sabbati, 6° die Februarii, 3 Gulielmi et Mari®.

ORDERED, That Sir Joseph Tredenham do go to the Lords, and desire a free Conference with the Lords, upon the Subject-matter of the last Conference.

Sir Joseph Tredenham reported, that he having (according to Order) been to desire a free Conference with the Lords, upon the Subject-matter of the last [<z] Conference, the Lords do agree to a free Conference accordingly, and appoint the same upon Monday Morning next, at Twelve a Clock, in the Painted Chamber.

THE Managers, appointed, went to the free Conference, desired on Saturday last, w ith the Lords, upon the Subject-matter of the last Conference:

And being returned;

Sir Joseph Tredenham reports, that they had attended the said free Conference, according to the Order of the House, and acquainted the Lords, that this House had insisted on their disagreeing with their Lordships in the Amendments to the Bill, for appointing and enabling Commissioners to examine; take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom.

Mcrcurii, 10 die Februarii, 30 Gulielmi et Mari®.

A Message from the Lords, by Sir John Frattcklyn, and Sir Robert Legat'd:

Mr. Speaker,

The Lords do desire a free Conference with this House, at One a Clock, in the Painted Chamber, upon the Subject-matter of the last free Conference.

And then the Messengers withdrew.

[a] The Word “ free" is in this Dace inserted in the Journal by Mistake, the Conference, here mentioned, not having been a free Conference, and in the Journal of the 6th of February, 3 IV. M. (from whence this Entry is transcribed) being stiled only “ the last Con-, ference."

Resolved, That this House doth agree to a free Conference with the Lords, as they desire.

And the Messengers were called in again, and Mr. Speaker acquainted them therewith.

Sir Eduard Seymour reports, that the Managers had attended the free Conference; and that the Lord Rochester managed the-same, on the Part of the Lords, and brought the Bill, and read the Title of it, for appointing and enabling Commissioners to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts- of the Kingdom; and acquainted them, that the Reasons, given at the last Conference, had been reported to the Lords, and that they bad had due Consideration of them; but that, notwithstanding, they did not depart from their Amendments to the Bill, but did adhere to their Amendments; and delivered the Bill, and Amendments back again.: And the same were brought up to the Table.

Ordered, That a Report of the Two last'free Conferences be made to the House upon Saturday Morning next.

Sahbati, 130 die Februarii, 3 Gulielmi ct Marise.

SIR Joseph Trcdenham (according to the Order of the

Day) reports the Two last free Conferences with the Lords, as followeth:

That the Conference was begun by the Managers for the Commons; who acquainted their Lordships, that the Commons had desired this free Conference, to preserve that good Correspondence, which had hitherto continued between the Two Houses.

That they had solemnly and deliberately considered their Lordships Amendments to a Bill, from the Commons (intituled, An Act for appointing Commissioners, to examine and state the publick Accounts of the Kingdom) and the Reasons, which induced their Lordships to insist on those Amendments, but had not found them sufficient to convince them; and they still disagree with the Lords in those Amendments, and insisted on that Disagreement.

That the particular Knowledge the Commons had of the Commissioners, named in the Bill, recommended them to the Nomination; and the Progress, those Commissioners have already made in stating those Accounts, hath justified the Commons good Opinion of their Abilities and Integrity.

That to add new Commissioners, must of Necessity delay the perfecting this Work, and would hazard the rendering the Bill (which continues only for a Year) ineffectual; for the Commissioners, proposed in their Lordships Amendments, will find themselves, by their Oath, and to answer their Lordships Expectations, obliged to inform themselves, as well of what hath already undergone the Scrutiny of the present Commissioners, as in those Particulars, which shall hereafter become the Subject of their Euquiry; and that such Retrospect canuot be consistent with the Dispatch the Bill requires.

That, in Answer to their Lordships Argument, derived from the Quality of the Commissioners, named in the Bill, it was demanded, whether their Lordships could have any Assurance, that the Commissioners, they proposed, will not be elected in the Vacancy of this, nor in any succeeding Parliament, wherein these Accounts may be required? Should that happen, their Lordships Amendments would not be useful to attain to the End intended.

That the Commons could not determine, how far the Quality of the Commissioners, named in the Act of Accounts made in 19® Car. II. prevailed with their Lordships in agreeing the reto: There was, indeed, no Member of the Commons of that Committee, which met at Brook-house, with great Reputation; but how little they effected, how soon they were dissolved, and how the Fruits of their Labours became abortive, is fresh in Memory.

That, from thenceforth, the Commons, with better Success, reposed T rusts, of this N atui e, in their own Members: Of such were the Committee for disbanding the Army, constituted 31 Car. II. Such are the Commissioners in the Act, whereunto this Bill relates. It might, with as

' 17024

good Logick, be argued, that their Lordships agreed to those last-recited Acts, because the Commissioners, therein named, were then Members of the House of Commons, as, that their Lordships were induced to an Agreement with the Commons in the Nomination of the Commissioners of Brook-house, because they were not of the House of Commons. But, upon this Variety in the Precedents, it may be more reasonably inferred, that their Lordships have from time to time agreed to the Commissioners, named by the Commons, without respect to their Quality, and because the Right of such Nomination is in the Commons only.

That the Measures, by which both Houses are to

Sivern themselves, are derived either from Precedent, or eason: Their Lordships had not offered any Precedent in Justification of insisting on those Amendments. If there be any Force in the Argument, their Lordships derive from the Clause in this Bill, which provides, that the Accounts shall be laid before the King, and both Houses of Parliament, it extends as well to vest a Right in their Majesties to nominate such Commissioners, as in their Lordships; for it equally relates to both.

That the Title and Design of the Bill is, to appoint Commissioners, to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom; which, during the Session of Parliament, is the proper Work of the House of Commons; and no Inference can be more natural, than that it is in the Commons only to name Commissioners for the Exercise of that Authority, which is an essential Part of their Constitution.

That they desired to know the End, their Lordships would propose to themselves by such Enquiry. Should any Misapplication of Money, or Default of Distribution, appear in these Accounts, their Lordships cannot take Cognizance thereof originally, nor otherwise, even in their judicial Capacity, than at the Complaint of the Commons: Should a Failure or Want of Money appear, it is not in the Lords to redress it; for the Grant of all Aida is in the Commons only.

That such Enquiry can only be of Use to the Commons, to direct their future Supplies; and herein the last Commission proved useful this Session, the Commons supplying the Defects of die Fund upon the Expences in the Excise. If there be a Redundancy, the Commons only can apply it to the Charge of the ensuing Year; if there be discovered Misapplications, or undue Preferences, the Commons only can frame the Accusations, and lay them before their Lordships, for Judgment

That the Managers added, that, though this Bill be thought so useful at this Time, as cannot be sufficiently expressed, yet nothing can be of greater Importance to the Publick, than the maintaining the just and distinct Rights and Privileges, which each Estate of this Kingdom enjoys, according to our Constitution: The Lords have many high Privileges, to recommend their Lordships to the Favour of their Prince, and to support their Figure in the Government; but the Commons have little, besides this One, of giving Money, and granting Aids: This is their undoubted and inherent Right; and therefore every thing, that intrenches on that, the Commons may be allowed to be extremely jealous of.

That the Liberty of naming Commissioners, to take Account of the publick Money, is a necessary Dependance of this Right, is evident, if their Lordships will consider that, when any Aids are given, the Commons only do judge of the Necessities of the Crown, which cannot otherwise be made manifest to them, than by enquiring, how the Money, which hath been granted, and Revenue of the Crown, expended and applied. If the several Branches of the publick Revenue are rightly considered, it will be found, there is some particular Use, to which they are originally assigned. There are some necessary Charges incumbent on the King, in the Administration of the Government, which these Supplies arc to defray; there is no Fund set aside for Contingencies, no Provision made for casual and incident Charges; but all extraordinary Expences require an extraordinary Supply; and when the

Commons

13° Febru.

I Ann. . 130 Februarii. 199

Commons do think fit to erect such a Commission, the Expence, made in the Execution of it, must, soon or late, be drawn from the Purse of the People; and, since the Burden must inevitably light upon their Shoulders, they only can be Judges of the Weight, which is fit to be imposed, and to assign the Quantum of the Charge, which, in this Case, is proportionable to the Numbers of the Commissioners: So that this doth not only relate to this undoubted Right of the Commons, but doth finally end in raising of Money itself; which being a Privilege, derived to them from their Ancestors, and continued by the uninterrupted Practice of all Ages, 'tis a Right, the Commons can never depart from, but must for ever assert, support, and maintain.

For that, although the Lords, in the Preamble of the Third Reason, seem to wave the Dispute; yet having in their last Reason disallowed the Right of the Commons, in granting, limiting, and disposing, publick Aids, the Commons think it of highest Concern, that this Affair, being the main Hinge of the Controversy, should be cleared and settled.

That the ancient Manner of giving Aids was by Indenture, to which, Conditions were sometimes annexed; the Lords only gave their Consent, without making any Alteration . And this was the continued Practice, until the latter End of Henry the Fifth, and, in some Instances, until Henry the Seventh.

That in the famous Record, called, “ The Indemnity of the Lords and Commons,” settled by the King, Lords, and Commons, on a most solemn Debate, in 9® Hen. IV. it is declared, That all Grants and Aids are made by the Commons, and only assented to by the Lords.

That the modern Practice is, to omit the Lords out of the granting, and name them Parties only to the enacting, Clause of Aids, granted to the Crown; to which their Lordships have always concurred, and, on Conferences, departed from their Attempts of petty Alterations in Acts relating the reunto.

That, if then all Aids be by the Grant of the Commons, it follows, that the Limitation, Disposition, and Manner, of Account, must likewise belong only to them.

And that, although the Account, then stated, was ordered, by 19 Car. If. and the Act, to which this Bill relates, to be brought before their Majesties, and both Houses of Parliament, this was a voluntary Act, and no Concession of the Commons; for when their Lordships insisted upon it, as of Right, in 31 Car. II. it was denied; and their Lordships, after several Conferences thereupon, withdrew their Amendments to that Bill.

That the Lords, who appeared as Managers, and spoke at this Conference, were the Earl of Devonshire, the Earl of Nottingham, and the Earl of Rochester.

That the Substance of what was delivered by the Lords, was to this Effect; That their Lordships are willing at all Times to meet with the Commons at Conferences, and free Conferences, with an equal Desire to continue a good Correspondence between both Houses; and have often condescended in some Things, rather than to go on with further Debates; for tho' Conferences are the best way of reconciling any Differences between the two Houses, yet they are Marks to the World, that there is such a Difference; and the Lords, even in this Case, would have condescended to depart from their Amendments, if they had not judged them to be of such Consequence, that they could not do it.

That they took Notice, that it had been said, that Debates of this Kind ought to be governed either upon Reason, or Precedent; and they would endeavour to proceed upon both.

That in the Act, 31 Car. II. for disbanding the Army, there was no Direction to give an Account to either House; and in the Act in the Year 1677, for the building of Ships, there was no Account to be given to the House of Lords: So that these Precedents, which the Gentlemen of the House of Commons insist upon, are not very applicable in the Matter of Debate; for in the last Act, and the Bill now depending, there is a Clause, that an Account shall be given to both Houses,

Vqi.. 14.

That the Lords had experienced by the last Act, that the Enquiry, their Lordships are directed to take by this Act, are defective and dilatory, for want of Commissioners, that can attend them, and are able to explain such Things, as they may have Occasion to enquire into; and it cannot be imagined, that ever they can have that Satisfaction by writing to them, which they may arrive at by personal Examination.

That it is very true, that in the Act of 19 Car. II. for taking the publick Accounts, there were no Commissioners named by the Lords; but 'tis as true, those Commissioners were not Members of the House of Commons; and they had no Reason to disagree in that Matter, because this Objection did not lie against them.

That their Lordships declined all Arguments, concerning the Rights of the Commons, in granting, limiting, and disposing publick Aids; and therefore forbore to answer any Arguments of that kind; for that the Business, now depending, relates only to the taking Accounts, and directing such Part of the Revenue, as is not appropriated, to the Payment of Salaries to such Persons, as are employed therein; which their Lordships take to be quite another thing.

That the Commons urge it with great Weight, if their Lordships could shew no Precedent for doing this; but, if there be any such Precedent, their Lojrdships did hope, the Commons would allow them for Reasons; for it is not to be supposed, these Precedents were made without Reason.

That the Commons insist, they are the Representative of all the Commons of England; and that the Lords can name no Commoner a Commissioner, nor appoint Money to such Persons for these Services: It appears by the Journals of the Lords, and, 'tis to be supposed, in those of the Commons likewise, that, in the Poll Bill, August, 1660, the Lords named Commissioners for the Cinque Ports, and expunged some in Kent and Sussex; to all which the Commons agreed; In an Act, 31 Car. II. for disbanding the Forces, the Lords added Rennet Lord Sherrard; and the Commons agreed to it.

That in an Act made 12 Car. II. for speedy disbanding the Army, the Lords named Commissioners, that. were Peers, who were to be joined with Commissioners named by the Commons; and afterwards, in an additional Act, for disbanding the Remainder of the Army, John IVal/cer was added a Commissioner by the House of Lords, and his Salary was 205. per Diem; which last Precedent comes directly up to be a Precedent in Point; only in the Amendments now offered, there are Four, who are to have Five hundred Pounds per Annum each, and he was one, who had 365 /. per Annum.

That it was insinuated by some of the Gentlemen of the House of Commons, that the End their Lordships could propose to themselves by such an Enquiry, must be, either to discover, what Offences have been committed in the Misapplication, or, whether there be a Failure of the Money for the Ends, for which it was intended; and that to neither of these their Lordships Enquiry can be of Use, for, as to the Punishment, it must be by Impeachment; and if there be any want of Money, the Lords cannot come at it. This their Lordships look on as an Objection to the Clause itself, but not to their naming Commissioners, to satisfy their Lordships in relation to the Accounts.

That there are other Uses, may be made of these Accounts: The Lords may have Leisure to enquire into these Accounts, whilst the Commons are employed on other weighty Occasions; and the Lords may take Notice (for there is an Account of it in the printed Votes, licensed by the Speaker) that the Commons have not made so great a Progress in those Accounts, as their Lordships have done; and should the Lords discover Miscarriages, they may order a Prosecution of them in the Exchequer, lay them before the House of Commons, or represent the Matter to the King.

That there are some Precedents in Richard 2d's Time; and it seems to be implied in the Precedents quoted in the Year 1677, about the Act, for building Thirty

Ships,

Examining Members by Lords.

Examining Members by Lords.

06 130 Februarii. A. 1702.

Ships, that the House of Commons have not, of themselves, a Right to take these Accounts; for the Dispute then was not about the Commissioners, but the laying the Accounts before the Commons alone: For had they Power to call for them theirsolves, an Act would not have been necessary; and the Precedent of the Lords receding, at that Time, ought not to be reckoned to their Disadvantage; because, from their suspending their Privileges at that Time (which they did with a Protestation) and from the Thirty'Ships, that w ere built thereupon, it is, that we sit here in Safety.

In that Dispute it was acknowledged, that it was the inherent Right of the Lords to call for the Accounts; so that 'tis no extraordinary Thing, that the Commons have now done; for this Bill gives the Lords and Commons an equal Right to call for the Accounts: And since the Commons cannot call for these Accounts, so well, as by this Bill, wherein they have named Persons under their own Jurisdiction, as Members of your House, it is but reasonable, they likewise should name such Commissioners, as they may have Authority to call upon; for the Commons will hardly allow them Authority to send for the Members of the House of Commons.

On the Whole, since the Bill hadallowed their Lordships to take the Accounts, their Lordships desire to know, what Reason there could be, why they should not be allowed the proper Methods of coming at these Accounts.

That the Managers for the Commoners, by way of Reply, said, that the Precedents in 1660, 31 II. and additional Bill in 12 Car. II. were no Grounds for their Lordships insisting to add and appoint Commoners; because, in those, the Lords had the Consent of the Commoners signified to their Lordships by their Representatives in Parliament; but the Lords have no Right to impose an Office, or Burden, upon any Commoner, without their own Consent; and, in the Course of the Legislature, the Lords have no means to know, neither hath a Commoner any w'ay to signify, his Consent, or Dissent, but by his Representatives in Parliament. To insist to appoint Commoners, after their Dissent is signified in the proper Parliamentary Way, is to insist upon a Right of appointing Commoners, and imposing a Burden upon them, without their Consents; which their Lordships never pretended to, no more than the Commons to nominate and appoint Peers in any Commissions.

That in the Aid, given in the Second Year of their Majesties Reign, the Lord Dursley was inserted a Commissioner; in case the Lords had not signified his Dissent, he had been a Commissioner; and yet that would not have been a Precedent of the Commons Right of appointing a Peer to be a Commissioner, and insisting upon it; but the Lords, by Amendment, left him out, and the Commons agreed to the Amendment, though in a Money Bill, conceiving, they had no Right to insist upon naming a Peer, without the Consent of the Peers, who only can bind their own Members; neither can the Peers pretend to a larger Right over the Commons.

That their Lordships, in their Reasons, say, that, if they may not nominate Commoners Commissioners, by Parity of Reason they may be deprived of assigning Counsel, upon Impeachments for Misdemeanor, and in Cases of High Treason, where Matter of Law appears.

That the Commons conceive, this is not a natural Consequence; for, in Cases of Impeachment, they act in their judicial Capacity; and the Law gives the Party accused a Right to have Counsel; and their Lordships assign Counsel, when the Party cannot get Counsel, to assist him; and the Law enables their Lordships to do it; but there is no Law, which entitles them to nominate Commissioners, for passing Accounts.

That their Lordships alleged, that, in the Bill for regulating the Trial of Treason, both Houses agreed, that their Lordships might assign Counsel, in Cases of Impeachment for High Treason.

That the Bill not passing, that cannot be urged as a Precedent

That, as the Lords cannot supply the Want, that being

the Act of the Commons, nor punish the Misapplication till Complaint is made by the Commons; so neither can their Lordships acquaint the Commons, at a Conference, that there hath been a Misapplication of the Money; because that were giving Judgment, before the Matter came [a] judicially before then).

That the Lords cannot punish a Commoner, except for Breach of their Privilege, without an Information made by the Commons.

That, since no Fruit can be had by their Lordships Enquiry, why should they nominate Commissioners, not being their Representatives

And that to insist upon it at this Time, is most unseasonable, when the Commons, for the Support of the Go vemment, lay under the heavy Burden of so many Taxes; which Weight will be much increased, by being denied the Satisfaction of knowing, how their Money is disposed of, and having those screened from Justice, who misap plied the same; which must necessarily happen, by deny ing to agree with the Commons.

That, in Answer to what was said by their Lordships, that, in Case of the building the Thirty Ships, it was admitted, their Lordships had a Right to take the Accounts, it was admitted, with this Distinction, that, as to the stating and examining the Accounts, it belonged only to the Commons, but, that the Lords claimed the Cogtti -zance of the Accounts in their judicial Capacity, for their Information in Cases of Misdemeanor.

That, as to the Question, which their Lordships ask. To what End are these Accounts to be laid before them? to which there seems some Difficulty to make an Answer; the Commons cannot but observe from thence, their Lordships Right to demand to have those Accounts is not very clear; for 'tis a strange kind of Right, for which 'tis hard to give a Reason.

Upon Consideration whereof, it was Resolved, That this House doth adhere to their disagreeing with the Lords to the Amendments, made by the Lords to the Bill, intituled, An additional Act, for appointing and enabling Commissioners, to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom; and that this House doth adhere to the Bill, as it was sent up from this House.

And then the Messengers withdrew.

Colonel Granville reported from the Committee, to Examining whom it wus referred, to draw up what is proper to be Members by offered to the Lords, at a Conference, upon the Subject- Lords‘ matter of the Message from the Lords the 4th Instant, relating to the Commissioners of Accounts, and the Lords Proceedings in relation to the Observations of the said Commissioners; that the Committee had drawn up the same accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House: Which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was twice read, and, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House, and is, as followeth; viz.

THE Commons cannot comply with your Lordships Desires, contained in your Message of the 4th instant;

Because the Commons are still of the same Opinion as was delivered to your Lordships in February, 1691, at a free Conference upon the Subject-matter of the Amendments, made by the Lords to the additional Bill, for the appointing and enabling Commissioners, to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom, when they desired to know the End, your Lordships would propose to yourselves by an Enquiry into the publick Accounts; for, should any Misapplication of Money, or Default of Distribution, appear in the Accounts, your Lordships cannot take Cognizance thereof originally, nor otherw ise, even in your judicial Capacity, than at the Complaint of the Commons; and, should a Failure or Want of Money appear, it is not in your Lordships Power to redress it; for the Grant of all Aids is in the Commons only; or, if there be any Surplusage, the Commons only can apply it to the Charge of the ensuing Year.

But should the Commons give Leave to the Commissioners to attend your Lordships, no Information they can give, against any Person whatsoever, can entitle your Lordships either to acquit, or condemn; yet, since this Message, the Commons find in your Lordships Journals, the following Resolution; viz. That it is resolved and declared by the I-ords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, that Charles Lord Halifax, Auditor of the Receipt of the Exchequer, hath performed the Duty of his Office in transmitting the ordinary imprest Rolls to the Queen's Remembrancer, according to the ancient Custom of the Exchequer, and the Direction of the Act 8th and 9th Gidiel.tertii Regis (intituled, An Act for the better

Observation of the Course, anciently used in the Receipt of the Exchequer) and that he hath not been guilty of any Neglect, or Breach of Trust, upon that Account:

Which looks to the Commons, as if your Lordships pretended to give a Judgment of Acquittal, without any Accusation brought before your Lordships, and consequently without any Tryal; and that (which makes your Lordships Proceedings yet more irregular) it tends to prejudging a Cause, which might regularly have come before you, either originally by Impeachment, or by Writ of Error from the Courts below: And therefore the Commons can see no Use of this Resolution, unless it be either to intimidate the Judges, or prepossess a Jury.

But if your Lordships could have judged in this Matter, it does not appear by your Lordships Journals that you have had under. Examination the respective Times of transmitting the several imprest Rolls to the Queen's Remembrancer, without which it is impossible to know, whether the Auditor of the Receipt had done his Duty, according to the Act of Parliament.

Ordered, That a Conference he desired w ith the Lords, interference upon the Subject-matter <j>f the Message from the Lords in Public Ac-the 4th Instant, relating to the Commissioners, for taking, counu' examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the

A Petition of Captain Thomas Hart, on behalf of himself, and the Captains, and Widows of the Captains, of the Royal Regiment of Fuzileers, was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, that the Captains, in 1689, sent 155 Men to Flanders, for which they were promised 3 /. per Man: That they were respited for November, December, January, and Part of February; and the Petitioners paid towards clothing of the Regiment, as if they had received Pay for their full Companies; insomuch that, unless relieved, they w ill lose 175 /. 8 3 d.

besides the Charge of raising, and sending the Recruits to Flanders: That the Petitioners have applied to the Treasury, but without Relief; and the last Year addressed to the Commissioners of Accounts, but they had not Power to determine their Accounts: And praying, in the Bill, depending in the House, for appointing Commissioners, to take, state, and examine, the Accounts of the Army, Sic. there may be a Clause, to impower the said Commissioners to state and adjust the Petitioners Debt.

And a Motion being made, and the Question being put, That the Consideration of the said Petition be referred to the Committee;

That the Lords can neither acquit, or condemn, any Person whatsoever, upon any Enquiry, arising originally in their own House.

That the Attempt, the Lords have made, to acquit Charles Lord Halifax, Auditor of the Receipt of Exchequer, is not only unparliamentary, and not warranted by any Precedent; and the Resolution thereupon is plainly contrary to what appears on the Records themselves.

That the Conference, desired by the Commons, was in order to preserve a good Correspondence between both Houses, by offering Reasons to prevent the Lords from proceeding in a Case, which they had no Precedent to warrant; and the Commons expressing the Consequences, they apprehended might follow from that Resolution, was neither reflecting, nor unparliamentary, nor tending to destroy the good Correspondence betw een the two Houses, and much less to the Subversion of the Constitution.

COLONEL Granville reported, that the Managers of interference the free Conference with the Lords, on 'Thursday in Publick last, had, according to Order, drawn up a Report of the Accoums same, which they had directed him to report to the House, which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table.

Ordered, That the said Report be entered upon the Journal.

And the same is as followeth; viz.

That the Managers acquainted their Lordships, that the Commons had desired this free Conference, in order to maintain a good Correspondence between the two Houses; and that, upon Consideration of the Reasons, offered by the Commons at the first Conference, and their Lordships Answer, delivered at the last, they took the Points in Difference to be, First, That no Cognizance, the Lords could take of the publick Accounts, could enable them to supply any Deficiency, or apply any Surplusage, of the publick Money, in case any should he found: And then your Managers went ori to open the rest of the Particulars, which they had in Direction from the House to insist on; which they did in the same Manner, as they appear by your Journal; but added, when they acquainted their Lordships, that the expressing the Consequences, which, they apprehended, might follow from their Resolution, that it was not a Charge upon their Lordships, that they intended that Consequence; but they would have been very glad, their Lordships would have been pleased to have let them know, what Use was to be made of it, or what they intended by it; and concluded, that, if their Lordships

I. Ann. 37® Felrmrii.

209

did controvert any of those Points, your Managers were ready to maintain them.

That the Lords made no Answer to any of those Particulars, save to the Matter of their Resolution, relating to the Lord Halifax; upon which their Lordships did acknowledge, that they were no Court of Enquiry, to form any Accusation: That their Proceedings, in relation to that Lord, was no Tryal, nor was their Resolution any Judgment, or Acquittal, but that he might still be prosecuted, as before; but that, which gave Occasion to that Proceeding, was the Resolution of the House of Commons, which they found in the printed Votes, reflecting upon a Member of their House; and thereupon they thought fit to give their Opinion, which they did in their legislative Capacity.

To which the Managers replied, that, their Lordships having-in their Resolutions declared, that they had proceeded according to the Rules of Justice, and the Evidence, that was before them, the Commons could put no other Interpretation upon it, than that it was intended as a Judgment; and no Judgment could be made, where there was no Accusation; and if it was not a Judgment, they could not imagine, what it did tend to.

As to their Lordships delivering their Opinion; the Managers observed, it was against die Rule of any Court, that any Judge whatsoever should deliver an Opinion in a Cause, that might come before him; and this Matter might hereafter come judicially before their Lordships.

And the Managers observed the great Difference between the Resolution of the Commons, and that of the Lords: The Vote of the House of Commons was but in order to a Prosecution, which they can never vote, without declaring the Crime; and they can never come to be Judges of it The House of Commons is the grand Inquest of the Nation; and every Grand Jury, that finds Billa vera, upon an Indictment docs by that declare the Man guilty: Rut the Lords have a judicial Capacity; and their Resolution, before an Accusation brought is Pre judging the Cause, that may come regularly before them. And some of the Managers, in speaking to these Points, were frequently interrupted by their Lordships.

As to the Observation, the Commons made, that the Lords had not examined the respective Times of transmitting the Imprest Rolls to the Queen's Remembrancer; your Managers said, that, as their Lordships Resolution was no Judgment, so this Conference was no Tryal. Rut, to shew the Mistake of their Lordships Resolution, they observed the Dates upon the several imprest Rolls, that had been transmitted to the Remembrancer; that they apprehended, there were still Two wanting; that the Three last, that were transmitted, came not to the Remembrancer till January last, the Two first, on the 23d, the last, on the 27th: The first of these Three imprest Rolls, was Money imprest to the 21st of February, 1700, and said to be in the First Year of the Reign of Queen Anne; which shewed, that That Roll was so far from being examined, or transmitted in time, that it w'as not made up till since her Majesty came to the Crown.

That, as the Custom formerly has been to set down the Time of the Examination of those Rolls, since Mr. Chr.

Mountague came in to be Auditor, he set down the Month, but not the Day; and since the Lord Halifax was Auditor, he has set down neither Month, nor Day; and, by his Example, on the Three last imprest Rolls the Clerks of the Pells had put down no Time at all.

To which a noble Lord, in his own Defence, replied, that the Lords Resolution was well founded, since they had the Rolls themselves before them, and Proof upon Oath: That, by the Words of the Act, the Auditor was to transmit the imprest Rolls to the Remembrancer half-yearly, according to the usual Course of the Exchequer, which is Eight Months, and Four Months: That it was not his Duty to transmit them immediately to the Remembrancer, because he was to send them to the Clerk of the Pells, who is to examine and sign them; and it cannot be imagined, the Auditor should be tied to a certain Time, to transmit the Rolls to the Remembrancer, because they V>l. 14.

must first go through another Hand; and he never took it, there was any Occasion to put down the Time he examined them; for that would appear from the Time of the Delivery, and Date of the Roll.

That there was One examined by the Clerk of the Pells the 4th of July, and not delivered till the 23d of January; which he did not take to be the Auditor's Fault, but took it to be the Duty of the Clerk of the Pells to deliver them: That every Rody knew the great Trouble had been given in his, as well as other Offices, by the Commissioners of Accounts: That no publick Loss had happened by not transmitting these Rolls, no Process having been issued forth for many Years upon them.

To this your Managers answered, that, though Half-yearly should be taken for Eight Months, and Four Months, yet, by that, they must be transmitted twice a Year; and that he had failed in his Duty in that respect

To construe the ancient Course of the Exchequer, in the Act of Parliament, to be meant, that the Clerk of the Pells should transmit the Rolls, is a direct Contradiction to the Act, that says, the Auditor shall do it; and the ancient Course of the Exchequer not having been observed, was the Occasion of making that Law; and that they thought.

Laws wrere made to be observed. That indeed no Process could issue, till the Rolls were transmitted; and possibly that might be the Ground, the Accounts have been so long unpassed, to the Prejudice of the Publick. That his Lordship's Apprehension, there was no Loss to the Publick, by not transmitting the Rolls, might probably be the Reason of his Lordship s neglecting his Duty.

A Message from the Lords, by Sir Robert Legard, and Sir Richard Holford:

Mr. Speaker,

The Queen commands this honourable House to attend her Majesty immediately in the House of Peers.

Accordingly Mr. Speaker, with the House, went up to attend her Majesty:

And being returned;

Mr: Speaker reported, that her Majesty had been pleased to make a most gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament; and that, to prevent any Mistake therein, he had desired, and obtained, a Copy thereof; which he readj, and is, as followeth; viz.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

I have called you together, as soon as I thought you could conveniently come out of your Countries, that no Time might be lost in making our Preparations for carrying on the present War; in which I do not doubt of your chearful Concurrence, since you cannot but be sensible, that on the Success of it depends our own Safety and Happiness, and that of all Europe.

I hope I have improved the Confidence, you reposed in me last Year, to your Satisfaction, and the Advantage of us, and our Allies, by the Treaty with the King of Portugal, and the Declaration of the Duke of; Which, in great measure, may be imputed to the Chear-fiilness, with which you supported me in this War, and

flit

the Assurance, with which you trusted me in the Conduct of it; and we cannot sufficiently acknowledge the Goodness of Almighty God, who is pleased to afford us so fair a Prospect, as we now have, of bringing it to a glorious and speedy Conclusion.

I must therefore desire you, Gentlemen of the House of Commons, to grant me such Supplies, as shall be requisite to defray the necessary Charge of the War in the next Year, with regard not only to all our former Engagements, but particularly to our Alliance, lately made with the King of Portsor recovering the Monarchy of Spain from the House of and re-

storing it to the House of Austria; which Treaty, being in itself of the highest Importance imaginable, and requiring all possible Dispatch in the Execution of it, has necessarily occasioned a great Ex pence even in this present Year, though not so much, ak it will require, and for which,

I hope, we shall be amply recompensed, in the next.

The Subsidies, which will now be immediately required, for the Assistance of the Duke of Savoy, will likewise occasion a further necessary Charge.

I must take notice to you, that, though no particular Provision was made in the last Session, either for the Charge of our present Expedition to , or for

that of the Augmentation Troops, desired by the States General; yet the Funds, given by Parliament, have held out so well, and the Produce of the Prizes has proved so considerable, that you will find, the Publick will not be in Debt, by reason of either of these additional Services.

I may further observe to you, that, though the Funds, for the civil Government, are diminished by the War, I have, in Conjunction with the States General, contributed out of my own Revenue towards some publick Services, and particularly, the Support of the Circle of Suabia, whose firm Adherence to the Interest of the Allies, under the greatest Pressures, did very well deserve our seasonable Assistance; and I shall still be careful, not to engage myself in any unnecessary Expence of my own, that I may have the more to spare towards the Ease of my Subjects.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

I heartily wish, some easy, and less chargeable, Method could be found, for the speedy and effectual manning of the Fleet

I must also recommend to you to make some Regulation, for preventing the excessive Price of Coals. I have examined this Matter, and taken particular Care to appoint Convoys for that Service; but the Price has not been in the least abated, notwithstanding a very considerable Quantity has been imported since that Time. This gives great Ground of Suspicion, Jhere may be a Combination of some Persons, to enrich themselves by a general Oppression of others, and particularly the Poor: It will deserve your Consideration, how to remedy this great Inconvenience.

And, in all your Affairs, I must recommend to you as much Dispatch, as the Nature of them will admit. This is necessary to make our Preparations early, on which, in great measure, depends the good Success of all our Enterpnzes.

I want Words to express to you my earnest Desires of seeing all my Subjects in perfect Peace and Union among themselves: I have nothing so much at Heart, as their general Welfare and Happiness. Let me therefore desire you all, that you would carefully avoid any Heats or Divisions, that may disappoint me of that Satisfaction, and give Encouragement to the common Enemies of our Church and State.

After which, several Members took the Oaths, and made and subscribed the Declaration, and took and sub-cribed the Oath of Abjuration, according to the Laws made for those Purposes.

2.

Sa Majesty ne payant la Cavallerie, suivant T Article 4me, que sur le Pied de deux Regiments de Sept cent Chevaux, nonobstant qu' il y en a un beaucoup plus grand Nombre, qui ne passe dans le Paye que pour de T Infanterie, on est convenu de part et d' autre, que leurs Altesses Electorale et Serenissime pourront, quand il leur plaira, changer cpntre de Tlnfanterie, ce qu' il y a en Cavallerie dans ce Corps au dessus des dits deux Regiments qui font lest Sept cent Chevaux ensemble.

But, in case these Offices should avail nothing, and prove ineffectual, so that the aforesaid King9, or either of them, shall make War against the Kingdom of Britain, or the United Provinces, his sacred royal Majesty of Portugal shall in like Manner be obliged to make War, with all his Might, against the foresaid Kings, or either of them; and in that Case also the Two Potentates of Great Britain and the States General shall supply him with the same Aids of Soldiers and Ships, as are agreed by the precedent Heads or Articles,.in case that the Kings of France and Spain, or either of them, shall make War against Portugal, and with all those Things, in the same Manner, as is there expressed.

13

As well in the First as Second Case of making War, his sacred royal Majesty of Portugal shall be obliged to have Ten Ships of War, for the Defence of himself and his Confederates; nevertheless, in such Manner, that, if the Spaniards and French together, or Spaniards only, make War against the Confederates, in such Case, the Ten Ships of War of his sacred royal Majesty of Portugal shall not be obliged to stir from the Coast of Portugal, where they will be of great Use to divert the Forces of the Enemy; but, if War is made only by the French, it shall be lawful for the Ships of Portugal to assist the Confederates, in Conjunction with their Fleets.

14.

Neither Peace, nor Truce, shall be made, but by the mutual Consent of the Confederates; and this League shall be perpetual, not determined by any Limits of Time.

15.

The Portuguese shall enjoy in the Kingdoms of the Crown of Britain, and in the United Provinces, the same Privilege for their Persons, and Liberty of Commerce, as the Britons and Dutch do enjoy in Portugal.

16.

If by the Instrument of the Treaty, in which there is an Agreement between the Crowns of Portugal and Britain concerning Bombaim, it shall appear, that either Party has exceeded the Limits, or not fulfilled the Measure, of that Agreement, all Things shall be adjusted according to the Tenor of that Treaty.

17.

The Ships of Portugal shall not be obliged to pay any thing for casting Anchor in the Port of Malaca, if other European Nations are not obliged to pay.

18.

Piratical Ships, of what Nation soever, shall not ohly [not ] be admitted and received into the Ports, which the sacred royal Majesty of Portugal, and Britain, and the States General of the United Provinces, possess in the East Indies, but also shall be accounted as common Enemies of Portuguese, English, and Dutch.

19-

In Times of Peace, Six Ships of War of both Nations, English and Dutch, shall be admitted into the larger Ports of the Kingdom of Portugal, besides other Six, which were permitted by virtue of former Treaties; so that, in the Whole, Twelve Ships may be admitted, and all in the very same Manner, as the First Six were admitted; but into the lesser Ports such a Number of Ships shall be admitted, as is most suitable to their Strength and Capacity.

Upon the Petition of George Dashwood, Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of Joseph Haskenstyles, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Sudbury:

That by the Petitioner's Counsel it was insisted, that the Right of Election was only in the Sons of Freemen, born after their Fathers were made free; in such, as have served seven Years Apprenticeships w ithin or

were made free by Redemption.

That the Sitting Member's Counsel insisted, that,besides the Persons qualified, as aforesaid, those, that have served as Clerks to Attorneys within Sudbury, by virtue of such Service were free of Sudbury, and had a Right to vote in Elections.

And the Sitting Member's Counsel called Mr. Tho.

Carpenter, Mr. Clement Ray, who said, that such, as had served as Clerks to Attorneys within Sudbury, and had no other Right, had been admitted to vote at several Elections, within' 40 Years lost past, and were never refused.

That, for the Petitioner was called, Mi\ Cole;

who said, he had served an Attorney in Sudbury, as his -Clerk; but purchased his Freedom. He acknowledged,

his

his Master died before his Time was out; though, had it been otherwise, such Service would not have entitled him to his Freedom. He confessed, Attornies have.voted at former Elections, and he never knew any refused; yet he took that to be only a Matter of Favour, and not of Right.

That the Committee came to this Resolution:

1. Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Right of Election of Burgesses, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Sudbury, in the County of Suffolk, is only in the Sons of Freemen, born after their Fathers were made free, and in such, as have served Seven Years Apprenticeships, or are made Freemen by Redemption.

That, upon the Poll, there were,

For Mr. Haskenstyles - - 365.

For Mr. Dashwood' - 344.

But the Petitioners Counsel alleged, it appeared by the Poll, that one Person had polled twice for the Sitting Member; which would reduce his Poll to 364, and gave him the Majority by 20 only.

That then the Petitioners Counsel proceeded to take off, and disqualify, several, that had polled for the Sitting Member, on these Heads; as being no Freemen, either not having served 7 Years Apprentices, or not being the Sons of Freemen; as receiving Alms; as Votes obtained by Bribery, or Treats.

Some Witnesses spoke to several Persons having voted for the Sitting Member, who had not served 7 Years Apprentices; which was allowed, as to 13 of them.

Other Witnesses spoke to several others, who were not the Sons of Freemen; which was also allowed as to Six of them.

Six more were objected against, as receiving Alms; and no Answer given to it.

As to Bribery; a Letter was produced by John Gilson, directed to him by Sir John Cordell (who married the Sitting Member's Daughter) to make what Interest he could for the Sitting Member, upon the former Election being made void by this House. Gilson testified, that he received 16s. from the Innkeeper at the George, to make Interest for him, and 5s. from Sir John Cordell; and so did some others.

Tho. Merills said, Sir John Cordell sent to him, to be for the Sitting Member; which he refusing, unless something was given him, Sir John gave him 2$. 6d. and bid him not speak of it; and Sir John Cordell told him, that, if the Election was not prolonged 3 or Days, Mr.

Dashwood would prevail: It was continued Three Days, when, at other Times, it has been ended in one.

Some Freemen (the Witnesses said) came from to vote for the Petitioner; but Mr. Cole, his Agent, refusing to entertain them, and pay for their Horses, they voted for the Sitting Member; his Friends and Agents paying for their Horses, and giving them Money to bear their (Charges.

Edward Tyler, Tho. Bantock, said, they intended to vote for Mr. Dashwood; but their Master, to whom they worked, desired them to vote for the Sitting Member, and gave them 5 s.a-piece.

Evidence was given of several Freemen, who lived at Colchester, who were treated at the Election, on the Sitting Member's Account

That the Counsel endeavoured to add Four to the Petitioner's Poll; Two of which were allowed him; the others were objected against, as receiving Charity.

It was said, that those, who voted for the Sitting Member, had Liberty to come in at a Door, contrived for their Convenience, when the others catnc up with Difficulty to the Bar; and Evidence was given, on both Sides, of Rudeness offered to the Voters.

Some spoke as to Money, that had been offered to Persons, to charge the Petitioner with Bribery.

That the Counsel for the Sitting Member answered, that it did not appear Sir John Cordell had any Direction to concern himself for the Sitting Member, who was invited to stand, and was so indifferent, he was not present at the Election.

Vol. 14.

As to the i6j. given to Gilson; they said it was be- Sudbury fore the W rit came out for the Election, and for his Loss Elation, of Time, he being a Labourer.

As to the Charges of Bribery, and Treating, they endeavoured to recriminate, by calling

John Allison; who said, Richard Bouncer told him, he had 10#. given him, to vote for the Petitioner, or else he had voted for the Sitting Member.

Several Witnesses gave Evidence of at least 20 Persons, that were treated during the Election, with Meat and Drink, at one Underwood's: That they were directed to go thither by Mr. Cole, art agent for Mr. Dashwood i That Underzvoodcame to them, and said, there was no-

thing for them to pay; and spoke to them to vote for Mr. Dashwood.

Other Witnesses proved, that about 20 Colchester men were entertained at William Buck's, at the Angel at Sudbury, some of which had Horses provided for them; and some of them said, they had staid at Home, and not gone to the Election, but that their Charges were borne.

That then they proceeded to disqualify some, who voted for the Petitioner; of which Five were admitted, and Answers given to the rest.

That, in Reply to this Evidence, the Petitioner's Counsel called Witnesses to the Reputation of some, that had given Testimony of Money given on the Account of the Petitioner; and charged them, as Men of ill Fame.

That, after this, they called John Underwood; who positively affirmed, that no Persons were treated at his House, during the Election, on the Petitioner's Account; but that the Reckonings were paid by those that eat and drank there, before they went away; and besides, a Week before the Election, Mr. Dashwood told him, if he drew any Drink on his Account, he would not pay for it.

And Richard Root said, he was present at the Angel, when the Colchester Men were there; and heard Buck the Innkeeper (before One Shilling w as spent) say, there was nothing to be drank, but what they paid for; and that he, particularly, paid js. 6d. and one Kent gs. having an Horse there.

And that, upon the whole Matter, the Committee come to these Resolutions; vis.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That Joseph Haskenstyles, Esquire, is not duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Sudbury, in the County of Suffolk.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That George Dashwood, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough oiSudbury.

more than was really due from the Petitioners; and therefore, bn 30th of July last, the said Trustees, by Endorsement, on one of the said Deeds, certify the said Error; nevertheless, there being, in every of the Conveyances, a Proviso, whereby the same is made void, if the whole Sums, therein expressed, be not paid, as therein mentioned, the Petitioners are advised, their Conveyances will become void, if they should omit paying the said 18,864/. 7 s.lid. so overcharged, as aforesaid: And praying, that Leave may be given to bring in a Bill, for rectifying the said Mistake.

Debts, to support his Family, and in 12 or 13'Years Law-suits with Proprietors of the said Estates; so that he is utterly ruined, and uncapable of making any Provision for his Family, by reason of his said Wounds: And praying, the said Reward may be paid him out of the Rents and Arrears of the Irish Forfeitures, or otherwise.

A more particular Account of all which is contained in a Book, delivered in with this Report.

Besides the Particulars aforesaid, there are several Estates, which may hereafter appear to be forfeited; but, for want of sufficient Evidence in our Time, to make out a good Title in the Publick, we did not think fit to expose them to Sale, and therefore returned them to the Commissioners of her Majesty's Revenue.

There was also a Fine of 10,0001, imposed on John Parker, for a false claim; which is certified to the Barons of her Majesty's Exchequer in Ireland, and Directions given for Prosecution, according to the Act of Parliament.

We have further delivered over all the Records, Books, Papers, and Writings, relating to the forfeited Estates, except such, as were necessary to perfect our Accounts, and except the Books of Survey, which, not being complete at our leaving Ireland, we thought it for the publick Service to continue in the Hands of the Surveyor, for that Purpose; and believe, by this time, they are finished.

And here we humbly crave Leave to lay before your Honours, that (besides all the above Particulars) the Reliefs, given by the Act of Resumption, the Act for Relief of Protestant Purchasers, and the several private Acts of Parliament, together with the several Estates, Interests, and Sums of Money, claimed, and allowed by us, according to the best Computation we are able to make, amount, in Value, to at least Eleven hundred thousand Pounds.

We are sensible, our sincere and hearty Endeavours to serve the Publick have created us many Enemies

in that Kingdom, who, to serve private Ends, have cast Reproach and Dishonour upon us, and our Proceedings; but we hope, their many and causeless Aspersions will make no impression to our Disadvantage, till they charge us with some Misbehaviour in particular; when we doubt not, but so to acquit ourselves, and vindicate our Proceedings, as to obtain your Approbation.

All which we most humbly submit to your Honours.

Upon the Petition of Eduard Harvey, Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return of Ambrose Pudsey, Esquire, and Thomas Stringer,

Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Clithero, in the County of Lancaster:

That the Petitioners Counsel opened, that the sitting Members Agents had been guilty of corrupt Practices; and that several had polled for the sitting Members, who had no Right; which being taken off from the sitting Members roll, would give the Petitioner a Majority.

That, upon the Poll, there was,

For Mr. Pudsey - - 66.

For Mr. Stringer - - 64.

For Mr. Harvey - - 32.

That the Right of Election the Petitioner s Counsel alleged to be in the Bailiff's, and Burgesses, presented by the Jury of Enquiry, and sworn by foe Bailiffs, and also by the Freemen.

That the Burgesses are such, as are seised of Burgage Lands of Inheritance; and the Freemen are foe Tenants to those Burgesses, and have a Right to vote, when those, that have the Inheritance, do not vote.

That the sitting Members Counsel denied, that it was necessary, that the Burgesses should be presented, or sworn, to give them a Right to vote.

Upon which, the Petitioner's Counsel called John Wal-bank, Robert Brenan; who gave an Account, that they never knew any vote in Elections, but such Burgesses, as were presented by the Jury of Enquiry, and sworn by the Bailiffs; but at foe same time said, they took it, that the Bailiff ought to swear such, as were presented.

And the Counsel for the sitting Members left the Matter of the Right, upon this Evidence, to the Judgment of the Committee.

And, as to corrupt Practices, the Petitioner's Counsel called

Henry Standish; who said, that Mrs. Parker, deceased.

Colonel Stringer's Sister, came to the Jury of Enquiry, and insisted, that they should admit Colonel Stringer to be a Burgess, for Lands, called Stanhope Croft', and threatened, if they did not, they should answer it in an higher Place; whereas the said Land was not of Burgage Tenure; However he acknowledged, that one Cockcrojt had been presented a Buigess for it, and Colonel Stringer was found by the Jury; which, he said, was by means of some of the Jury, who vrere Mrs. Parker's Tenants, and received of her 2 os.a Year.

en old Debt of 30s. and that he voted for Mr. Pudsey, because of the said Promises; though he owned, he had not received, nor asked for; the 40 which, he said, was, because the Election was contested.

Others, viz.James, NoeU, John Ilopwood, Alexander Noell, John Dutton, said, that Mrs. had promised

them Money, to vote for the Sitting Members; and some of them said, that such Promises were the Occasion of their voting for the sitting Members: But, being asked, owned, that the Petitioner was a Stranger; and that they had voted for the sitting Members at former. Elections; and that Mrs. Parker bad used to give Money yearly at Christmas to the poorer Sort, though they did not know of any Person, except such as had Votes, who received so much as 20 s.

As to Treating;

Robert Broun said, that he kept the Black Bull Inn at CUthero;and Mrs. Parker, on the Election.Day (she then

being his Landlady) ordered him to draw Drink, to the Value of 40s. and, when the Election was over, and the sitting Members were carried to his House, a great Number of Persons (Friends to Mrs. Parker and the sitting Members) came thither, and drank; and when the 40#. was speut, they desired more Drink; and he drew, by her Order, more Drink, to the Value of 10s. which 50 s.she afterwards paid him. He further said, that, when he took the House of Mrs. , she in-

sisted, he should vote as she would have him, and promised him 20s. each time be voted.

That the Petitioners Counsel objected to several, that polled for the sitting Members, who were not sworn Bur-

fssses; and the sitting Members Counsel admitted the act, as to 17; but insisted, that they were good Bur--gesses, and so presented, and ought to have been sworn; but the Bailiff refused to do it: And called Tho. Dugdale, Edw. Farrer; who gave an Account,

that about 12 of them were found by the Jury of Enquiry, the Beginning of May; and that in June they demanded a Court of the Bailiffs to swear them; but one of the Bailiffs refused, saving he did not value the Parliament; and adjourned the Court till the 3d of August, the Election being on the 28th; yet, upon the Application of Colonel Stringer, and Mr. Pudsey, to Mr. the other Bailiff, on the 20th of July, and upon giving him a Note to save him harmless, he declaring some Fear of the Earl of Montagu, and his Interest, be called a Court, and swore those 12 Burgesses.

That Evidence was also given, that the Toll was taken away from the Town, since the time of the last Election; but Mr. Dummer being examined as to that Point by the Petitioner, gave an Account, that there was nothing done in it; only the Lease was expired, and Sclater, the Bailiff of the Town, received the Toll, as formerly.

And that, upon the whole Matter, the Committee came to these Resolutions:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this' Committee, that Ambrose PudStoy, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliameni or the Borough of , in the

County of Lancaster.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that Thomas Stringer, Esquire, is duly elected a Burgess, to serve in Parliament for the said Borough of Clithero.

Mr. St.John reported from the Committee, to whom

it was referred to draw up an Address upon the Resolutions of Yesterday, that they had drawn up an Address accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House: Which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was read, and is, as followeth; viz

Most gracious Sovereic WE, your Majesty's mqfif dutifjJ and loyal Subjects, the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled, V01. 14.

beg Leave'humbly to lay before your Majesty the great and just Concern we are under, to see any Violation of your royal Prerogative.

Your faithful Commons believe the Administration of the Government best secured, when it is left to your Majesty, with whom the Law has intrusted it; and have so firm a Dependence upon your Majesty's Affection to your People, and your great Wisdom, that they can never apprehend so little Danger from any Conspiracy, as w hen the Examination thereof is under your Majesty's Direction.

We are therefore surprised to find, that, alien several Persons, suspected of treasonable Practices against your Majesty, were taken into Custody by your Messengers, in order to be examined, the Lords, in violation of the known Laws of the Land, have wrested them out of your Majesty's Hands, and, without your Majesty's Leave, or Knowledge, in a most extraordinary Manner taken the Examination of them solely to themselves; whereby a due Enquiry into the evil Practices, and Designs, against your Majesty's Person and Government, may, in great measure be obstructed.

Your loyal Commons do therefore most earnestly desire your Majesty, to suffer no Diminution of that Prerogative, which, during your Majesty's Reign, they are confident will always be exerted for the Good of your People.

And we humbly beg Leave to assure your Majesty, that, as we are resolved, by timely and effectual Supplies, to enable your Majesty to carry on the War, which you have so gloriously begun; so we M ill, to the utmost of our Power, support your Majesty in the Exercise of your just Prerogative at home, and the Assertion of it against all Invasions whatsoever.

The said Address being read a Second time;

An Amendment was proposed to be made thereunto, in the First Paragraph, by leaving out, “ are under, to “ see any Violation,” and, instead thereof, to insert have of the Preservation.”

And the Question being put, That the words “ are “ under, to see any Violation,” do stand Part of the Address;

The House divided:

The Noes go forth:

Tellers for the Yeas.

Tellers for the NoMS.

So it was resolved in the Affirmative.

Another Amendment was proposed to be made in the last Paragraph, by leaving out “ Assertion,” and inserting, instead thereof, “ asserting.”

And the same was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee, in the said Address, so amended: And the same is as followeth:

Most gracious Sovereign,

WE your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled, beg Leave humbly to lay before your Majesty the great. and just Concern we are under, to see any Violation of your royal Prerogative. '

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill, for reviving the Act, made in the 5th and 6th Year of their late Majesties Reign, for the importing of Salt-petre for one Year; and that Sir John Parsons, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Clayton, do prepare, and bring in, the Bill.

' Resolved, That this House will, upon Saturduy Fort- East India night, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole Trade. House, to consider of the Trade to the East Indies.

Ordered, That the Report from the Committee, to York We»t whom the Bill for the publick registering of all Convey- Riding ances, Mortgages, or other Securities that shall here- R g‘sl;y after be made of any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, within the West Riding of the County of York, was committed, be made Tomorrow, at Twelve a Clock.

Ordered, That the House be called over upon Mon- Call of the day Fortnight; and that such Members, as shall not then Ho“ e attend, be sent for in Custody of the Serjeant at Arms attending this House.

Mr. Secretary Hedges acquainted the House, that her ir-,si, jjncn Majesty had commanded him to lay before the House, a Manut'actme, Copy of an Address, which had been presented to her Majesty from the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of the Kingdom of Ireland, assembled in Parliament, relating to the Lincu Manufacture: And he presented the same to the House accordingly; and the same was read, and is, as followeth; vis.

To the Queen's most excellent Majesty.

The humble Address of the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of your Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland, in Parliament assembled:

WE, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Commons, in Parliament assembled, taking into our Consideration the distressed Condition of your Majesty's Subjects of this your Kingdom, and more especially of the industrious Protestants thereof, by the almost total Loss of Trade, and Decay of our Manufactures, have had in our most serious Thoughts, by what Methods this Country might be preserved from utter Ruin.

That of the Linen Manufacture hath come under our Consideration, as what may, in some measure, relieve us in our Distress; to the which we have been chiefly induced by the Applications made to his late Majesty (of glorious Memory) by the Lords- and Commons of England, in Parliament assembled; beseeching, that his Majesty would recommend the same to this Kingdom; and declaring, that, for the Encouragement thereof, they should be always ready to give their utmost Assistance.

We therefore presume humbly to lay before your

 Majesty, that, though it be very manifest, that the Linen Trade cannot in a long time be brought to such Perfection, as to employ any considerable Number of the Hands, which now want Work, or ever prove advantageous to us, unless speedy and due Encouragement be given thereto by England', nevertheless, in order to lay a good Foundation for the same, as is in our Power, we have proceeded to the forming Heads of a Bill, for promoting the Linen Manufactury in this Kingdom; the passing of which Bill into a Law will (as we humbly conceive) rather tend to compleat the Ruin, than to the Relief, of this Kingdom, unless we be allowed due Encouragement, and full Liberty of making the best of our Linen Trade in all Parts beyond the Seas.

This being our present unhappy Condition, we, in most humble Manner, beseech your most gracious Majesty, that your Majesty would please so to recommend the same to your Parliament of England, that your Majesty's Subjects of this Kingdom may have Liberty of exporting all manner of Linen Cloth (being the Manufacture of this Kingdom) directly from hence to your Majesty's Plantations; and that we may receive such further Encouragement, as has been assured to your Subjects of this Kingdom, if they should turn their Industry to the Improvement of the Linen Manufacture.

Resolved, That this House will, upon Tomorrow Sevennight, take the Matter of the said Address into Consideration.

Resolved, That this House will, upon Monday Morn- Ways and ing next, resolve jtself into a Committee of the whole M«ans. House, to consider further of Ways and Means for raising the Supply granted to her Majesty.

And then the House adjourned till Tomorrow Morning, Nine a Clock.

(except the Ferries Of Dormegal and Rockow'sey, of the Value of 5/. per Annum) as being of no Value.

That on the 13th of February, 1604, his said Majesty did, in Consideration of his said Surrender, and of his said Services, grant unto the Petitioner, in Fee, the Estate of James Everard, of the Value of 104/. per Annum.

That the Petitioner did expend in Law-suits, ami other Charges, in supporting his Majesty's Title to the said Estates, and in Journies to and from England, and other Expences, in order to procure his Grants, the Sum of 1,990/. as appears by his own Affidavit, and the Report of the Commissioners of the Revenue of Inland, and by what is recited in his Warrant for another Grant.

That his late Majesty, in Consideration of his great Expences, and to Supply the Deficiency of his former Grants, did sign a Warrant, dated the 22d of November, 1699, for a Grant of Part of the Estate of Mur-

rough, in the County of Cork, of the yearly Value of 85/. whereof 33/. per Annum is held in Jointure, and 829/. 7 s.7</. Incumbrances are allowed thereon; and also for the Estate of Walter of the Value of

That to this Evidence they added, that the Petitioner declared, some Time before the Election, against Bribery; and that he would turn out any of his Tenants, that should t ke Money.

That, in Answer, Evidence was given for the Sitting Member, that those Three, they endeavoured to add to the Petitioner's Poll, came into the Town, to inhabit, not long before the Election; and that, upon Complaint, the Justices had granted Warrants to remove Two of them: Which, as it was used for an Argument against their being legally settled; so, on the other side, Exception was taken to this, as an indirect Practice, to take oft Votes.

He declared, the Malt was accordingly distributed to Eight Tenants; and the Remainder of the Money, being 8 5. he gave to his Servant Finch, by the Order of the Petitioner, after the Election was over.

That this Witness did not vote for the Petitioner.

She further said, she was at an Entertainment with a great many Freemen, and paid nothing.

The Translation of the said Articles.

Article 1st.

HIS sacred royal Majesty of Portugal promises, in his own Name, and in the Name of his Successors, that there shall be admitted at all times into Portugal, Woollen Cloth, and other the Woollen Manufactures of England, no otherwise than they used to be, before they were prohibited by Pragmatick Sanctions; upon this Condition nevertheless:

Article 2d.

That her sacred royal Majesty of Great Britain be obliged, in her own N ame, and in the Name of her Successors, at all times so to admit into England, Wines gathered from the Vineyards belonging to the Portugal Dominions, as that at no time, whether there be Peace or War, between the Kingdoms of England and France, any more shall be demanded for such Wines, directly or indirectly, on Account of Custom or Impost, or upon any other Account whatsoever, than what shall, after deducting a third Part of the Custom or Impost, be demanded for a like Quantity of French Wine, whether such Wines shall be imported into Great Britain in Pipes, Hogsheads, or any other Vessels; but if at any time this Diminution of Duties, to be made as abovesaid, shall in any manner be attempted, and the same shall be infringed, it shall be right and lawful for his sacred Majesty of Portugal to prohibit again Woollen Cloths, and other the Woollen Manufactures of England.

Article 3d.

The most excellent Lords the Plenipotentiaries promise, and take upon themselves, that their above-mentioned Masters shall ratify this Treaty, and that within the Space of Two Months the Ratifications shall be exchanged.

The said Extract of Mr. Methu en's Letter.

Lisbon, December -£, 1703.

A C CORD IN G to the Account I gave your Lord1

£_Dec.

Ship in my Letter of the is No . I have made the Agreement with the Marquis d' Allegret; and I herew ith send your Lordship the full Powers of the King of Portugal to the Marquis, the Original of the Part signed by him, and the Copy of that Part of the Agreement, which I have signed, and which remains with the King of Portugal', and, according to which Copy, your Lordship will please to order her Majesty's Ratification to be drawn, the Method being the same, as was observed in the Two late Treaties, as to the naming her Majesty and the King of Portugal, and as to the signing of the Ministers. The Marquis, in respect of the general Powers her Majesty has honoured me with, and the future use of them, hath contented himself with a Copy, which I have attested to be exactly agreeing with the original Powers remaining in my hands.

Your Lordship will perceive the Agreement to be no more, than that the King of Portugal doth oblige himself, forever, to permit all the Sorts of Woollen Manufacture of England to be imported, in the same Manner, as they were before the Prohibitions, in Consideration, that her Majesty obliges herself, that the Wines of Portugal shall be admitted in England, and pay one Third Part less Duties, than French Wines, by the Pipe or Hogshead.

I cannot but hope, that your Lordship, and the Lords of her Majesty's Councils, as well as the Parliament, will be satisfied, that the Agreement is greatly advantageous to England, not only in that Part, which relates to the Woollen Manufacture, but also in the Manner of the Expedient for the King of Portugal his Satisfaction as to the Portugal Wines. I presume therefore to lay before your Lordship a State of the whole Matter, and the Reasons, for which this could not be obtained before, and which have made me hasten it now.

The whole Kingdom of Portugal, in the Reign of King Charles the Second, did generally clothe themselves with the Woollen Manufactures of England; but, upon raising the Duties upon their Wines, and putting an Imposition upon their Sugars, the Portuguese, finding their Money exported to England in return for our Goods, despairing of balancing our Trade by their Wines, and considering the great Quantity of very good and fine Wool, which Portugal produces, and the Convenience of having what Wool they pleased from Spain, they resolved to prohibit the Woollen Manufactures of , and.set

up the same in their Kingdom, where their Wool was very cheap. They began with prohibiting all Cloth, Hats, Stockings, and some other Sorts; but forebore the Prohibition of Bays, and the rest, till they could attain the making of them.

The Portugal Manufactures succeeded ill in every thing, but somewhat tolerably in coloured Cloth, very coarse, and in coarse Hats; so that by this means France hail everyway the Advantage, by sending their Wines to England, and a vast Quantity of Druggets and Stuffs to Portugal; where they have been always admitted, and sold to great Advantage, while even our Druggets, for being like Cloth, have been, 'till lately, refused, and now but sometimes, and with Difficulty, admitted.

The King of Portugal some Years since was prevailed with to admit black Cloth, of which very little is worn, and Stockings, and Hats, that were finer, than could be made here; but hath ahvays refused to admit Cloth, and Druggets, &c. generally, as well to continue their own Manufacture, as in hopes to get a Certainty of the buying all their Wines, or at least of taking off the greatest Part of the Duties on them; and could never be convinced, that it was impracticable to make an Agreement for tlx? taking off a great Quantity of their Wines at a certain Rate; but finding now, that their Wines, for several Years, sell very dear, without any Agreement,' and that this Conjuncture makes them see the want of our Cloth it\ particular, I have been able to obtain this Agreement, which they hope will be advantageous enough, to make their Wines sell in England.

2 Ann 2o' —

This Agreement will have this Consequence in Portugal, that all their own Manufactures, which at this Time make vast Quantity of ill Cloth, and dear, will be immediately laid down, and totally discontinued, and the Cloth or Stuffs of no other Nation will be able to come in Competition with those of England; of which the Duties, payable here, are likewise very advantageously settled by the Treaty of Commerce made with Portugal in the late Times, and now confirmed by the late Treaty of Alliance.

I am very confident, this will be more fully confirmed to your Lordship, and the Council, by all, who have used the Trade of Portugal; and therefore I have hastened the Execution of the Agreement, that her Majesty might know the Sense of the Parliament, and might let the English Merchants have the Benefit of sending Cloth just at this Tipne, when so great a Quantity will immediately be sold, and used, and when the Remittances of Money hither will be at a very great Disadvantage) unless our Trade can be increased.

The Expedient, for their Satisfaction in their Wines, seems to me the only one, that could be practicable, and advantageous to England; in respect, that, if any thing should have been taken oft" from the Duties of Portugal Wines, besides the Loss to the CrowB, it would have made a fatal Objection in Spain, if they had not been likewise favoured, since their Trade stands equally beneficial to England; her Majesty by this Means being under no Restraint at all, in respect of the present or future Duties on Portugal Wines, so as the Duties on French Wines be continued one Third higher; which, as I believe to be of itself a great advantage to England, so I have had the Satisfaction to see the Parliament, for many Years past, of that Opinion.

I had forgot to mention, that this thing will be a very acceptable thing to Spain likewise, and a Means of obtaining a greater Advantage in our Settlement of Commerce with that Kingdom.

Ordered, That the Consideration of the said Articles, and Extract, be referred to the Committee of the whole House, who are to consider further of Ways and Means for raising the Supply granted to her Majesty.

Ordered, That the Report, with relation to the Proceedings of the House of Lords, and Court of Queen's Bench, in the Case of White and Ashby, be made Tomorrow Morning.

And the same was twice read with a Blank; which was filled up by the House: And then the Rider was

Another ingrossed Clause was offered, as a Rider, For the enrolling all Deeds, that ought to be enrolled.

And the Question being put, That the Rider be read a Second time;

It passed in the Negative.

Another ingrossed Clause was offered, as a Rider, That the Register shall not be a Member of Parliament.

And the same was thrice read, and upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House, to be made Part of the Bill.

Another ingrossed Clause was offered, as a Rider, That the Register shall not endeavour to persuade Electors to give Votes, or dissuade thelu from giving Votes, in Elections of Members of Parliament.

And the same was twice read, with a Blank for the Penalty; which was filled up by the House with tool, and, Vox.. 14.

It was resolved in the Negative.

Leave is given to several Lords to enter their Dissent to the abovesaid Question; and accordingly do enter their Dissents, in the Reasons ensuing:

1st, Because it is a denying Sir Samuel Barnardiston the Benefit of Law, which gives Relief in all Wrong and Injury; and though this be an Action of the first Impression, yet, here being a Damage to the Plaintiff, the Common Law gives him this Action, to repair himself; and, if it were not so, there would be a Failure of Justice; which cannot be admitted.

2dly, Because the allowing this Reversal tends towards the giving the Power and Encouragement to Sheriffs to make false and double Returns; by which means the Right of Elections will be avoided; and it tends thereby to the packing of a House of Commons, which may overturn the whole Frame of the Government, and establish what Religion and Government a pack'd Parliament shall think fit.

Die Veneris, 22 Jan 1702.

AFTER hearing Counsel upon the Petition of Robert Squire, and John Thompson, and the Answer of the Right Honourable Thomas Lord Wharton;

And Debate thereupon;

The Question was put, Whether the Petition of Robert Squire and John Thompson shall be dismissed, and they ordered to answer:

It was resolved in the Affirmative.

Dissentient.

First, Because we conceive, that by this we assume a Jurisdiction in an original Cause, for these Reasons:

1st, Because there has been no Suit between the Parties in the Court of Exchequer; and consequently, this Petition cannot be called an Appeal from that Court.

2dly, Although there was a Suit in the Court of Chancery, yet one of the Persons, required to answer, was not a Party in that Suit; and therefore, as to him, at least, it must be an original Cause.

3dly, Though all had been Parties in the Chancery, yet it never was heard, that an Appeal lay from one Court, that had no Suit depending in it, because there was a Suit depending in another Court.

Secondly, Because no Court can take any Cognizance of a Cause, in which that Court cannot make an Order; but in this Case the House of I,ords cannot make an Order, because very many are concerned in this Record, who are not before this House; therefore this House cannot take any Cognizance of it.

Upon the Petition of Sir Tho. Bellot, Baronet, complaining of an undue Election and Return of John Crew Qffley, Esquire, to serve in Parliament for the

Borough of Netvcastle under Line

That it was agreed, That the Right of Election was in the Mayor, Bailiffs, and Burgesses: That the Sons of Freemen, born while their Fathers were resident within the Borough, and those, who have served Apprenticeships, demanding to be made free within a Year after their Apprenticeships are expired, have a Right to their Freedoms.

That it was further agreed, That Burgesses, living a Year and Day out of the Borough, lost their Freedom.

The Petitioner's Counsel opened, that they did not pretend to a Majority on the Poll, nor particularly to take off so many V otes, as would give it them; but should prove such Practices in the Sitting Member, or his Agents, as would set aside his Election; and hoped, the Committee would consequently be of Opinion, that the Petitioner, with a less Number, was duly elected.

That then Evidence was called to the following Particulars: That the Mayor was very partial in soliciting Votes for the Sitting Member; in refusing to swear some, that had a Right to their Freedom; in denying to poll others; and in binding some of the Petitioner's Voters to the Peace.

That there was Evidence also given, as to Treats, and Entertainments, on the Sitting Member's Account

That at the Election there were several By-brewers, that drew Drink for the Burgesses, that voted for him; and their Houses were distinguished by green Boughs at their Doors:

Vol. 14.

That, in Answer,

The Sitting Member's Counsel first produced the Poll, upon which it appeared, there were,

For the Sitting Member - - 223.

For the Petitioner - - 83.

And Evidence was given, that the First time the Sitting Member came to Newcastle, and offered himself to serve for that Borough in Parliament, he was promised 240 Votes; and therefore was under no Temptation to use any indirect Practices, to secure his Election.

That no Burgess was refused to be polled, but only a Minor, that offered his Vote for the Sitting Member.

That the Mayor made Men free even on the Day of the Election, who demanded their Freedom; and refused none, that had a Right.

That some of the Burgesses, and others, were disorderly, and made such Disturbance at the Sitting Member's Inn, that the Magistrates were sent for to quiet them; who bound all over indifferently, that were informed against

That the Sitting Member did himself forbid several publick Houses treating on his Account.

That the Burgesses, when they were at publick Houses, and the Entertainments, generally paid their Clubs.

That green Boughs were common at most Houses in the Town, and some strewed in the Streets.

That several Burgesses were treated on the Petitioner's Account

That some were threatened, they should be prosecuted for Money they owed, if they did not vote for the Petitioner; and it was undertaken, another should not be troubled, if he voted for him.

That Money was given, and more offered, and some lent, to Burgesses, with a Promise it should not be demanded, if they voted for the Petitioner.

And that, upon the whole Matter, the Committee came to these Resolutions;

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That John Crew Offley, Esquire, is not duly elected a Burgess to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Newcastle under Line, in the County of Stafford.

THE Earl of Nottingham, by her Majesty's Cotn-hiand, said, That the Queen commanded him to lay before your Lordships those Papers, which contain all the Matters, hitherto discovered, of the Conspiracy in Scotland: But there is one thing, which I am also commanded to let your Lordships know is not yet proper to be communicated to the House, because the making it publick may prevent a further Discovery of Matters of greater Importance, than what these Papers contain; but that your Lordships shall be acquainted with this also, so soon as it can be done without Prejudice to the publick Service.

Which Papers, being delivered, were, (according to Order) sealed up at the Table, with the Ix>rd Keeper's Seal.

Then the House agreed, that the Address following should be made to her Majesty, for the rest of the Papers, relating to the Scotch Conspiracy; which is, as followeth;

viz.

Ordered, By the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, That an humble Address be made to her Majesty from this House, to acquaint her Majesty, that they have, by her Majesty's Order, received some Papers, relating to the Scotch Plot; but being at the same time informed, by your Majesty's Direction, that there is some other Matter, not yet laid before this House, they humbly desire her Majesty, that the whole Matter, and all Papers relating the reunto, may be laid before them, with all convenient Dispatch; that this House may not want an Opportunity, before the End of this Session, of enquiring into, and discovering, the wicked Designs and Conspiracies of her Enemies.

After hearing Mr. Attorney-general in relation to that Matter;

The House agreed to the Address following;

Ordered, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, that an humble Address be made to her Majesty, to acquaint her Majesty, that, notwithstanding the Application of this House to her Majesty, for the immediate Prosecution of Boucher, and her Majesty's Directions given therein accordingly, they are highly concerned, to find, there has been such Remissness and Neglect in the said Prosecution.

Ordered, That the Lords with white Staves do humbly attend her Majesty with the Addresses, agreed to this Day by the House.

Die Mortis, l 1703.

1. Her Majesty having so lately acquainted you, that she had communicated to you all the Particulars, relating to the Design against Scotland, which could yet be made publick without Prejudice to the Service, her Majesty did not expect to be pressed upon that Matter, before it was scarcely possible, that the State of it could be altered; and her Majesty makes no doubt, but, before the End of the Session, there will be a proper Time to communicate that, which cannot now be made publick, without great Inconvenience.

2. Her Majesty hath long since directed a Prosecution against Boucher, and very lately examined, what Steps had been made in that Matter; and her Majesty finds, if there has been any Delay in the bringing Boucher to his Tryal, it has been occasioned only by the great Difficulty, and Backwardness of several Persons to give Evidence in Matters of Fact, the Truth of which they cannot but know.

Lords Reprs- Majesty, to clear this House from the Misrepresentations

And the Title thereof was read; and the Report is as followeth; viz.

I N Obedience to the Order of this House, whereby, the Petition of the Governor and Company for making hollow Sword-blades, in England, was referred to us, to examine, and report the Matter of Fact, we have examined the Allegations in the said Petition; and do find,

That the said Governor and Company, by their Agents, or others in Trust for them, or by Assignments from others, became Purchasers of divers forfeited ami other Estates in Ireland, to the Value of 261,297/. 15 s.

That the said Estates, so purchased, were conveyed to them by the Trustees for Sale thereof, in 2S Deeds, Six of which were executed the 23d of June last (the last Day allowed for making Sales) and the remaining 22 Deeds on the qth of July, the last Day allowed for executing Conveyances.

C /

That the said 22 Deeds were brought to the Trustees, by the Agents for the said Corporation, on the said 9th Day of July, with Blanks for the several Sums, to contain the Consideration-money agreed for; but their Account being not stated by the Trustees Accomptant, the said Agents being not ready to settle it with the Trustees, and it being not possible to be done at that Time, the Trustees required the Company's Agents to insert such Sums in their several Conveyances, as they judged sufficient to secure to the Publick the Sum total due upon the said Purchases.

That by such Calculations, as could be made under these Circumstances, it was agreed, the same should be in the whole 263,629/. 15 s. 11 d.of which they were to be allowed, for Incumbrances, 41,953/. 19.?. 10 for Payments into the Exchequer in Ireland, 145,684/ 13 ,v. lid. and that the Residue, secured to be paid should be 75,991/. 12s. 5It/, (which Particulars, we observe, exceed the Total qs. 6d.) but that an Endorsement should be made upon one of the Deeds (a true Copy whereof we find annexed to the said Company's Petition) for the rectifying Errors on either Side, in the best Manner they were able; and, for a further Security to the Publick, the Trustees obliged the Company's Agents to leave all the said Conveyances in their Hands, till this Account could be perfectly settled.

That, upon a just Calculation, since made, it appears, that the said Purchases amount only to 261,297/. 15 A that the Incumbrances on the said Estates, together with the Crown and Quit Rents, amounted to 52,430/. 9 -.

1 Id.and that the Company having paid into the Exchequer of Ireland, 151,740/. os. 6 there remains due only 57,127/. 5 s.4 \d.whereby there is an evident Mistake of 18,864/. 7s. 1 \d.to the Prejudice of the Corporation, which the Trustees w ere of Opinion could not then be rectified by them in the said Conveyances.

And that there is a Proviso in every the said Conveyances, whereby the same is made void, if the whole Sums, in them expressed, are not paid in Manner and Time therein mentioned.

Sir Cyrill Wych, from the Trustees for Sale of the for- Irish forfeited Estates in Ireland, presented to the House their feiture . Reports,

Upon the Petition of Dr. Charles Crave, Lord Bishop of Cloyn; and also,

Upon the Petition of Charles Godfrey, Esquire, and Arabella, his Wife; and also,

Upon the Petition of Richard Stone, Esquire.

And foe Titles thereof were read; and the said Reports are, as follow; viz.

The Report upon the Petition of the Bishop of Cloyne.

To foe honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled:

IN Obedience to your Honours Order of Reference on the Petition hereunto annexed, we find, that the late Bishop of Cloyne, now Bishop of Rapho, did claim the Lands in the Petition mentioned, as the ancient Inheritance of foe See of Cloyne; but not making out a Title in the Church, his Claim was dismissed.

That the Time of hearing Claims was expired before the Promotion of the Petitioner to the See of Cloyne.

That the Petitioner, soon after applied to the Trustees, desiring them to suspend the Sale of the Lands, till Application, could be made to the Parliament of England, for annexing them to the Bishoprick of Cloyne; but the Trustees, not having it in their Power to gratify the Petitioner's Request, did post and expose to Sale the said Lands, in small Parcels, for several Months together, as they did all the other forfeited Lands; but nobody bid for the same till the 23d Day of June, being the last Day of the Sales, when the Trustees did expose the same to Sale at 4,000l. which the Petitioner bought at 4,oco /. on the Cant, and paid down one Third of his Purchase-money, as in the Petition is alleged.

We do believe, the said Lands might have been the ancient Inheritance of the See of Cloyne, and that they were in the Possession of the Church of Cloyn in the Year 1595; but we do not find any Possession in the Bishops of Cloyne since.

The Petitioner does allege, that the Bishop of Cloyne was put into Possession of these Lands by Orders of Council in the Earl of Strafford's Time, and delivered a Memorial to us, signed by several of the Bishops of Ireland, to that Purpose; but no Proof thereof appeared to us, our judicial Power being then determined.

All which is humbly submitted.

of the Estate of the late King commonly called

the private Estate, and were thereto adjudged, as in the Petition is alleged.

That the Trustees paid to the Petitioners the said Rent-charge, and all Arrears due at Michaelmas, 1702, and no longer.

That the Half-year's Rent from , 1702, to

our Lady-day following, was sold to the several Purchasers of the private Estate; who were to pay the Petitioners the several Proportions of Rent their Lands were subject to, and for which the Purchasers had an Allowance by Discount out of their Purchase-money.

We do believe, that the Trustees did execute several Deeds of Purchase of the private Estate, in the Months of April, May and June, last; but all the Copies of the Deeds of Sale being delivered to the Commissioners of her Majesty's Revenue in Ireland, pursuant to the Directions of an Act of Parliament, made last Session, we cannot tell, in which, nor how many, of them, the Words, “ from the Date hereof,” are mentioned.

That, notwithstanding such Words should appear to be inserted in any of the said Conveyances, the Act of Resumption, and the Petitioners Decree, make the Lands, so sold, chargeable as well with all Rent due before the Sale, as with what shall afterwards accrue due, as appears by two Clauses in the said Act, Page 29, and Page 41.

The said Report upon the Petition of Rich. Stone, Esquire.

To the honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled:

May it please your Honours:

IN obedience to your Honours Order of Reference on the Petition hereunto annexed, we have examined the Contents thereof; and do find, that the Petitioner is her Majesty's Surveyor-general of the Kingdom of Ireland, and has the Custody of the Books of Survey, and of a great Part of the other Records, concerning the Titles of the Lands in that Kingdom.

That the Books of Survey were so necessary to us, for making out the Titles, and ascertaining the Bounds of the forfeited Lands, that we had almost the continual Possession of them; and the Petitioner employed a Clerk to attend our Surveyors, as often as required; to explain the Books aforesaid; which w;as of great Service to the Publick.

That the Petitioner has produced to us his own Affidavit, that he gave his said Clerk Security for too/, as set forth in his Petition.

That by the Act of Resumption we had Power to send for Boqks, Papers, and Records, without paying any Fee or Reward; and therefore did not make the Petitioner any Allowance.

That we believe, the Petitioner hath, in a great measure, lost the Benefit of his Office, by our constant Use of his Books and Records; and we do not know of any other Officer in the Kingdom of Ireland, that has done the same.

All which is humbly submitted.

IN Obedience to an Order of this honourable House, dated the 15th Instant, we do humbly lay before this House, by the Hands of foe proper Officers, An Account of all the Bullion, Silver and Gold, entered for the East India's since the last Account laid before this honourable House;

which foe Importers would have put upon foe Officers of the Customs, we have caused to be insisted upon, as well in point of Right for the Crown, as for the Discouragement of the Innovation of those Sorts of Fabricks, to foe Prejudice of our Manufactures; so that those Sorts of Linens are not distinguished, in the Books of foe Customs, from other Holland's Linen.

Most gracious Sovereign,

YOU Majesty having, with great Goodness, declared from the Throne to your Parliament, that divers ill Practices and Designs had been carried on in Scotland by Emissaries from France, which might have proved extremely dangerous to the Peace of these Kingdoms; and that you would lay the Particulars before your Parliament, as soon as the several Examinations could be fully perfected, and made publick without Prejudice; we, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Commons, resting secure and satisfied in your Majesty's great Wisdom and Care,

[a] The Proceedings of the House upon the 7th Resolution of the Committee are not mentioned in the Journal.

Examination of suspected Persons by Lords — Address on Lords Representation.

A. 1763.

Examination of suspected Persons by Lords — Address on Lords Representation.

most thankfuffy acknowledged the Confidence you have been pleased to repose in us:

But finding upon the Ix>rds Journals, that their Lordships, the very same Day, made two Orders; one, to remove your Majesty's Prisoners out of your Custody into their own; and the other, to commit their Examination

solely to a Committee of Seven Lords, chosen and appointed by themselves; by which your Majesty seemed excluded from any Power over the said Prisoners;

Your loyal Commons, justly sensible of the dangerous Consequences of such Proceedings, thought themselves obliged to declare their Concern at this Violation of your royal Prerogative, and the known Laws of the Laud, in an humble Address presented to your Majesty.

Your faithful Commons are well assured, when tills Matter comes to be rightly stated, and understood, a Zeal, so well intended, and so well grounded, will rather lie imputed to them as meritorious, than liable to Exception; and therefore, since their humble Address has been so artfully misrepresented by the Lords, in their late Representation, presented to your Majesty on ,

the 18th of January, and published and spread with unusual Industry through all Parts of the Kingdom, they look upon thei.:.>elves under an indispensable Necessity of appearing before your Majesty in their own Justification.

Their Lordships think fit to take Offence at the Manner and Words of our Address, and accompany this Exception with Reflections, and Insinuations, more harsh, and more odious, than the most opprobrious Language: But as we made use of no Terms, but what were suitable to the Occasion; so it will appear by Precedents, that the same have been frequently and reciprocally used by both Houses to each other; nor could the Commons, in Respect to your Majesty, assert your royal Prerogative in Words of less Force, than those, in which they have vindicated their own Privileges.

Whatever Expressions our Zeal for your Majesty and the Publick might have inspired, we could never have offered to our Sovereign so ungrateful a Remembrance, as the Destruction of the Monarchy by a detestable Assembly, composed of Members ot both Houses, who, being alike Partakers in the Guilt, ought equally to share the Reproach.

With much more Reason might we observe, both on behalf of your Majesty, and the Commons, thut their Lordships, not contented with preferring their own Examinations to yours; not contented with excluding your Majesty, and the Commons, to whom parliamentary Enquiries most properly belong; appropriate to their House only, even in their Application to their Sovereign, the Name of a Parliament; an Instance, not to be paralleled, unless by that very Assembly, that subverted the Monarchy.

It is not the Question at present, as stated by the Lords, whether their Lordships have a Power of taking into Custody, while under Examination, Persons accused of criminal Matters, cognizable in Parliament; but, that their Lordships have a Right to take the Prisoners of the Crown, and the Examination of them, solely into their own Hands, without your Majesty's Consent, and in such a Manner, as must necessarily prove <an Exclusion of your Majesty, and this House, is the Proposition, your Commons deny, and for which their Lordships have produced no Precedent

This unhappy Occasion has been at the same time accompanied with the most surprising Instances of Contradiction, and counter Orders, to your Majesty, both preceding and subsequent to it, but especially on the 29th of January last, when your Majesty, with your accustomed Goodness, communicated to the Lords the Papers relating to the Scotch Conspiracy, with an Exception only of some Matters, not vet proper to be made publick, without preventing a further Discovery of Secrets of greater Importance, with which, your Majesty assured their Lordships, they should also be acquainted, as soon as it could be done without Prejudice: However their Lordships, upon what Provocation, or for what Reason, no where

2

appears, immediately addressed to yoiir Majesty, pressing you to lay before them the whole Matter, and ail Papers relating the reunto; by which your Majesty was put under a Necessity, either to give their Lordships a Refusal, or to comply with their unexpected Importunity, to the endangering the publick Service. These Proceedings, so extraordinary in their Nature, and in their Manner, could not but sensibly affect your faithful Commons, whose earnest Desire it is, to see both your Houses of Parliament, and the whole Body of your People, intirely agreed, to pay the Deference, due to your Majesty's Wisdom, to confide in your Care, and 'to promote and maintain your Honour and Dignity.

Their Lordships, not satisfied with assuming this unprecedented Power, liuve endeavoured, with a great deal of Art, to persuade your Majesty of the Necessity of it, to prevent the Designs of ill Princes, and their Favourites: But as it may seem unreasonable, for their Lordships to begin to practise upon a good Prince such Methods, as are pretended only to be needful against an ill one; so it is our humble Opinion, that the Danger might be much' greater, admitting this Precedent. Should the Lords combine to defend one another from Enquiries, and Prosecutions, all parliamentary Impeachments might be eluded, secret Designs carried on, the innocent aspersed, without Reparation, and the guilty acquitted, without Tryal: Nor is that Instance, mentioned by the Lords, an unseasonable Caution; since that Resolution in a neighbouring Kingdom, alluded to by their Lordships was occasioned by the Encroachments of a prevailing Cabal of Lords, who endeavouring to enslave the People, and to betray their King, and their Country, to a foreign Power, obliged the Church and the Commons to unite in the publick Defence.

Your faithful Commons have found themselves so happy under your Majesty's Administration, that they please themselves with more agreeable Prospects; and, renouncing such Examples of unseasonable Jealousies and Fears, most thankfully receive foe Blessings of your Reign; nor could they have made a more grateful Return for your Majesty's generous Protection of their Liberties, than by a suitable Concern for your Prerogative.

If their Lordships had consulted their own Journals, with the same Care, that we always take to be rightly informed, they would hardly have alfirmed, that a direct Appeal to the Throne, without any previous Desire of Conference, had been an unprecedented Practice: Their Books are filled with Variety of Instances to the contrary. But, without examining their Books, it seetns very surprising, that their Lordships could so soon forget their Address, presented to your Majesty the last Session, on behalf of foe Lord Bishop of Worcester, and their Address to the late King, on behalf of William Earl of Edward Earl of Orjord, John Lord Somers and Charles Lord Halifax, impeached by the Commons of high Crimes and Misdemeanors; and when this House formerly expostulated with the House of Lords, for proceeding in the very same Method, of which they now complain, their Lordships made a most solemn Declaration, in these Words:

“ That they must ever assert a Liberty in their House, “ to apply to the Throne, by themselves, for the doing “ any thing warranted by Law, &c.”

Nor can the Lords, we presume, upon second Reflection, deny the Commons the same Liberty, which their Lordships themselves have so strongly asserted, and so frequently practised.

Your loyal Commons sincerely concur w ith their Lordships, in declaring, that we will never contribute, by any Act of ours, to foe Diminution of the Rights of foe Crown; and, that we will not suffer it in others, your Majesty, their Lordships, and the whole World, may judge, from the Example we have now given. If their Lordships do truly wish, the House of Commons may, ill all Times to come, speak, and act, with that Regard, to foe Prerogative, which they allow us the Honour to have now taken up, we shall be very unfortunate, to

continue

2 Ann. i 8° — 190 F 345

continue under their Displeasure at the same time when they seem to hope, that those, who succeed us, will take Pattern by us.

We wish, tljeir Lordships also, on their Wrt, may continue, in all Times to come, to speak with that Regard to parliamentary Impeachments, which they seem so lately to have taken up; since w« have Reason to apprehend, that the Misunderstandings, which have of late Years arisen between the Two Houses, have been principally owing to the Artifices of some particular Persons among themselves, whom the Commons thought it their Duty, for the publick Safety, to bring to Justice: How much more difficult will all such Endeavours be rendered, should their Lordships be once admitted sole Examiners of Accusations against each other, as they are already sole Judges?

We are accused, but most unjustly, of exciting, and earnestly desiring, your Majesty to exert your Prerogative against the House of Lords. We appeal to the Words of our Address, if it is possible, naturally, to impose any such Sense upon any Expression, that is there. We are sorry, their Lordships should descend so low, as to the straining and wresting of Words; by which they rather discover an unfortunate Inclination to make us seem culpable, upon any Terms, than that they, in Truth, believe us so. We know, how vain and how fruitless an Application it would be, to excite your Majesty to any Abuse of your Power, which, we are convinced, you will always exercise for the general Good; and so far are your Commons from entertaining any such Desire, that we heartily wish to see a good Correspondence preserved between the Two Houses; nor would forbear to purchase it at any Rate, except the giving up the Rights of your Majesty, by whom we are protected, and the Liberties and Properties of the People, by whom we are intrusted.

These few Instances, so plain, and so uncontestable, we presume, will be sufficient, without trespassing much longer upon your Majesty's Time, to discredit whatever else has been alleged, to create in your Majesty, and those we represent, an ill Opinion of us. We have been careful and industrious, to avoid, as far as was consistent with our necessary Justification, all Occasion of reviving Animosities; and, how great soever the Provocation has been, your Majesty having declared, how uneasy you are under such Misunderstandings, we shall make no Difficulty to lay aside our Resentments, who shall always be ready to# sacrifice our Lives and Fortunes to yourQuiet and Service: Nor can we doubt, but we must stand fully acquitted to the whole World, and especially to your Majesty, since the Zeal, that we have shewn, and the Reproaches, that we have borne, have been owing to no other Cause, but the Defence of an excellent Queen, in whose Hands God Almighty has placed the executive Authority over these Nations; which Authority it has been the only Endeavour of your faithful Commons to preserve as intire, as our Laws and Constitution allow.

May it please your most sacred Majesty:

It is with the deepest Concern, and a Grief not to be expressed, that your dutiful and loyal Commons have found themselves engaged in Disputes of this Nature, by which they have been so unseasonably interrupted in finishing the Supplies, and other Matters of the highest. Importance: How zealously they have applied themselves to the Discharge of their Duty, appears from their having already presented your Majesty with the greatest Part of their Aids, with a Dispatch, and Unanimity, beyond Example; nor could the few Rills, yet depending, have met the least Obstruction or Delay, but from the indispensable Necessity of vindicating your Majesty's royal.Prerogative, the Privileges of our own House, and the Rights and Liberties of all the Commons of in several Iii-

«tances invaded almost at the same Time. We wish, there may have been more of Mistake, than Design, in those, who have created these unhappy Differences. However, we desire, the Remembrance may be henceforth blotted out; and that there may remain- no other Impression in the Hearts both of Lords and Commons than Vox- 14.

a sincere and passionate Concern fof your Majesty's Welfare and Glory, nor any other Contention ever hereafter arise, but by whom the publick Good shall be best advanced, the Protestant Succession, and the Church of England, best secured, and the just Rights and Preroga1-tives bf the Crown best supported.

But we think it fit for us to observe, that a Surplusage of 30/. per Cent, out of the said Establishment, arising by the Difference of the Value of Money in that Province, hath been directed, by Warrants to the Governor, to be applied to the Pay of a Chaplain, and several Persons, thereby added, and the Overplus to the Contingent Use of the said Companies, and the Fortifications of the Province, an Account whereof was to be given to the Committee of Trade and Plantations, and the Lords of the Treasury; whereby, out of the Balance aforesaid, there is to be deducted, for the Uses mentioned in the said Warrants, the Sum of - - £. 3,060 19 2

That the Counsel for the Lord William Powlet opened the Matter, that the Lord William Powlet had been in Possession of the Lands in Question ever since the Death of his Father, the late Duke of Bolton; and that the Persons, who served the Order, at the time of such Service,. took notice, that they were Tenants to the Lord Powlet.

Wm. Marshall, And it appeared by the Evidence of some Jos. Chapman, Tenants of the Premises, that they had been John Whaling, Tenants to the Lord William Powlett about Five Years; and William Young, when he served them with the Order, which was about the 20th November last, did so far take notice, that they were Tenants to the Lord William Powlet, as to forbid them paying Rent to his Lordship.

This fact seemed to be admitted.

And the several Proceedings were, as follow:

John Lauze was Plaintiffin Chancery against Sir Charles Windham, and others, Executors of the late Duke of Bolton; to which Suit the Lord Wm. Powlet is no Party.

23 July, 2° Anna Reginas, the Plaintiff, upon an Allegation, that the Defendants had not given Obedience to a. former Order, in bringing to Mr. Gay, a Master in Chancery, such Securities, as they had in their Hands, relating to the Premises, to the end an Assignment might be prepared, for the Defendants to execute, the Plaintiff obtained an Order, for staying the Rents in the Tenants Hands, unless the Defendants complied, within One Monti), with the former Order, in bringing to the said Master such Securities, and executing of an Assignment.

On the nth of November, William Young served the Tenants with a WTrit of Execution of that Order.

29th November following, the Plaintiff obtained a further Order, for delivering Possession to the Plaintiff, quieting the Plaintiffin that Possession; and that the Rents, stayed in the Tenants Hands, should be paid to the Plaintiff, unless Cause was shewed to the contrary by a certain Day.

9th December, upon a Motion made by the Defendants Counsel, the time for shewing Cause was enlarged to the then next general Seal.

25 January, upon the Petition of the Lord lett, the Time was enlarged for Ten Days.

That the Counsel on the other Side insisted, that the Clerks could not take Notice, the Lord JVm.

Tenants were concerned, he being no Party to the Suit; and besides that, if there was any Privilege originally, it was waved, by the Lord JVm. Powlett's appearing in Chancery, and submitting to the Orders of that Court: Apd cited the Case of the Lord De la and Sir

John Cutler.

That it was admitted, that the Lord was in Court, upon the Motion made the 20th December; and that he attended the Master upon the Reference, directed by that Order.

introduced his Motion, the 20th December, by saying, the Lord JVm. Perwlet might insist upon Privilege, but he could not advise him to do it; and that being a Clerk in the Chancery Court, and appearing for the Plaintiff before the Master, asked the Lord JVm. if he might

speak for his Client, without Breach of Privilege: That his Lordship answered, he had a mind to trick him; but Mr. Tolson replying, that he did not ask him to wave his Privilege, his Lordship gave him Leave to go on; and accordingly he did then, on behalf of his Client.

That, by way of Reply, it was observed, that the Case of Sir John Cutler did not come up to this, the Lord William Pcm-lct being no Party to this Suit; and that what were alleged as Instances of his waving of his Privilege, were subsequent to the Breach of it, now complained of.

And that, upon the Whole, the Committee came to these Resolutions:

Sir Dudly Cullum, reported from the Committee, appointed to examine Two Books; one intituled, “ Second ' “ Thoughts concerning human Soul, [a] as believed to be “ a spiritual immortal Substance, united to human Body, to “ be a plain heathenish Invention, and not consonant to “ the Principles of Philosophy, Reason, or Religion;” the other, “ The grand Essay; or, Vindication of Reason “ and Religion against Impostures of Philosophyand to collect thereout such Parts, as are offensive; and to examine, who is the Author, Printer, and Publisher, thereof; that they had examined the same accordingly, and had collected out of the said Books several Passages therein, which they conceive offensive; and that they found, that Dr. William Coward was the Author of the said Books; and that Mr. David Edwards was the Printer of the one, and Mr. William Pierson was the Printer of the other; and that Mr. Bassett was the Publisher of the said Books: Which Report he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was read, and is, as followeth:

In the “Second Thoughts concerning human Soul&c.

Pa. 84. “ Now the Notion of an immaterial, im-

“ mortal, substantial, Being in Man, or Soul, was one of “ those Principles, I had by Education so imbibed; and “ having thought fit, more strictly to enquire into the “ Reasons or Foundation of this Belief, 1 find it to be “ only an Opinion derived down to Posterity, as it were, “ upon Trust.”

Pa. 85. “ But these Grounds of the framing an im “ material immortal Soul in Man I look upon to be idle “ and fabulous; and conceive it ratlier to be the Consent “ and Doctrine of the Philosophers, in general preaching, “ that Virtue was to be rewarded, and Vice punished; “ and, when they usually saw good Men to die untimely “ Deaths, and unrewarded too, being ignorant of a

[a] The Words, “ demonstrating ths Notion of human Soul," inserted in the Journal of the 10th of March preceding, p. 273, as Part of the Title of this Book, are here omitted, both in the Journal, and the printed Votes.

VOL. 14.

“ Resurrection, taught their Seliolars, that Men's Souls, “ after Death, remained alive, to receive the same; e. “ good Men, Rewards, and ill Men, Punishments.”

Pa. 88. “ Now after the Piety of the primitive Christians began by secular Interest to be perverted, and the “ Ambition of crafty Prelates grew so high, as to require “ to be supported in Grandeur and State, then it became “ convenient to propagate this Doctrine to the Height.” Pa. 144. “ Thus, upon the Whole, we find, how

“ weak and insufficient the Arguments of Philosophy “ are, to defend the Opinion of an immaterial Soul, “ united to the Body; what idle and trifling Distinctions “ they are forced to make, to defend it; what Shifts and “ Evasions they frame, to support their Notion; insomuch that a Man may say, there is no Plea, to ground “ a Belief on the Philosophers Arguments, which pretend “ to establish Two distinct Substances, spiritual and “ material, in Man, but only to those, who are resolved “ not to be informed, and will know no better.”

Pa. 176. “ If we allow this Conjunction of Body and “ Soul to be the Union of an immortal immaterial Spirit “ to a mortal material Body, where is then the Mystery “ of the hypostatick Union? The Union of the Soul and “ Body no Man yet ever allowed to be a Mystery of “ Religion; therefore, either both must be reputed so, “ or neither.”

Pa. 206. “ 1. That human Soul will cease, when the “ Bddy dies (t. e. Life, and Soul, are the same thing in “ Scripture) and consequently, the common Notion of a “ spiritual immortal Substance, united to, or in, Man, is “ erroneous:

“ 2. That, by the common Course of Providence, “ Man's Immortality begins not until after the Resurrection.”

“ As to the First Proposition, thus I argue: If it appear by the whole Current of Scripture, that Life is “ properly the Soul of Man, and no Text gives us a “ sufficient Ground to call it an immaterial Substance; “ then the Soul of Man will cease to be, when the Body “ dies: But it appears by the whole Current of Scripture, “ &c. ergo, the Soul of Man will cease to be, when the “ Body dies; and, consequently, the Notion of a spiritual “ immortal Substance, united to, or in, Man, is erroneous.” Pa. 222. “ Thessalon. Cap. iv. Vers. 13, 14. — Who “ will be changed in a Moment, in the Twinkling of an “ Eye, at the last Trump: For this Corruptible must put “ on Incorruption, and this Mortal put on Immortality, “ before it can be pronounced, that Death is swallowed “ up in Victory. 1 Cor. xv. Vers. 51. &c. Where it is “ very observable, that the Apostle, in all the whole “ Course of his Writing, says, “ we,' not, “ our “ Bodies;” who cannot be called “ weAs, “ We shall “ not all sleep; “ We shall be raised incorruptibleand, “We shall be changedWhich could not be true, “ were the Soul, our better Part, an incorruptible immortal Being already; for that has no Change at all, “ but retains its first immortal Nature.”

Pa. 278. “ Obj. 14. “ Then shall the Dust return to “ the Earth, as it was; and the Spirit to God, that gave it “ Therefore, herein is a plain Distinction of Soul, and “ Body; and that, when we die, our Souls will certainly “ return to God.”

“ Answer: This is the great Goliah Argument, generally brought to knock down all Op posers; though it “ argues not for an immaterial spiritual Substance, but is “ rather, and ought to be explained as, a Confirmation “ of my Opinion.

Pa. 280. “Thus far, I think, I have sufficiently answered all Objections, brought from the Old Testament: “ And though there occur many of the same Nature in the Apocrypha, and, indeed, more seemingly opposite “ to my Opinion, yet I shall here pass them by, until the “ Apocrypha be proved canonical; and so proceed to “ Objections, extorted from the New Testament.

“ 1. The First I meet with, that seems significant, is “ this: “ Fear not them, that can kill the Body, but are “ not able to kill the Soul; hut rather fear him, which is

“ able

380 170 Ma . 1703.

“ able to destroy both Body and Soul in Hell.” Matth. “ x. [a] 28. Therefore there is a Being in Man, distinct

“ from his Body, capable of being cast into a Place of “ Torment; whereas the Body only lies in the Power of “ Man, and not the Soul, to be destroyed.”

Pa. 283, 284. “ Answer: If by this Text was meant a spiritual, substantial, immortal, Soul, no doubt, but “ that oiir Saviour knew it, and so did his Disciples, to “ whom he then preached this Doctrine; therefore, for “ our Saviour to instruct them in a Doctrine, The “ Impossibility of Man's Power to kill an immortal Spirit, “ which they must know before, if true, would savour “ more of trifling, than giving of real Instructions in “ Christianity; for it might easily be returned, that all “ the W orld knows, an immortal Spirit cannot be killed; “ so that such Instructions are vain, and useless.”

P. 285, 286. “ Lu. xxiii. 43. “ This Day” (says our “ Saviour to the Thief on the Cross) “ thou shalt be with “ me in ParadiseTherefore his Soul must be there with “ our Saviour, or else our Saviour's WTords could not “ be admitted for Truth; for, be sure, the Thief's Body “ was buried, and laid in the Ground, as others were.

“ Answer: This Objection, though oft brought, I cannot see of what Force it is, unless it be, to tell us, “ that our Saviour spake to the Soul of the Thief, when he said, “ Thou shalt be with me in Paradise,” “ Thou “ Soul of the Thief, for owning me, shall this Day be “ with me in a State of Bliss: But, O Thief! thy Body “ shall go to Corruption, as other Bodies do.” Now “ what a Speech must such Men make for our Saviour, “ that give such an Interpretation of this Text, let the “ Learned judge.”

In “ The grand Essay,” &c.

Pa. 185. “ Theol. How could Man come by this immaterial Substance, but at the first Creation ? And it's “ plain there, by express Words, that he was made no “ more than a living Creature.

“ Philos. You had as good throw your Cap into the “ Air. All the Heathen Philosophers preached up Man “ to be made of a Soul, called immaterial Substance, and “ Body; and if you throw all the Old and New Testametit at that Doctrine, you'll never confound it, or “ convince its Believers to the contrary.”

Pa. 186, 187. “Theol. Don't a Man die if he lose “ his Life

“ Philos. No; he doth die in his Body, but not in his “ Soul; for that lives as well, if not better, than it did “ in the Body.

“ Theol. Not one Word of this, or like it, do I find “ in the Bible. This is as much as to say, a Man doth “ die, and he doth not die. Pray what is meant by dying “ in his Body

« “ Philos. His material Body dies.

“ Theol. As far as I find, it never lived; for it was V the Soul lived all the while; and how can any thing die, which never lived

Philos. “ It's no matter how; it is so: The Soul, or “ immaterial Substance, gave the Body Life; and now “ it is separated, the Body is dead.

“ Theol. What Chapter and Verse, for your immaterial “ living Substance, in the Bible

“ Philos. I told you, you were always for Scripture. “ It's so by Philosophy, that's enough: And so, if a “ Man is said to sleep in Death, he is as fully awake in “ his Soul, the next Minute of Separation, as ever he “ was in his Life in this World.

“Theol. A pretty Way of sleeping indeed! You “ Philosophers make us believe any thing. I'll be stigmatized [fora Fool#] all iny Lile-time, if you can bring the “like Case, where so many Absurdities, without any Warrant from Scripture, or common Reason, are believed.” That Mr. Bassett was called in to the Committee; and being asked, who was the Author and Printer of the Book, called, “ Second Thoughts concerning human “ Soul,” <$c. said, that Doctor William was the

Author of the said Book; and that Mr. David Edwards printed the same.

That l»e sold about Three hundred of the said Books, and had Three pence a Book for selling the same.

Mr. Chaunt ry being asked, who was the Author, and

Printer, of the Book, called, “ The grand Essay,” said, that Doctor Coward was the Author, and William Pierson was the Printer.

That he sold Five hundred of the said Books, by Doctor Coxcard'sDirections; and that the said Doctor

Mr. Edu ards said, that he printed Part of the Book, called, “ Second Thoughts;” and that Doctor Coward delivered to him the Copy.

Mr. Pierson said, that he printed the Book, called,

“ The grand Essay;” and that Doctor Coward delivered him the Copy, and lie printed Five hundred of them.

Doctor Coward, being called in, said, that he hath not read the Book, called, “Second Thoughts,” &c. since Edwards printed the same; so that he knows not, whether it be printed according to his Copy: He never intended any thing against Religion; and that there is nothing contained in those Books, contrary either to Morality, or Religion.

That he does not deny himself to be the Author of those Books; and, if there be any thing the rein, against Religion, or Morality, he is heartily sorry, and is ready to recant the same.

Resolved, That the said Books do contain therein divers Doctrines and Positions, contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of England, and tending to the Subversion of the

Christian Religion.

Ordered, That the said Books be burnt by the common Hangman Tomorrow Morning, in New Palace Yard, Westminster; and that the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex do assist the Serjeant at Arms attending this House, in seeing the same done.

Mr. Secretary Hedges reported to the House, that their Address had been presented to her Majesty, That she would be pleased to direct an immediate and effectual Prosecution against Philip Papillon, Esquire, late Cashier of the Victualling, to compel him to account, according to the Course of the Exchequer; and that her Majesty had commanded him to acquaint the House, tint she had given necessary Direction, as they had desired.

Ordered, That Thomas Addison, Anthony Shephard, and David Elder, Esquires, Three of the late Commissioners for the sick and wounded Seamen, and Exchange of Prisoners at War, by directing their Receiver to make several great Payments to themselves, have exceeded their Instructions, acted in a Method very unsafe to the Publick, and rendered the passing of their Accounts more chargeable, and difficult.

To the honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled.

May it please your Honours:

IN Obedience to your Honours Order of Reference, bearing Date the 17th Instant, on the Petition hereunto tmnexed, we have examined the Contents thereof; and find, that William Cloxcdesky, the Petitioner's late Husband, was a Vintner in the City of London; and that, during his Life, there was an Account between him and Sir Patrick Trout, for Wine, and other Things, in the Way of his Trade, as a Vintner.

That the said Account begins the Twenty-seventh Day of October, 16S2, and is carried on in his Book, and transferred from one Page to another, to the 7th of April, 1686, where the Sum total, for Goods delivered to that Day, comes to One hundred Ninety-two Pounds, Seventeen Shillings, and Nine-pence.

That, on a further Inspection into his Books, about 220 Pages forwards, we find another Account of Goods, delivered for the Use of the said Sir Patrick com-

mencing the 9th Day of December, 1686, and carried on to the 7U1 of August, 1688, amounting to Seventy Pounds, Eleven Shillings, and Nine-pence; which is transferred to another Page, where an Account is held with him by the Petitioner, after her Husband's Death, to the Sixth of February, 1G88, and there the Sum total for Goods delivered to that Day, is Seventy-one Pounds, Fifteen Shillings, and Five-pence; which Account is there closed, and without any Notice there taken of the One hundred Ninety-two Pounds, Seventeen Shillings, and Nine-pence; and whether paid, or not, docs not appear.

That both these Accounts do at this time lie open in his Books, and do amount to the Sum mentioned in the Petition.

That the said William Clou'desky died about the 8th of August, 16885 and the Petitioner took out Letters of Administration to him the 4th of September following, and filed an Original, in Michaelmas Term after, for Two hundred Sixty-five Pounds, Five Shillings, and Twopence, in the Court of Common Pleas, against the said Sir Patrick Trant.

That the Petitioner saith, she can give no Account of w hat passed between Sir Patrick Trant and her deceased Husband, w ith relation to the Discharge either of the one or the other Account, only that, at the Time of his Death, she found them lying open in the Books, without an Entry of any Money received towards Payment.

That the Petitioner did, by her Agent, demand the above Debt of us in Ireland; but not being able to make Proof thereof, and no Mention being made of the Debt in the Schedule, annexed to the Deed of Settlement, made by the said Sir Patrick Trant for Payment of his Debts, her Petition was dismissed.

To the honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled.

IN Obedience to your Honours Order of Reference, on the Petition hereunto annexed, we have examined tho Allegations thereof; and do humbly certify, that the Trustees are altogether Strangers to any Disposition, made by the Petitioner's Father, of his personal Estate before his Attainder.

That the Petitioner did exhibit his Claim before the Trustees, alleging, that his Father, by virtue of a Settlement, made by him in the Year 1602, after Marriage, was but Tenant for Life, with a Remainder in Tail to the Petitioner.

That the Trustees gave great Indulgence to the Petitioner, in allowing him many Hearings by a great N umber of Counsel; and, upon deliberate Consideration had of the Acts of Settlement, and Explanation, and the Resolution of Doubts, upon which the Determination of this Case chiefly depended, and upon consulting the Judgments of the Courts of Law and Equity in that Kingdom, and the Construction of those Acts (in which the Security of the Protestant Interest is highly concerned) Judgment was given, that the Petitioner's Claim should be disallowed; and the Lands have since been sold, as the Forfeiture in Fee-simple of Francis Leigh, the Petitioner's Father, for Flight thousand Nine hundred Twenty-three Pounds, besides Two thousand Three hundred Thirty-three Pounds, Ten Shillings, paid by Lawrence Steel, Esquire, who, after Notice of the Settlement, and Advice had thereupon, purchased of the Lord Grantee

of the said Estate, who was in Possession thereof from the Time of the Grant, till the said Estate was vested in the Trustees.

That the Petitioner is in Possession of an Estate, reputed worth between Fyur and Five hundred Pounds per Annum; but whether it came to him from his Father, or what other ltelation, we know not.

That, whether the Petitioner's Family were English, or Irish, does not appear to us; but, upon hearing his Claim, we found, that the Ancestors of the Petitioner were outlawed for the Rebellion of Forty-one, and not adjudged innocent.

All which is humbly submitted to your Honours.

That the Petitioners alleged, that their Grandfather was non compos Mentis, when he made the Settlement in the Petition mentioned; and that he was Two Years afterwards of sound Mind and Memory, when lie made a Disposition of his Estate, by Will, from his Heir at Law, under which the Petitioners claim.

But it appearing by sufficient Proof, that he was of sound Mind, when he made the said Settlement; and that, if there had been neither Settlement, nor Will, the Petitioners had no Title, they not being Heirs at Law, the Trustees dismissed the Claim.

Mir. Manley reported from the Committee, appointed publick to draw up Reasons, to be offered to the Lords at a Account; Conference, fot disagreeing with their Lordships in their Amendments to the Bill, intituled, An Act for the taking,: examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom; that the Committee had drawn up Reasons accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House: Which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were once read throughout.

Then the First Reason was read a Second time, and, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

And the Second Reason, being read a Second time, was, with an Amendment made thetolo, agreed unto by the House.

And the Third Reason, being read a Second time; was, with an Amendment made thereto, agreed unto by the House.

And the other Paragraphs, being severally read a Second time, were, with several Amendments made there- unto, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed unto by the House; and are, as follow:

The Commons disagree to the Amendments, made by your Lordships to the Bill, intituled, An Act for the taking, examining, and stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom.

As to your Lordships First Amendment, by leaving out Robert Byerly, Esquire, and inserting the Names of Sir JohnHubland, Sir William ScawMr.

the Commons disagree, for these Reasons, which were delivered to your Lordships in February, 1691, upon the Amendments, then made by your Lordships to the ad ditional Bill, for appointing and enabling Commissioners to examine, take, and state, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom:

1st, Because in all Acts, that have been passed, for taking Accounts of publick Money, the Commissioners have been always named by the Commons only; and, in particular, in an Act, passed the 19th Car. 2dl, intituled, An Act for taking the Accounts of the several Sums of Money therein mentioned; which Actimpowers the Commissioners, therein named, to take Account, not only of Money granted by the Commons,' but also of other Sums of the publick Revenue; and although that Act requires an Account to be givea to the King's Majesty, and to both Houses of Parliament, yet all the Commissioners, thereby constituted, were named solely by the Commons.

2dly, The Commons by this Bill appoint those, whom they name Commissioners, to do that out of Parliament, which, during the Session of Parliament, is the proper

Work

4

388 44 — 4 7

Work of the House of Commons, in whom, by the Law s and Customs of the Kingdom, the Power of granting Supplies to the Crown is vested, as an essential Part of their Constitution; and the taking and examining the Accounts thereof is, of Right, in them also; and they being the Representatives of all -the Commons, no Commoner can be named, but by them.

3dly, The Disposition, as well as granting Money by Act of Parliament, hath ever been in the House of Commons; and these Amendments, relating to the disposing of Money to the Commissioners, added by your Lordships, do intrench upon that Right. ' 7

And your Lordships having since agreed to several Bills, wherein the Commissioners for pa Wick Accounts were solely named by the Commons, th$y are surprised, to find your Lordships make such an Amendment to this Bill;

But, besides these Reasons, the Commons, having maturely considered the Report, and Observations, laid before them this Session by the Commissioners of Accounts, of whom Robert Byerly, Esquire, wa& one, have thereupon come to this Resolution: [

“ That the Commissioners, for taking, examining, and “ stating, the publick Accounts of the Kingdom,' have “ faithfully discharged the Trust reposed in them,'to the “ Satisfaction of this House, and the general Good of “ the whole Nation:” ' .

And therefore, could this House: admit (whieb they never can) that your Lordships might leave out any Com- miskioners, appointed by this House, and appoint others; yet they cannot consent to the leaving out Robert Byerly, Esquire, of whose Abilities and Integrity) in tbc Discharge of this Trust, they have had so much Experience, and who was named by this House in Two' Bills of Accounts, passed by your Lordships, without any Exception made by your Lordships to him. i

The Commons observe further, that, though your Lordships have increased the Number.of Commissioners, and from Seven made them Nine, you have not thought fit to alter the Quorum, Which continues to be Four; whereby great Absurdities, and Inconveniencies, may happen, from contrary inconsistent Actings in the same Commission.

As to the Clause, marked A, being your Lordships Second Amendment, the Commons disagree;

Because, had the Commons no other Direction to it, there is a Provision made in the Bill (intituled, An Act for punishing Mutiny, Desertion, and false Musters, and for better paying of the Army, and Quarters, and for satisfying divers Arrears, and for a further Continuance of the Powers of the five Commissioners, for examining and determining the Accounts of the; Army) for the examining and determining the Accounts of Major-general Windham's Regiment df Horse, by the Commissioners, appointed to take, exandine,. and determine, the Debts, due to the Army, and for Transport Service, and also an Account of the Prizes, taken during the late War.

The Commons are sensible, that this Bill is absolutely necessary at this Time, as is evident from the Detections, already made by the Commissioners of Accounts, of many great Frauds, Abuses, and Irregularities, to the Prejudice of the Publick; and they are very apprehensive of the ill Consequences, that may attend the Loss of this Bill; yet nothing being of greater Importance to the Publick, thatl the maintaining the just Rights and Privileges, which do belong to each House of Parliament, according to our Constitution; and it being the sole undoubted and inherent Right of the Commons to give Money, and grant Aids, which are to be raised by such Methods, and with such Provisions, and the Disposition thereof to be made in such Manner, as the Commons only think proper, upon which Right the Amendments, made by your Lordships, do plainly intrench; the Commons therefore cannot agree to your Lordships Amendments to this Bill.

Ordered, That the said Reasons be offered to the Lords at a Conference.

Conference Ordered, That Mr; Casar do go to the Lords, and

desired with desire a Conference with their Lordships upon the Subject-

Vol. 14.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

THE great and remarkable Success, with which God hath blessed our Arms in this Summer, hath stirred up our good Subjects, in all Parts of the Kingdom, to express their unanimous Joy antt Satisfaction; and I assure myself, you are all come disposed to do every thing, that is necessary, for the effectual Prosecution of the War; nothing being more obvious, than that a timely Improvement of our present Advantages will enable us to procure a lasting Foundation of Security for England, and a firm Support for the Liberty of Europe. This is my Aim:

I have no Interest, nor ever will have, but to promote the Good and Happiness of all my Subjects.

Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

I must desire such Supplies of you, as may be requisite for carrying on the next Year's Service, both by Sea and Land, and for punctually performing our Treaties with all our Allies; the rather, for that some of them have just Pretensions, depending ever since the last War; and I need not put you in mind, of what Importance it is, to preserve the public Credit both abroad and at home.

I believe, you will find some Charges necessary next Year, which were not mentioned in the last Sessions; and some extraordinary Expences incurred since, which were not then provided for.

I assure you, that all the Supplies you give, with what I am able to spare from my own Ex pences, shall be carefully applied to the best Advantage for the publick Service; and I earnestly recommend to you a speedy Dispatch, as that, which, under the good Providence of God, we must chiefly depend upon, to disappoint the earliest Design of our Enemies.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

I cannot but tell you, how essential it is, for attaining these great Ends abroad, of which we have so hopeful a Prospect, that w e should be entirely united at home.

It is plain, our Enemies have no Encouragemeflt left, but what arises from their Hopes of our Divisions: Tis therefore your Concern, not to give the least Countenance to those Hopes.

Mv Inclinations are to be kind and indulgent to you all.

I hope you will do nothing, to endanger the Loss of this Opportunity, which God has put into our Hands, of securing ourselves, and all Europe', and that there will be no Contention among you, but who shall most promote the publick Welfare.

Such a Temperas this, in all your Proceedings, cannot fail of securing your Reputation both at home and abroad.

This would make me a happy Queen, whose utmost Endeavours shall never be wanting to make you a happy and flourishing People.

Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That an humble Ad- Address on dress be presented to her Majesty, returning her Majesty the Queen's the Thanks of this House for her most gracious Speech; Speech, and to congratulate her Majesty upon the glorious Success of her Majesty's Arms; and to assure her Majesty, that this House will enable her Majesty, with Supplies, to pursue those Advantages; and will give the speediest Dispatch to the publick Business.

Over-castings.

For 44,813 16 1 of for Subsistence, for which no Warrants are produced, and for which no Accounts were stated by the Commissioners for the Army's Debt.

For 6,690/. 17 s.4 d.to Colonel Colt's Regiment, the Acquittances of the respective Parties not produced, as is directed by a Memorandum in the Queen's Warrant

For 3,5311. 7 s.6d. being so much over-computed in the Duke of Bolton's West India Regiment.

For this Sum the Accomptant has produced the said Vander Esch's Acquittances, or the Acquittance of Mr. Sohnius, his Deputy, as also the Establishments,

and Regulation of Subsistence, of these Troops; but no Warrants directing the Payment thereof; nor has Mr. Vander Esch rendered any Account for the said Sum, whereby it may appear, that the same has beeu _ paid to the said Troops.

(Acquittances are only produced for the Payment of this \ Sum, but no Warrants to authorize the same.

Warrants are produced for the Sum, demanded by the Accomptant; but this Sum is disallowed, because so much more than is allowed by the Establishment.

Being either un vouched for Want of Warrants and Acquittances, or Part of the Debentures before charged, and not issued out, no body having made their Claim thereto.

Vouched only by the Earl of s Bill of Ex-

change, and is so much more than the said Earl has accounted for in the Exchequer, as received of the Lord Ranelagh.

No Warrants for this Sum, only Bills of Exchange, drawn by the said Count and Mr. Vander Mere, and no Voucher for 26,737 /. 10$. 6 d. said to be paid to the Dutch Ambassador.

rWe do find Warrants, and proper Discharges, for the greatest Part of this Sum; but the same having been paid by the Accomptants Deputy, Mr. Hill, in Flanders, in foreign Money, and not having expressed in his Accounts, at what Rate these Sums were turned into Sterling Money, we have not allowed the same.

For some Part of this Sum there are Warrants, but no Acquittances; for other Part thereof there are Acquittances, but no W'arrants; and the Remainder, though vouched by Warrants, and Acquittances, yet, being in foreign Money, cannot be by us allowed, without further Authority, as is before mentioned.

Though the Accomptant has produced Warrants and Acquittances for a great Part of this Sum, yet he having charged himself with no Deductions, made for the said Bread and Forage, as the Establishments and Regulations of Forage do direct, alleging, that the Sum, here demanded, was paid over and above what the said Deductions amounted to; yet, till the Accounts of the said Deductions shall be produced, and examined, which he alleges are in the Custody of Mr, Hill, we conceive, we cannot allow him any Part of

the said Sum.

'Certificates wanting, that they were qualified for their Earl of Pensions, as the Establishment directs, by Certificate Ranelagh's of the Colonel, Captain, and Surgeon of the Regi- Accounts, ment, in which they served.

Though 'tis for their Subsistence, and short of their established Pay, yet there are no Warrants for Payment, nor the Authorities produced, by which the Agents of the said Invalids did receive the said Subsistence.

Part of this Sum was paid in foreign Money, viz 1,666/. 13 s. 4 d.and the Remainder is without Voucher; besides, the Warrants, directing Payment of the said 1,666/. 13 s. 4 takes notice, that the same was to be repaid Mr. Hill, in Flanders; and it appears not to us, but that the same was so repaid.

The Accomptant has produced Warrants for Payment of Part of this Sum, which was most of it paid in foreign Money; to which we have not only the fore going Objection, as to the Rates, at which it is to be allowed in Sterling Money, bot do also want the Establishment of die Hospitals, and the Contracts for Provisions, in order to examine, whether the Sums, brought to Accoont, are allowable by the Establishment.

The Warrant for this Sum directs it to be paid pursuant to Contract, and Bills signed by Sir Millington, Doctor Hutton, and others; but neither the Contracts nor Bills, so signed, are produced to us.

For 14,430/. 19«. io</. of this Sum the Commissioners of Transports, Mr. Fielding, Mr.

Mr. Van Odijck, and others, are accountable, and when allowed, must be made an Insuper upon them; but is disallowed for want of Warrants.

The Vouchers for the remaining 28,656/. 3

are defective, as well for want of Warrants, as because the same is paid in foreign Money, which we cannot allow at the Rates at which it is demanded in Sterling Money, without further Authority, as is C afore mentioned.

/'Beingeither Payments, made in foreign Money, or such;

} as are brought to Account, without Warrants, and y Acquittances, to vouch the same, or not appearing to C be paid for the Use of the Army.

These Payments are made in Hollands Money, and the ' Sums demanded for the same in Sterling Money, cannot be allowed by us, without further' Authority;

Besides, some of the Warrants are in general Words, for Sums advanced, lent, or disbursed, for his Majesty's Service, and for Interest of Money lent; but the Nature of the Disbursements are not expressed ip many Cases.

f Whereof 4,087 /. 17 s. 10 d.appears not by any Acquit-| tance, to be paid; and 4,020/. 18 4 is without

( Warrant or Acquittance.

/'Though die Accomptant has produced the late King's general Warrant of the 1 st of May, 1694, that he shall be allowed such Sums, as shall be occasioned by this Loss; yet he has not produced any Account how it amounts to this Sum, save an Account for 43,156/. is. id. made by his Deputy, Mr. Hill, in Flanders, attested under the Hand of the said Mr. Hill; which, we conceive, is not a sufficient Audiority to allow the same.

The Return of the Comptroller of the Victualling to the Order of the 11th Instant, for laying the State of Mr. Papillon's Account, now under Examination, with the Exceptions made to the Articles of the said Accounts, and to the Vouchers for the same: And also,

The Representation of the Commissioners of Victualling.upon the said Order.

And the Titles of the said Accounts were read.

And the Accounts are, as follow; viz.

The Return of the Comptroller.

THAT the late Treasurer of the Navy's Leidgers, for the Affairs of the Victualling, have been signed and passed by the Navy-board, from the 25th of November, 1689 (at which Time Mr. Papillon came to be his Cashier) to the End of the Year 1697.

That the Leidgers for 1698, and 1699, as also another, for the Bills made out by the former Commissioners of the Victualling, were some time since delivered into the Office of the Comptroller of the Victualling; but, upon Examination thereof, the following Exceptions have arisen thereto; viz.

1 st. The voluntary Charge is not certified by the Commissioners of the Victualling, as it ought to be, for regularly charging the Accomptant with the Produce of the Sales of Offal, Tallow, Hides, decayed Provisions, Bran, Small-coal, old Stores, &c.

2d. The Accomptant appearing to have double Vouchers in his Hands for Payments made for short Provisions, necessary Money to Pursers, Freights to Hoymen, &c. namely, both the gross and the particular Bills for the same Services, it is necessary, it should be examined by the Commissioners of the Victualling, and the one, or the other, vacated, and taken up, to prevent double Allowances.

3d. He is also found to have, in some Cases, Two perfect Bills for the same Thing, in different Persons Names; which must be examined and corrected by the said Commissioners, to prevent double Allowances.

4th. Likewise, both the imprest and perfect Bills, to many Persons, are discovered to be in his Hands; so that the former must be called for, and vacated, and only the latter allowed, to prevent double Allowances.

5th. The Debt of the former Commissioners being paid by their Successors, by new Bills, and he having both the one and the other in his Custody, either the old or new Bills must be taken up, and vacated, to prevent double Allowances.

6th. Several Bills are observed to be antedated, and some of them paid with Money, which should (by the Lords of the Treasury's Orders) have been paid with Salt Tallies, and others with the said Tallies, which should have been paid with Money.

7th. The said Cashier, since his Office ceased, hath not only received several Sums of Money for Offal, &c. but likewise from the present Treasurer on Bills to one Row, which he bad Money in his Hands to answer, and hath refused to return the same.

8th. The Allowance of Imprests for great Sums of Money is claimed; but it is not thought safe, for the Crown to allow any Imprests, which have been cleared by perfect Bills in his Hands, for fear of double Allowances; and therefore it is necessary, that That Matter should be examined, and cleared, by the Commissioners of the Victualling.

9th. Several Bills claimed to be allowed, which are not fully signed by the Commissioners of the Victualling, and others, which want the Receipts of the Parties for the Money alleged to be paid thereon.

The said Representation of the Commissioners of the Victualling, on an Order from the honourable House of Commons, of the nth Instant, for laying before their Honours the State of Mr. Papillon s Accounts, now under Examination, with the Exceptions made to the Articles of the stud Accounts, and to the Vouchers for the same, put down, as they lie in each Paragraph of the Return, made by the Comptroller of the Victualling.

TO the 1st. Tis acknowledged, that we, the present Commissioners of the Victualling, are not enabled fully to certify toward charging the Accomptant with the Produce of the Sale of Offal, Tallow, Hides, Bran, Small-coal, old Stores, &c. in former Years before our Time; for that, after much Application, to satisfy ourselves, we cannot find any Books in the Victualling Office, from-whence to make a regular Charge on him, or to trace, whether he hath voluntarily charged himself on those Heads, to the Degree he ought to do.

2d. On our examining into the said Cashier's Accounts, we find a great many small Bills to sundry Persons, for short Provisions, necessary Money to Pursers, Freight to Hoymen, &c. to so great a Number, as a Collection of them, from the Year 16.89 to 1700, fills a Volume, and amounts to 268,477/. 145. 3d. from which petty Bills general ones were made out, in the Names of Jacob Woodward and George Row, then Officers in this Office, containing all the particular Bills, paid by Mr. Papillon within each Month; and both the small Bills, and those general ones, were remaining in the Accomptant's Hands, till lately he delivered them over to us; and being diligently in hand with examining them, we meet with sundry Matters observable; as, that those petty Bills run in Discharge of Imprests to considerable Value; that they carry with them a great many Abatements for short Deliveries by Hoymen, &c. which ought to be charged on the Accomptant; from whence such Examination requires the more Care, and takes up much the more Time; but we are now near a Close on this Head, and shall suddenly make our Report thereof to the Commissioners of her Majesty's Navy.

3d. As to the Accomptant's having, in some Cases, Two perfect Bills for the same Thing, in different Persons Names, we are not yet come to the Examination thereof.

4th. Both the Imprests, and perfect Bills, to many Persons, are discovered to be in the Accomptant's Hands; and though we have not yet been able to examine into the Particulars, this Remark we must beg Leave to make, that, after such a Space of Time, as looking back for 15 Years, through the Action of the late War, in an Office, which appears to have been then managed under the greatest Confusion of Accounts, no Journals or Leidgers being found, by which to charge or discharge, no Course or Assignments in the Payments of Bills, but some of them paid in few Days, Weeks, or Months, while others, of the same, and preceding Dates, remained for several Years unpaid, nor, when perfect Bills were paid, was it noted on them, what Imprests they were to clear, it must from hence be a Matter of the utmost Difficulty, if possible, for us, thus in the Dark, to come at a Certainty therein; but nevertheless we shall set about examining the same, with our utmost Care, to prevent any Prejudice to the Crown.

5th. This Exception will be duly regarded, as we shall proceed in the examining these Accounts.

6th. This respects the Conduct of our Predecessors, and was transacted, before any of us came into the Commission.

7th. There was a Bill of 772/. 6j. 2 made to George Row, in Discharge of sundry petty Bills for short Provisions, Freights, &c. which being after numbered on our Course, and paid by Sir Thomas Littleton, the present Treasurer, this Money, 'tis said, was received by Mr.

Restraining Commerce with France.

Papillon after the Determination of his Office; and we wrote to him, to repay it into the Treasury of the Navy, that her Majesty might have had the Benefit of it on the current Service; but have not understood, that it hath been yet done.

8th. There is a Necessity to examine, what perfect Bills he bath in his Hands, towards clearing Imprests, for preventing double Allowances; wherein our Endeavours will by duly employed, though no small Difficulties attend the Performance of it, as is represented on the 4th Article.

9th. Such Bills, as are claimed to be allowed, and not fully signed by the late Commissioners of the Victualling, we shall examine into; and if we can find Vouchers remaining in this Office, to warrant our signing such Bills, we shall add what Hands are wanting, or otherwise report, why it cannot be done.

Mr. Blathwait (according to Order) presented to the House, the Answer and Report of the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, pursuant to the Order of the 14th Instant, by which they were to lay before the House their Opinion, as to the best Method for restraining Commerce with France, and negotiating Bills of Exchange from thence.

And the same was read, and is, as followeth; viz.

THAT there being at present no Statute Law in force, which does absolutely forbid a Commerce with France, or the Importation of French Commodities, and no other Restraint upon that Trade, than what is directed by the Declaration of War, Which forbids all Correspondence or Communication with her Majesty's Enemies, we are of opinion, that an Act be passed, with proper Clauses, and severe Penalties, against Persons corresponding in any Manner with France, and for the Confiscation of Ships, importing Goods of the Growth of France, and likewise of Goods so imported into England-, it being always sub- , mitted to the great Wisdom of this honourable House, how far it may consist with the general Interest of England, as well in respect to our Navigation, as Commerce, to forbid the vending the Commodities, of the Growth and Product of this Kingdom, or of the Plantations, into the French Dominions, or Dominions of their Allies, whilst there is, or may be, an open Trade carried on between some of her Majesty's Allies, and France.

As to restraining the negotiating of Bills of Exchange from France, the best Method we can offer at present, is, that an Act of Parliament be passed in that behalf, impowering her Majesty to issue out her royal Proclamation, declaring, that if any of her Majesty's Subjects shall knowingly correspond in Bills of Exchange, or Matters of Money, with any Persons furnishing Money to France by Bills of Exchange, the Persons so offending shall be liable to such Penalties, as shall be enacted; by which Act Power may be likewise vested in£ix, or any other Number, of her Majesty's Privy Council, to examine such Letters, and Bills of Exchange, as they shall suspect may tend towards the carrying on a Correspondence with France, or furnishing that Kingdom, their Armies, or Allies, with Money, and to cause such Bills to be returned back; which, we are humbly of opinion, will have a good Effect towards the stopping of Bills of Exchange, for the Supply of the French Armies, in case her Majesty's Allies do proceed in like Manner, and take the same Care within their Dominions.

Mr. Lowndes,

I wonder at you, that you would not pass the Clause we sent you, for pardoning our Fortunes, as it was, but to put us to so much Trouble in altering it. It might have been worth Ten thousand Pounds to you, if you had passed it, as it was penned; but, as 'tis now proposed, our Committees think, it will be worth little to them. I earnestly desire you, for your own Sake, let it pass, and be put into the Callicoe Bill, as 'tis sent you next, without any Alteration, there being a very considerable Sum of Money lodged in a Friend's Hands of yours, who has and will assist you effectually herein; and I will answer, he neither shall nor can deceive you; for I will certainly let you know, what your Proportion is allotted to be. I hope, you will never think it reasonable, that such a Company as ours should be undone by a Parcel of Informers, and Scotch Pedlars. You shall know me by the Questions I shall ask you, when we meet next in the House. In the mean time, I am

Yours,

HER Majesty the Queen of Great Britain having represented to his Majesty the King of Prussia, by my Lord Duke of Marlborough, who has been dispatched to him expressly for this Purpose, in what Risque and D.anger the Affairs of the Allies are, by the unhappy Condition, whereunto the Duke of Savoy appears to be reduced, and that all the Advantages, gained by the Allies this last Campaign over France, and its Adherents, might be destroyed and lost, if some Endeavours were not used, to recover the tottering, and otherwise altogether desperate, Affairs of that Prince; that, on this Consideration, her said Majesty the Queen of Great Britain had thought fit to address herself to his Majesty the King of Prussia, as the only Prince of Europe, who, by the great Number of Troops, which he has on foot, w as most in a Condition, and w as the most enabled, to remedy this Misfortune, and thereby to give a great Weight to the Re-establishment of a constant and sure Tranquillity in Europe:

His Majesty the King of Prussia having nothing in the World more at Heart, than to employ all the Forces, which God hath given him, for the publick Good, that he may be able to concur in the glorious Designs, which her Majesty the Queen of Great , and the other

Allies, have formed, for the Safety of Europe', and that he may answer, as is fitting, the Confidence and Consideration, which her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain has been pleased to express for him, in sending the Person of the said my Lord Duke; his Majesty would not cast his Eye on any thing, that might have diver,ed him from the Resolution of entering into the Propositions of the said my Lord; and after some Discourse, which, himself, and some Conferences, which his Ministers have had with him, the following Articles are agreed upon:

I. His Majesty the King of Prussia shall send a Body of Eight thousand Men into Italy, there to be employed in the Year 1705, jointly with the Troops of the Emperor and of the Duke of Savoy, against France, for the Good of the common Cause, and for the Interest of the Allies.

II. This Body shall be composed of Six thousand Foot, and Two thousand Horse, with the Generals, and other Officers, necessary to command them.

III. In order to concur to the Subsistence of these Troops, her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain shall pay her Quota Part towards the Sum of30o,oooo Crow ns, which shall be paid to his Majesty for this Corps by the Year; it being not doubted, but that the High and Mighty Lords the States General of the United Provinces, who daily give so many Marks of their Zeal, and of their good Intention, for the Good of the common Cause, will enter with Pleasure into this Convention,

Treaty with

King of Prussia.

and also give their Proportion, equally with her Majesty, towards the said Sum of 300,000 Crowns; which shall be paid at Twelve equal Terms, to wit, 25,000 Crowns at each, at Amsterdam, in the current Money of the Exchange whereof shall be made good unto his Majesty so far as Geneva: And these Payments shall commence on the 15th of January, N. S. that the Troops, which shall begin to march as soon as may be, may do what is possible, whereby to arrive about the Middle of February in the Dominions of the Duke of

IV. It being impossible, that the Sum of Money, stipulated in the precedent Article, should hold out to subsist so considerable a Number of Troops, his Imperial Majesty shall engage himself, that, besides the Sum above-mentioned, which is to be paid by England and Holland, he will furnish and deliver, by Carriages, maintained at his Expence, to the said Body of 8,000 Men, the ordinary Rations of Bread, during the Time of their being in the Field.

V. The General, who shall command this Corps on

the Part of his Majesty the King of shall have

full Jurisdiction over the Troops, which compose it; and he shall obey no Orders, but those of his Royal Highness the Duke of Savoy, or the General Commander, according to his Rank: lie shall likewise have the Liberty of voting, and sitting, in all Councils, which shall be held for the Operations of the War, equally with the other Generals of his Rank and Character; and this Corps shall not be separated, without his Consent.

Vf. A Regulation shall immediately be made with his Imperial Majesty, and with his Royal Highness the Duke of Savoy,concerning the Road, which the said Troops

shall take to get into Italy; and since one Part of the said Troops is to come from Prussia, his Imperial Majesty and the Allies shall so order it, that they may take the shortest Road to get thither; and that there be given, as well to those Troops, as to such, whom his Majesty shall send from these Quarters, through all the Countries, and States, where they are to pass, all Facility, w hereby they may be able to march conveniently.

VII. In the Quarters to be given to these Troops, during the Winter, they shall enjoy the same Advantages, in Utensils and other Things, which were enjoyed by the Battalions, which his Majesty the King of Prussia gave his Royal Highness the last War; and an Agreement shall be made with the Emperor about the Recruits of this Corps, in case of any Loss, during this Year.

VIII. As to the Exercise of Religion, the Lazarett, or Hospitals for the Wounded, and Sick, and other Points, requisite for the Preservation and Re-establishment of these Troops, all shall be observed, that was stipulated lliereabout between his Majesty the King of Prussia, and his Royal Highness, in the last War, for the Troops, which were then sent by his Majesty to his said Royal Highness, in the same Manner, as if it came to a new Agreement thereon for the Succours, now given by his Majesty to him.

IX- If by the Operations, which shall be made jointly by these Troops of his Prussian Majesty, and those of the other Allies, any Advantages shall be gained over the common Enemy, whether in France, in the Milancze, or any other Place, his Majesty shall always have his Part, in Proportion to his Troops, well in Contributions, Prisoners, Cannon, Ammunition, as all other Things, of what Nature soever they may be.

X. Since his Majesty will cause this Corps to act with all possible Vigour for the Good of the common Cause, and that it is just, that herein his own Interest be not neglected; the Emperor, the Queen Britain,

the States General, and the Duke of Savoy, do engage themselves, that, in the Operations to be made towards Italy against France, a very particular Regard shall be had to the Interests of the King of Prussia, with respect to those, which he may have on that Side, and, particularly, to his Right on the Counties of At and

Valengin; whether it be, in putting his Majesty into Pos-

session tlieteof, as soon as can be, or, that no Peace, or Truce, shall be made with France, unless his Majesty be intirely contented as to his said Rights and Pretensions.

XI. There remaining yet to be paid by the Crown of England to his Majesty tire King of Prussia, for the last War, a Sum of about 236,000 Crowns; her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain shall endeavour, and do her

' best, that in the present Session of the Parliament of England, some Funds may be found, to pay off that Sum, or that, which shall be justly due, before the End of the next Year.

XII. His Majesty the King of Prussia, out of his great Zeal for the Good of the common Cause, having offered, that, besides the 8,000 Men, which he is obliged by this Treaty to send to the Duke of Savoy, he will moreover give 3,000 Men for the Moselle, upon Condition, that these 3,000 Men be reunited in one and the same Corp9 with the 12,000 Men, which are at present on the Upper Rhine, and the 5,000 Men, which arc in the Pay of England and Holland, making together a Corps of

20,000 Men: And my Lord Duke of Marlborough being not authorized to agree with his Majesty on this Article, his Grace, however, being of Opinion, that this Proposition cannot but be very advantageous for the Good of the common Cause, will use his Endeavours with her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, that, in case her Majesty shall make an Augmentation of Troops on this Side the Sea, she may take the Troops of his Majesty the King of Prussia, preferably to any others; and that he will do all he can, to the end that the High and Mighty Lords the States General do the same on their Part, and consent, in like Manner with her Majesty the Queen, to the Junction of the 5,000 Men with the rest of the Troops of his Majesty. There shall be given to his Majesty the King of Prussia, a positive Resolution on this Point, at the same time, when the Exchange of the Ratifications of the present Treaty shall be made.

XIII. The King of Prussia having represented to my Lord Duke of Marlborough several Articles, which he desires may be regulated, some with his Imperial Majesty, and others with the High and Mighty Lords the btates General; viz. concerning the Succession of Orange, the upper Quarter of Guelderland, the Quarters of Bavaria and of Cologne, the Contributions established, and to be established, in the Enemy's Country; her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain will employ her Credit, and the Power, which she hath with the said Potentates, to the end his Majesty may forthwith be satisfied as to all these Points, according to Equity and Justice.

XIV. When the Time shall come, to treat of a Peace

in Poland,her Majesty the Queen shall not only support

with all her Credit, and with all her Power, the Pretensions, which his Majesty the King of Prussia shall propose on that Occasion, in order to the obtaining for him alt possible Satisfaction thereon, but will likewise endeavour with tire Emperor, and the States General, to do the same on their Part.

XV. The present Treaty being only for One Year, to commence from the 15th of January, as is above mentioned, it shall be agreed on, Two Months before the Expiration of the said Year, whether, and upon what Conditions, this Treaty shall be prolonged; but, in case it be not thought fit to continue k longer, the Troops shall have, for their Return, the Pay of a long Month.

XVI. The present Treaty shall be ratified within

Month after the Date of the signing, or sooner, if it can be. In Witness whereof, the present Treaty hath been signed, and sealed, in the Name, and on the Part, of her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, by my Lord Duke of Marlborough; and, in the Name of his Majesty the King of Prussia, by the Count de Great

late Majesty, the Interest on the Blank Alalt Tickes was doubled from the 25th of Alarch, 1699.

That by an Act, made in the First Year of her present Majesty Queen Ann, Provision is made for Payment of all the Blank and Benefit Malt Tickets; but the same does not commence till the 1st of August, 1706, and is continued till the Year 1710; so that the said Benefit Tickets, yet unpaid, have been about Five Years and a half deficient, and ever since the 24th of June, 1697 (which is above Seven Years and a half) without Interest.

That there still remains 18,565 /. of the said Benefits unpaid; and, notwithstanding the y have been so long deficient, and that the Government had the Benefit of drawing them, they carry no Interest at all.

That, upon the Report of the Committee, to whom '

the Petition of the Proprietors of the said Tickets, last Session of Parliament, was referred, this House did, on the 18th of Alarch, 1703, give an Instruction to the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill, for better securing and regulating the Duties upon Salt, was committed, to receive a Clause, for securing the Interest on the said Benefit Alalt Lotte 17 Tickets.

Ordered, That the said Report be referred to the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill, for continuing Duties upon low Wines, and upon Coffee, Tea,

Chocolate, Spices, and Pictures, and upon Hawkers,

Pedlars, and Petty Chapmen, and upon Aluslins, and for granting new Duties upon several of the said Commodities, and also upon Callicoes, China-ware, and Drugs, is committed.

A Petition oiJohn Benson, Under-sheriff of Middlesex, clandestine was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, that Outlawries, he finds by the Votes, that the Bill, for the better enforcing the Execution of the Law, for preventing clandestine Outlawries in personal Actions, is committed; and being advised, the same will greatly prejudice the Petitioner, and also all Sheriffs in general, lie prays to be heard by Counsel before the said Committee, touching the said Bill.

The Orders of the Day being read;

Mr. Dryden reported from the Committee, to whom the Petition of the Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of the Peace, Gentlemen, Freeholders, and others, Inhabitants in the County of Huntington;

And also the Petition of the Justices of Peace, Gentlemen, Freeholders, and other the Inhabitants, of the County of Bedford-,

And also the Petition of the Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of the Peace, and other Gentlemen and Freeholders, . of the County of Norfolk, in behalf of themselves, and the poor Inhabitants;

And also the Petition of the Mayor, Sheriffs, Citizens, and Commonalty, of the City of Norwich, in Common Council assembled;

Were referred; the Matter, as it appeared to them, and Four Resolutions of the Committee thereupon; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where foe same were read, and are, as follow; viz.

That foe Petitions of Huntingtonshire and Bedfordshire being foe same in Substance, the Committee proceeded to examine the Witnesses of both together: And to prove foe Matter was produced;

William Barnes, Wm. Rawlins, Aaron Brown, John Wright-, who informed the Committee; that for Twenty, and Five-and-twenty, Years last past, they chiefly employed themselves in buying of Sea-coals at King's Lynn, in the County of Norfolk, and selling them again in the several Counties of Huntington and Bedford:

That, for about 16 or 17 Years last, they had paid id.a Chaldron for such Coals, Foreign-bought (over and above 4 d.which they paid before) by virtue of certain

By-laws, made for the Use and Benefit of the Poor of Lynn, as foe Vender (who is always a Freeman) has told them; saying, “You know, I must pay foe said “ 12 d.for the Benefit of the TownAnd then they

agree for the Price of foe Coals, as well as they can;

That, in case they buy Coals of a Freeman of not Foreign-bought (that is, not bought of an Importer, who is not a Freeman of Lyn) the said 12 is not demanded; but the Seller agrees for a reasonable Profit perhaps at 3d. or 6d. per Chaldron:

That all Masters of Ships, and others, importing Coals to Lyn, not being free of foe said Town, are compelled to lie Three Days in foe Port, before they are permitted to sell their Coals, though a Freeman may sell, or unload, as soon as he arrives; and then they are obliged to sell to a Freeman only, or else the Coals are seized by foe Corporation of Lyn, as forfeited, upon Pretence of a Custom, called Foreign-bought and sold; which has been put in Practice for about Sixteen Years:

That the Ships, using foe Coal Trade from Newcastle to Lyn,are lessened in Number by One-fifth, occasioned

(as they conceive) by the said By-laws, or Customs; whereby also her Majesty's Duties on S.ea-coals is diminished, many People within the said Counties using Pit-7

coals, and other Fuel, who otherwise would bum Sea-coals':

That a Lyn Ship, now trading in Coals to Newcastle, will make as much Profit in One Voyage, as formerly in Two, the Freemen engrossing all the Sea-coals into their Hands; and if foe Buyer will not give them their Price, they will lay them up.

That William Barnes said, he bought Coals at Lyn, between May Day and Michaelmas last, for 25 s. per Chaldron, and Forty Bushels to the Chaldron, and sold the same again at St. Ives for 31$. 4 foe Chaldron; and that they cost him per Chaldron Freight; and that he sold but 32 Bushels to the Chaldron at Bedford.

Aaron Brown said, that he paid between May Day and Michaelmas last, 26 s. 6d. a Chaldron at Lyn, and sold them at Bedford for 37 s. 6 d.per Chaldron.

And that all the Witnesses agreed, they never made any Complaint of foe said By-laws, or Customs, to the Mayor or Corporation of Lyn, because (as they said) they thought, it would have been to no Purpose.

That, in Answer to which,

Mr. Rolf foe Town-clerk of Lyn, said, that there never was any By-law made by the Corporation of Lyn: That Eight-pence per Chaldron, for Sea-coals, should be paid for all Foreign-bought, or sold, Coals, imported into their Harbour, and not consumed in the said Town; but believes, there was a Combination, or Subscription, for that Purpose, entered into by the Ship-masters, and other Freemen of Lyn, trading in Coals, which was for the Relief of the Seamens Widows and Orphans, lost in a great Storm in 1695, whereby foe Town of Lyn lost Twenty of their Ships, and, since that, to foe Value of above 12,0001.

That this 8 d.per Chaldron is collected of the Freemen by the Churchwardens, and Overseers of the Poor, of Lyn; and never knew, that anybody ever complained of it to foe Mayor and Corporation; but foe Freemen do not j>ay foe said 8 d. per Chaldron, for such Coals, as they spend themselves; and if this House shall not allow of the said Collection, it shall be discontinued.

That 4 d.per Chaldron, for all Coals, so imported

into the said Harbour, has been paid for foe Use of foe Corporation of Lyn, for above One hundred and Sixty Years, but not by the Freemen.

That Lyn was a Corporation by Prescription, long be- ' fore foe Reign of King John: That he granted them a Charter, with divers Privileges, and referring to the Charter of Oxford, in case of any Doubt

That the Freemen of Oxford did, Three hundred and Thirty Years ago, adjudge, that all foreign Ships, importing Coals to Lyn, shall sell the same upon a Market-day only, upon Forfeiture of the Coals, as Foreign-bought, and sold, except to a Nobleman, or Freeman, or any other Person that buys the same for their own Consumption.

Mr. Rolf also acquainted foe Committee, that by Foreign-bought, and sold, is meant, where both the Buyer and Seller are Foreigners; but if either of them be a Freeman, it is not within the Meaning of those Words; and foe Corporation of Lyn do claim that Privilege of Foreign-bought and sold, by Prescription, for above 500 Years.

That all Coals, so imported, must be sold to the: Freemen of Lyn, except as aforesaid; but the Foreigner1 might always sell his Coals by Retail, as soon as he came into Port; and he never knew, that any of them were denied to sell to a Freeman in gross, upon asking Leave of the Mayor of Lyn so to do, several of them having.' had such Leave granted.

He also produced Two By-Laws, made by foe Corporation of Lyn, foe one dated foe 21st Day of May, 1688, and foe other the 29th Day of April, 1689; whereby it was resolved, That the said Corporation would use all lawful Ways and Means to support and maintain their ancient Rights and Privileges, in obliging all foreign Ships, bringing Sea-coals to that Port, not to deliver their Coals

3 Ann. 3 Februarii.511

in gross, till they have laid Three working Days, to be computed from the Time of such Ship's mooring within their Harbour, for serving the poor Inhabitants, pursuant to an ancient Custom.

That Mr. Rolf also said, the Occasion of making those

By-laws was, to prevent Persons going.down to Sea in Boats, and forestalling the Coals, before they arrived in the Port of Lyn, and engrossing them in great Quantities;

but believes, there was a Mistake, as to the Three Days; because, he takes it, they ought to have been confined to sell upon a Market-day only, which are , and

Saturdays, weekly.

Mr. John Turner, now Mayor of Lyn, said, that, during his Mayoralty, there has been but One Foreigner, that did ask Leave to unlade his Coals, as soon as he arrived in their Port, his Ship being leaky; and it was granted him; and believes, he should have given the like Liberty to others, if they had asked it.

Mr. Charles Turner, late Mayor of Lyn — that, while he was Mayor, several Foreigners, importing Sea-coals, desired Leave of him to unlade; and he denied uone, that asked for it.

Mr. Upzcood said, that he has sent several hundred

Chaldrons of Sea-coals from Lyn to Bedford, by Boatmen, who often leave the Coals upon the Banks of the River, and go Two or Three times to Lyn, before they deliver the Coals at Bedford", whereby the Coals are much wasted; and he never had above 26 Bushels to the Chaldron, delivered at Bedford.

And that, upon the whole Matter, the Committee came to the following Resolutions; viz.

Resolved, That it appears to the Committee, That the Freemen of the Town of Lyn in the County of Norfolk, have, for many Years last past, by a Combination amon< themselves, exacted Eight-pence per Chaldron for all Coals, sold in the Port of Lyn by Persons not being free of the said Town (more than has been anciently paid) without any Colour of Law for it.

Resolved, That it appears to the Committee, That the Corporation of Lyn, in 1688, and 1689, made Two several By-laws, whereby they obliged all Persons, trading in Coals to the Port of Lyn, not to deliver their Coals in

f'oss, till they have lain Three working Days in the stud ort, from the Mooring of the Ship.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That there is an ancient Custom in the Town of Lynn, called Foreign-bought, and Foreign-sold; which is a Monopoly, and a very great Grievance and Oppression to the Inhabitants of die Counties of Huntingdon and Bedford.

That, upon the Petition of the City of Norwich, referred also to the said Committee, the Matter appeared, upon the Examination of the several Witnesses following; viz.

Mr. John Jex, Mr. James Ward, Mr. Tho. Myles, (all of Lowestoff) that they have been Dealers in Shipping,

and sold Coals at Yarmouth, for Fifteen, Eight, and Nine, Years; and that they have been obliged to sell their Coals to the Freemen of Yarmouth only, or else to get a Freeman to sell for them; and then they are forced to aliow half a Chaldron out of Twenty, for the Benefit of the Town of Yarmouth, and another half Chaldron in the Score to the Freemen, that either buy, or sell, the Coals; and this they take, and demand, as a Right, or else the Coals are seized; but said, that oftentimes the Freemen, by' reason of their great Dealings, do remit their half Chaldron.

That they are also obliged to pay to the Town of Yarmouth for unfree Ballast (as they call it) Eight-pence Halfpeny per Chaldron, for every Chaldron of Coals, that are imported or made out there, although they use but Five or Six Ton of Ballast; and that a Freeman of Yarmouth pays only 4l d. per Chaldron.

That they also pay to the Chamberlain of Yarmouth 4 s.6 d. for every Vessel, that comes into that Port, for Anchorage, Peerage, Pilotage, and Outgoing, though it was but 45. before the present Water-bailiff 's time; yet he You 14.

insists upon 45. 6d. as his Right; and, besides have paid Coal an Half-peny, a Peny, and Three Half-pence, per Chal- Trade, dron, for Metage, to the Chamberlain: And Ward said, that a Master of his paid 20 s. for the Use of the Capstern; when his Vessel was on Ground, but told him, the Cable was thereby damnified.

That were it not for these Customs, or Duties, they should import much more Coals, than they do; but, by reason thereof, they send them to Ipswich, Harwich, and other Ports, where they sell to a better Advantage, than at Yarmouth, although they sell their Coals something cheaper: And Mr. Jex said, he should send Five Vessels, for One, to were it not

for those Payments; and then Coals might be afforded cheaper.

And Ward said, that, for the same Reason, he had a Pink went twice to Harwich this Year, which should otherwise have gone to Yarmouth; and that they do not know, that any other Port, or Freeman, takes, or demands any such Duties as aforesaid.

Cyrill Rich, Esquire, said, that he, going upon the Key of Yarmouth, with Intent to buy Coals, observed, that a Master of a Vessel had lain there loaded some Time; and asking him the Reason of it, answered, he had not staid his Time, for that he must lie Three Market-days there, before he could sell his Coals; and that the Market Days are twice a Week.

Mr. Hehvys, Alderman of Norwich, said, that the Town of Yarmouth monopolize Shipping, as well as Coals; for , that he bought a small Ship with a Freeman, of Yarmouth, in Moieties; and the Ship arriving at Yarmouth, laden with Coals, the Town demanded, and took, of him los. 6d. as a Composition for Half a Chaldron of Coals, as a Foreigner, though the Coals were for his own Consumption at Norwich, and never was a Dealer in Coals any otherwise.

That Coals are cheaper Southward of Yarmouth, thart there, where they have brought them to near the Price, though the Wages for Labour is double at London.

That the Charges of the Capstern, and Cables to it[ were paid for by the Couqfies of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the Inventor of the Capstern had Ten Guineas given him for his Contrivance.

Elisha Philippo, of Norwich, said, that one Joseph Had-(foc/r bought some Deals, imported by a Danish Vessel at Yarmouth; and the Town seized the Deals, as foreign-bought, and foreign-sold; and Haddock broOght a Re-plevin, and the Matter going on for'Trial, the then Tdwh-clerk of Yarmouth (one Mr. Godfrey, since dead) advised Haddock to make an End with the Town, and submit to pay a Fine; for that the Town was rich; and believed,' their Custom was against Law; yet it wbuld cost him Money, to try it with them; and, if he would make his Submission, he promised, his Fine should be repaid him:

And accordingly Haddock did submit, was fined, and the Fine repaid by Mr. Godfrey, at Mr. s House,

with Costs of Suit.

That; in Answer to Norwich Petition,

Mr. Anth. Ellis and Mr. Andrews, Aldermen of Yarmouth, 9aid, that the Town of Yarmouth had appointed them, and others, to attend the Committee upon the said Petition; and that they did not dehy the Evidence, produced by the Petitioners; but alleged, that Yarmouth was a Borough by Prescription, long before the Reign of King John ", artd that the same Customs, Usages, and Duties, were then there irt' Practice, and paid to the CrOwn, as are now to the Town, and to which they have a Right.

That King John granted them a Charted, and thereby gave them all the Soil, Rights, Privileges, and Customs, of the Borough, then in the Crown, reserving a Fee-farm Rent, of Five-and-fifty Pounds per Annum, to him, and his Successors.

In Consideration'of the Customs and Usages of the Borough, they had no profitable Lahds or Tenements, thereby granted them, nor claim any other Customs, or

Dufies,

512

Duties, that what are founded upon the Charter of King John, except an Admiralty Jurisdiction granted them by Queen Eliz.

That, by virtue of such Rights, and Customs, the Town of Yarmouth have always claimed, and taken, half a Chaldron in the Score of all Coals, imported there by Foreigners; and the Freemen of Yarmouth have the sthnc Right to another Half Chaldron; but never heard, it was ever taken by any of them, for this 25 Years (while he has been a Dealer) till upon the now Complaint.

That the Freemen of Yarmouth have, by ancient Custom, a Right to buy and sell all Merchandize and Commodities, imported there, exclusive of all others; and produced a List of many Seizures, where sold to a Foreigner; the First of which was in 140 Edw. III. the last in 1648.

That they have such a Custom as Foreign-bought, and 6old, which is, where both Buyer and Seller are not Freemen: but, if either be a Freeman, it is not so.

That what the Town of Yarmouth claim, they do it by ancient Custom, and not by any By-laws, though they have By-laws, as a Community, for disposing of tire Moneys arising by their Customs, and Duties.

That they have no Custom, to oblige a Foreigner to lie in their Port Three Market-days before he sells his Lading, but that he may sell immediately to a Freeman of Yarmouth.

That the Town of Yarmouth yearly employ One hundred Forty-five Vessels (besides many other Ships to London) in the Coal Trade, and breed about 500 Seamen: That these Ships import about 24,000 Chaldrons yearly in Time of War (last Year 29,000;) and in Time of Peace, making Six Voyages in a Summer (as they might do) about 43,000 Chaldrons.

That for Three Years last, commvnibus annis, the Produce of the Half Chaldron, taken by the Town, has amounted but to about 64/. yearly, and is about 6d. per Chaldron, but, upon the whole Importation, is about a Half-peny per Chaldron.

That the Town of Yarmouth do take of an Unfreeman, for Ballast 8id. per Chaldron, for every Chaldron of Coals that they import, or make out; and if go a fishing, pay for free Ballast only; and that a Freeman pays but 4f d.per Chaldron.

That Yarmouth constantly keeps Two Keels, of about 24 Tons each, and Men employed, to fetch Ballast, at the cheapest Rate they can; and it lies them in about 15 s. for which a Freeman, if he has Occasion for it, must pay 17 s. And that, if an Unfreeman were to find his own Ballast, the Town giving their Soil, yet it would cost him as much, or near as much, getting, as he pays for it; because the Ballast-men being always employed, will work cheaper, than to be at the Uncertainty of Employ by Foreigners.

That Foreigners are not obliged to take their Ballast of the Town, but may get it at other Places; and of Eighteen Foreigners, in 1702, but Six of them took Ballast of the Town: And if Foreigners lay their own Ballast on the Key, and take it again, they pay but for half Ballast; and they may deliver it on the other Side of the River, out of the Town's Jurisdiction; but there they must also pay an Acknowledgment.

That, by the ancient Customs of , they have

a Right to 45. 6d. for every foreign Vessel, that comes into their Harbour for Anchorage, Moorage, Keyage, Beaconage, Pilotage, and Outgoings; of which lSd'. is paid to the Pier-master; and cannot say particularly, how the other 3$. is paid; but the Town is at the Charge of a Light set up at the Head of the Haven; and that the Freemen pay to the Pier-man, but not the other Duties above-mentioned.

That the Town is at the Charge of Metts, or Measures, which costs them about 35 /. a Year; and Strangers have the Use of them for nothing.

That were it not for the Customs, and Duties, aforesaid (though they claim some others) the Corporation could not subsist; and if there should be no Difference

.1704.

between a Free and Unfrceman, nbbody will take out their Freedoms; for it is a great Charge to the Freemen, to bear the Offices of the Town.

That the Revenues and Duties of the Town, arising by their ancient Customs, are so precarious, and so many, that he cannot say what they amount to yearly.

That there are Two Cables to the Capstem, a greater, and a lesser, which were provided at the County Charge; and if the greater be used they pay 125. for it; if the lesser, 105. And a Committee of the Town of Yarmouth is appointed, to esquire, what Damages arise by such Usage, and to assess the same, the Produce whereof is placed to the Credit of the County; and that both Freemen and Unfreemen pay alike for the Use of the Capstem.

To this the Petitioners replied:

And Mr. Ilelwys,of Norwich, said, that, by virtue of the said Charter, Yarmouth has a Key, Thirty or Forty Yards broad in the narrowest Place, and a Mile long, a great Market Place, have built an Hospital on a great Waste before the Church, and a whole Street, near half a Mile long.

That they have an Estate near the Key Mill, and several Gardens out of Town, [and One in Town ]; and also have Rents of the Inhabitants, for Liberty of setting up Pales in the Streets, about Four Foot from the Houses; and that he pays 1 £. a Year, or some such Matter, for Two Houses, be has there, of about Thirty Foot Front, for the like Privilege.

They have also a Common which is called the Daines, above 200 Acres whereof is good Land, and if it were inclosed, would be worth 1 o or 15 an Acre.

And that, about Two Years ago, Alderman Bradford, of Yarmouth, told him, the Bailiffs made 500l. a Year by the Customs arising out of their Fishery.

Mr. JVard, and Mr. Myles said, that, if a Foreigner imports Herrings at Yarmouth, the First Freeman sets the Price, that he will give the Fisherman, and then carries the Price to the Town-house, where the Freemen haine them (that is, set a higher Price on them) if they think fit; which advanced Price the Corporation have the Benefit of, and amounts to a considerable yearly Sum.

Mr. Je.v said, that he has paid the late Chamberlain of Yarmouth a Half-peny, 4 Peny, and Three Halfpence, per Chaldron, for Metage; and produced Bills under iris Hand, to prove it.

That he never, but once, in Fourteen Years, allowed the full Half Chaldron to the Freeman; yet they always claim it as their Right, and take, in lieu thereof, a Bottle of Wine, or some such small Matter: And Mr. Myles said, he allowed it the First time of his trading the re, before he was acquainted, and resolved never to go thither again, unless they would remit it; since which he has never paid the full, but always an Acknowledgment of the Favour, by a Bottle or Two of Wine; and sends to Yarmouth but once a Year, because of their Impositions.

Mr. Jex further said, that they can get Ballast, if they might have it where the Town has, as cheap, as to take it from the Ballast Keels; for that they pay the Ballast-men for throwing it into the Ship, over and above the 8 id.

That a Ship of 90 Tons will require 30 Tons of Ballast, which he could supply for 10 s. if he might get it where the Town does; and if he buys it of the Town, as they reckon by the Chaldron, it w ill come to about 3/. And that at London, and other Ports, they pay for no more Ballast than they have.

That there is no Ballast near the Town, but what is their Soil; so cannot be conveniently supplied elsewhere, but at greater Charges.

That if a Vessel go out a fishing, her Ballast is of another Sort, for which they pay 2 per Ton to the Carters, that bring and lay it upon the Key; for which Liberty. the Town takes half a Crown.

That Two of his Ships ran one against another, and one laden with Coals, ran aground, and he offered the

[ ] These Words are supplied from the origiuul Report.

Coals to any body, that would take them, For Lightage of the Ship; and she coming afterwards to Yarmouth Ilaven, to repair, the Town of Yarmouth demanded 10& for Ground age, as their Manor Right; and he paid it.

That a Master of one of his Vessels took up Nine Barrels of Tar, supposed to be a Wreck; and the Town of Yarmouth sent for them, as their Right of Admiralty, and had them, as his Master told him.

To this Reply, Mr. Alderman Ellis said,

That it is true, the Town of Yarmouth have a Key, the Daines, an Hospital for 50 poor Children, and several Gardens, and old Houses; but all were the Waste of the Borough, and they have no Rents for them; and all the Inhabitants of Yarmouth use the Dames as their Common,

and put in their Cows, to supply the Town with Milk, paying to the Parson only 3d. a Head.

That if the Chamberlain, or Water-bailiff, has taken any thing for Metage, he had no Custom of the Town to warrant it, for it is not in their Book of Rates.

That the Freemen have a Right of haining a Moiety of the Herrings imported, the Corporation claiming a Right to that Moiety, in case they hain them at a higher Price, than the First Buyer bought them at; and then distribute them among the Freemen, to prevent engrossing them, such Over-price being the Bailiffs, towards the Support of the Corporation; and if they are not hained higher than the First Price, the First Buyer has all the Herrings himself.

Mr. Alderman Ferrier said, that Seven or Eight Years ago he was Bailiff of Yarmouth; and the Execution of that Office was always looked upon as burthensome, and expensive; and he found it so, though he was as good a Husband as he could, and had the Half of 91 /. allowed him by the Corporation, towards his Charges; and several have been ruined, and impaired their Families, thereby.

That what arises by the Customs, Duties, and Revenues, of the Borough, are all applied to support the Community of the Town, and not to the Maintenance of the Poor.

That, upon the Petition of the County of Norfolk, also referred to the said Committee,

Mr. Jex and Mr. JVardacquainted the Committee, that they had no more to say for the County, than what they had said for the City of Norz; but that the Duties taken of Foreigners at Yarmouth discourage them from importing Coals there, whereby the Country, and Places supplied from thence, must needs suffer in the Price of their Coals; and believe, that the Freemen of Yarmouth may yearly import a sufficient Quantity to serve the Country; yet, if Strangers might have a free Importation, it would lower the Price of Coals, and People would spend more of them.

To this Alderman Ferrier said, that, if Foreigners might import Coals Duty-free, yet they could not do it so cheap, as the Yarmouth Men; for that their Haven being very dangerous, a Foreigner lies sometimes Three Weeks, to get in, because they do not care to Be at the Charge, and have not the Conveniency, of lightening their Vessels, as the Yarmouth Men have.

That Yarmouth has always more Coals by them, than the Country consumes; and therefore believes, if more were imported, the Price would not be lessened.

That the Yarmouth Freemen sell 36 Bushels to the Chaldron to the Keelmen, out of which they make 40 Bushels, and take a Peny per Chaldron for Stayage at

Norwich, and 2 d. at all the Country Stays besides, as the Keelmen have told him; and this raises the Price of Coals to the Country.

And that, upon the whole Matter of the Petitions of the Cjty of Norwich, and County of , the Com-

mittee came to the following Resolution; viz.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Custom and usage of the Corporation of Yarmouth, that no Un-freeman of that Corporation can sell any Coals -to any Person, who is not free of the same, Vo h. 14.

513

is a Monopoly, and a very great Grievance and Oppression to the Inhabitants of the City of Norwich, a great Part of the County of Norfolk, and County of Suffolk, who cannot so conveniently be supplied with Coals but by the Port of Yarmouth;

The First Resolution being read a Second time; several Amendments were severally proposed to be made therein; viz.

Before “ Freemen” to leave out “ the,” and insert “ several” instead thereof; and after “ Not folk”, to insert “ dealing in Coals;” and at the End of the Resolution to add, “ or any Act of the Corporation, preteudidg to “ authorize the same.”

And the same were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House.

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee, in the said Resolution, so amended, That several Freemen of the Town of Lyn, in the County of Norfolk, dealing in Coals, have, for many Years last past, by a Combination among themselves, exacted Eight-pence per Chaldon for all Coals, sold in the Port of Lynn by Persons not being free of the said Town (more than has been anciently paid) without any Colour of Law for it, or any Act of the Corporation, pretending to authorize the same.

The Second Resolution being read a Second time;

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee, in the said Resolution, That the Corporation of Lynn, in 1688, and 1689, made Two several By-laws, whereby they obliged all Persons, trading in Coals to the Port of Lynn, not to deliver their Coals in gross, till they have lain Three working Days in the said Port, from the Mooring of the Ship. ' '

The Third Resolution being read a Second time; an Amendment was proposed to be made therein, by leaving out “ a Monopoly, and.”

And the Question being put, That “ a Monopoly, and,” stand Part of the said Resolution;

It was resolved in the Affirmative.

Then a Motion being made, and the Question being put, That the House do agree with the Committee,' in the said Resolution, That there is an ancient Custom in the Town of Lynn, called Foreign-bought, and Foreign-sold, which is a Monopoly, and a very great Grievance iand Oppression to the Inhabitants of the Counties of Huntington and Bedford;

The House divided;

“ as a Man of Honour, Conduct, and Loyalty; all

“ which I cannot, without Injustice to hiui, omit to cer-

That it likewise appeared to the Committee, that the Petitioner, Colonel Rice, perceiving his Captains very diffident of being performed with, and well treated in the English Service, and that great Endeavours were used by General Sarsfeild, otherwise called Earl of Lucan, to carry them into the Enemy's Service; for Prevention whereof, the said Colonel was necessitated, on

bringing in his said Regiment into their said late Majesties Service, to agree with them, and oblige himself in a Bond of Ten thousand Pounds Sterling to the said Captains, to pay them, and their several subaltern Commission and Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, their full Vol. 14.

Pay, according to the English Establishment, and also pay them the Value of their several Troops, Horses, Arms, and Accoutrements, if taken from them, and also save them harmless from any Losses that might happen to them, for or by reason of their staying with him, and entering into their Majesties Service, as aforesaid, or for the Non-performance of the said publick Faith given them. In pursuance of which Agreement, and in Discharge of the said Bond, the said Colonel Rice did actually pay them their full Pay, according to the English Establishment; and did also pay them for their several Troops, Horses, Arms, and Accoutrements, the Horses, Arms and Accoutrements of each of the said Captain's Troops, being valued at 900l. the Troop; which the said Colonel Rice, upon a Reference between him and the said Captains, and by the Mediation of some Friends, did agree and compound with the said Captains for half the Value aforesaid, being 450/. a Troop, paid to each of the Five Captains of the said Regiment, the Colonel's own Troop being valued by the said Brigadier Villiers at 1,060/. Sterling; as appeared to the Committee, as well by the foregoing Certificate of the said Brigadier's, and by the said Bona, cancelled, as also by an instrument in Writing, under the Handa and Seals of the said Captains, owning the Receipt of their Pay, and Value of their Horses, and impowering the said Colonel Rice to put in for, recover, and receive, the same, to Isis own Use; which said cancelled Bond, and Instrument in Writing, together with the Matters of Fact aforesaid, were attested by Mr. Mully, heretofore Agent to the said Regiment, and One of the Arbitrators, or Referrees, between the said Colonel Rice and his said Captains, and well acquainted with their Handwriting, and the Proceedings aforesaid.

That it likewise appeared to the Committee, that the Petitioner, Colonel Rice, did apply himself to the late Commissioners, appointed by Act of Parliament to examine, balance, and determine, the Debts, due to the Army, Navy, <§r. to have his Accounts stated; which they refused to do, conceiving, they, had not Power by the said Act so to do, alleging, the Petitioner's Regiment was not upon the Establishment, although he produced to them Sir Edward Northey, her Majesty's Attorney-general, his Opinion in Writing, under his Hand, on the State of his Case, with this Qucere at the Foot of it;

“ Quare, Whether the Arrears of Pay, due to the “ said Colonel Rice, for serving with his Regiment in his Majesty's Army, and stated and allowed by the Commissioners of Accounts in Ireland, pursuant to the “ Order of the Lords Justices of that Kingdom, be such “ Debts due to the Army, as the Commissioners, appointed by the said Act, can take, state, balance, “ examine, and determiner”

Whereupon the said Sir Edward Northey delivered his Opinion in these Words following, viz.

“ I cannot see how this comes to be a Question: For “ the Intent of the Act seems to be plain, to have the “ Accounts of all the Officers of his Majesty's Army, “ or Land Forces, wheresoever they were, to be stated, “ balanced, and determined; and the Commissioners are “ constituted, by express Words, to state the Accounts “ of them, whether in England, Ireland, or elsewhere, “ at any time after his Majesty's Accession to the Throne, “ before the 24th of December, 1699; and, on perusing “ the Act, I cannot find, that general Power is restrained: Therefore, if Colonel Rice was received into “ his Majesty's Service, and continued so, as stated in the Case, and appears by the Papers annexed, his “ Accounts must be stated by the Commissioners, by “ virtue of the said late Act.

“ 21 June, 1700. “ Northey.”

Which said Application, and Matters of Fact, were testified to the Committee by Geo. Langlon, Esquire, One of the Commissioners of Accounts aforesaid; who confessed, they had no other Objection to make to the said Colonel liices Accounts, laid before them, but that they were of Judgment, his Regiment was not upon the

Establishment, and therefore could not certify concerning the m; being the final Resolution of the said Commis-» sinners, delivered to the said Colonel after the End of the last Sessions of Parliament.

That it appeared to the Committee, upon perusing the late Act of Parliament, impowering the said Commissioners to take, state, balance, and determine, the Debts, due to the Army, &c. as well by the foregoing Opinion of the said Sir Edward upon the same,

as also for that the said Regiment, as afore set forth, was invited and received into the Service of England, upon the same foot with the English Regiments, and there being mustered, and Advance-money paid, and Winter Quarters assigned them, as to other Regiments of the English Army, that they were upon the English Establishment, as well as any other Regiments: And the Matters of Fact aforesaid appeared the more plain to the Committee, in regard it w as affirmed by the said Sir . Robinson, that if the said Regiment had not been in Pay, and on the Establishment, the Government could not have taken away their Horses, and Accoutrements, which they might have sold, and converted to their own Use, as well as others of the Irish Army did, that stayed at Home, and did not enter into the Service.

That it also appeared to the Committee, by the Testimony of the said Sir William Robinson, that it was looked upon as an extraordinary Piece of Service to their Majesties, and the Publick, the Petitioner's bringing in

his Regiment into their Majesties Service, and preventing their and other Regiments going into the Enemy's Service; and the Petitioner, Colonel Rice, affirms, that Lieutenant-general Lumleywas One of the Persons, employed to give the publick Faith, and Encouragement aforesaid, to such Troops of the Army, as would reject going into France, and take Service under their late Majesties, upon the Surrender of Limerick, as aforesaid.

That it likewise appeared to the Committee, that the said Colonel Rice's paying his said Captains their full

Pay', and the Value of their Horses, Arms, and Accoutrements, as aforesaid, has plunged him in several great Debts, for which he pays 10/. perCent. Interest, and reduced him, and his Family, to a necessitous Condition.

And the Managers went to the Conference:

And being returned;

' The Lord Marquis of Hartington reported, that the Managers had attended the Conference: and that it was managed by the Earl of Sunderland, who expressed himself as followeth; viz.

That the Lords have desired this Conference with the House Of Commons, in order to a good Correspondence between the Two Houses, which they will always endeavour to preserve. When either House of Parliament have apprehended the Proceedings of the other to be liable to Exception, the ancient Parliamentary Method has befen, to ask a Conference; it being ever supposed, that, when ihe Matters are fairly laid open, and debated, that, which tnay have been amiss, will be rectified, or else the House, that made the Objections, will be satisfied, that their Complaint was not well-grounded.

Such Hopes as these have induced the Lords to command us to acquaint you, that, upon Consideration of the Petition of Daniel Horne, Henry Basse, and John Paton, junior, and also the Petition of John Paty and Oviat, complaining to the House of Lords, that they have been Prisoners in Newgate for about Twelve Weeks, upon several Warrants, signed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, bearing Date the 5th of December last, for their having commenced, and prosecuted, Actions at Common Law against the late Constables of Aylesbury, for not allowing their Votes at an Election of Members, to serve in Parliament; which Actions, they alleged, they were encouraged to bring, by reason of a Judgment given in Parliament upon a Writ of Error, brought in the last Session by one Ashby against White, and others; and also representing, by the same Petitions, what had been done by them respectively, since their said Commitment, in order to obtain their Liberty; and praying the Consideration of the House of Peers upon the whole Matter; and also upon Consideration of a printed Paper, intituled, “ The Votes of the House “ of Commons,” signed with the Speakers Name, and dated the 24th of this Instant February; the House of Lords found themselves obliged to come to several Resolutions, which they have commanded us to communicate to you at this Conference, and are as follow; wx.

1st. It is Resolved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled, That neither House of Parliament hath any Power, by any Vote, or Declaration, to create to themselves any new Privilege, that is not warranted by the koown Laws dnd Customs of Parliament.

2. Resolved, That every Freeman of England, who apprehends himself to be injured, has a Right to seek Redness by Action at Law; and that the commencing and prosecuting an Action at Common Law against any Person, not entitled to Privilege of Parliament, is no Breach of the Privilege of Parliament.

3. Resolved, That the House of Commons, in committing to Newgate, Daniel Horne, Henry Basse, and John Paton, junior, John Paty, and John Oviat, for commencing and prosecuting an Action at Common Law against the late Constables of Aylesbury, for not allowing their Votes in Election of Members to serve ia Parliament, upon

: VO U U.

Pretence that their so doing was contrary to a Declaration, a Contempt of the Jurisdiction, and a Breach of the Privilege, of that House, have assumed to themselves alone a legislative Authority, by pretending to attribute the Force of a Law to their Declaration, have claimed a Jurisdiction, not warranted by the Constitution, and have assumed a new Privilege, to which they can shew no Title by the Law and Custom of Parliament, and have thereby, us farl s in them lies, subjected the Rights of Englishmen, and the Freedom of their Persons, to the arbitrary Votes oT the House of Commons.

4. Resolved, That every Englishmen, who is imprisoned by any Authority whatsoever, has an undoubted Right by his Agents, or Friends, to apply for, and obtain a Writ of Habeas Corpus, in order to procure his Liberty by dae Course of Law.

5. Resolved, That for the House of Commons to censure, or punish, any Person, for assisting a Prisoner to procure a Writ of Habeas Corpus, or by Vote, or otherwise, to deter Men from soliciting, prosecuting, and pleading upon, such Writ of Habeas Corpus, in behalf of such Prisoner, is an Attempt of dangerous Consequence, a Breach of the many good Statutes, provided for the Liberty of the Subject, and of pernicious Example, by denying the necessary Assistance to the Prisoner, upon a Commitment of the House of Commons, which has ever been allowed upon all Commitments by any Authority whatsoever.

6. Resolved, That a Writ of Error is not a Writ of Grace, but of Right, and ought not to be denied to the Subject, when duly applied for, though at the Request of either House of Parliament; the Denial thereof being an Obstruction of Justice, contrary to Magna Charta.

In these Resolutions the House of Lords have expressed that Regard and Tenderness, which they have always bad, and will ever maintain, for the Rights of the People of England, and for the Liberties of their Persons; and also their Zeal against all Innovations, to the Prejudice of the known Course of Law, whereupon the Happiness of our Constitution does depend; and they hope, that, upon Recollection, the House of Commons will be of the same Opinion in all the Particulars resolved by the Lords, and agree with their Lordships therein.

Ordej'cd, That the said Report be taken into Consideration Tomorrow Morning.

Tl»e Serjeant also acquainted the House, that he heard, there was another Habeas Corpus grauted for Mr. Denton, in his Custody also.

While the Matter (upon Occasion of the §rst mentioned Whit) was debating, the Serjeant acquainted the Ho ue, that the other Writ of Habeas Corpus was just served upon hi Deputy, who had Mr. Denlon in his Custody: And he ulso delivered the same in at the Clerks Table; where it was read; and was the same, mutatis mutandis, w ith the former.

And the Precedents, of what was done in the Year 1675, were, by Order, read.

And several Members mentioned, upon their Memory, what was done in the Year 1680, in the Case of one Mr.

Sheridan.

But the House were of Opinion, that any Person, committed by the House of Commons, w ere not bailable within the Act of Habeas of 31 Car. ;but

came not then to any Resolution.

Mr. Bromley reported from the Committee, appointed to draw up what is proper to be offered to the Lords at the next Conference, that they had drawn up the same accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House: Which lie read in lib Place, and afterwards

Vox.. 14.

delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was twice read; and, with some Amendments, agreed unto by the House, and is, as foHoweth:

The Commons have desired this Confererice with your Lordships, in order to preserve that good Correspondence between the Two Houses, which the Commons shall always sincerely endeavour to maintain; and which is so particularly necessary at this Time of common Danger, that the Commons would not engage in any thing, that looks like a Dispute with your Lordships, were it not for the Necessity of vindicating, from a manifest Invasion, the Privileges of all the Commons of England (with which the House of Commons is intrusted) even those Privileges, which are essential, not only to the well-being, but to the very being, of an House of Commons, and the preventing the ill Consequences of those Misunderstandings, which, if they are not speedily removed, must otherwise interrupt the happy Conclusion of this Session, and the Proceedings of all future Parliaments.

It was this Consideration alone has so long prevailed with the House of Commons, not to insist on due Reparation for those violent and unparliamentary Attempts, made by your Lordships upon their Rights arid Privileges at the End of die last Session of Parliament, but to apply themselves to the giving the speediest Dispatch to those Supplies, which her Majesty so earnestly recommended from the Throne; which are so necessary to enable her Majesty to pursue the Advantages, that have been obtained against the common Enemy by the great and glorious Successes of her Majesty's Arms; and which are now delayed in your Lordships House in so unusual a manner.

The Commons do agree to your Lordships, that, when either House of Parliament have apprehended the Proceedings of the other to be liable to Exceptions, the ancient parliamentary Method has often been tt> ask a Conference; because it ought to be supposed, that, when the Matters are fairly laid open, and debated, that, which may have been amiss, will be rectified, or else the House, that made the Objections, will be satisfied, that their Complaint was not well grounded; But your Lordships seem so little to desire to have Matters fairly laid open, and debated, that to the great Surprize of the Commons, when your Lordships had invited them to a Conference about some ancient fundamental Liberties of the Kingdom, they found only the ancient and fuudamental Rights of the House of Commons, and their Proceedings, censured, and treated in a Manner unknown to former Parliaments; and that your Lordships had anticipated all Debates, by delivering positive Resolutions; and these Proceedings of your lordships grounded only upon the Petitions of Criminals, that had fallen under the just Censure and Displeasure of the Commons, and upon a printed Paper, which was not regularly before your Lordships.

Though this Manner of proceeding, as well as the Matter of your Lordships Resolutions, might have justified the House of Commons in refusing to continue Conferences with your Lordships, as their Predecessors have done upon less Occasions; and though the Commons cannot submit their Privileges to be determined, or examined, by your Lordships, upon any Pretence whatsoever; yet, that nothing may be wanting, on their Part, to induce your Lordships to retract these Resolutions, they proceed to take them into their Consideration.

Your Lordships first Resolution is, vis. “ That neither “ House of Parliament hath any Power, by any Y'ote, “ or Declaration, to create to themselves any new Privilege, that is not warranted by the known Laws and “ Customs of Parliament.”

As the Commons have guided themselves by this Rule, in asserting their Privileges, so they wish, your Lordships had observed it in all your Proceedings. 'I his had mtirely taken away all Colour for Disputes between her Majesty's Two Houses of Parliament, and many just Occasions of Complaint from those the Commons represent: This would effectually put an End to that Encroachment in Judicature, so lately assumed by your Lordships, and so often complained of by the Commons we mean, the

hearing

O

A rawer to Lords respecting Writs ot Error in Aylesbury Case.

560 6° Maftii. 1704.

hearing of Appeals from Courts of Equity, in your Lordships House; This would have hindered the bringing of original Causes before your Lordships, and your unwarrantable Proceedings upon the Petition of Thomas Lord ,

complaining of an Order of the Court of Exchequer, bearing Date the 15th of July, 1701, for filing the Record of a Survey of the Honour of , and Lordship of

Middleham, in the County of York; an Attempt, which, contrary to the -ancient legal Judicature of Parliament, heretofore exercised for the Relief of the Subject, oppressed by the Power of the great Men of the Realm, was in Favour of One of your own Body, to suppress a publick Record, which all her Majesty sjSubjects had an undoubted Right to make use of; an Attempt, that tends to render all Fines and Recoveries, and other Records (upon which Estates and Titles depend) precarious, and consequently subjects the Rights and Properties of all the Commons of England to an illegal and arbitrary Power.

A due Regard to the same Rule would have prevented your Lordships entertaining the Petitions, mentioned at the last Conference; which set forth, that the Lords having given Judgment, in the Case of Ashby and White, viz. “ That, by the known Laws of this Kingdom, every Free- holder, or other Person, having a Right to give his Vote “ at the Election of Members to serve in Parliament, and “ being wilfully denied, or hindered, so to do, by the “ Officer, who ought to receive the same, may maintain “ an Action in the Queen's Courts against such Officer, to “ assert his Right, and recover Damages for the Injury;” the Petitioners thereupon brought the like Actions in their own Cases: Whereby an'extrajudicial Vote of your Lordships is stated as a Judgment of Parliament, and standing Law in that Case; your Lordships having no Foundation for the entertaining such Petitions, unless that, after having assumed to yourselves the hearing of Appeals from Courts of Equity, you would now bring Appeals to your Lordships from the Proceedings of the Commons, who are not accountable to your Lordships for them.

Your Lordships SeccAid Resolution is, “ That every “ Freeman of England, who apprehends himself to be injured, has a Right to seek Redress by Action at Law; “ and that the commencing and prosecuting an Action “ at Common Law against any Person, not intitled to “ Privilege of Parliament, is no Breach of the Privilege “ of Parliament.”

To which the Commons say, that every Freeman, and every Subject of England', has a Right to seek Redress for any Injury; but then such Person must apply for that Redress to the proper Court, which hath, by ancient Laws, and Usage, the Cognizance of such Matters: For should your Lordships Resolution be taken as an universal Proposition, all Distinction of the several Courts, viz. Commou Law, Equity, Ecclesiastical, Admiralty, and other Courts, will be destroyed; and in this Confusion of Jurisdiction the high Court of Parliament is involved in your Lordships Resolution.

However, the Commons conceive it no Wonder, your Lordships should favour the universal Propositions, that all Rights, whatsoever, are to be redressed by Actions at Law, when your Lordships pretend to have the last Resort in Cases of Judicature, by Writs of Error; so that your Lordships are, in this, only extending your own Judicature, under the Colour of a Regard and Tenderness for the Rights of the People, and Liberties of their Persons.

The C mmons are surprized, to find your Lordships assert, that the commencing and prosecuting an Action against a Person, not intitled to Privilege of Parliament, is no Breach of the Privilege of Parliament; since it is most certain, that to commence and prosecute an Action, which would bring any Matter, or Cause, solely cognizable in Parliament, to the Examination and Determination of any other Court, is more destructive to the Privileges of Parliament, than to commence and prosecute an Action against a Person only, w ho is intitled to such Privilege.

That some Matters, and Causes, are solely cognizable in Parliament, hath ever been allowed by the sage Judges of the Law, and is evident from many Precedents; and to

bring such Causes to the Determination of other Courts strikes at the very Foundation of all Parliamentary Jurisdiction, which is the only Basis, and Support, even of that personal Privilege, to which the Members of either House of Parliament are intitled; and consequently, to commence and prosecute any Action, whereby to draw such Causes to the Examination of other Courts, is equally a Breach of the Privilege of Parliament, whether the Defendant, against whom such Action is brought, is intitled to the Privilege of Parliament, or not; which, besides the Nature and Reason of the Thing, is fully evident from the constant Usage of each House of Parliament, in committing for Contempts only against their respective Bodies, as appears from many Precedents upon the Journals of both Houses.

Your Lordships Third Resolution is thus, viz. “ That “ the House of Commons, in committing to Newgate “ Daniel Horne, Henry Basse, and Pal on, junior, “ John Paty, and JohnOviat, for commencing and “ prosecuting an Action at Common Law against the “ Constables of Ailesbury, for not allowing their Votes “ in Election of Members to serve in Parliament, upon “ Pretence, that their so doing was contrary to a Declaration, a Contempt of the Jurisdiction, and a Breach of “ the Privilege, of that House, have assumed to themselves alone a legislative Authority, by pretending to “ attribute the Force of a Law to their Declaration, have “ claimed a Jurisdiction, not warranted by the Constitution, and have assumed a new Privilege, to which “ they can shew no Title by the Laws and Customs of “ Parliament, and have thereby, as far as in them lies, “ subjected the Rights of Englishmen, and the Freedom “ of their Persons, to the arbitrary Votes of the House “ of Commons.”

In Answer to which the Commons affirm, that the said Commitment is justified by ancient Precedents, and by the Usage and Customs of Parliament, which is the Law of Parliament, and the Rule, by which either House ought to govern their Proceedings; and that the Terms, of assuming to themselves alone a legislative Authority, of attributing the Force of a Law to their Declaration, of claiming a Jurisdiction, not warranted by the Constitution, of assuming a new Privilege, to which they can shew no Title by the Law and Custom of Parliament, and of arbitrary Votes, are more applicable to this Resolution of your Lordships, which hath no One Precedent to justify it.

According to the known Laws and Usage of Parliament, it is the sole Right of the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled (except in Cases, otherwise provided for by Act of Parliament) to examine and determine all Matters, relating to the Right of Election of their own Members.

And, according to the known Laws and Usage of Parliament; neither the Qualification of any Elector, nor the Right of any Person elected, is cognizable or determinable otherwise, than before the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled, excepting such Cases, as are specially provided for by Act of Parliament:

And, were it otherwise, the Mayors, Bailiffs, and other Officers, who are obliged to take the Poll at Elections, and make a Return thereupon, would be exposed to Multiplicity of Actions, vexatious Suits, and insupportable Expences; and such Officers would be subjected to different and independent Jurisdictions, and inconsistent Determinations, in the same Case, without Relief.

And the Exercise of this Power by the House of Commons is warranted by a long uncontested Possession, and confirmed by the Act, that passed 70 et 8 3. Cap. 7.

And the House of Commons must be owned to be the only Jurisdiction, that can allow7 the Elector his Vote, and settle and establish the Right of it; the last Determination in that House being, by that Act of Parliament, declared to be the standing Rule for the Right of Election in each respective Place.

Nor can any Elector suffer cither Injury, or Damage, by the Officer's denying his Vote; for, when the Elector

hath

3- Ann. 6s MartiL 561

hath named the Person, he would have _ represent him, his Vote is effectually given, both as to his own Right and Privilege, and as it avails the Candidate in his Elec tion, and is ever allowed, when it comes in question in the House of Comtnous, whether the Officer had any Regard to it, or no.

' In the Beginning of the Parliament, held 28 Eliz. Mi . Speaker acquaints the House, that he had received, by the Lead Chancellor, her Majesty's Pleasure, that she was Sorry, the House was troubled with the Matter of detei -mining the chusing and returning of Knights for the County of Norfolke: That it was improper for the House

to meddle in it, which was proper for the Lord Chancellor, whence the Writs issued out, and whither they were returnable: That her Majesty had appointed the Lord Chancellor to confer therein with the Judges, and, upon examining the same, to set down such Course, as to Justice and Right should appertain.

November 9th, a Committee was appointed, to examine, and state, the Circumstances of the Return of the Knights for the County of

And on Friday, November 11 th, Mr. Cromwell reports the Case of the Norfolke Election, very largely; in which Report are these following Resolutions:

1. That the said Writ was duly executed.

" 2. That it was a pernicious Precedent, that anew Writ should issue, without the Order of this House.

' 3. That the discussing or judging of this, and suchlike Differences, only belonged to the said House.

4. That, though the Lord Chancellor, and Judges, are Competent Judges in their Courts, they are not so in Parliament

‘ 5. That, it should be entered in the Journal Bode of the House, that the first Election is good, and that the Knights, then chosen, were received and allowed as Members of the House, not out of any Respect the House had or gave to the Lord Chancellors Judgment therein passed, but merely by reason of the Resolution of the House itself by which the said Election had been approved.

6. That there should be no Message sent to the Lord Chancellor, not so much as to let him know what was done therein; because it was derogatory to the Power and Privilege of the said House.

It also appears, that Sir Edmund Anderson, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was acquainted, that the Explanation, and ordering, of the Cause appertained only to the Censure of the House of Commons, not to the Lord Chancellor, and the Judges; and that they should take no Notice of their having done any thing in it.

: Accordingly Mr. Farmer and Mr. Gresham were received into the House, and took the Oaths, being admitted only upon the Censure of the House, not as allowed by the Lord Chancellor, or the Judges; and so ordered to be set do« n and entered by the Clerk.

And this Right of jthe Commons, to determine their Own Elections, has never been disputed since the Case of Sir Francis Goodwyn, the 1st I. when the Lords would have enquired into the Proceedings of the House Of Commons upon his Election; but the Commons then told their Lordships, it did not stand with the Honour of the House to give Account to their Lordships of any their Proceedings, or Doings.

And in the Reasons of their Proceedings in that Case, which they laid, by Petition, before the King, among other Things, they say, They are a Part of the Body, to make new Laws; yet, for any Matter of Privileges of their House, they are, and ever have been, a Court of themselves, of sufficient Pow er to discern, and determine, without the Lords, as the Lords have always used to do theirs, without them.

In which Reasons, as well as in their Apoloey afterwards to that Prince, the House of Commons did, above tm hundred Years since, so clearly, and with so much Strength of Reason, assert their Right in the Matter of the Election of their Members. The Commons think it their Duty to resist all Attempts, whatsoever, to invadd them.

s' Vol. Hi

And, upon this Occasion, it may not be improper to cite the Opinion the House of Commons had of the Judges intennedling in Matters of their Elections, as they have delivered it in the aforesaid Apology, in these Words; vii,

“ Neither thought wef that the Judges Opinion (which “ yet in due Place we greatly reverence, being delivered “ with the Common Law, which extends only to inferior “ and standing Courts) ought to bring any Prejudice to “ this high Court of Parliament} whose Power, being “ above the Law, is not founded on the Common Laws “ but they have their Rights and Privileges peculiar to “ themselves.”

When the Earl of Shaftsbury was Lord Chancellor, Writs issued, during a Prorogation of Parliament, for electing Members, in tire Room of those, that were dead. The King himself was so cautious, as to the Regularity of this Proceeding, and had so-much Regard to the Privileges of the House of-Commons, that at the next Session of Parliament, 5° Februarii, 1672, he spoke to the Commons from the Throne, in these Words:

“ One Thing I forgot to mention, which happened If. during this Prorogation; I did give Orders for the issuiag some Writs, for the Election of Members instead “ of those, that are dead, that the House might be full at “ their Meeting; and I am mistaken, if this be not according to former Precedents: But I desire you will “ not fall to other Business till you have examined that “ Particular ;-and I doubt not, but Precedents will justify “ what is done. I am as careful of all your Privileges, “ as of my own Prerogative.”

6 February, 1672, the House of Commons took thas Matter into Consideration: And several Precedents being cited, and the Matter at large debated; and the general Sense and Opinion of the House being, that, during the Continuance of the high Court of Parliament, the Right and Power of issuing Writs, for electing Members to serve in this House, in such Places, as are vacant, is in this House, who are the proper Judges also of Elections and Returns of their Members;

Thereupon it was resolved, That all Elections, upon the Writs issued since the last Session, are void; and that Mr. Speaker do issue out his Warrant to the Clerk of the CrOwn, to make.out uew Writs lor those Places: Which was done accordingly.

No other Court, than the House of Commons, hath ever had the Determination of the Elections, or any Cognizance of such Causes, except whereby Acts of Parliament directed; and such an Action, as those against the late Constables of Aylsbury, to bring the Right of voting ini an Election in question in the Courts of Law, is a new Invention, never heard of before; which (as new Devices in the Law are generally attended with Inconveniencies and Absurdities) was plainly to subject the Elections of all the Members of the House of Commons to the Determination of other Courts.

This undoubted Privilege and Jurisdiction, the Commons think, will warrant these Commitments, if the late Declaration (which is agreeable,to, and cannot lessen, their ancient Right) had never been made.

For it is the ancient and undoubted Right of the House of Commons, to-commit for Breach of Privilege; and the Instances of their committing Persons, not Members of the House, for Breach of Privilege, and that to any her Majesty's Prisons, are ancient, so mauv, and so well known to your Lordships, that the Commons think it needless to produce them.

- And it being the Privilege of the House of Commons to have the sole Examination , and Determination of all Causes relating to their Elections, as aforesaid; it follows, that any Attempt, to draw such Causes to the Determination of any other Court, is a Breach of the Privilege of the House of Commons, for which the Person offending may be committed by the Commons.

And here we cannot but take notice of that unreasonable, as well as unnatural, Insinuation,whereby your Lord-shipr endeavour to separate the Interest of the People from

their Representatives in Parliament; who pretend to no Privileges, but upon their Account, and for their Benefit; and are sorry to say, they ave thus severely reflected on by your Lordships, for no other Reason, but for their interposing, to preserve the Rights of the People, and their Liberties, from your Lordships arbitrary Determinations.

Your Lordships Fourth Resolution is,

“ That every Englishmen, who is imprisoned by any u Authority whatsoever, has an undoubted Right by his “ Agents, or Friends, to apply for, and obtain, a Writ of “ Habeas Corpus, in order to procure his Liberty by due “ Course of Law.”

The Commons do not deny, that every ,

who is imprisoned by any Authority whatsoever, has an undoubted Right to aipply, by his Agents, or Friends, in order to procure his Liberty by due Course of Law; provided, such Application be made to the proper Place, and in a proper Manner: As, upon the Commitments of the House of Commons (which sometimes are not, as other Commitments, in order to bring to Tryal, but are, in Cases of Breach of Privilege, arid Contempt, the proper Punishment of the House of Commons) the Application Ought to be to that House.

The Commons are so willing to allow, and encourage, every Englishmen to apply, by his Friends, or Agents, to obtain a Writ of Habeas Corpus, in order to procure his Liberty by due Course of Law, that they have not censured any Person, merely for applying for such Writ of Habeas Corpus, even in Cases, where by due Process of Law the Prisoners cannot be discharged: For the Commons must observe, that ill many Cases a Prisoner cannot, upon a Writ of Habeas Corpus, obtain his Liberty; as in Cases of Commitment in Execution, or for Contempt to any Court of Record, or by virtue of mesne Process, or the like; and in the Act of Habeas Corpus several Cases are expressly excepted: And that no Person, committed for any Contempt, of Breach of the Privilege, by the House of Commons, can be discharged upon a Writ of Habeas Corpus, or by any other Authority, than

that of the House, during that Session of Parliament, is plain from the following Precedents:

23 Mail, i Jac. I.

“ Jones,the Prisoner, to be sent for hither, and to

M attend his Discharge from the House.- —

“ That the Prisoners, committed by ns, cannot be w taken from us, and committed by any other.”

In May, 1675, the House of Commons having resolved, That there lay no Appeal to the Judicature of the Lords from Courts of Equity; and that no Member of the House should prosecute any Appeal from any Court of Equity, before the House of LordB; Serjeant Pemberton, Serjeant Peck, Sir J Churchill, and Charles

Pm'ter, Esquire, were committed to the Custody of the Serjeant of the House, for Breach of Privilege, in having been of Counsel at the Bar of the House of Lord?, in the Prosecution of a Cause depending upon an Appeal, therein Mr. Dalmahoy, a Member of the House of Commons, was concerned.

But the Serjeant having been by Force, prevented keeping them in Custody, the Commons did, 4th June,

167.5, acquaint the Lords at a Conference, as followed); v is.

“ We are further commanded to acquaint you, that u the Enlargement of the Persons, imprisoned by Order “ of the House of Commons, by the Gentleman-usher of the Black Rod, and the Prohibition, with Threats,

“ to all Officers, and other Persons whatsoever, not to u receive, or detain, them, is an apparent Breach of the 4 Rights and Privileges of the House of Commons;

“ and they have therefore caused them to be retaken into the Custody of the Serjeant at Arms, and have com mitted them to the Tower."

The said Counsel were afterwards committed to the Tower, for a Breach of Privilege, and Contempt of the Authority of the House: And the House being informed, -that the Lords had qrdered Writs of Habeas Corpus, for

bringing the Counsel to the Bar of their House; the Commons then passed the following Resolutions:

7 June, >675.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradice That no Person,

“ committed for Breach of Privilege, by Order of this “ House, ought to be discharged, during the Session “ of Parliament, but by Order, or Warrant, of this “ House.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That the Lieute

“ nant of the Tower,in receiving, and detaining in “ Custody, Sir John Churchill, Serjeant Peck, Serjeant “ Pemberton, and Mr. Porter, performed his Duty)

“ according to Law; and for so doing he shall have the “ Assistance, and Protection, of this House.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That the Lieute

“ nant of the Tower, in case he hath received, or shall “ receive, any Writ, Warrant, Order, or Commandment,

“ to remove, or deliver, any Person or Persons, com

“ mitted for Breach of Privilege, by any Order, or Warrant, of this House, shall not make any Return thereof “ or yield any Obedience thereunto, before he hath first “ acquainted this House, and received their Order, and “ Directions, how to proceed therein.

“ Ordered, That these Resolutions be immediately “ sent to the Lieutenant of the

Afterwards the Lieutenant of the Tower gave the House an Account, that he hath refused to deliver the Counsel, upon the Lords Order, signified to him by the Black Rod, because they were committed by this House; and that, after he had received the Votes of this House, he had Writs of Habeas Corpus 'brought liim, to bring the Counsel to the House of Lords, at Ten a Clock the next Morning; and humbly craved the Direction of the House, what to do.

Mr. Speaker intimated to him, he should forbear to return the Writs.

And the House came to several other Resolutions:

9th June, 1675.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradicente. That no Commoner of England, committed by Order or Warrant “ of the House of Commons, for Breach of Privilege, or “ Contempt of that House, ought, without Order of that “ House, to be, by any Writ of Habeas Corpus, or other “ Authority, whatsoever, made to appear, and answer,

“ and do, and receive a Determination, in the House of “ Peers, during the Session of Parliament, wherein such “ Person was committed.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That the Order of “ the House of Peers, for the issuing out of Writs of “ Habeas Corpus, concerning Serjeant Peck, Sir John “ Churchill, Serjeant Pemberton, and Mr. Charles Porter, is insufficient, and illegal; for that it is general, and “ expresses no particular Cause of Privilege; and point “ mands the King's Great Seal to be put to Writs, not “ returnable before tire said House of Peers.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That the Lord “ Keeper be acquainted with these Resolutions, to the “ end that the said Writ of Habeas Corpus may be “ superseded, as contrary to Law, and the Privileges of “ this House.

“ Resolved, Nemine contradicente, That a Message be “ sent to the Lords, to acquaint them, that Serjeant Peck,

“ Sir John Churchill, Serjeant Pemberton, and Mr.

“ Chat'les Porter, were committed by Order and Warrant of this House, for Breach of the Privilege, and “ Contempt of the Authority, of this House.”

22d March, 1697.

“ Charles Duncombe, Esquire, having been committed u by Order of this House, and afterwards discharged by “ Order of the House of Lords, w ithout the Consent of “ this House;

Resolved, That no Person, committed by this Houses “ can, during the same Session, be discharged by any “ other Authority whatsoever.

“ Resolved, That the said Charles Duncombe be taken “ into the Custody of the Serjeant at Aims attending this “ House.”

behalf of such Prisoner, is an Attempt of dangerous “ Consequence, a Breach of the many goqd Statutes, provided for the Liberty of the Subject, and of pernicious “ Example, by denying the necessacy Assistance to the “ Prisoner, upon a Commitment of the House of Commons, which has ever been allowed upon all Commitmeats by any Authority whatsoever.”

The Commons take this to be another Instance of your Lordships Breach of your own Rule, your Lordships being no Judges of their Privileges, though by this Resolution you seem to make a Judgment, without having beard, and knowing, what the Commons have to alledge for them.

This Attempt therefore in your Lordships is of dangerous Consequence, tending to a Breach of the good Understanding between the Two Houses, and of most pernicious Example. The Commons late Proceeding, in censuring and punishing the Counsel, that have pleaded upon the Return of the W rits of Habeas , in behalf of these Prisoners, if duly considered, a great Instance of the Temper of the House of Commons: For this House did not interpose, when the Prisoners applied to the Lord Keeper, and the Judges, to be bailed; and had the Lawyers shewn so much Modesty, as to have acquiesced in the Opinion of the Lord Keeper, and all the Judges, that these Prisoners were not bailable by the Statute of Habeas Corpus, the Commons had never taken any Notice of it: But they would not rest satisfied, without bringing on again this Case; and the Privileges of the Commons were, with great Licentiousness of Speech, denied, and insulted, in publick Court; not with any Hope, or Prospect, of Relief of the Prisoners (who, in this whole Proceeding, have apparently been only die Tools of some ill-designing Persons, that are contriving every Way to disturb the Freedom of the Commons Elections) but in order to vent these new Doctrines against the Commons of England, and with a Desigq to overthrow their fundamental Right. And after so much Inveteracy shewn to the Commons, they could not do less, than declare the Abettors, Promoters, Countenancers, or Assisters, of a Prosecution so carried on, to be guilty of conspiring to make a Difference between the Two Houses of Parliament, to be Disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdom, and to have endeavoured, as far as in them lay, to overthrow the Rights and Privileges of the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled.

And the Commons, in committing the Lawyers, have only done that Right to their Body, which your Lordships have frequently practised in Cases of personal Privilege, where any single Member of your Lordships House is concerned.

Your Lordships last Resolution; viz.

“ That a Writ of Error is not a Writ of Grace, but (t of Right, and ought not, to be denied to the Subject, “ when duly applied for, though at the Request of either “ House of Parliament; the Denial thereof being ail “ Obstruction of Justice, contrary to Mugna .”

Tire Commons shall not enter into any Consideration, whether a Writ of Error is of Right, or of Grace; they concaving it uot material in this Case, in which no Writ of Error lies, nor was ever any Writ of EVror brought or attempted, in the like Case before; and the allowing it in such Cases would not only subject all the Privileges of the House of Commons, but the Liberties of all the People of England, to thq Will and Pleasure of the House of Lords.

You 14

And when your Lordships Exercise of Judicature upon Answer to Writs of Error is considered; how unaccountable in ift Lords«-Foundation; how inconsistent it is with our Constitution, which, in all other Respects, is the wisest and happiest £rror “n in the World, to suppose the last Resort in Judicature Aylesbury and the Legislature to be differently placed? Case.

And when it is considered, how that Usurpation, in hearing of Appeals from Courts of Equity, so easily traced, though often denied, and protested against, yet still ex- ercised, and almost every Session of Parliament extended; it is not to be wondered, that, after the Success your Lordships have had in these great Advances upon our Constitution, you should now at once make an Attempt upon the whole Frame of it, by drawing the Choice of the Commons Representatives to your Determination for theft is a necessary consequence from your Lordships encouraging the late Actions, and your countenancing a Writ of Error;. which, if allowed upon such a Proceeding, plight as well be.introduced upon all Acts and Proceedings of Courts, or Magistrates of Justice: And though the present Instance has been brought on under the specious Pretence of preserving Liberty; it is obvious, the spme will as well hold to controul the bailing, and discharging, Prisoners in all Cases.

And the Commons cannot but see, how your Lordships are contriving, by all Methods, to bring the Determination of Liberty and Property into the bottomless and insatiable Gulf of your Lordships Judicature; which ' would swallow up both the Prerogatives of the Crowb, and the Rights and Liberties of the People; and which, your Lordships must give the Commons Leave to say, they have the greater Reason to dread, when they consider, ip what manner it has been exercised; the Instances whereof they forbear, because they hope, your Lordships will reform; and they desire, rather to compose the old, than to create any new, Differences.

Upon the whole, the Commons hope, that, upon due Consideration of what tfyey have laid before your Lordships, you will be fully satisfied, they have acted nothing in all these Proceedings, but what they are sufficiently justified in from Precedents, and the known Laws and Customs of Parliament; and that your Lordships have assumed and exercised Judicature, contrary to the known Laws and Customs of Parliament, and tending to the Overthrow of the Rights and Liberties of the People of England.

Mr. Speaker resumed the Chair.

Sir Thomas Meeres reported from the Committee, that they had gone through the Bill, and made several Amendments thereunto, which they had directed him to report, when the House will please to receive the same.

Ordered, That the Report be made Tomorrow Morning.

Sir Gilbert Heatchcott reported from the Committee, to Pitkin's whom the Petition of the Merchants, Tradesmen, Clo- Creditors, thiers, and others, the Creditors of Thomas Pitkin, late of London, Linen-draper, on behalf of themselves, and all the rest of the said Pitkin's Creditors, was referred; that it appeared to the Committee, upon the Examination of Thomas Brerewood, Job Williams, and several other Persons, and upon Perusal of some of the Books, of Thomas Pitkin, and the said Thomas Brerewood,

That, since the Beginning of last June, divers great Quantities of the Goods, bought up by the said Thomas Pitkin, to the Value of Two-and-thirty thousand Pounds, and upwards, have been conveyed to the Hands of the said Thomas Brerewood, by the Aid and Assistance of the said Job Williams, and one Michael Miles, and by divers secret and fraudulent Methods disposed of, and concealed, by them.

That the Accounts in the said s Books, be-

tween him and other Persons, appear to have been duly entered with regular references; but the Accounts between him and the said Pitkin appear to have been entered at once, and without References, or Vouchers, and to be merely fictitious, and framed and contrived, with a Design to cover and conceal the Truth of the Dealings between them; and, to this End, he refuses to produce his Cash-book, pretending the same not to have been regularly kept; without which no Accounts can be fairly entered, not rightly examined.

And that thereupon the Committee had come to a Resolution, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same was read, and is, . followeth:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

That the said Thomas Brerewood has been the principal Accomplice, concerned with the said Pitkin; and the said Job Williams and Michael Miles have been privy, aiding, and assisting, to the said Thomas Pitkin; in contriving, and carrying on, the Design to cheat and defraud '

his Creditors of all the Goods, bought by him the said Pitkin within Nine Months last past.

The said Resolution being read a Second time;

Resolved, That the House doth agree with the Committee, in the said Resolution, That the said Thomas Brerewood has been the principal Accomplice, concerned with the said Pitkin; and the said Job Williams and Michael Miles have been privy, aiding, and assisting, to the said Thomas Pitkin; in contriving, and carrying on, the Design to cheat and defraud his Creditors of all the Goods, bought by him the said Pitkin within Nine Months last past

Resolved, That this Hoase will, Tomorrow Morning, Bankrupts, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, upon the ingrossed Bill, from the Lords, intituled, An Act to prevent Frauds, frequently committed by Bankrupts.

Conference IV/T & Bromley reported, that the Managers of the free

with Louis, _L ▼ JL Conference with the Lords had (according to llabees (for drawn up what passed at the said free Conference;

pus and Wriu u 'c they had directed him to report to the House: «f Error in Which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in Aylesbury at the Clerk's Table.

Case" Ordered, That the said Report be entered upon the

Journals.

And the same is, as followeth:

That the Lords, who appeared as Managers, and spoke . at this free Conference, were the Earl of Sunderland, the Lord Ferret's,the liishop of Salisbury, the Lord Haiti fax,

the Lord Wharton, and the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Steward.

That the free Conference was begun by the Managers for the Lords; who said, This Conference was desired, to maintain a good Correspondence betw een the Two Houses; which w as never more necessary, than at this time.

That the delivering Resolutions, at their First Conference, was Parliamentary; and instanced the Resolutions 3® Cai\ i-, which produced the Petition of Right

That the Lords look upon the Commons to be a great Part of the Constitution, which cannot be preserved, but by doing Right to both Houses.

That every Part of the Body politick, as well as the Body natural, ought to be kept within due Bounds: An Excess in any Member will weaken the Whole.

That this Constitution is the Wonder of the World, and Glory of this Nation: Tis founded upon Liberty, and Property; and the House of Commons hath been a great Fence and Bulwark of Liberty.

That the Lords Resolutions are very well founded, and justified by the Laws of the Land; as is their Judicature in this Case.

That it was proper for them to receive the Petitions, and make these Resolutions thereupon.

That the Lords are the great Court of Judicature; and when the Courts below have differed in Opinion, there has been Resort to the Lords, for their Judgment; as in the Case of Kindred of half Blood claiming Shares of Intestates Estates.

That, when such a Complaint comes before the Lords, they ought to give their Opinion as to the Law of the Land; and that was the Foundation of their present Resolutions.

That the First Resolution was, in Effect, agreed to by the Commons, though they go off to foreign Matters, of which the Lords take no notice.

That the Law of the Land can be altered only by the Legislature.

1'hat the Second Resolution asserts the Subject's Redress by Action at Law, &c.

That all Constitutions have reckoned this their Safety, that every Man, from the highest to the lowest, hath the Protection of the Law.

That, according to our Constitution, the Subject may contest his Right with the Crown, and upon equal Terms, with that Respect, which is due.

That this Resolution only asserts the Right, does not state the respective Courts, where the Redress is to be had: If the Party mistakes the Court, he is punished by Costs of Suit.

The Term of “ privileged Causes” is new, and the Distinction unknown.

To support the Third Resolution, it was urged,

That the Breach of Privilege was not well grounded.

That it belongs to the Crown to make Declarations. The Commons did indeed make Ordinances; and, w hen their Prince was murdered, they came to Declarations.

That a Law, without Promulgation, cannot have Force >to make an Offence,

Vol. 14.

The Liberty of Mens Persons is the greatest Privilege, and not to be taken away, but in known Cases: The invading of it has shook the best Constitutions.

That the taking away the Liberty of one mean Person once endangered the Government of Rome.

That both Houses may commit for Breach of Privilege, but cannot declare any thing to be a Privilege, without good Grounds; nor, consequently, make any thing'a Contempt, that is not known to be so.

That Commitments, or Censures, have not been usual upon Actions at Law, though such Actions have brought the Proceedings, or Privileges, of either House in question.

That in the Case of Freedom of Speech, which is the greatest Privilege, there was a Judgment in King Charles the First's Reign, in the Heat of those Times, against some Members, for Speeches in Parliament. This the Commons first condemned, and then, by Conference, brought it before the Lords; who came to a Resolution, that it was erroneous, and desired the Lord Hollis to bring his Writ of Error; and thereupon it was reverse,d by the Lords, in the Time of 2d: Which shews the Care, the Lords had of the Commons Privileges.

That, in Soames and Barnadiston's Case, the Commons did not concern themselves, only in Support of the Action, when in 1678 they examined the Judgment of Reversal, as a Grievance.

That the Lords had not interposed in any Suits, which concerned the Proceedings of their House.

" That the Earl of Banbury (as he was called) was by the Lords adjudged to be no Peer: This was examined in the King's Bench, where, in Abatement of an Indictment of Murder against him, as Charles Esquire, he

pleaded his Title of an Earl; and, in Avoidance of that, the Order of the Lords was replied, and was examined by the Court, and disallowed.

That the late Bishop of St. David's was prosecuted in the Spiritual Court, and deprived, though a Member of that House; and the Lords did not interpose.

That it is the Wisdom of all Governments, to have the Law open; and that's the Difference between a legal, and an arbitrary Government.

That the Lords don't meddle with the Commons Right of determining their own Elections: They have a settled Possession of it, which is a Right: But if all the Rights of Subjects, concerned in those Elections, are to be determined there, that will bring all Questions of Freehold, and the Allowance of all Charters, and all Liberty and Property, before them.

That a Freeholder, of I'orty Shillings per Annum, has a Right of Inheritance, to which he is born; and, if his Vote is denied, he is damnified, and loses the Credit of his Vote; and if he shall only come to the House of Commons, they can neither give him Damages, nor Costs of Suit.

That a Freehold cannot be determined by any Court, which cannot give an Oath.

That the Precedents, produced, concern only the Right of determining Elections in general.

And an Action by an Elector, for lib Right of voting, does not avoid the Election.

To maintain the F'ourth Resolution, they said,

That it may be lawful for a Man to apply for his Liberty, where he cannot have it.

That the Proceedings in 1675, produced as a Precedent in this Case, w'ere upon a Matter contested between the Two Houses, and resolved differently in the Lords House: Topham, and the Lieutenant of the Tower, were both turned out; and the Ferment was so high, that the Parliament was prorogued, and soon after dissolved.

The fifth Resolution is a Consequence of the Fourth.

That the Commitment of the Lawyers was not for licentious Speech, as was insinuated at the last Conference, but for pleading upon the Return of the W rits ot Habeas Corpus.

That 'tis the particular Character of that odious Court, called the Inquisition, that nobody dares appear for, or 7 E resort

resort to, a Person imprisoned there, but he is left to the Mercy of the Court.

That Lawyers are not to be answerable for every thing the y argue: They are to do their Duty for their Clients, and the Court is to judge of it.

The Commons declining the last Resolution is an agreeing it, though not so parliamentary, as it would have been, to have agreed it directly.

That the Lords are the only proper Judges, whether the Writ of Error lies before them.

To these Arguments your Managers answered,

That they agreed the Necessity of a good Correspondence between the Two Houses, especially at this Time of common Danger, and that the Commons had fully shewn their Desire to maintain that good Correspondence, by condescending to meet their Lordships at this free Conference, although their ancient and fundamental Privileges had been called in question, and denied, by their Lordships, and that in an extraordinary and very unparliamentary Manner.

That the Delivery of Resolutions is so far from being the only Method of Conferences, that the more usual Method has been to offer Reasons, without Resolutions; and it would be very difficult to give any Instance, before this, of either House delivering positive Resolutions at a Conference, without the Reasons at the same time to support them, and that induced them to make such Resolutions.

That the Commons Answer to the I.ords First Resolution is not foreign to the Subject-matter of the Conference, because the Commons apprehended the Subject-matter to be, their Lordships denying the Privileges of the Commons, on the one hand, and their extending their own Judicature beyond its proper Limits, on the other; and therefore the Commons could uot but take notice, how for their Lordships'lmd transgressed in the Exercise of an unwarrantable Judicature, in Contradiction to that very Rule, they had laid down for the Test of the Proceedings of the Commons, and by which the Commons had strictly governed themselves.

That the Commons cannot create new Privileges; yet in Cook's 13 Reports, fol. 63. 'tis said, the Privilege of Parliament, either of the Upper House, or of the House of Commons, belongs to the Determination or Decision only of the Court of Parliament: For every Court hath a Right to adjudge their own Privileges, according to the Book of E. 4th, Sir John Posto Case.

To their Lordships Arguments fof their Second Resolution, your Managers answered,

That every Person injured hath a Right to seek Redress; but then that Redress must be sought in the Place, where the Matter is properly cognizable.

To what the Lords offered upon the Third Resolution, your Managers answered,

That Matters of Election do not belong to the Courts below, but only to the House of Commons, which hath been in long Possession of them.

That there was an Act of Parliament, made in the Time of King Henry the 6th, to give an Action for a false Return of Members to serve in Parliament, because no such Action lay at common Law, it relating to Elections.

That double Returns not being within that Statute, no Action lay in the Courts of common Law, for making any double Return, till the Statute 7 and 8 III.

That, besides the Instances given in the Answers the Commons gave to the Lords Resolutions at the last Conference, this Distinction, as to privileged Cases, is fully and undeniably warranted by the Statute, made in the 1st Year of King JViUiam and Queen , intituled, An Act, declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and settling the Succession of the Crown; where, among other Endeavours, of the late King James, to subvert and extirpate the Laws apd Liberties of the Kingdom, these are mentioned, “ by violating the Freedom of Election “ of Members to serve in Parliament, and by Prosecutions in the Court of King's Bench for Matters and Causes, only cognizable in Parliament.”

Besides, that there are privileged Cases, as well as privileged Persons, appears from hence: A Prohibition, and afterwards an Attachment, lies, for suing in the spiritual Court for a temporal Cause, determinable in the temporal Court. There are divers Laws within this Realm, of which the common Law is but One; as appears in Cook's 1st. Inst. j. 11. B. where he mentions lex et Parliamenti, et lex communis, as distinct Laws.

As there are several Laws, so there are several Courts and Jurisdictions, and several Causes proper for those several Laws, and several Jurisdictions. Of these the high Court of Parliament is the First. Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti is a great Branch of the Law of England; and many Causes are to be determined only by that Law, as appears in the Inst.yb. 23.

Of such Caused, as are in their Nature parliamentary, and to be determined by the Law of Parliament, the common Law, and common Law Judges, have nothing to do; as further appears, 4 Inst. 14, 15. where the Expressions are very suitable to the present Controversies.

That the Persons persisting in the Prosecution of such Actions, after a Prohibition by the Commons, for that such Causes belong to their Jurisdiction, the committing them for the Breach of their Privileges in that Particular is no more than is done by the common Law Courts for a like Contempt; as, when Persons will sue, after a Prohibition, to the spiritual Courts; and the Commons usual Way to defend their Privileges, against such Invasions, has been by committing the Tools and Instrument? thereof.

It is a fundamental Maxim of the Law and Custom of Parliament, which is the highest and noblest Part of the ' Law of England, and particularly adapted to the Preservation of the Liberties of this Kingdom, that the Two Houses are independent of one another, and sole Judges of their own Rights and Privileges. That their Lordships did admit the Commons have a Privilege to judge of the Rights of their own Electors to one Intent, but not to another; but if the Commons have such a Privilege to one Intent, they must be Judges of it to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever; and being sole Judges thereof their Judgment cannot be legally called in question, either by Writs o i Habeas Corpus, Writs of Error, or otherwise,

in any other Court; and consequently the Proceedings in Westminster-hall, and in the House of Peers, and the

Judgment given there, are all null and void, and coram nonjudice.

The Commons Commitment, for commencing these Actions, is no more, than what they, and their Predecessors, have in all Times practised in Cases of Breach of Privilege.

In Answer to what the Lords had offered upon the Fourth Resolution, your Managers insisted, The Application of Friends, for the Liberty of any Person imprisoned, ought to be in a proper Place, and in a proper Manner; which, in this Case, ought to have been only to the House of Commons, and by the Petition of the Persons they had committed.

That the Proceedings in 1675 were so well grounded, that they must be Precedents to the Commons to follow at all Times upon the like Occasions.

To what the Lords offered upon the Fifth Resolution, your Managers answered,

The Licentiousness of Speech, used by the Lawyers, was only mentioned among other Particulars of the Provocations they gave the House of Commons; but they were committed for pleading, upon the Returns of the Writs of Habeas Corpus, in behalf of the Prisoners committed by the House of Commons; which the Commons, who are the only Judges of their own Privileges, take to be a great Breach of the Privilege of their House.

To the last Resolution your Managers insisted, That no Writ of Error lies in that Case: And that there may he Cases, wherein no Writ of Error lies, was their lordships Opinion in the Case of the late Bishop of David's, w ho JJ brought

Vol. 14. That

Conference with Lords, respecting Habeas Corpus and Writs of F.rror in Aylesbury Case.

572 130 Martii. jl. 1704.

That 30 Car. the Commons maintained, that the Mea-

sure of Persons being bailable, is not from the Authority that committed, but from the Cause of Commitment.

Your Managers further observed, this Subject-matter was scarce ever in Conference before between the Lords and Commons, and will seem strange to Posterity.

That the Lords Concern for Liberty and Property can not be equal with that of the Commons; for the Lords Liberty is better fenced, and consequently their Property too, than that of the Commons.

The Lords are less interested in the Event of this Conference, than the Commons, who are the Trustees of those, who sent them, and are bound in Duty, and Interest to preserve their Liberty and Property; and having but a b iennial Duration, which is at this Time hear expiring, it's not to be imagined, they will infringe what they are intrusted with, and so much concerned to maintain, and that so notoriously, that the Lords should complain, who are much less concerned, but more to be feared, as their Designs, as well as Honours, may be hereditary.

At the First Conference Six Resolutions were delivered, as Matters of undoubted Truth and Law.

And the Proceedings of the Commons are to be tried by these Rules, though they were no Parties to the making the m.

The first is not to be excepted against; only is an Insinuation, as if the Commons had practised the contrary; which they are not conscious of.

To the Second; There are many Injuries, for which no Action at Law is allowed; as, if a Judge gives a wrong Judgment, the Redress by Writ of Error is no Satisfaction for the Damage.

So for other Acts of a Judge, or Court of Justice; as denying a W rit of Habeas , or Bail; no Action

lies, but upon the late Statute.

That their Lordships not making any Distinction between Matters and Causes, which were exempt from the Cognizance of the common Law Courts, as being solely cognizable in Parliament, and Causes, which were exempt only in respect of the Person sued being entitled to Privilege of Parliament, seems to be the Occasion of the Mistakes, their Lordships have entertained in relation to tire Proceedings of the Commons: That the House of Commons is a Court of Judicature in many Respects, and, as such, hath, as well as other Courts, Causes proper and peculiar to its Jurisdiction.

That the Law Books, and particularly the Lord Cook, speaks of Matters of Parliament, which are not to be determined by the common Law, but according to the Law and Usage of Parliament.

That all Matters, moved, or done, in Parliament, must be questioned and determined there, and not elsewhere, has been heretofore asserted by the House of Commons, as their ancient and undoubted Right, and has been allowed, both by the Judges of Law, and by their Lordships; and w'hen the Judges in the King's Bench, in the 5th Year of King Charles the First, upon an Information against Sir John Elliott, Mr. Hollis, and others, held, that Matters done in the House of Commons, if not done in a parliamentary Way, might be questioned elsewhere, that Judgment was afterwards reversed in Parliament.

That their Lordships allowed all Matters, relating to Elections, ought to be determined solely by the Commons; and though their Lordships attempted to make a Distinction between the Right of Elections, and the Right of Electors, yet their Lordships cannot find room for such a Distinction, unless they would say, the Right and Qualification of the Electors was a Matter not relating to Elections.

That by the Parliament Roll, 11 Richard II. it appears, a Petition was exhibited by Parliament, and allowed by the King, that the Liberties and Privileges of Parliament should be discussed by the Parliament, and not by any other Courts, nor by common or civil Law; and therefore, when the Judges have been asked their Opi-

nions in Matters of Parliament, they have answered that the Privileges of Parliament ought to be determined there, and not by any other; as they did in the Case of Speaker of the House of Commons, 31 II. VI.

That these Matters are not exempt from the Determination of other Courts in respect of the Persons sued, for then they might be determined there, after the Time of Privilege was expired; whereas it is evident, that such Alatters and Causes cannot be determined in any other Courts, than that of Parliament, after the Expiration of the Time of Privilege, any more than before.

That these Matters are determinable in Parliament, although the Persons prosecuted are not entitled to the Privilege of Parliament, as appears by many Instances; particularly, by that of the Mayor of Westbury, in the 8th Year of Queen Elizabeth; who, for taking four Pounds, to get a Person elected a Burgess for that Borough, was fined and imprisoned by the House of Commons, although he was not a Person entitled to the Privilege of Parliament.

That it may as well be said, that an Action is maintainable for refusing any of the Lords a Right of Precedency in Parliament; yet it cannot be imagined, the House of Peers would be content, the same should be brought in question in any of the Courts of Law, and decided by a Jury of Commoners.

But the same Arguments will hold for maintaining such an Action, to recover Damage for refusing Precedency to him, that hath Right to it, as for maintaining an Action to recover Damages for refusing to take down upon the Poll the Vote of an Elector; for it may with equal Reason be said in both Causes, that the Plaintiff hath a Right; that the Defendant refused him that Right; that such Refusal is an Injury; and, consequently, ought to be repaired in Damages.

As to the Third Resolution; The Commons are not accountable to the House of Lords, or any other Court, for what they did in that Matter.

Their Privileges being Rights peculiar to that House, what is their Privilege, and the Breach of it, is only examinable, and to be judged, by themselves.

The Courts of Westminster'-hallhave that Deference

for each others Judgment, that in Commitments for Contempt, or Misdemeanor, which are frequent every Term, another Court, though superior, will not redress the Prisoner by Habeas Coipus, or otherwise, but he must address to the Court, that committed him; much less can an inferior Court do it.

The House of Commons therefore expected the same. Deference from those Courts, which they pay each other, and also from the Lords House w hat is due to-a co-ordinate Jurisdiction; the Commons taking themselves to be superior to any Court in Westminster-hall, andnotallow'-ing any Court in this Government to be their Superior, as their Predecessors have done.

The Commons do not intend, by their Declaration, to make a new Law'; but barely declare what the Law was, and prohibit any Person to act contrary.

The Term “ Declaration' is not peculiar to the Prince, but is a familiar Term in Westminster-hall.

The Commitment was not for acting contrary to the Votes of the Commons, but for acting contrary to Law, after the Law was notified to them by that Declaration, and they thereby prohibited to proceed in that Course.

To set this in a true Light: If a man sues in the Admiralty, or ecclesiastical, Court, for a Matter, properly cognizable at common Law, the Party shall not indeed be committed for commencing that Suit; but if the Defendant in such Suit obtains a Prohibition, which declares what the Law is, and gives the Plaintiff Notice, that his Suit is contrary to Law, and therefore prohibits him to proceed any further therein, if he does proceed, an Attachment will issue, to arrest him for Breach of the Prohibition, as it is said, though, in truth, it is for acting contrary to Law, after he had been admonished what the Law was.

Now there's no Difference between the Declaration complained of, and the Prohibition mentioned, but in the

13 As

4 Ann. 130 Martii.

As the Commons at the last Conference waved the Point of a Writ of Error being of Right, or of Grace, so they do now, by way of Admission, but as it's not material in this Case.

Rut thus much may be observed, that the is not the common Case, where the Question arises and falls under the Determination of the Judges of the Law, which is of Petitions of Right, and Writs of Error, in the Courts of Westminster (as that of Sir Thomas Armstrong's was) where the Queen is Party: There it is in the room of a Suit against the Crown, and, if denied, the Party has no Remedy.

This Petition to the Queen, for a Writ of Error in Parliament, is properly a parliamentary Case, and is the same, when the Queen is Party, or not; and seems some Remnant of our ancient Constitution, where all Petitions were to the King in Parliament, or to the King, and his great Council (which was distinct from the House of Peers) and were examined by Tryers, w hether fit for the Parliament tp proceed upon, or not; and to say, that, upon such Examination, they could not be rejected, is to say, that Examination was insignificant.

And if in this Case no Writ of Error lies, it cannot then be said, that the denying of it is an Obstruction of Justice, or contrary to Magna Chart a.

That a Writ of Error lies not in any Proceeding on an Habeas Corpus, has been the uniform Opinion of former Times, as appears in a Case of the City of London, 7# Jac. reported by the Lord Chief Justice Cook, in his 8th Report; wlicre one under an Arrest, for the Penalty in a By-law, brought his Habeas C; and the Judges took it for a Ground, that no Issue or Demurrer could be joined upon the Return, nor could any Writ of Error lie upon their Award; and upon that, as a Principle, grounded their Resolution, so. 128.

And that this never came directly in question, is, because a Writ of Error in such Case w as never asked, much less had, upon a bare Commitment of any Court whatsoever; and it is hard to imagine, that there is any law ful Resort, or Appeal, for Liberty, left untried at this Day, when so many in all Times have had occasion to apply for it, especially considering the frequent Commitments of both Houses of Parliament.

That the Commons are not surprised, to find the Lords make such a Shew of submitting their Privileges to the Courts of Westminster, when it is an Order to draw all the Rights and Privileges of both Houses to their own final Determination; and much less, when they consider, how insignificant all Courts of Justice are rendered, while their Lordships exercise the last Resort in Judicature. '

The several Attempts in the way of Judicature, which have been made upon the Constitution, are so many Reasons for the Commons at last to make a Stand.

The very Form of Writs of Error in Parliament is altered in a most material Part.

It is still returnable into Parliament generally, and the Judgment is entered per curiam Parliamenli:

But where the ancient Form, which appears in s

Entries, fol.302. was, utde et advisamento Domi-

ttorum Spiritualium et Temporalium ac in

Parliamento nostro existentium, ulterius pro errore getido Jieri Jaciamus quod dejure, §c.

Of late, as appears by a Writ of Error, printed in the Lord Chief Justice Saunders' 2d Report, Jo. 228. (and agreeable to that are all the modern ones) that Word “ Communitatum" is omitted.

This is only touched, for an Instance, that even the highest Records, which ought to derive to us our Laws, and Constitution, pure and intire, have been corrupted.

And to proceed to instance some modern Innovations upon our Constitution in point of Judicature;

In December, 18 Jac. I. it appears by the Lords Journal, that an Appeal to the Lords from a Court of Equity, was by them acknowledged to he as new', and unprecedented, as any of the Attempts, which occasion the present Conference.

Here the Lords interrupted your Managers, affirming, Vol. 14.

that they were restrained from entering into Debate of their Judicature of Appeals from Equity, as foreign from the Subject-matter of the last Conference. But it was answered, and insisted, by your Managers, that this was Part of the Matter offered at the last Conference.

And your Managers declared, that they had more to offer, and were ready to proceed upon the Subject-matter of the last Conference, in such Manner as they thought their Duty to the Commons of England required, if their Lordships thought fit to hear them: Whereupon the Lords did rise, and broke off the Conference.

Resolved', That the Proceedings of this House in relation to the Ailesbury Men, committed by this House for a Breach of Privilege, and the other Proceedings of this House in that Matter, are in Maintenance of the ancient and undoubted Rights and Privileges of the Commons of England.

Ordered, That all the Proceedings in relation to the Ailesbury Men, committed by this House, and the Report of the Lords Journal, and Reports of the Conferences, and of the free Conference, be printed.

Ordered, That Mr. Speaker do appoint the printing of the said Proceedings, and Reports.

A Message from the Lords, by Mr. Rogers and Mr.. Hiccocks:

Mr. Speaker,

The Lords desire a present Conference with this House, in the Painted Chamber, upon the Subject-matter of the Amendments, made by this House to the Bill, intituled, An Act for naturalizing Job Pechels, Elias Landes, Francis Lacroix, and others.

And then the Messengers withdrew.

Resolved, That the House doth agree to meet the Lords at a Conference, as the Lords do desire.

And the Messengers were called in again, and Mr. Speaker acquainted them therewith.

Ordered, That Sir Thomas Meers, Sir Tho. Hanmer, Sir IVm. Drake, Sir Cha. Turner, Mr. Sir IIu.

Mack-aonh, Mr. Pole, Mr. Gery, Mr. Etterick, Mr. Fogg, Mr. How, Sir Gilbert Dolben, Mr. Scobell, Mr. Porlmun, Colonel Byerley, Sir Geo. Beaumont, Mr. Graham, Mr. liarcourt, Mr. B, Mr. Chancellor of

Exchequer, Colonel Stanhope, Earl of Mr. Free-

man, Mr. Aislaby, Mr. Gwyn, Mr. Harpur, Sir Joseph Tredenham,do manage the said Conference.

And the Managers went to the Conference:

And being returned;

Sir Thottuis Meers reported the Conference; and that it was managed, on the Part of the Lords, by the Bishop of Salisbury; w ho acquainted them,

That the Lords agree to all the Amendments, made by the Commons to the said Bill, except to the Clause A.

And to the Clause A, they do disagree, for the Reasons following:

1. The greatest Wealth and Strength of any Nation ariseth from the Number of the Inhabitants; which all wise Governments have endeavoured to increase, by giving all possible Encouragement, Privileges, and Freedoms, to such Foreigners, who should come and settle among them.

2. The most useful and beneficial Manufactures in England were first brought in, and erected here, by those, who fled out of Flanders from the Inquisition, and the Cruelty of Duke d' Alva.

3. Many useful Trades have been improved, and many considerable Manufactures set up, by the French Protestants, who have lately left their native Country, to preserve their Liberties and Religion from the Tyranny and Persecution of the presem French King.

4. 'The greatest Encouragement, that can be given to these, and any other Strangers, to settle in England, is the allowing them all the Freedoms, Liberties, and Privileges, of Englishmen.

5. That in all Governments, ancient and modern, those Persons, which they thought fit to naturaiize, were

admitted to enjoy the same Rights and Privileges, as the Natives.

t>. That the restraining those, who are able to purchase Lands, or otherwise to entitle themselves thereunto, from giving their Consent to the Election of their Representatives in Parliament, is without Example, and contrary to the Custom of all Nations.

7. That the admitting this Clause might endanger the taking away of the Votes of all Foreigners, though naturalized, or Denizens; for, unless an Exemplification of tills Act were lodged in every Place, where an Election is to be made, the Vote of any Foreigner might be refused, under Pretence, that he was comprehended in this Act.

And the Messengers were called in again, and Mr. Speaker acquainted them, therewith.

Ordered, That the Managers, who managed the former Conference upon the said Amendment, do manage this Conference.

And the Managers went to the Conference:

And being returned;

Sir William Drake reported the Conference; and that it was managed, on the Part of the Lords, by the Earl of Scarborough; who acquainted them, that the Lords do insist on their Amendment to the said Bill, for the Reason following;

Because the Clause is too general; and that neither Persons, nor Sums, being named, nor any certain Method of accounting being set down, this may occasion much 'Trouble even to Persons unconcerned, and may be managed with much Partiality.

And also the Amendment, made by this House, to which the Lords had disagreed, being read;

Resolved, That this House doth insist upon the said Amendment.

Ordered] That the Members, who managed the last Conference upon the Subject-matter of the said Amendment, do immediately withdraw into the Speaker's Chamber, and draw up Reasons, to be offered to the Lords at a Conference, for insisting upon the said Amendment.

Hiccocks:

Mr. Speaker,

The Lords have agreed to the Bill, intituled, An Act for granting to her Majesty a further Subsidy on Wines, and Merchandize imported, without any Amendment.

And then the Messengers withdrew.

Mr. Freeman reported, that the Members, appointed to withdraw, and draw up Reasons, to be offered at a Conference with the Lords, for insisting upon the Amendment, made by this House to the ingrossed Bill, from the Lords, iptituled, An Act for naturalizing Jacob Rechels, Elias Landes, Francis Lacroix, and others, to which the Lords have disagreed, had drawn up Reasons accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place, and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were once read throughout, and then a Second time Paragragh by Paragraph, and, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed unto by the House, and are, as follow:

That the Commons do insist upon their Amendment, for the following Reasons:

For that the other Advantages, given by this Bill, are a sufficient Encouragement for Foreigners to settle in this Kingdom, especially such, as have fled from so great a Tyranny and Persecution, as that of the present French King. '

For that, though Wealth and Strength may arise to a Nation from the Number of Inhabitants, yet it may prove dangerous to admit Foreigners into a Privilege, so important to the Being of our Constitution, who cannot be acquainted with, or bear a natural Affection, to it.

For that the Distinction, made by this Clause, is warranted by the Policy of other wise Nations; the Romans having often admitted Strangers to the Jus to

whom they did not think fit to allow the Jus

For that the admitting this Clause cannot take away the Votes of other Foreigners, who are entitled thereto; for though they should be unjustly refused by the Officer, at the Election, they will have their Votes allowed by the House of Commons.

Resolved, That a Conference be desired with the Lords, upon the Subject-matter of the Amendment, made to the ingrossed Bill, from the Lords, intituled,

An Act for naturalizing Jacob Pechels, Elias Landes,

Francis Lacroix, and others, to which their Lordships have disagreed.

Ordered, That Mr. Freeman do go to the Lords, and desire the said Conference.

Mr. Freeman reported, that he having (according to Order) b$en at the Lords, to desire the said Conference, the Lords do return an Answer, that they will send an Answer by Messengers of their own.

The several Clauses, added as Amendments to the in- Growth of grossed Bill, from the Lords, intituled, An Act for the Popery, further preventing the Growth of Popery, being ingrossed;

And a Motion being made, That the Bill be read the Third time;

As the Question was putting in the House, for the Third reading the Bill;

A Message was brought from her Majesty by Mr. Message to Aston, Deputy Gentleman-usher of the Black Rod: attend tba

Mr. Speaker, Queen.

The Queen commands this honourable House to attend her Majesty in the House of Peers, immediately.

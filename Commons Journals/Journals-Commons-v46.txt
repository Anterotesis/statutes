Mr. Speaker Mr. Speaker Reported to the House, That when the reports the House did attend His Majesty, upon^ Friday last, in the House of Peers, His Majesty was pleased to make

peec " a most Gracious Speech from the Throne to both

Houses of Parliament; of which, Mr. Speaker said, he had, to prevent Mistakes, obtained a Copy; which he read to the House; and is as followeth; viz.

My Lords, and Gentlemen,

It is a great Satisfaction to Me to inform you, that

the Differences which had arisen between Me and the Court of Spain have happily been brought to an amicable Termination.

I have ordered Copies of the Declarations exchanged Vo l.46.

between My Ambassador and the Minister of the Catholic King, and of the Convention which has since been concluded, to be laid before you.

The Objects which I have proposed to Myself in the Whole of this Transaction, have been to obtain a suitable Reparation for the Act of Violence committed at Nootka, and to remove the Grounds of similar Disputes in future; as well as to secure to My Subjects the Exercise of their Navigation, Commerce, and Fisheries, in those Parts of the World which were the Subject of Discussion.

The Zeal and Public Spirit manifested by all Ranks of My Subjects, and the Disposition and Conduct of My Allies, had left Me no Room to doubt of the most vigorous and effectual Support; but no Event could have afforded Me so much Satisfaction, as the Attainment of the Objects which I had in View-, without any actual Interruption of the Blessings of Peace.

Since the last Session of Parliament, a Foundation has been laid for a Pacification between Austria and The Porte, and I am now employing My Mediation, in Conjunction with My Allies, for the Purpose of negotiating a Definitive Treaty between those Powers, and of endeavouring to put an End to the Dissentions lit the Netherlands, in whose Situation I am necessarily concerned, from Considerations of National Interest, as well as from the Engagements of Treaties.

A separate Peace has taken Place between Russia and Sweden, but the War between the former of those Powers and The Porte still continues. The Principles on which I have hitherto acted will make Me always desirous of employing the Weight and Influence of this Country in contributing to the Restoration of general Tranquillity.

Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

I have ordered the Accounts of the Expences of the late Armaments, and the Estimates for the ensuing Year, to be laid before you.

Painful as it is to Me at all Times to see any Increase of the Public Burthens, I am persuaded you will agree with Me in thinking that the Extent of Our Preparations was dictated by a due Regard to the existing Circumstances, and that you will reflect w ith Pleasure on so striking a Proof of the Advantages derived from the liberal Supplies granted since the last Peace for the Naval Service. I rely on your Zeal and public Spirit to make due Provision for defraying the Charges incurred by this Armament, and for supporting the several Branches of the Public Service on such a Footing as the general Situation of Affairs may appear to require. You will at the same Time, I am persuaded, shew your Determination invariably to persevere in that System which has so effectually confirmed and maintained the Public Credit of the Nation.

My Lords, and Gentlemen,

You will have observed with Concern the Interruption which has taken Place in the Tranquillity of Our Indian Possessions, in consequence of the unprovoked Attack on an Ally of the British Nation. The respectable State however of the Forces under the Direction of the Government there, and the Confidence in the British Name, which the System prescribed by Parliament has established among the Native Powers in India, afford the most favourable Prospect of bringing the Contest to a speedy and successful Conclusion.

I think it necessary particularly to call your At-, tention to the State of the Province of Quebec, and

to recommend it to you to consider of such Regulations for its Government as the present Circumstances and Condition of the Province may appear to require.

D I am

Resolution for Address on King’s Speech.

10 30° JVovembris,-

That nothing can more evince His Majesty’s Mpde-fation, Wisdom, and Justice, than His having proposed to Himself, as His Objects in the Whole of this Transaction, to obtain a suitable Reparation for the Act of Violence committed at Nootka, and to remove the Grounds of similar Disputes in future, as well as to secure to His Subjects the Exercise of their Navigation, Commerce, and Fisheries, in those Parts of the World, which were the Subject of Discussion:

That it gives us the greatest Pleasure to be informed, that- the Disposition and Conduct of His Majesty’s Allies concurred with the Zeal and Public Spirit so naturally manifested by all Ranks of His Subjects, in ensuring to His Majesty the most vigorous and effectual Support; but that we are, at the same Time, fully sensible that no Event could have been so satisfactory as the Attainment of the Objects which His Majesty had in View, without any actual Interruption of the blessings of Peace:

That we are happy to learn, that a Foundation has been laid for a Pacification between Austria and The Porte, and that His Majesty has employed His Mediation, in Conjunction with His Allies, for the Purpose of negpciating a Definitive Treaty between those Powers, and of endeavouring to put an End to the Dissentions in the Netherlands', and that we shall at all Times rejoice in seeing the Weight and Influence of this Country directed to the wise and benevolent Object of contributing to the Restoration of general Tranquillity:

To assure His that His faithful Commons

are. deeply sensible of His Majesty’s paternal Goodness to His People, which leads His Majesty to regret any Occasion of increasing the public Burthens — That we are fully awarp of the Policy and Prudence of vigorous Preparations under the Circumstances which lately existed, and that we cannot but reflect with great Satisfaction on the striking Proof which has been given of the Advantages derived from the liberal Supplies granted since the last Peace for the Nayal Service:

That we shall not fail to direct pur particular Attention to the State of the Province of Quebec, and that wp shall carefully consider of such Regulations for its Government as the present Circumstances and Condition of the Province may render expedient:

That we should not faithfully represent file Sentiments of a loyal and grateful People, if wp were not to seek every Opportunity of affording His Majesty the most convincing Proof of our zealous and affectionate Attachment. — That if any Consideration cpuld increase the Warmth of those Sentiments, it would bp derived from His Majesty’s Gracious Declaration of IIjs Desire to cultivate an entire Harmony and Confidence w'ith His Parliament, for Purposes which must endear still more His Majesty’s Name to the present Age and to Posterity, as long as there remains a due Sense of the invaluable Blessings of pur free and excel* lent Constitution, and of the numerous and increasing Advantages which His Subjects enjoy under His Majesty’s mild and auspicious Government.

at the least, and is also restrained from taking any Apprentice at all, except he be the Owner of his Work hithself;. which Restrictions, from the great Increase of Trade within the said Liberty, are now very detrimental to the said Manufacture; and that divers Frauds and Deceits are frequently committed in the said Manufacture, by one Manufacturer striking or using the Mark of another Manufacturer, and the Powers of the said Act are found insufficient to prevent such Frauds and Deceits, and the said Act is in other Respects defective, and inadequate to the Purposes thereby intended; and that, the Petitioners conceive, it would greatly tend to the Encouragement, Increase, and Improvement of the said Manufacture, and be of very considerable Advantage to the Petitioners and others concerned therein, and of great public Benefit, if the Manufacturers of the said Wares were allowed to retain in their Service a greater Number of Apprentices at one Time than is allowed by the said Act, and if such of the said Manufacturers as are not Owners of their Work themselves were allowed to take Apprentices, and also if effectual Provision was made to prevent the committing of Frauds and Deceits in the said Manufacture, and for carrying into Execution the Purposes and Intentions of the said Act: And therefore praying, That I.eave may be given to bring in a Bill to repeal so much of the said Act as relates to the Regulation of the said Company, their Apprentices, Servants, and Workmen, in the said Arts, Trades, and Occupations, and to substitute other and more effectual Provisions and Regulations in Lieu thereof, and to give the Petitioners such other Relief in the Premises, as the House shall think meet and proper.

A Petition of James Bland Burges, and Charles Abbot, Esquires, was also read; Setting forth. That at the last Election of Burgesses to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Helleston, in the County of Cornwall, Sir GUbert Elliot, Baronet, and Stephen Lushington, Esquire, and the Petitioners, were proposed as Candidates; and that Richard Hit chaw, Esquire, Sheriff of the said County of Cornwall, made out his Precept for the Election of Two Members for the said Borough, but which he refused to deliver to Richard Penhall, a Freeman of the said Borough, who had the sole Right of executing the said Precept, and was the proper Returning Officer of the said Borough, and delivered the same to the Reverend John Pasmore, Clerk, hereafter-named; and that the said Richard Penhall had the sole Right to vote in the said Election, and he voted for the Petitioners, who were duly elected, and rightfully returned, by the said Richard Penhall, to the said Richard Hitchens, Sheriff of the said County of Cornwall; and that under Colour of a Royal Charter, obtained a short Time before the General Election in the Year 1774, and then attempted to be imposed on several of the ancient and the then subsisting Members of the Corporation of Helleston against their Consent, John Rogers took on himself to act at that Election as Mayor and Returning Officer of the said Borough,

although a Majority of the existing Members of the said Corporation, at the Time of the passing of the said Charter, opposed the same in every Stage of its Progress, and have not accepted, but, on the contrary, absolutely rejected, and the said Richard Penhall doth still reject and refuse to act under the same; and that, at the said General Election in 1774, a Return was made by the said John Rogers, and another Return was executed by Richard Johns, and others, claiming a Right to vote independently of the said modern Charter, and upon that Occasion this Honourable House, in pursuance of a Resolution of the Select Committee to whom the Merits of that Election were referred, did order tire Deputy Clerk of the Crown to amend the Return, by taking off the File the Indenture of Return made by the said John Rogers, and by annexing thereto the Indenture of Return executed by the said Richard Johns, and others; and that, under the same pretended Authority, John Hoblyn, at the General Election in 1780, took on himself to act as Mayor and Returning Officer, and at that Election unwarrantably made a Return of Burgesses to serve in Parliament for the said Borough, and another Return was executed by Matthew Wills, and the other Freemen of the said Borough, claitning a Right to vote independently of the said modem Charter, and upon that Occasion this Honourable House, in pursuance of the Resolution of the Select Committee to whom the Merits of that Election were referred, did order the Deputy Clerk of the Crown to amend such Double Return, by taking off the File the Indenture of Return which was made by the said John Hoblyn, and by annexing thereto the Indenture of Return executed by the said Matthew Wills, and others; and that at the General Election in the Year 1784, and at a subsequent Election in the Year 1787, the Elections and Returns of Burgesses to serve in Parliament for the said Borough were made by the Members of the old Corporation alone, without any Claim or Interference on the Part of the said modern Corporation, or any Petition against the said Returns; and that the Reverend John Pasmore, Clerk, took on himself to act at the last General Election as Mayor and Returning Officer of the said Borough at such Election, and took a Poll, and admitted great Numbers of Persons, w ho had no Right to vote, nor claim any other Right than such as they pretended to derive under the said Charter, to poll for the said Sir Gilbert Elliot and Stephen Lushington, and unwarrantably made a Return of them, as Members for the said Borough, to the said Richard Hitchens, the Sheriff, who has not only annexed to his Writ the Return so made by the said Richard Penhall of the Petitioners, but has also annexed to his Writ the Return so made by the said John Pasmore, and hath sent both Returns, with his Writ, into the Office of the Clerk of the Crown; and that the said Richard Hitchens, the Sheriff, ought only to have accepted the Return made by the said Richard Penhall, of the Petitioners, and sent the same with his Writ into the Office of the Clerk of the Crown: And therefore praying the House will take the Premises into Consideration, and grant them such Relief as the Circumstances of the Case call for and require.

A Petition of Sir Gilbert EUiot, Baronet, and Stephen Hellston Lushington, Esquire, was likewise read; Setting forth, Election — That, at the fast Election of Members to serve in Parlia- ^gj’ibert ment for the Borough of Helstone, otherwise Helleston, in Elliot and the County of Cornwall, the Petitioners, and James Bland Mr. Lushing-Burges and Charles Abbot, Esquires, were proj>osed as ton-Candidates to represent the said Borough in Parliament; and that the Sheriff of the said County of Cornwall delivered the Precept for the Election of Members to serve in Parliament to the Reverend John Pasmore,

Clerk, Mayor of the said Borough; and that a Poll having been demanded, the same was taken before the said John Pasmore, the Mayor of the said Borough, and

a great

a great Majority of the Persons, legally entitled to vote at the said Election, voted for the Petitioners, who were duly elected, and were returned by the said Mayor to the Sheriff of the said County of Cornwall, who annexed the same to the Writ of Election, and transmitted the same to the Office of the Clerk of the Crown; and that one Richard Penhall took upon himself to preside at another pretended Election for the said Borough, at which he, the said Richard Penhall, took upon himself to vote for the said James Bland Burges and Charles Abbot, and the said Richard Penhall, without any lawful Authority, hath returned the said James Bland Burges and Charles Abbot, as Members for the said Borough, although no other Person save the said Richard Penhall voted for the said James Bland Burges and Charles , and the said Sheriff hath accepted and annexed the said last-mentioned Return also to his Writ of Election, and transmitted the same to the Office of the Clerk of the Crown; and that the said Richard Penhall claimed to vote as a Freeman of the said Borough, pretending to have been elected to such Franchise under a Charter granted to the said Borough in the 27th Year of the Reign of Queeu Elizabeth, although, in Truth, the said Richard Penhall is not duly elected a Freeman according to the Provisions of the said Charter, but was elected by the Mayor and Aldermen only, and in the same Manner as all the other pretended Freemen of the said Borough who claimed their Franchises under the said Charter, and who were ousted by the Judgment of His Majesty’s Court of King’s Bench, and although the Corporation created by the said Charter is dissolved; and that the said James Bland Burges and Charles Abbot have been unduly elected and returned as Representatives of the said Borough, to the great Injury of the Petitioners: And the Petitioners therefore hope, That the House will take the Premises into Consideration, and give such Relief as the Circumstances of the Case require.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be taken into Consideration at the same Time that the said Petition of the Reverend John Pasmore, Clerk, Mayor of the Borough of Hellston, otherwise Helleston, in the County of Cornwall, and of the several other Persons whose Names are thereunder subscribed, Freemen of the said Borough, is ordered to be taken into Consideration.

Most Gracious Sovereign,

We, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Commons of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled, beg Leave to return Your Majesty our humble and hearty Thanks, for Your most Gracious Speech from the Throne.

We cannot omit taking the first Opportunity to offer to Your Majesty our sincere Condolence on the Loss which Your Majesty has sustained, by the untimely Death of Your Royal Brother, the late Duke of Cumberland.

It affords us the greatest Satisfaction that the Differences which had arisen between Your Majesty and the Court of Spain, have happily been brought to an amicable Termination; and we are grateful for Your Majesty’s Goodness in having ordered Copies of the Declaration exchanged between Your Majesty’s Ambassador and the Minister of the Catholic King, and of the Convention which has since been concluded, to be laid before us.

Nothing can more evince Your Majesty’s Moderation, Wisdom, and Justice, than Your having been pleased to direct Your Attention, in the Whole of this Transaction, to the Objects of obtaining a suitable Reparation for the Act of Violence committed at Nootka, and of removing the Grounds of similar Disputes in future, as well as of securing to Your Subjects the Exercise of their Navigation, Commerce, and Fisheries, in those Parts of the World which were the Subject of Discussion.

It gives us the greatest Pleasure to be informed, that the Disposition and Conduct of Your Majesty’s Allies concurred with the Zeal and Public Spirit so naturally manifested by all Ranks of Your Subjects, in ensuring to Your Majesty the most vigorous and effectual Support: We are, at the same Time, fully sensible that no Event could have been so satisfactory as the Attainment of the Objects which Your Majesty bad in Vot. 46.

View, without any actual Interruption of the Blessings of Peace.

We are happy to learn, that a Foundation has been laid for a Pacification between Austria and The , and that Your Majesty has employed Yeur Mediation, in Conjunction with Your Allies, for the Purpose of negociating a Definitive Treaty between those Powers, and of endeavouring to put an End to the Dissensions in the Netherlands; and we shall at, all Times rejoice in seeing the Weight and Influence of this Countiy directed to the wise and benevolent Object of contributing to the Restoration of general Tranquillity.

Your faithful Commons are deeply sensible of Your Majesty’s paternal Goodness to Your People, which leads Your Majesty to regret any Occasion of increasing the Public Burthens: — We are fully aware of the Policy and Prudence of vigorous Preparations under the Circumstances which lately existed; and we cannot but reflect with great Satisfaction on the striking Proof which has been given of the Advantages derived from the liberal Supplies granted, since the last Peace, for the Naval Service.

Your Majesty may be assured of our Readiness to make due Provision for defraying the Expences of the late Armament, and for supporting the several Branches of the Public Service, on such a Footing as the general Situation of Affairs may appear to require; and of our being, at the same Time, peculiarly desirous of shewing, in the strongest Manner, our Determination invariably to persevere in that System which has so effectually confirmed and maintained the Public Credit of the Nation.

We have observed, with Concern, the Interruption which has taken Place in the Tranquillity of our Indian Possessions; but it affords us great Satisfaction to be informed that Your Majesty sees so favourable a Prospect of bringing the Contest to a speedy and successful Conclusion.

Our particular Attention shall be directed to the State of the Province of Quebecand we shall carefully consider of such Regulations for its Government as the present Circumstances and Condition of the Province may render expedient.

We should not faithfully represent the Sentiments of a loyal and grateful People, if we were not to seek every Opportunity of affording Your Majesty the most convincing Proofs of our zealous and affectionate Attachment. If any Consideration could increase the Warmth of those Sentiments, it would be derived from Your Majesty’s Gracious Declaration of Your Desire to cultivate an entire Harmony and Confidence with Your Parliament, for Purposes which must endear still more Your Majesty’s Name to the present Age, and to Posterity, as long as there remains a due Sense of the invaluable Blessings of our free and excellent Constitution, and of the numerous and increasing Advantages which Your Subjects enjoy under Your Majesty’s mild and auspicious Government.

The said Address being read a Second Time;

DECLARATION.

His Britanruck Majesty having complained of the

Capture of certain Vessels belonging to His Subjects in the Port of Nootka, situated on the North-West Coast of America, by an Officer in the Service of the King, the under-signed Councillor and Principal Secretary of State to his Majesty, being thereto duly authorized; declares, in the Name, and by the Order of his said Majesty, That he is willing to give Satisfaction to His Britanruck Majesty for the Injury of which He has complained; fully persuaded that His said Britannick Majesty would act in the same Manner towards the King, under similar Circumstances; and his Majesty further engages to make full Restitution of all the British Vessels which we^e captured at Nootka, and to indemnify the Parties interested in those Vessels for the Losses which they shall have sustained, as soon as the Amount thereof shall have been ascertained.

It being understood that this Declaration is not to preclude or prejudice the ulterior Discussion of any Right which his Majesty may claim, to form an exclusive Establishment at the Port of Nootka.

In Witness whereof I have signed this Declaration, and sealed it with the Seal of my Arms. At Madrid, the 24th of July 1790.

(L. S.) Signed, Le Comte de Florida Blanca.

COUNTER-DECLARATION.

His Catholick Majesty having declared that he was willing to give Satisfaction for the Injury done to the King, by the Capture of certain Vessels belonging to His Subjects in the Bay of , and the Count de Florida Blanca having signed, in the Name, and by the Order, of his Catholic Majesty, a Declaration to this Effect, and by which his said Majesty likewise engages to make full Restitution of the Vessels so captured, and to indemnify the Parties interested in those Vessels for the Losses they shall have sustained; the under-signed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of His Majesty to the Catholick King, being thereto duly and expressly authorized, accepts the said Declaration in the Name of the King; and declares, that His Majesty will consider this Declaration, together with the Performance of the Engagements contained therein, as a full and entire Satisfaction for the Injury of which His Majesty has complained.

The under-signed declares, at the same Time, that H is to be understood, that neither the said Declaration signed by Count Florida Blanca, nor the Acceptance thereof by the under-signed, in the Name of the King, is to preclude or prejudice, in any Respect, the Right which his Majesty may claim to any Establishment, which his Subjects may have formed, or should be desirous of forming in future, at the said Bay of Nootka.

Their Britannick and Catholick Majesties, being desirous of terminating, by a speedy and solid Agree-

ment, the Differences which have lately arisen between the Two Crowns, have judged that the best Way of attaining this salutary Object would be that of an amicable Arrangement; which, setting aside all retrospective Discussion of the Rights and Pretensions of the Two Parties, should fix their respective Situation for the future on a Basis conformable to their true Interests, as well as to the mutual Desire with which their said Majesties are animated, of establishing with each other, in every Thing, and in all Places, the most perfect Friendship, Harmony, and good Correspondence. In this View they have named and constituted for their Plenipotentiaries; to wit, on the Part of His Britannick Majesty, Alleyne Fitz-Herbert, Esquire, One of His said Majesty’s Privy Council in Great Britain and Ireland, and His Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to his Catholick Majesty; and, on the Part of his Catholick Majesty, Don Joseph Monino, Count of Florida Blanca, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Spanish Order of Charles the Third, Councillor of State to his said Majesty, and his Principal Secretary of State, and of the Dispatches; who, after having communicated to each other their respective full Powers* have agreed upon the following Articles:

Article I.

It is agreed, That the Buildings and Tracts of Land, situated on the North-West Coast of the Continent of North America, or on Islands adjacent to that Continent, of which the Subjects of His Britannick Majesty were dispossessed, about the Month of 1789, by a Spanish Officer, shall be restored to the said British Subjects.

Article II.

And further, That a just Reparation shall be made, according to the Nature of the Case, for all Acts of Violence or Hostility, which may have been committed, subsequent to the Month of April 1789, by the Subjects of either of the contracting Parties against the Subjects of the other; and that, in case any of the said respective Subjects shall, since the same Period, have been forcibly dispossessed of their Lands, Buildings, Vessels, Merchandize, or other Property whatever, on the ' said Continent, or on the Seas or Islands adjacent, they shall be re-established in the Possession thereof, or a just Compensation shall be made to them for the Losses which they shall have sustained.

Article III.

And, in order to strengthen the Bonds of Friendship, and to preserve in future a perfect Harmony and good Understanding between the Two contracting Parlies, It is agreed, That their respective Subjects shall not be disturbed or molested, either in navigating or carrying on their Fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, or in the South Seas, or in landing on the Coasts of those Seas, in Places not already occupied, for the Purpose of carrying on their Commerce with the Natives of the Country, or of making Settlements there; the whole subject, nevertheless, to the Restrictions and Provisions specified in the Three following Articles.

Article IV.

His Britannick Majesty engages to take the most effectual Measures to prevent the Navigation and Fishery of His Subjects in the Pacific Ocean, or in the South Seas, from being made a Pretext for illicit Trade with the Spanish Settlements; and, with this View, it is moreover expressly stipulated, that British Subjects shall not navigate, or carry on their Fishery, in the said Seas, within the Space of Ten Sea Leagues from any Part of the Coasts already occupied by Spain.

Article V.

It is agreed, That, as well in the Places which are to be restored to the British Subjects, by virtue of the First Article, as in all other Parts of the North-ri Western

Article VI.

It is further agreed, with respect to the Eastern and Western Coasts of South America, and to the Islands adjacent, That no Settlement shall be formed hereafter, by the respective Subjects, in such Parts of those Coasts as are situated to the South of those Parts of the same Coasts, and of the Islands adjacent, which are already occupied by Spain: Provided that the Said respective Subjects shall retain the Liberty of landing on the Coasts and Islands so situated, for the Purposes of their Fishery, and of erecting thereon Huts, and other temporary Buildings, serving only for those Purposes.

Article VII.

In all Cases of Complaint or Infraction of the Articles

31

of the present Convention, the Officers of either Party, without permitting themselves previously to commit any Violence or Act of Force, shall be bound to make an exact Report of the Affair, and of its Circumstances, to their respective Courts, who will terminate such Differences in an amicable Manner.

Article VIII.

The present Convention shall be ratified and confirmed in the Space of Six Weeks, to be computed from the Day of its Signature, or sooner, if it can be done.

In Witness whereof, we, the under-signed Plenipotentiaries of their Britannick and Catholick Majesties, have, in their Names, and in virtue of our respective full Powers, signed the present Convention, aid set thereto the Seals of our Arms.

A Petition of the Persons thereunto subscribing, Glasgow Owners of Land in the Counties of Lanark, Ayr, and Road* t*eti-Renfrew,was presented to the House, and read; Set- tion* ting forth, That by an Act passed in the 29th Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, for making and repairing the Road from the City of Glasgow, in the County of Lanark, to Muirkirk, in the County of Ayr, and from thence to the Confines of the said County of Ayr, towards Sanquhar, in the County of Dumfries, and other Roads communicating the rewith, the said Roads have so far been made and repaired, and certain of the Trustees appointed by the said Act have engaged with, and become personally bound to Contractors for carrying on the same, but from the great Expence which has been necessarily incurred in executing of these Roads, and which very considerably exceeds the Estimates originally made, it is found that the Borrowing Clause contained in the said Act, which only empowers the Trustees to take upon Loan the Sum of £.0,500 Sterling, for the Purposes of the Act, will tall greatly short of the real Ex pence, which renders it necessary that the said Borrowing Clause should be enlarged, and the Tolls granted by the said Act augmented; and that, in the 14th Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, an Act was passed for making and repairing several Roads leading into the City of Glasgow, in the County of Lanark, particularly a Road from the East Side of the Entry to the new Bridge over Clyde, at Glasgow, on the Paisley Loan, by the Village of Gorbals, to the Chapel of , which

*Road has been made and repaired, but tire same cannot be upheld and kept in Repair, -and the Money borrowed repaid, unless the Term and Powers granted by the said Act are enlarged; and that the Road from the said Chapel of Cambuslang to Bumbank, where it joins the high Road from the Town of Hamilton, leading towards Eaglesham (being the Continuation of the Road from Glasgow by the Village of Cambuslang) is in bad Repair, inconvenient for Travellers, and dangerous for Carriages, and it would be of public Utility if the same was made and kept in Repair; and that the said Road from the City of Glasgow by the Chapel of Cambuslang, and the aforesaid Road from the said City to Muirkirk, are naturally connected with one another, there being several Miles of the Road from the said City common to both, and the same

continued till the 6th of July 1789, when a very small comparative Progress having been made, the Petitioners, from a Conviction of the Impossibility of any Decision by the Committee, were compelled to abandon their Petitions without any Effect, or Tendency towards Effect, after a tedious and expensive Litigation of Three Months and Three Days, and with an Expence to the petitioning Candidate of more than Fourteen thousand Pounds: That under these Circumstances, as the Petitioner declined demanding a Scrutiny before the Returning Officer, so is he compelled to disclaim all Scrutiny before a Committee of the House of Commons, for although that Act (the 10th of George the Third) by which the said Committee is appointed, recites, in its Preamble, That “ whereas the present Mode of Decision upon “ Petitions complaining of undue Elections or Returns of Members to serve in Parliament, frequently “ obstructs public Business, occasions much Expence, “ Trouble, and Delay, to the Parties, &c. for Re- medy thereof, &c.” yet it would be less expensive and less ruinous to the Petitioner to be impeached (even according to the present Mode of conducting Impeachments) and to be convicted too of real Crimes, than to be guilty of attempting to obtain Justice for himself and the injured Electors of , by the

only Mode of Decision, which the new remedial Statute (the 10th of George the Third) has appointed for that Purpose, however well adapted that Mode of Decision may be to settle the disputed Claims of the Proprietors of small Boroughs, for whose usurped and smuggled Interest alone the Framers of that Bill, and of those Bills which have been since built upon it, seem to have had any real Concern: That by the 9th of Anne, Chapter 5, the Right of Electors (before unlimited by Qualification in the Object of their Choice) is restricted in Cities and Boroughs to Citizens and Burgesses respectively, having an Estate, Freehold or Copyhold, for their own respective Lives, of the Annual Value of Three hundred Pounds above Reprizes: That this very moderate Restriction (however vicious in its Principle) leaving all Citizens and Burgesses eligible, possessing Life Estates, Freehold or Copyhold, of the Annual Value of Three hundred Pounds, will henceforth serve only as a Suare to the Candidate, and a Mockery of the Electors, if such Candidate, possessing a Life Estate of Three hundred Pounds a Year, must expend Fifty thousand Pounds (and there is no probable Appearance that a Hundred thousand Pounds would be sufficient) in attempting by a tedious, expensive, and ineffectual Litigation, to sustain the Choice of his Constituents, and to prove himself duly elected: That though the Petitioner complains (as he hereby does) of the undue Election and Return of Lord Hood and the Right honourable Charles James Fox to this present Parliament for the City and Liberty of Westminster, yet is the Petitioner, by a Persecution and Proscription of more than Twenty Years, disabled from making that pecuniary Sacrifice which by the present new Mode of Investigation is (and ought not to be) necessary effectually to prove such undue Return, and yet the Petitioner fully trusts, that notwithstanding a very great Majority of the House of Commons (for so it still continues to be stiled) are not, as they Ought to be, elected by the Commons of this Realm (in any honest Meaning of the Word “ Commons”) and must therefore naturally and necessarily have a Bias and Interest against a fair and real Representation of the People, yet the Petitioner fully trusts, that he shall be able to lay before “ a Committee chosen and “ sworn to try and determine the Matter of this Petition,” Evidence of such a Nature, as that the Committee will, on their Oaths, “ think proper to “ report to the House some Resolution or Resolutions “ other than the Determination of the Return, and “ that the House will make such Orders thereon as to “ them shall seem proper,” and the Petitioner doubts

not, that, as an Elector at least, he shall in consequence receive such Redress as will be much more important to him, and to the Electors of , than any

Determination of the Return;

And a Motion being made, and the Question being proposed, That the said Petition be taken into Consideration upon Tuesday, the 24th Day of May next, at Three of the Clock in the Afternoon;

An Amendment was proposed to be made to the Question, by leaving out the Words “ Tuesday, the “ 24th Day of May,” and inserting the Words “ Friday,

“ the 4th Day of February” instead thereof.

And the Question being put, That the Words “ Tuesday, the 24th Day of May,” stand Part of the . Question;

It passed in the Negative.

And the Question being put, That the Words “ Friday, the 4th Day of February,” be inserted instead thereof;

It was resolved in the Affirmative.

Then the main Question, so amended, being put;

Ordered, That the said Petition be taken into Consideration upon Friday, the 4th Day of February next, at Three of the Clock in the Afternoon.

Ordered, That Mr. Speaker do issue his Warrant, or Warrants, for such Persons, Papers, and Records, as shall be thought necessary, by the several Parties, on the Hearing of the Matter of the said Petition.

Memorandum:

In pursuance of several Acts, made for regulating the Trials of controverted Elections, or Returns of Members to serve in Parliament, the like Notices, as in former Cases, were sent to the several Parties; accompanied with Orders for their Attendance, by themselves, their Counsel, or Agents, at the Times on which the said several Petitions were ordered to be taken into Consideration.

Mr. Gilbert, according to Order, reported from the Committee of the whole 1 louse, to whom it was referred to consider of Ways and Means for raising the Supply granted to His Majesty, the Resolution which the Committee had directed him to report to the House; which he read in his Place; and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That, towards raising the Supply granted to His Majesty, the Sum of Four Shillings in the Pound, and no more, be raised within the Space of One Year, from the 25th* Day of March 1791, upon Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, Pensions, Offices, and Personal Estates, in that Part of Great Britain called England, Wales, and the Town of Berwick upon Tweed; and that a proportionable Cess, according to the Ninth Article of the Treaty of Union, be laid upon that Part of Great Britain called Scotland.

The said Resolution being read a Second Time, was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed to by the House.

Ordered, That a Bill be brought in, upon the said Resolution: And that Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Edward James Eliot, the Lord Bayham, the Lord Apsley, Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, Mr. Rose, and Mr. Steele, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

A Petition of Sir James Johnstone, Baronet, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioner petitioned the House upon the 1st Day of this Instant December, complaining of an undue Election and Return for the District of Burghs of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Annan, Lochma and Sanquhar; and that by an Act made in the Twenty-eighth Year of

THE Royal Forests may be divided into Two Classes, the One consisting of tiiose in which the principal Share of the Property belongs to the Crown, and which, from their Extent, and their Vicinity to the Dock Yards, it becomes a National Object to keep and to improve; and the other consisting of those Forests in which the most valuable Share has been granted away, together with the Custody and Management, and where it does not appear to be expedient

Forestrial Rights, such as we have described in former Reports, excepting in such Parts as have been exempted from the Forest Laws, by Grants of Free Hay, or Disafforestation.

The Lands now considered as Forest, and in which the Crown is possessed of the Timber, and other valuable Rights, extend in Length about Two Miles and a Half, and in Breadth about One Mile and a

Appendix, A more particular Description of the Coppices and N® 3* other Lands above-mentioned, extracted from the Survey made by our Direction, is inserted in the Appendix.

By the Custom of this Forest the Underwood of the several Coppices is cut in Rotatiou, at Twenty-one Years Growth; and after each Cutting the Coppices are inclosed, so as to exclude the Commonable Cattle of the Forest for Nine Years, but the Deer are admitted into them Two Years sooner, by Means of Creeps and Deer Leaps made in the Fences. At the End of Nine Years they are again thrown opeu, and so continue for the remaining Twelve Years, until the Period of cutting the Underwood returns.

The Owners or Occupiers of Lands in Six different Parishes, namely, Hartwell, , Piddington,

and Hackleton in Northa, and Hanslop in Bucks, claim a Right of Common of Pasture in the 93d Nov'. Forest^ from Old May Day to Martinmas*, for as many Horses and Cows as they can keep in Winter on their Lands, to which the Right is appendant. The Forest is cleared of Draught Horses and Milch Cows during the t Fromooth Fence Month')'; no Swine are admitted at any Time, June to 90th and when the Forest is surcharged by the Commoners, Jul>- or the Cattle of Strangers are found in it, the trespas-Appendix, sing Cattle are impounded in the Forest Pounds; and N®7. the Keepers take, for their own Use, Six Shillings and Eight Pence a Head for the Cattle impounded. The Commonable Cattle are admitted to feed with the Deer in the uninclosed Plains and Ridings, which

And in all the Coppices, for the last Twelve Years out of every Twenty-one Years, being the Time which intervenes between the cutting of the Coppices, as has- been already explained - 1,121 3 24

So that the Quantity of Land subject to Rights of Common at the Seasons, and under the Limitations before-

mentioned, is 1,592 3 21

The Forest of Salcey was made Part of the Honour of Grafton, erected or established by Act of Parliament 33 HeA.VIII. in the 33d Year of King Henry VIII. and during the Cap. 3S. Time that the Coppices continued in the actual Possession of the Crown the Underwood was cut and sold, from Time to Time, by the Woodward of the County, by virtue of Warrants from the Lord Treasurer or Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Profits accounted for to the King’s Use.

30 June, In the 17th Year of King Charles II. this Forest, 17Cha.lI. together with the Forest of was settled on

Queen Catherine for her Life, as Part of her Jointure, reserving all the Timber Trees and Sapling? for the Use of the Crown.

7

And in the 25th Year of that King, the several 91 June, Coppices, Woods, Underwoods, and Wood Lands, «5 Cha. II. in both those Forests, were granted to Henry Earl of 1673* Arlington, for the Term of his Life, after the Decease of the Queen, and after his Death to Henry Earl of Euston (afterwards Duke of Grafton) Charles Earl of Southampton, and George Lord Fitzroy, otherwise Lord George Palmer, Sons of Charles II. and their respective Heirs Male for ever} “ Excepting all great Trees and “ Timber Trees, and all fair Saplings, growing, arising,

“ or increasing, in the said Coppices and Wood Lands,

“ to be reserved for Stadles, or Samplers, and which “ should seem most fit and proper for Timber, according to the Form of the Statute in that Case “ made and provided; and also except all Herbage and Pannage of the said Coppices and Wood “ Lands.”

By virtue of this Grant, which commenced on the Death of the Queen Dowager*, in 1705, the Family De-of Grafton became entitled to, and now possess, the cember 170S* Underwood in the several Coppices, which after each Cutting are inclosed with a strong Hedge and Ditch, at the Expence of the Duke of Grafton, except in those Parts where the Fences of the Coppices form Part of the Outer Boundary of the Forest, the greatest Part of which is fenced by die Proprietors of the adjacent Lands, and the Residue with Posts and Rails, at the Expence of the Crown. The Right to the Underwood is the only Right which the Family of Grafton appear to have in Salcey Forest

In the 12th Year of King Charles II. that Office was

granted by Letters Patent to George of Hor-

ton, in the County of Northam, Esquire, and his Heirs Male, in Reversion of a Grant thereof to Robert Philips, Esquire, for his Life; with Power to appoint all Under Keepers, and other Under Officers, and to remove them at his Pleasure, together with a Yearly Fee or Allowance of £. 40; the Warden being charged fas the Patent expresses) with the Wages of a Lieutenant, Four Yeomen Keepers, and an inferior Keeper, called a Page.

Under this Patent, of which a Copy is given in the Appendix, the Office of Warden is now held by Mr. Montagu, who, as he informs us, is the last Heir Male of the original Grantee. In Right of that Office Mr. Montagu possesses the Great Lodge, which is a well built Prick House, and Offices, with Gardens and Pleasure Ground, and about 30 Acres of Meadow Land, inclosed for Hay, and Three inclosed Lawns, containing about 150 Acres, in which the Cattle of the Warden and his Deputy are admitted to depasture in Common with the Deer. The Warden’ also receives the Fee or Salary of £.40 per Annum, which was formerly paid out of the Produce of the Underwood, but since the Commencement of the Grant of the Coppices, on the Death of the Queen Dowager, has been paid at the Exchequer. He has also, by ancient Custom, One Acre of Underwood in each of the Coppices, every Time they are cut, which, with the Sale of the Lop of certain Trees, called Browse Trees, set apart for cutting Browse Wood for the Sustenance of the Deer in hard Weather, produces about £. 80 a Year; and out of these the Warden pays the Lieutenant or Deputy Warden, and Keepers, the Salaries and Allowances hereafter mentioned.

The Number of Deer kept in this Forest is about f,oooo, of all Sorts; and the Number killed Annually is about Twenty-eight Brace of Bucks, and Twenty-four of Does; of which Four Bucks and Four Does are supplied for the Use of His Majesty’s Household, in pursuance of Warrants from the Board of Green Cloth; and Six Bucks and Six Does (more or less, as the Forest is able to supply) are killed under Warrants from the Cofferer’s Office, or Clerk of the Venison Warrants, for the Use of the Public Offices, and others accustomed to have Venison from the Royal Forests. Besides these the Verderors of the Forest, the Chief Justice in Eyre, and his Secretary, and the Surveyor General of the Woods, have each a Fee Buck and Doe yearly; the Deputy Warden Six Bucks and Six Does; and each of the Three Yeomen Keepers One Brace of Bucks and One of Does. The Residue are disposed of by the Warden.

The Lieutenant or Deputy Warden has a general

Care of the Forest, under the Warden. When in the Seventh Forest he resides at the Great Lodge. His Salary is

£. 20 a Year, paid by the Warden, and he receives ----- ---- v- — <

certain Fees and Perquisites on killing Deer, besides the Fee Bucks and Does before mentioned. Also One Shilling in the Pound on the Sale of the Browse Wood, and of the Acre of Coppice Wood belonging to the Warden, with all Windfalls and dead Wood on the Lawn, and the Privilege of keeping Cattle on the Lawn; which Fees and Perquisites he estimates at Appendix, £ $0 a Year. N;8-

The Verderors in this, as in all other Forests, are MN* chosen by the Freeholders of the County. Their ’

Office is judicial, to preside at the Forest Courts, and to take Cognizance of all Trespasses relative to Vert and Venison. No Courts, however, are now held for this Forest; and Mr. Montagu informs us that none Appendix, have been held since he has been Ranger, nor, as N° 10. he believes, since the Rangership has been in his Family.

By the Custom of this Forest, every Verderor has Half an Acre of Underwood in each Coppice every Time it is cut, worth on an Average about Three Pounds per Annum to each Verderor. They have not any Salary or other Perquisite, except a Fee Buck and Fee Doe each, as before mention sd.

The Woodward for this Forest was formerly the Woodward General of all the King’s Woods in the Counties of Northampton and Rutland, and had an-tiently a Salary of Five Pounds per and a Per-

quisite of Twelve Pence in the Pound on all Wood Sales from the Buyers of the Wood, and a Fee of Four Pence for every Tree marked for Sale; but in the Year 1702 an additional Salary or Allowance of £. 30 a Year was allowed to the Woodward, in lieu of that Poundage; and in the Year 1756, when the Office of Woodward General became vacant, a separate Woodward was appointed for the Forest of Whit-tlewood, and the present Woodward, Mr. Thomas , was appointed Woodward of Salcey and Rockingham Forests, with a Salary of Five Pounds per Annum, an Allowance of £. 15 a Year in lieu of the Poundage on Wood Sales, and the Fee of Four Pence for every Tree marked for Sale. The Salary of Five Pounds is paid by Debenture, out of the Land Revenue; the Allowance of £. 15 a Year by the Surveyor General of the Woods, out of the Produce of Wood Sales; and the Fee of Four Pence per Tree by the Purchasers of the Wood.

The Three Keepers and Page Keeper have each a Lodge, and a certain Quantity of inclosed Land; and they state their Salaries, Allowances, and Emolument^ Appendix, to be as follows; vLd. 7«

L Srft The Surveyor General of the Woods has in this, as ^Report.'1'1* ’n the Forests, a general Superintendance, and , — J Care of the Timber, and the Execution of all Warrants for felling Timber for' the Navy, or for Sale, and performing Repairs, or any other Works done in the Forest, at the Charge of the Crown; and his Emoluments in this arc similar to those which have usually been received by that Officer from other Forests, ex-. cepting the Third Poundage of 5 Cent, on the Money arising from Wood Sales, which does not appear to have been retained in this Forest for the Surveyor General, as it was in those on which we have already reported. The Business of that Office is executed by a Deputy; and the present Deputy Sur-Appendix, V6y0r for this, as well as for Whittlewood Forest, is ia> Mr. Reuben Capes (One of the Keepers of Whittlewood, under the Duke of Grafton) whose Salary as Deputy Surveyor for both Forests is £. 25 per Annum, which is paid out of the Produce of Wood Sales: And it is worthy of Notice, as an Instance of the loose and irregular Manner in which the Business of that Department is conducted, that the Deputy Surveyor has at Two different Periods (viz1, from 178310 1787, and again in the present Year) taken a Poundage of 5 per Cent, for his own Use on the Sale of Offal Wood and Bark of Navy Timber, without Authority from his Principal, assigning as his Reason for it, that he had been promised an Increase of Salary, which had not been paid to him.

From the Account we have given, it appears that the Interest in this Forest, exclusive of the Rights of the Commoners, is divided between Three different Proprietors, viz1.The great Timber and Saplings belong to the Crown, under the Reservation in the Grant of the Coppices; the Underwood to the Duke of Grafton, by virtue of the same Grant; and the Lodges, Lawns, and (’are of the Deer, to Mr.

in consequence of his Office of Warden, Keeper, or Master Forester.

We have endeavoured to discover what the State of this Forest was in antient Times, before the Grants were made, by which this Mixture of Interests in the Timber and Underwood was created, when the Crown was the sole Proprietor of both; and what it has produced in Appendix later.Times, since the Date of those Grants; and we K* 13. ’ have found (among the Papers collected by Sir

Ciesar, one of the Ministers of King James I.) a Survey

of the Timber and Wood belonging to the Crown in the County of Northampton, taken in the Year 1608, by Men of respectable Character, acting under the Controul of the Earl of Exeter and the Lord Stanhope; from which it appeal's that there were at tlmt Time growing in this Forest 15,274 Timber Trees of Oak, then valued at £.11,951, besides 440 decaying Trees, valued at £.140. 13 s. 4 d. The Number of Loads of Timber is not mentioned in this Survey; but as we find, from other authentic Documents of the same Period, that the general Price of Oak Timber was then about 105. per Load, Girt Measure, the 15,274 Oak Trees which were valued at near 16$. each, must have contained, One with another, not less than a Load and a Half of Timber, or about 22,911 Loads, Girt Measure, which is equal to 34,366 Loads, Square Measure.

On a Survey taken in 1783, by Mr. Reuben , the Deputy Surveyor, under the Authority of the Surveyor General of the Woods and forests, in Obedience to an Order of the House of Commons, there were reported to be then in this Forest only 2,918 Oak Trees fit for the Navy (including all Trees down to 30 Feet of Timber) containing by Computation 3,745 Loads of Timber, Square Measure; and only 194 scrubbed, dotard, or defective Trees of above 30 Feet each, besides Browse Trees, of which there were 8,266 Oak Trees, containing by Computation 7,338 Loads of Timber, Square Measure, and 8,914 Browse Ashes; — so that the Timber fit for the Navy, according to this Survey, was little more than One-tenth Part of the Quantity fit for Naval Use glowing in this Forest in 1608. The annexed Statements of the Timber supplied from this Forest for the Navy, and of the Wood and Timber sold there for the Use of the Crown, since the Death of the Queen Dowager, when the Grantees of the Coppices entered into Possession, will shew that the small Stock of Timber, said to be remaining in 1783, is not accounted for by the felling of any great Quantities during the present Century; and, admitting that the Survey in 1783 may not have been taken with perfect Accuracy, and that the growing Timber may have been somewhat under-rated, no Error of that Kind can be supposed of such Magnitude, as to account for so extraordinary a Diminution.

On perusing the Accounts of the Surveyor General of the Woods, from the Death of the Queen Dowager to the End of the Year 1786, we find that the whole Produce of the Timber and Wood felled and sold in £. s. d. this Forest for the Use of the Crown, within that Time, amounts to the Sum of ... 6,447 3

At first Sight it must appear extraordinary, that so valuable a Property as the Timt>er and Trees of every Kind in a Forest of above 1,800 Acres Extent, the greatest Part of it Wood Land, fully planted, and the Soil the most excellent for the Growth of Oak, should have been so unproductive to the Proprietor; and that, at the same Time, the Stock of Timber remaining in the Forest should be so inconsiderable, in Comparison of w hat once was there; more especially as there are not in this Forest any other Charges to be defrayed out of the Produce of the Timber, than the Repairs of Four small Lodges for the Under Keepers, and of a moderate-sized Dwelling House for the Warden, the small Salary of £. 15 to the Woodward, and a Proportion of that to the Deputy Surveyor. In our Opinion, therefore, this can only be imputed to the ruinous Effects of a Mixture of opposite Interests in the same Property, and of the System of Management of the Royal Forests which has prevailed for many Years past

There cannot indeed be a stronger Proof of the bad Effects of that System, than what arises from the vast Number of Oak Trees lopped for Browse Wood; and we know from the Information of Mr. John the Officer employed by the Navy Board to take the Charge of the Navy Timber in and

Forests, that some of the Browse Trees are very large and sound Trees, fit for the Service of the Navy. The Waste and Spoil of Timber, occasioned by the lopping of so many Trees for Browse, far beyond what Can be necessary for the Sustenance of the Deer in this small Forest, is obviously owing to the present Mode of paying the Salaries of the Lieutenant and Keepers, which are defrayed by the Warden, chiefly from the Sale of Browse Wood. This wasteful Practice, we think it necessary to observe, has not been introduced, nor has the Number of Browse Trees been increased, by the present Warden; but, at the same Time, we think it our Duty to remark, that the cutting of Browse Wood, beyond what is absolutely necessary for the Support of the Deer, does not appear to be authorized by the Terms of the Patent under which that Office is held, and by which the Patentee engaged to pay the Wages of the Lieutenant and Keepers, in Consideration of the Allowance of £. 40 a Year; and if the Patentee has now a Right to cut Browse Wood, in order to raise a Fund for the Payment of those Salaries, it must have been acquired by long Usage only.

Among the Privileges belonging to the Warden or Deputy Warden, our Surveyor enumerates that of cutting Bushes and Underwood, in the Plains, open Ridings, and Lawns in the Forest, which contain about 650 Acres. The Exercise of this Privilege must ever prevent a Succession of young Trees in these Parts of the Forest, where, being constantly exposed to Injuries from the Deer and (battle, none can possibly grow up but under the Protection of the Bushes; and accordingly we find that there are a few Oak limber Trees, Ash Pollards, and Bushes growing the re, but no young Saplings of any Kind.

Ihe. Office of Surveyor of the Woods, as at present Vol. 46. F

Constituted, the Nature of its Perquisites, and the #

Mode of executing the Business of that Department, are additional Causes of Waste and Expence. Ihe Poundage of 5 per Cent, on all Monies coming to the See Reports, Hands of the Surveyor General, and another Pound- 6 3,5,au age of 5 per Cent, on the Expenditure of those Monies, make it for the Interest of that Officer to fell the Timber, and to promote and enhance the Expence of Repairs and Works in the Forests. — The Whole of the actual Business in the Forests being transacted by Deputies, and those Deputies not acting upon Oath; the Sales of the Wood and Timber being wholly under their Direction, without any adequate Check or Controul; and those Deputies, in many Instances (as appears by our former Reports) the Buyers of the Wood and Timber sold by themselves; the Works and Repairs being either performed by them, or by Workmen of their Appointment, upon Estimates of their own forming; and neither those Estimates made on Oath, nor the Works afterwards surveyed, or the Accounts sworn to, by those who transact the Business, though the Surveyor General himself is accountable on Oath, must leave the Whole entirely dependant on the personal Integrity of an Individual, who is neither from Rank or Situation, or the fair Emoluments of Office, placed above the Temptation of ordinary Corruption; and yet this Officer is the only one who has any special Charge of the growing Timber in the Forests.

The Stools or Roots of the Trees felled, which unquestionably belong to the Crown, are here taken by the Keepers: the Value of them, when dug up, is from One Shilling to Five or Six Shillings each — One Half Appendix, of which is allowed for the Labour of raising the m. l'2-In a large Fall of Timber this Article might be worth Attention. In Nerv Forest the Roots of Trees are sold and brought to Account, under the Title of Moor Wood; but the Deputy Surveyor of this Forest, whose Duty it is to attend to the Interests of the Crown there, is One of the Keepers of JVhittlezoooo Forest, as his Father, the late Deputy Surveyor, was for many Years before, and One of those who turn this Article to their own Emolument.

To any one who considers the natural Tendency of such a System of Management, it cannot be surprising that any Property whatever should not prove very productive.

The Soil of this Forest appears to be peculiarly Appendix, adapted to the Growth of large Timber; as a Proof of which may he mentioned, that there is One antient 3. ’ Oak Tree 17 Yards in Circumference; and the Trees in general are larger and longer than those in the neighbouring Forest of ll’hittk‘.wood:But the Underwood here is of much less Value, the Land being cold and wet, and lying very flat. The Succession of young Timber in this Forest is, comparatively, very small, chiefly owing to the great Quantity of Browse Trees, which, in 1783, were no less than 17,580, of Oak and Ash, being more than double the Number of all the other Trees in tire Forest, down to Saplings apd Storers of Tw’o Feet each.

It was probably owing to the Distance of this:

den should take Place until such an Arrangement has been made respecting the Property of the Timber and Underwood, and the Rights of the Commoners, as shall fie found expedient and practicable.

In forming an Opinion what Measures it would then be most adviseable for the Public to adopt, there are various Circumstances which merit Consideration.

We are sensible, that under the best Plan of Management which can be devised, the Care and uniform Protection which a Nursery of Timber requires will always be found more difficult, and mpre expensive in any Situation to the Public, than to a private Proprietor; and if it were certain, that a regular Supply of Timber for the Use of the Navy could be obtained from private Estates in this Country, we should think it for the Advantage of the Public to sell the Whole of the Forests, and invest the Price in the Public Funds, instead of attempting the Improvement of any of them by its own Officers and Servants. It is the concurring Information which we have hitherto received

1

See Pag* 97*

of a gradual Decrease in tl*e Quantity of growing Timber, the Prospect of a Scarcity, and the Danger of depending upon other Countries for the Support of our Navy, which alone could induce us to recommend that Government should undertake what we know to be so difficult, as the Management, Protection, and Improvement of Woods and Timber: But since there is Cause to apprehend a Scarcity, and that this Measure is therefore become highly expedient and necessary, it is extremely desirable that t!»e Forests to be retained by the Crown, and improved by its owu Officers, should be such as are possessed of every natural Advantage, in Point of Soil, Situation, and Extent, to make up for the Disadvantages attending public Management, so as that die Timber may cost as little to the Public as possible: They should be of such Extent as to make it worth while to employ proper Officers in them, dependant ou the Office of Forests and Navy Board, to form Checks on the Conduct of each other; they ought to be few hi Number, and situated conveniently for Carriage to the Dock Yards, that the Expeoce of conveying the Timber way be moderate, and that they may be visited often, and without much Expeoce, by principal Officers in those Departments, and the State and Condition in which they are preserved, made known by their Reports to those Offices, to the Treasury Board, and to Parliament.

The Forests which were the Subject of our former Reports enjoy those Advantages; and we therefore gave it as our Opinion, that they should be kept in the Possession of the Crown. The Forest of Salcey is in some Respects different, and does not possess aH those Advantages. The Distance of the Forest from the Dock Yards, and from any navigable Iliver, as we have before observed, is so considerable, that the Carriage of the Timber has been hitherto no less than £3. i8j. per Load, notwithstanding the Precaution taken by the Officers of the Navy Board to lessen the Expence, by squaring and converting the Timber in the Forest; and though that Expence may probably be lessened in future, by Means of the new Canal before mentioned, yet, according to the best Calculation we are enabled to make, the Carnage w ill still be more expensive than from the Forest of Dean, New Forest, or Aliceholt. The Extent of this Forest is also not so great as we think desirable in a Forest to be retained and improved by the Crown; and there will still be a Mixture of Rights in it, even after the Grant of the Wardenship shall expire, while the Duke of Grafton retains the Property of the Underwood; but, on the other Hand, the Soil of this Forest is found to be peculiarly adapted to the Growth of great Oak Timber, the Trees there rising to such a Size, as to furnish the principal Pieces necessary in the Construction of our largest Ships, now very difficult to be procured, and which few Soils are capable of producing in an equal Degree.

Under these Circumstances, we humbly think it would be adviseable, when the Wardenship of the Forest shall revert to the Crown, that Endeavours should be used to effect a Settlement with those having Right of Common in the Forest, by which they should agree to permit the Coppices to continue a longer Time inclosed, in Consideration that the Deer should be either wholly removed from the Forest, or confined entirely to tho Lawns, or some other Part which can be kept constantly inclosed: Aud in this Case Power might be given to Commissioners appointed by the Crown and the Commoners, to determine what dumber of Years, added to the present Term of Inclosure, would bean Equivalent for removing the Deer: And we think it would also be adviseable to tnake an Offer either to transfer to the Family of Grafton all the remaining Rights of the Crown there, on Condition of delivering an adequate Quantity of Timber Annually Vox,. 46.

for the Use of the Navy, of such Dimensions and Descriptions as this Forest may be expected to produce; or to purchase from that Family the Right to the Underwood, if they shall be disposed to part with it on reasonable Terms, so as to put an End to that Mixture of Rights, which not only prevents the full Improvement of Property, but introduces Waste, and renders the Management more expensive and difficult.

If either of the Proposals for an Arrangement w ith the Duke of Grafton shall be adopted, the Quantity of the Timber to be delivered Annually for the Navy, in Return for the Rights to be transferred to the Duke of Grafton, and all the Conditions necessary in such ao Agreement, or, on the other Hand, the Price to be paid by the Crown for the Right to the Underwood, may be determined by Treaty, or settled by Commissioners 01* Arbitrators, to he appointed by the Crown and the Duke of Grafton.

If the Plan of accepting a stipulated Quantity of Naval Timber, in lieu of the present Rights of the Crown, shall be preferred, we apprehend it would be necessary, in order to ensure a permanent Succession of Timber in that Forest, and render it capable of yielding the Annual Supply, that the Grantee or Purchaser should be restrained from converting any of the Wood Lands into Tillage or Pasture; ffiat he should be bound to leave standing a certain Number of the most thriving Standils or Saplings of Oak, on every Acre of the Coppices, and to preserve them from Spoil; and that the Forest should be visited often by an Inspector or Surveyor from the Office of Forests, to see that those Conditions are duly complied with; that no Oak Tree whatever should lie cut, except in Barking Season, and that during that Time a Purveyor, or Officer from the Navy Board, together with an Inspector or Surveyor from the Office of Forests, should attend, the former to see that the Timber to be rendered to the Public be made up of that Sort of the Year’s Falling which is best adapted for the Service of the Navy, and both of them as a Check on the felling too great a Quantity in any One Season, in Proportion to the Stock remaining for the future Supply; and, with this View, all the Trees proposed to he felled in each Season, as well for the Use of the Grantee as for the Public, should be set out in the Presence, and with the Approbation, of those Officers, and marked with both their Hammers; and proper Penalties should he enacted to enforce the Observance of those Conditions. Such Clauses w’ould not only in our Opinion be necessary for securing the Supply for the Navy from this Forest, but, we have Reason to believe, would be particularly desired by the Duke of Grafton himself, as a Security against the Danger of the Timber being improvidently and profusely cut by any future Proprietor, to the Prejudice of his Successors; from the Apprehension of which Danger his Grace has expressed some Objections to this Proposal.

By Means of such an Arrangement, the Two Objects which we have constantly in View, of patting an End to that Mixture of Rights so prejudicial to the Improvement of all Property, and of providing a Supply of Timber of the most valuable Kind for the Navy, would both be attained; while the Disadvantages attending the Cultivation of Timber by the Officers of the Crown, in a Forest rather too remote, and of too limited an Extent, would be avoided.

But if instead of this Plan, the purchasing of the Underwood shall meet the Approbation of the Crown and the Duke of Grafton, such Regulations should be established as may be necessary both to secure to the Crown the full Benefit of the Underwood, though a secondary and inferior Object, and to provide effectually for the future Growth and Preservation of Timber in this Forest.

To this End we would advise that as the Coppices

Seventh Land Revenue Report.

----- v ----- '

The Underwood in the Coppices cannot rightfully be cut, except at Twenty-one Years Growth. On the Cutting of the Coppices, the second-best Acre of the Underwood in every Coppice is set apart for the Ranger; and the Two next best Half Acres (One each) to the Two Verderors. The Remainder is the Property of his Grace the Duke of Grafto, by virtue of a Grant from the Crown.

When a Coppice has gone ' to Sale, it is inclosed with a strong Hedge and Ditch, made at the Expence of his Grace the Duke of on such Parts as

are not the Outer Boundary of the Forest. If an Outer Boundary, it is inclosed mostly with Posts and Rails, at the Expence of the Crown. This Hedge is continued Seven Years, in order that the Underwood and Saplings may grow out of the Reach of the Deer arid Cattle. Then there are Creeps made in the Hedges, of a proper Size, to admit the Deer, and exclude the Cattle, for the next Two Years; at which Time the Hedge is entirely taken away, and the Common Cattle are admitted for the remaining Twelve Years. When the Underwood is cut, the Timber is felled for the Use of the Royal Navy, and the dotard and decayed Timber for the Repairs and Ring Mounds, which last are not extensive, most of the Boundary Fence belonging to the adjoining Proprietors. The Coppice is then inclosed again as before, so that the Deer and Commonable Cattle are maintained in the Coppices when open, and on those Plains and Ridings that are never inclosed.

Amongst the Underwood in most of the Coppices are abundantly interspersed Oak and Ash Trees of all Sizes, and but very few Trees of any other Kind. These are reserved to the Crown.

The Soil is well adapted to the Growth of Oaks, which upon the Whole are longer and larger here than in Whittlewood Forest; and the Timber harder and

better for the Service, with this Difference, that as many of the Oaks are lopped when young, it often occasions Defects in the old Knots. There is a greater Quantity of Browse Trees, in Proportion to the Size of the Forest, here than at Whittlewood, which may be One Means of rendering the Succession of Saplings not so numerous, nor the Quantity of Maiden Oaks so great.

There are many Oaks growing on the Lawn, which having been considered as ornamental Timber, are for the most Part become very antient and unserviceable; One Oak in particular, which is now quite hollow, is Seventeen Yards in Circumference.

The present Mode of Land Carriage of the Timber from this Forest is long and expensive, being to the River Lea, at Hartford, near 50 Miles; and takes a Journey of Four Days, Two going and Two returning. The Carriage might be shortened, by conveying the Timber when the Roads are good to Tmccester, about Eight Miles from whence there is a Turnpike Road to Aynhoe Wharf. By this Conveyance the Land Carriage would be only Half the present Distance.

The Answer of the Right honourable Frederick Montagu, Ranger or Warden of the Forest of Salcey, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated December the 7th,

1789.

The Office which I hold in Salcey Forest is that of Ranger or Warden, which is hereditary. I hold it by virtue of a Grant from King Charles the IP to my Great Grandfather George , of Hot'ton, in

Northamptonshire, and his Heirs Male. I am. the last of the Heirs Male of the Family. I receive a Salary of Forty Pounds per Annum from the Exchequer, ana about Eighty Pounds, on an Average, every Year from the Sale of Browse Wood. I have a convenient

Lodge,

31 Geo* III.

17° Decemb.

Lodge, but out of Repair, good Stables, Two small Gardens, and an Inclosure of about Two hundred Acres round my Lodge, Thirty Acres of which is fenced in for Hay. I appoint a Deputy Ranger, Three Keepers, and One Under Keeper. I pay Twenty Pounds per Annum to the Deputy Ranger. The Payments I make to the Keepers and Under Keeper, taken together, amount to about Sixty Pounds per Annum. I receive no Annual Rents, or other Sums of Money, for the Use of the Crown. I make no Disbursements but the Sums I pay to the Deputy Ranger and Keepers. I have some Fuel for the Use of my Lodge from the Forest, but to no considerable Value. There are about One thousand Two hundred Rucks and Does in the Forest: I kill Annually, on an Average, about Ninety. I supply the King’s Larder Warrants, the Cofferer's Warrants, those of the Verderors, and the Chief Justice in Eyre, and Compensations to the neighbouring Landholders, on Account of the Damage done by the Deer. The rest I have for my Use, and that of my Friends. No Com or Hay are purchased for the Deer. No Intrusions or Encroachments, Spoil or Waste of Timber, or any Abuses injurious to the Rights of the Crown in this Forest, have come to my Knowledge. The Forest of Salcey supplies the King with Venison, the Navy with Timber, and the adjacent Villages with Fuel, under proper Restrictions. It is not in my Power to suggest any more particular Improvements.

To the R* honbl* Sidney Earle of Ld

May it please your Lordship,

In Obedience to your Lordship’s Reference on the Petition of George Montague, Esq; I have perused the

G randfather, George Mountague, of , in the County

of Northton. Esq; and the Heires Male of his Body (in Reversion of a Grant of the Premises then lately made to Robert Philips, Esq; for his Life); and because the Warden is in this Grant charged with the Wages and Fees to a Lieutenant, Four Yeoman Keepers, and One Page Keeper, therefore he hath a Fee of Forty Pounds per Ann. allowed him to be detayned in his owne Hands, or paid by the Recr out of the Profits of the said Forest, or else out of the Exchequer, by the Lord High Trear or Lords Com'* of the Treary for the Time being.

This Forest, together with that of Whittlewood adjacent, having been settled on the Queen Dowager for her Life, I searched with her Officers, and found the Forty Pounds above-mentioned was Annually paid out of a Rent of Two hundred Pounds a Year, reserved on a Lease of the Woods, and Copices in the said Forests; but those Woods and Copices being granted away to his Grace the Duke of Grafton, and having advised with the Surveyor of the Woods, who hath wrote to his DepT on the Spott, and not finding (tho’ there is an Exception of Timber in the said Duke’s Grant) any certain Profits arising Annually to her Matie in this Forest, whereout the Pet1 may be paid his Salary, since Queen Dowager’s Death, (a Year at Michas last, as ’tis alleaged) and as it growes due for the future, 1 am humbly of Opinion the Pet* may reasonably be paid the same out of the Exchequer.

All which is humbly submitted

to your Lordship’s great Wisdom.

Tl»e Examination of Reuben Capes, Deputy to the Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests, for the Forests of JVhittl and Salcey; taken on Oath, the 10th Day of December 1790.

This Examinant was appointed Deputy or Agent to the Surveyor General for the Forests of JVhittlewood and Salcey, by John Pitt, Esquire, late Surveyor General, about Twenty Years ago, on the Death of his Father, who was Deputy Surveyor for several Years before. He had no written Deputation or Appointment, only a verbal Direction from Mr. Pitt to execute the Business as his Father had done. He was not sworn into the said Office at that Time or since. His Salary as Deputy Surveyor is Twenty-five Pounds a Year without Deduction, which is retained by him out of Monies coming to his Hands on Account of Wood Sales. He received no Perquisite whatever besides that Salary before the Year 1784; but Mr. Pitt having, in the Year 1783, promised to allow him an additional Salary, and not coming to a Settlement with him, he took a Poundage of One Shilling in the Pound, on the Price of the Lop, Top, and Offal Wood, of the Timber felled for Naval Purposes only, in both the said Forests, from 1784 to 1787, both inclusive, which Poundage amounted, on an Average of those Four Years, to Eighteen Pounds One Shilling and Six Pence per Annum, or thereabouts. In the Years 1788 and 1789 he took no Poundage whatever, being told by the present Surveyor General that an Increase of Salary would be allowed to him; but not receiving any such Allowance, he took the like Poundage again, last Spring, on the Sale of the Offal Wood of the Navy Timber, and no other. The Poundage that Year amounted to near Thirty Pounds, as well as he can

state from Memory. He had hot any Direction from the Surveyor General to take such Poundage on either of those Occasions.

His Business as Deputy Surveyor is to pay the Keepers and other Officers of JVhittlewood Forest their Usual Salaries and Allowances, specified in the Account hereto annexed, amounting to Two hundred and Seventy-eight Pounds Six Shillings per Annum; and to perform any Repairs or other Works to be done in the Forest at the Charge of the Crown; to fell and make Sale of Wood and Timber for those Purposes; and to fell Timber for the Use of the Navy, and sell the Offal Wood and Bark thereof.

A Fall of Timber is made every Year in Forest for paying the Salaries, under a Warrant issued, as he believes, about the Beginning of His Majesty’s Reign. The Trees to be felled for that Purpose, as well as those felled by Warrant for defraying the Expence of Repairs, and for, the Use of the Navy, in both Forests, are selected and marked by the Deputy Surveyor in the Presence of the Woodwards of the respective Forests, or some Person appointed by them to attend with their Hammers, and of the Keepers of the respective Walks. No Trees are felled without being previously marked with the Woodward’s Hammer.

For several Years before the Death of the late Surveyor General, Two Justices of the Peace attended on the marking of the Trees for the Navy, that being required by the Treasury Warrants; which Warrants, or Copies of them, were then usually sent to the Deputy Surveyor; but since that Time no Justices have attended, the Warrants not being sent to the Deputy, and no Orders given to him to desire their Attendance; and no Justice of Peace ever attended on the marking of the Trees to be sold.

The Navy Purveyor (who resides at about a Quarter of a Mile from JVhittlewood Forest) attends on the marking of the Navy Timber, when Notice is given to him for (hat Purpose. He was not present at the marking of any of the Timber last Year, not being sent to by this Examinant, who had no Directions to send to him. His Orders from the Surveyor General were to make a Return of the Trees which he thought proper to be felled in the Coppices which came in course of cutting that Season, in Two Classes, one to contain such Trees as he thought fit for the Service of the Navy, and the other the Trees unfit for that Use; which was accordingly.done by him, assisted by his Son Arthur Capes, and one John a Timber Valuer, employed by him. He afterwards received Orders from the Surveyor General to fell the Trees comprized in those Returns; and when they were felled, and such as be and his Assistants had returned as fit for Naval Use were set out, Notice was given to the Navy Purveyor to attend to examine the same, and to accept or refuse them as he should think fit. The rest of the Timber felled that Season was sold as usual. The Purveyor was not desired to view it, and no Part of it was offered to his Choice for the Use of the Navy.

As soon as the Navy Timber is felled and stripped, the Purveyor views the same, and when he has made Choice of such as he thinks proper for the Navy, he marks the Places where the Tops and Offal Wood not fit for the Service are to be cut off, which is done by Persons employed by the Deputy Surveyor. The Timber so chosen is next hewed or squared, and i9 then measured with Callipers by the Purveyor, and Deputy Surveyor, each taking an Account of the Quantity thereof in Square Measure, which is certified by she Purveyor to the Navy Board, and by this Examinant to the Surveyor General; to whom he has heard the Price of One Pound and Eighteen Shillings per Load is paid by the Navy Board according to Such Admeasurement; and that Quantity is then delivered into the Charge of the Purveyor, under whose Direction (in order to save Expence in the Carriage) it is sawed and converted into proper Forms for Naval Use

And the Slabs, and other Parts Works done in the Forest, are a like Poundage on the not lit for that Use, are sold by him in the Country. Salaries of all the Forest Officers, except those of The Tops, Offal Wood, and Bark, are sold by the the Page Keepers, on which it was also formerly taken.

All the Trees cut in the said Forests, whe- in Consideration of the Smallness of their Salaries, ther for the Navy, or otherwise, arc felled under the and has not been taken since. Such old Materials of Orders of this Examinant, and paid for by him; the Buildings and Fences as cannot be worked up again, are Expence of felling is from Eight Pence to Sixteen Pence sold for Firewood, and accounted for to the Surveyor per Tree, for Navy Timber and other large Trees, and General: They are of very small Value. No Poundage about One Shilling in the Pound on the Value for is taken on Wood Sales of any Kind for the Surveyor

General.

The Underwood in the Coppices is cut at Twenty-one Years Growth; they are then inclosed with a high Hedge on a Bank at the Expence of the Duke of

smaller Trees. The Stools or Roots of the Navy Trees (which being cut with a Saw close to or within the Ground, are found very rarely to shoot again so as to produce either Underwood or young Trees) are grubbed by the Keepers, and sold, he does not know , and remain inclosed for Nine Years from

by what Authority, or what may be the Value thereof Deer and Cattle. The Hedge is then taken up, and to other Keepers, nor what may be the Value of such either sold or used as Fuel by the Keepers, to whom it as he takes as Keeper of Shrob Walk, reckoning by is allowed as a Perquisite by the Duke of Grafton, the the Year, never having taken up any till this present Proprietor of the Underwood. In /Forest Year, but his Agreement for taking them up is to give each Keeper has the Management and Sale of the One Half of the Value to the Labourers, who raise the Underwood in his particular Walk for the Duke of Root and smooth the Ground; and he believes the same , accounting for the Produce to his Steward,

is paid by others, and the whole Value of each Root, In Salcey Forest the Underwood is managed and sold when grubbed, he believes, may be from One Shilling by Mr. John Keeper of Walk,

to Five or Six Shillings. in Whittlewood Forest. When a Copse goes to Sale it

The Sales of Timber and Bark in these Forests is divided into Cuts of Two Poles wide and Ten during the Time of the late Surveyor General were Poles long each, which Cuts are numbered and valued cried in the Market Towns nearest to the Forest, about by the Agents of the Duke of Grafton, and sold to the

Fourteen Days before the Sales. And the Timber and Bark being previously valued by the Deputy Surveyor and other Valuers, the Timber was divided into Lots and sold, by private Contract from One Shilling and Two Pence, and One Shilling per Foot Girt Measure, down to Eight Pence and Six Pence per Foot and the Bark was sold sometimes by the Tree, and sometimes by a Pound Rate on the Value of the Timber, from Two Shillings and Nine Pence

neighbouring People at various Prices, according to the Goodness of the Underwood. Public Notice is given at the Sales that no Saplings or Single Oak Plants are to be cut by the Buyers of the Underwood, on Pain of such Punishment as the Law directs. The Single Oak Plants are not marked, but where there are none such this Examinant marks the most thriving Shoots from the Stools of Oak and Ash Trees to stand for Timber, which are found by Expe-

to about Four Shillings and Nine Pence in the Potind, rience to produce very good sound Timber, except

both according to their Age and Quality, to any Person willing to give the Prices at which they were valued. Since the Death of the late Surveyor General, the Sales have been made by public Auction, advertised at least a Fortnight, but generally Three Weeks, before the Time of Sale; the Timber and Bark being previously valued in Lots as before. This Examinant, or his Son, . have usually acted as the Auctioneers on such Sales, though not sworn or licensed as Auctioneers. The

sometimes a small Defect at the But, of no Detriment to the Timber when cut of Some Parts of the Underwood are worth Eight Pounds an Acre and upwards, some not more than Three Pounds, but the Average Value he believes to be about Five Pounds an Acre. The Underwood in Shrobb Walk, which is constantly inclosed, not being subject to any Right of Common, and from which the Deer have been removed about Sixteen Years, is of thicker Plant in general than in

Keepers of the Walks in which the Coppices lie attend the other Walks, but in many Parts, from Want of at the Sales, and Two Men called in by the Exami- Air, does not grow so strong, but upon the Whole 'he nant to assist at the Sale certify the Accounts; and this believes it is of more Value by the Acre by at least Examinant accounts Once a Year with the Surveyor Twenty Shillings, and a much greater Quantity of General for all his Receipts and Disbursements as young Timber springs up there than in the open

Deputy Surveyor.

No Timber is felled in the said Forest for Repairs without a Warrant from the Treasury. When any Repairs are wanting, the Lord Warden, or the Lieutenant of the Forest where the Works are to be done, applies to the Treasury; and when this Examinant receives Orders from the Surveyor General to send an Estimate of such Repairs, be employs Workmen to make Estimates thereof, and returns the same (signed by himself and such Workmen) to the Surveyor Ge- Proportion to its Extent, in Salcey, than in;

neral; and when a Warrant is issued for executing the the Falls for the Navy not having been there begun so Works, he employs any Workmen that he thinks fit many Years ago. For the last Three Seasons after the to perform the same, oversees the Execution thereof Coppices then cut have been cleared of the Underwood, himself, and pays the Workmen’s Bills, deducting One an Account has been taken, by Order of the Surveyor

Coppices of the Forest. The Acorns which fall in the Years when the Copses are open are generally picked up and eaten by the Deer, and the young Oaks called Wavers much injured by cropping both by the Deer and Cattle. The Underwood in Salcey forest is not so good as in Whittlewood, owing, as he believes, to the Quality and Condition of the Land, which is cold, flat, and wet, and not near so well drained as the other Forest. There is more large Timber, in

Shilling in the Pound for the Surveyor General. He employs other Workmen when he thinks it necessary to measure such Parts of the Works as are done by Measure. No Survey is taken of them by any other Person. The Estimates are not made upon Oath, and the Accounts are not sworn to by the Workmen or Deputy Surveyor. "

as before described.

All the Oak Trees used as Browse Trees in wood Forest are very old. Many worn-out Browse Oaks have been cut down for Sale, but no other Oak Trees have been cut or set out for Browse Trees within his Memory. In Salcey Forest the Keepers used to lop for Browse what they thought fib until about Twenty Years ago, when Mr. Cross, a Navy Purveyor, surveyed and marked all the Navy Timber then in both Forests; since which no Oak Trees not browsed before have been cut in Salcey for Browse, except about Twenty or Thirty set out by the Woodward and this Examinant, about Twenty Years ago: He had not any Order from the Surveyor General for so doing; and though they were so set out he does not know whether they were afterwards cut for Browse or not; but in both Forests Ash Trees of all Ages and Sizes are lopped and browsed by the Keepers at their Discretion. The Number of Browse Trees is much greater in Salcey, in Proportion to its Extent, than in fVhittlewood Forest, and the Wood, after being browsed try the Deer, is sold towards paying the Keepers Salaries; but the Browse Trees are in general not near so large as those in fVhittlewood. The Quantity of Browse cut in fVhittlewood is not sufficient for the Support of the Deer, which in Wakefield, Hazleborough, and Shot-brook Walks, are foddered with Hay, and in most of the Walks some Deer perish Yearly from Want. No Browse Wood is sold in WhittlewForest, the Keepers take it for their Firing, and some of them find it not sufficient for their Use, and are obliged to buy more. This Examinant lops the same Trees in Shrobb Walk which were browsed while Deer were kept there, but they do not produce a sufficient Quantity of Wood for

his Fuel, and he is some Years obliged to buy more for his Use. An Oak Tree is not fit for browsing oftener than once in Twenty Years, even when the Tree is in Health and Vigour; but when very old not fit for browsing oftener than once in Thirty or Forty Years. An Ash may be browsed once in every Ten Years. The largest Wood cut for browsing is about the Thickness, as he believes, of a Man’s Arm, but in general not thicker than a Man’s Wrist.

The Bushes in the Lawns, Ridings, and Open Quarters, within Wakefield Walk, are cut by Order of the Duke of Grafton, and made into Faggots chiefly for the Use of his Brick Kiln. In the other Walks they are cut by the Keepers for Fuel, bui the Quantity is inconsiderable.

This Examinant is of Opinion, that the Proportion of the Pasture of the Commonable Lands and Coppices in the Forest, consumed by the Deer, is about One Half; and that the Common Cattle consume the other Half, as nearly as he can estimate. The Stock of Deer is considerably increased within his Memory, but he cannot say in what Proportion. The Number of Cattle depasturing in the Forest, he thinks, is rather less of late Years than formerly.

The Purposes to which the Underwood sold in the Forest is applied are chiefly for Fuel and Hedging. Some small Quantity is used for making Rails and Hurdles. The Price of Underwood has increased more than One Third within his Memory, and still increases, partly owing to the lessening of the Quantity, by the converting some Wood Lands in the Neighbourhood of the Forest into Tillage and Pasture Land; but more owing, as he believes, to an Increase of the Number of Inhabitants, and a greater Demand for it. The Price of Timber is also increased within his Memory, but not in so great a Proportion. The Quantity of great Timber in that Part of the Country is much less now than within his Remembrance. In some Woods belonging to private Owners in that Neighbourhood there is a good Succession of young Timber; but in many Woods very few Storers are left, and he thinks there is Reason to believe, that if the Woods in these Forests belonged to private Persons, the present Stock of Timber would be cut down, and very little Timber raised there in future, the Underwood producing more Profit, and a quicker Return.

Copies of Two Letters from Mr. to

the Commissioners of the Land Revenue*

Potterspury, near Stony Sir, Bucks, 20th April 1787.

In dutiful Obedience to the Orders in your Letter dated the 16th, I shall take great Care to obey their Honours Commands, praying Leave to know if I am to mark, or hammer-stamp, the Trees that are to be left standing, and if I am to notice those in the adjoining Riding, &c. humbly thinking the Trees mentioned Dotard, is signifying what is here called Browse Trees, whereof there is many in these Copses and Riding adjoining. Some are much decayed, and the others are in a full-grown State for falling, and will never be better by standing, and appear very sound, useful, large Trees for the Navy, which I have often mentioned when marking the Navy Timber Falls in the different Copses these Ten Years past, and not any was granted to be felled for the Navy. I humbly pray to know if those appearing sound are to be left standing, or felled for the Navy, as they never will be better. In humble Obedience, praying their Honours Commands, am,

Sir,

Your most obedient

very humble Servant,

John Fordyce, Esq; John Collinridge.

Land Revenue Office.

Honourable Sir,

In Obedience to your Letter of the 30th past, I have consulted and considered the Propriety of the Soil for the Growth of Oak Timber in and Salcey Forests, and from all Observations and Remarks thereon, I think it’s in general as proper Soil as can be for the Growth and Produce of good Oak Timber; and in course of 105 to 130 Years Oak Timber would there grow to a Size fit for Navy Purposes, as Trees fit for Plank and thick Stuff becomes fit for the Navy in less than 100 Years, and never more fit for those Purposes, being then in Strength and sound Condition, and would not become of more Size or Strength by standing longer; and some Trees may require 150 Years to grow for the Uses of the principal large Pieces for Ships of the Rate of 90 and 100 Guns; and it’s a great Pity Timber should stand longer than its proper Strength and Growth, to decay and become unfit for the Service, as is too often the Case; and in this Forest of Whittlewood Part has stood for a great Number of Years longer than its Growth, and become perished and decayed, and unfit for Service; which Trees, if felled at a proper Growth, and others planted in their Stead, would produce a Growth of young Timber for Service when wanted; and in many Copses in these Forests there’s very few Trees, and some scarce any, where might have been a great Number of Oak Trees now growing, if planted, many Years past. The Navy Timber bought at £.1. 18. a Load is delivered at His Majesty’s Yard full as cheap as any Timber bought of the Merchants; and if those Trees of the same Size were sold on the Spot; by Auction, to

the best Bidder, it’s a Doubt if they would fetch more Money than sold to the Navy at £ 1. 18. per Load, by Reason the Timber sold to the Navy is measured Square Measure, and that to the Country Girt Measure (at about One Shilling a Foot) which reduces it above One Fourth in Measure from the Navy Measure; and was a great Quantity to be disposed of to the Country, it would not fetch (the Quality equal as good) the Price, as when a few Trees are for Sale, as the Country Demand might not require it; and then there is that great and grand important Object in View, this fine Oak Timber may be wanted for supplying the Navy, and the Country might do with Timber of a much inferior Sort; for I am well assured, from long Experience, that valuable Article of Navy Timber must become scarce in a short Time, as the Demand for Ship Timber in general is very great, and requires the greatest Care to preserve it; and the Neglect of planting, and the using Timber at Half Growth for Country Uses, reduces the Quantity much. It’s certain these Forests have a great Quantity of very fine young growing Oak Timber in many Copses, and those Copses that I afore-mentioned, had they been planted, would have abounded with Timber of equal Goodness, and the Growth and Quality of the young Timber now growing on these Forests, and the fine large Timber that has been felled for many Years, and more fit for this Six or Seven Years to come for the Navy, is a general Proof that the Soil must be very proper for the Growth of Oak Timber, and would produce good, sound, strong Oak Timber for His Majesty’s Navy Purposes as any can be for the Service of the Navy in general; and humbly am,

Honourable Sir,

The Speech of Mr. Speaker, this Day, upon Mr. Speaker* presenting to His Majesty several Bills for ^*e^nt0 making good certain Supplies granted to His 1 8‘ Majesty in this Session of Parliament; when they received the Royal Assent.

Most Gracious Sovereign,

Your faithful Commons attend You! Majesty with sundry Bills of Supply, which they have passed for the Public Service.

A large Part of this Supply has been granted for the Purpose of carrying into Execution a Measure, the Principle of which has received the unanimous Approbation of Your Commons. Actuated by a generous and wise Policy, they have sacrificed the Considerations of temporary Convenience to those which arise from a just Regard to the permanent Interests of these Kingdoms. They have accordingly provided for the complete and speedy Discharge of the Ekpences recently incurred, in Support of the Honour and Dignity of Your Majesty’s Crown, and the Rights of Your Subjects, without any lasting Addition to thfe National Debt, or any Embarrassment to that System which has so effectually sustained and advanced the Public Credit of the Country.

Your Commons, Sire, are induced to hope, thak their Conduct on this Occasion will operate as a salutary Example to future Times; and that its immediate Effect will be to establish an universal Conviction of the internal Strength and copious Resources of this Country, and consequently to afford an additional Security for the Continuance of the Blessings of Peace. A Measure, which is the Result of such Motives, and which leads to such Consequences, Your Commons are persuaded, cannot fail to receive Your Majesty’s most gracious Approbation.

The Bills, which it is my Duty to present to Your Majesty, are severally intituled,

“ An Act for granting an Aid to His Majesty, by “ a Land Tax to be raised in Great Britain, for the “ Service of the Year One thousand Seven hundred “ and Ninety-one:

“ An Act for continuing and granting to His Majesty certain Duties upon Malt, Mum, Cyder, and “ Perry, for the Service of the Year One thousand Seven “ hundred and Ninety-one:

“ An Act for granting to His Majesty additional “ Duties upon Malt:

“ An Act for granting to His Majesty additional “ Duties upon Worts, Wash, and other Liquors “ brewed or made in England for extracting Spirits for “ Home Consumption; upon Spirits made in Scotland “ and imported into England, and upon Foreign Spirits “ imported into Great Britain; and to continue certain “ Acts for discontinuing, for a limited Time, the several “ Duties payable in Scotland upon Low Wines and Spirits, and upon Worts, Wash, and other Liquors there “ used in the Distillation of Spirits, and for granting to “ His Majesty other Duties in Lieu thereof; and for “ better regulating the Exportation of made

“ Spirits from England to Scotland, and from Scotland to “ England; and to continue, for a limited Time, an “ Act, made in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Reign “ of His present Majesty, to discontinue, for a limited “ Time, the Payment of the Duties upon Low Wines “ and Spirits for Home Consumption, and for granting “ and securing the due Payment of other Duties in Lieu “ thereof, and for the better Regulation of the making “ and vending of British Spirits:

“ An Act for granting to His Majesty additional “ Duties on the Amount of the Duties, under the Management of the Commissioners for the Affairs of “ Taxes, therein mentioned :”

To which Your Commons, with all Humility, desire Your Majesty’s Royal Assent.

Tackle, and Apparel, whatever be the Value of the same, are proposed to be made liable to Confiscation, for having on board a single Pound Weight of Biscuit, or a certain similar small Quantity of Grain, or Flour, contrary to the Provisions of the said Bill, though the same; should have happened without Fraud, or even withqut Privily, on the Part of the Owners, or though placed on board maliciously, or with a View to tbq Profit to arise from a collusive Seizure, which Seizure may forthwith be made by any Officer on the Part of His Majesty’s Customs; and that a single Proviso only is added,. purporting, that Evidence may be received by the Commissioners of the Customs, or the Courts of Law, in order to shew, from the Smallness of the Quantity of the said Articles so put on board, and other Circumstances of the Case, that neither the Owner, nor Master, nor other Person having Charge or Command of the Vessel, had Knowledge or Privity thereof, nor were guilty of any wilful Neglect, or Want of reasonable Care respecting the same, and that, where Proof shall be so made respectively, the Vessel, if exceeding One hundred Tons, shall not be forfeited; and that the Petitioners are by no Means relieved by the said Proviso from their just Apprehensions as to the evil Consequences, of the said Enacting Clauses, for, from the wording of the Proviso, as it now! stands, the Acceptance of such Evidence may be held to be optional, whereas they submit, that such Acceptance ought to be made peremptory; that the discretionary Power contained in the said Proviso appears only to be made to relate to Cases where small Quantities of the ,said Articles are put on board, whereas the Petitioners beg Leave to represent, that in the usual Course of Trade, considerable Quantities of such Articles may be put on board contrary to the Directions of the said Bill, as well from Inadvertence on the Part of the Shippers to the Forms therein prescribed, as from fraudulent Views, without any Neglect or Want of Care occurring, in either Case, on the Part of the Owners; that the Owners are still left to answer, in every Case whatever, not only for their own Acts and these of each other, but for the Acts of other Parties, since the Confiscation of the Vessel may follow on Account of Fraud or Neglect on the Part of the Captain, as well as of any other Person who may have the occasional Charge of the Vessel in his Absence; and, lastly, that great Injuries may arise to the Owners, not only of the Vessel, but also of the Cargo, in consequence of the Detention of the Vessel under Seizure, in order to await the Opinion of thq Commissioners of the Customs, or of a Court of Law, or the Determination of a Law Suit, against which Detention no Remedy whatever is provided by the said Bill; and that the Petitioners beg to submit the Impropriety of burthening Navigation with excessive Collateral Penalties in a Case where other direct Penalties amounting to a Forfeiture of the Goods in Question, along with Triple their Value, appear tp furnish a sufficient Remedy, and especially where other Penalties may be superadded affecting Persons guilty of having aided and abetted in the Commission of the

Petition A Petition of Sir Thomas Gooch, Baronet, was pre-agaiostthe seated to the House, and read; Setting forth, That Birmingham Petitioner is informed an Application has been

ter CaMl* aKa'n a>&^e to the House for Leave to bring in a Bill Bill. for making a Navigable Canal from or near the Town

of Birmingham to the River Severn, at Digits, near to the City of Worcester, similar to that which was offered to and rejected by Parliament in the last Session; and that the Petitioner is Owner of several valuable Water Mills, situate in and near to the Town of Birmingham, which lie below the Line of the said intended Canal, and i3 also the Owner of a large Landed Property, situate in and near to the said Town, and the present Supply of Water to the Petitioner’s said Mills is not fully sufficient for the necessary Uses thereof; and that in case the said intended Canal should take Place, the Petitioner apprehends that the same must unavoidably intercept and take away great Part of the Land Floods, Springs, and other Resources, which afford the natural Supply of Water to the said Mills, and that in Consequence thereof the same will be greatly injured and lessened in Value; and that many Streets have been formed, and very valuable and extensive Buildings erected, upon the Petitioner’s Estate in and near to the Town of Birmingham, the Value and Improvement whereof depends upon the Prosperity of the Manufactories of the said Town, which cannot be carried on without a constant and cheap Supply of Coals, and the Petitioner apprehends, that by Means of the intended Canal the Coals will be sent from the Mines which lie nearest to the Town of Birmingham into distant Markets, and that thereby the Supply of Coals for the Use of the said Manufactories will be rendered precarious, and the Price thereof consequently advanced, and very great Injury will result therefrom to the Petitioner’s Property: And therefore praying to be heard, by his Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Severn, near to the City of Worcester, be tead a Second Time, and that the Petitioner be then heard, by his Counsel, against the said Bill, upon his Petition, if he thinks lit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition.

American A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are Loyalists thereunto subscribed, being Inhabitants of America, Petition. who were driven from their Families and Possessions in Consequence of their Attachment to the British Government, and, by a Series of unfortunate Circumstances, have not been included in the Provisions of the Acts lately passed for the Relief of the Loyalists, being offered to be presented to the House:

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer (by His Majesty’s Command) acquainted the House, That His Majesty,

having been informed of the Contents of the said Petition, recommends it to the Consideration of the House.

Then the said Petition was brought up, and read;

Setting forth, That the Petitioners, actuated by an inviolable Attachment to the Person and Government of their Sovereign, and in chearful Obedience to His Majesty’s Proclamation, and the Resolutions of the Two Houses of Parliament, by which the Royal and Parliamentary Faith was most solemnly pledged for their Protection and Indemnity, exerted their.utmost Endeavours to suppress the late Rebellion in America, in direct Consequence whereof they were compelled to desert their Properties and Families, and to seek for Protection and Safely with the British Fleets and Armies — The Protection promised they confess they have in some Measure received, but they still remain destitute of the promised Indemnity and Compensation for their Losses, Services, and Sufferings, which has been liberally, administered to others under the same meritorious Circumstances: That far from imputing the least Degree of intentional Injustice, the Petitioners beg Leave to represent to the House, that their thus late Application for Relief has been occasioned by a Variety of unfortunate Circumstances, which naturally and inevitably attended their several Situations after the Peace, which were unforeseen, and therefore unprovided for by the several Acts passed for the Relief of the Loyalists; such as long and lingering Sickness; Imprisonment by the American States; their great Distance in the Wilderness of Canada and Nova Scotia, from the Source of Information, and the cruel and unjust Neglect of Agents: That thus particularly and unfortunately circumstanced, the Times limited by the Two First Acts, passed for the Relief of the Loyalists, were too short to enable the Petitioners, residing so distant from Great Britain, by any Means in their Power, to put in their Claims; that the subsequent Statutes were confined to the Cases of Persons therein particularly named, and that in Consequence thereof, although equally entitled by their Loyalty,

Sufferings, and Services, to the Public Relief which has been administered to others, they have not had an Opportunity to put in their Claims, and yet remain destitute of that Relief which they apprehend was within the equitable and benevolent Intention of the House in passing the aforesaid Acts for the Relief of the Loyalists: That the Petitioners have left their Families in the Wildernesses of Canada and Nova Scotia, struggling with Poverty and Distress, under a Confidence in the ‘Equity and Humanity of the British Government that they would receive the same Relief which has been granted to others, and that, should they fail in their Expectations, some of them have not, nor do they know' where to obtain, the Means of returning to their unfortunate and helpless Families:

And therefore entreating the House to take their unfortunate Case into Consideration, and to grant them that just Compensation for their Losses, Services, and Safferings, which they apprehend to be due to them, from the Principles of Reason and Justice, by the sacred Faith of Majesty, and by the solemn Resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, repeatedly made for their Protection and Indemnity, or to grant them such other Relief as to the House shall appear right and proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

A Petition of several Inhabitants of the Town and Petition in Neighbourhood of Sheffield, in the County of York, Favour of^ was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, “oad That the Petitioners are informed that Leave has been Bill.3 given to bring in a Bill for making, widening, altering, and repairing the JRoad from the Turnpike

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer (by His Majesty's Command) acquainted the House, That His Majesty, having been informed! of the Contents of the said Petition, recommends it to the Consideration of the House.

Then the said Petition was brought up and read;

Setting forth, That the large and rapid Rivers, called Bewley, Coma, and Helmsdale, run across the Country immediately to the Northward of Itrcerness from the Mountains to the East Sea, and it is the singular Condition of those Three Rivers to be absolutely without a Bridge from their Sources down to their respective Friths, from which uncommon Circumstance the large and populous Northern District above mentioned is sometimes utterly inaccessible, and always reached through dangerous Fords and Ferries, with great Inconveniency, and frequently with the Loss of Lives; and that the Funds and Abilities of the said District have been totally exhausted by making long Tracts of good Roads, and constructing numerous Bridges, some on large, and others on smaller Streams, without the Assistance hitherto of any Public Aid to effect those laborious and expensive Undertakings in the Counties to the Northward of the said Rivers, Two of which, vizBewley and Conon, run partly through, and partly contiguous to, Two of the most considerable of the late forfeited Estates, now restored to the Heirs of the former Proprietors; and that, during the Time the said Estates were in the Hands of the Public, the Commissioners appointed for their Management entered, at different Times, u|wn various Proceedings for building Bridges on the said Rivers Conon and Bewley, and paying the Expences out of the Rents of the said Estates; but those Rents having been, from Time to Time, otherwise applied, neither were the said Bridges, nor any other Public Work, carried on upon the said Northern Estates, nor in the Quarter of the Highlands where they lie, although their Rents were regularly levied for the Public, and were intended by Parliament for general Improvements in those Parts, as well as in other Quarters of Scotland;and that the late Grants of the forfeited Estates are charged with Payment, into the Exchequer in Scotland, of certain Sums subject to the future Disposition of Parliament, and, it being understood to he the Intention of Parliament to dispose of those Sums in useful and necessary Public Improvements in Scotland, the Bridges above mentioned are conceived to be primary Objects of that Description, as nearly serving to complete the only ti Part

31 Geo. III. 28° Februarii. 243

Part that now remains of a Line of Communication from one End of the Island to the other, and the Expence of building the aforesaid Bridges is computed at about £. 12,000: And therefore praying, That

Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for appropriating the Sum of £.12,000of the unexhausted Balance which is subject to the Disposition of Parliament, directed, by an Act of the Twenty-fourth Year of His present Majesty's Reign, to be paid into the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, by the several Persons to whom the forfeited Estates in are granted, towards

building Bridges over the Rivers , and

Helmsdale, in North Britain.

notwithstanding many other Towns in the same County have as large Markets for Corn; and that by far the greatest Part of the most considerable Millers, Maltsters, and Buyers of Corn for Sale, do not reside in the said T&wns of Reading, , or Windsor, but

in Country Villages, and the Petitioners conceive that the subjecting those Towns to the above Regulations, will be a Means of driving a great deal of the Business of the Market from those Towns to others not subjected thereto, and be a Means of considerable Quantities of Corn being sold in a more private Manner, and never brought to Market, which Practice hath of late very much prevailed; to the great Diminution of the Market, and to the Injury of the Inhabitants thereof, whose Trade in a great Measure thereon depends: And therefore praying, That the House would either subject all Market Towns within the said County, particularly the Towns of Wallingford, Abingdon, Wantage, Ilsley, Lambourn,

don, Hungerford, Maidenhead, and Oakingliam, to the same Regulations, and also enact, That all Millers, Maltsters, and Buyers of Corn for Sale, should weekly transmit to the Inspectors of Corn Returns for the Market Town nearest to their Abode the like Account of all Corn by them purchased, not only in such Market Towns, but in any other Place or Places, and at any other Time or Times, as otherwise the Petitioners fear that these Regulations will, by being confined to those Three Towns, be a very material Injury to their Markets, or that such other Mode of Relief should be granted to the Petitioners as the House shall think fit.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the said Bill is re-committed.

Resolved, That the Bill be read a Second Time.

A Petition of the Company of Proprietors of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Navigation, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That in pursuance of an Act passed in the Sixth Year of the lleign of His present Majesty, the Petitioners have, at a very large Expence, made and completed a Navigable Canal from the River Severn, at Stourport, in the County of Worcester, to the Trent and Mersey Canalr at Haywood, in the County of Stafford, by which Canals Commercial Intercourses have been opened between the Ports of Bristol, Liverpool, and Hull, and the interior Parts of the Kingdom; and that, in pursuance of another Act, a Navigable Canal has been made from the Canal of the Petitioners, at Autherley, near Wolverhampton, to Birmingham, and, in order to open a still nearer and better Communication between Birmingham and the River and

for the more effectually supplying Worcester, and the other Towns near the Secern, with Coals, Acts have since passed for making Canals from the Birmingham Canal at Tipton, by Dudley and Stourbridge, to fall into

the Petitioners said Canal at Stourton, which is Fifteen Miles nearer, from Birmingham to the River and Worcester, than by the Way of Autherley; and that, in the last Session of Parliament, a Bill was brought in for making a Canal from the said Town of Birmingham to the River Severn at Worcester, on tt Plan precisely the same as that proposed by the Bill now depending, founded, as was then alledged, on the imperfect State of the River Secern between Stourport and Diglis aforesaid, but the Petitioners offering and engaging at their own Expence to improve that Part of the River Severn, and to remove all Impediments therein, the said Bill was rejected by the House, and an Act was passed for empowering the Petitioners to improve the said River, in pursuance of which die Petitioners immediately began to make such Improvements, and are proceeding to complete the same with all possible Expedition; and that the Bill now depending will, if it passes into a Law, be attended with increased Hardships to the Petitioners, who have, on the Faith of the Powers granted them by Parliament in the last Session, expended a very considerable Sum of Money in improving the Secern, and removing the Impediments complained of, without the least pecuniary Benefit to themselves, they having no Power of Authority to collect or demand from the Public any Toll or Duty, on Account of the Money expended iu such Improvement; and that, when the Improvements in the Severn, now in Prosecution, are effected, the proposed Canal cannot in any Degree be necessary, as the Communication between Birmingham, and the Coal Mines, near the present Birmingham Canal and the Secern, will be complete and effectual, and as near and certain as by the Canal proposed, and such Ca- nal, instead of affording a Prospect of any Public Utility, will be productive of great private Injury, especially to the Petitioners and others who embarked their Properties in the Works of Inland Navigation at a Time when they were attended with great Risque and Hazard to the Undertakers, but which have in the Event been productive of great National Advantages: And therefore praying, that they may be beard, by their Counsel, against the said Bill for making the said Canal from Birmingham to the River Severn near Worcester, and that such Bill may not pass into a Law.

A Petition of the Company of Proprietors of the Petition Dudley Canal Navigation, was also presented to the against the House, and read; Setting forth, That by an Act, made in the Sixteenth Year of the Reign of His pre- ter Canal sent Majesty, the Petitioners were empowered to make Bill, a Navigable Canal from certain Lands belonging to Thomas Talbot Foley, Esquire, in the Parish of Dudley, to communicate with the Stourbridge Navigation, which said Canal hath been long since executed and rendered completely Navigable, and the Petitioners expended upwards of £.jo,oooo in such Undertaking; and that by virtue of an Act, made in the Twenty-fifth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, the Petitioners were empowered to extend the said Dudley Canal, from the Termination thereof in the Lands of the said Thomas Talbot Foley, to join the Birmingham and Birmingham and Fazcley Canal Navigation, at or near Tipton Green, in the County of Stafford, in order to open a Communication with the large Tracts of Coal and other Mines lying upon or near to the Line of the said Extension, and to afford a shorter and cheaper Conveyance for Goods and Merchandize between the Town of Birmingham and the Port of Bristol, and the intermediate Places, and the Petitioners were authorized by the said Act to raise amongst themselves the Sum of £. 27,000, in order to carry the said Work into Execution, which Sum not being found sufficient for the Purpose, the Petitioners, by an Act passed in the last Session, were enabled to raise the further Sum of £.10,100 for carrying the said Work

into

into Execution; and that, in pursuance Of the said last mentioned Acts, the Petitioners have expended upwards of £. 30,000 in carrying on the Extension of the said Dudley Canal, and the said Undertaking is now nearly completed, and by Means thereof a Communication will be opened between the Town of Birmingham and the River Secern Fifteen Miles nearer than the present Navigation by and that

the principal Inducement to the Petitioners to undertake the Extension of the said Dudley Cana), was in order to open a nearer and better Communication by Water between the Town of Birmingham and the Manufactories in the Neighbourhood thereof, and the Cities of W orcester, Gloucester, and Bristol, and the several intermediate Parts, and in order to supply the Counties of /Worcester, Gloucester, and Here-

ford, with Coals from tire Mines lying contiguous to the Line of the Birmingham Canal, in a constant and regular Manner; and that in order to render such Plan of Communication more perfect, an Act was obtained in the last Session, to enable the and /Worcestershire Canal Company, at their own Ex-

pence, and without laying any Tax or Burthen on the Public, to improve the Navigation of, the River Severn, between Stourporl and and which hath

been proceeded upon with all possible Expedition; and that the Petitioners observe, with very great Surprize and Concern, that an Application hath again been made to the House, in the present Session, for a Bill to make a Canal from or near the Town of Birmingham to the River Severn,at or near on

a Plan similar to the One brought into, and rejected by, Parliament in the last Session, which Scheme, if carried into Effect, will be attended with irreparable Injury to the Petitioners, in as much as it is calculated to defeat the very Objects for which the Petitioners have expended so large a Sum of Money under the Authority of Parliament without affording a Prospect of Public Utility, as when the Canal so forming by the Petitioners is united with the Birmingham Canal, it will open a much nearer Road for the Conveyance of Coals from the Mines lying on the Line of the Birmingham Canal to /Worcester and the Severn Markets than that proposed by the said intended Canal, and a complete Communication by YY'ater, sufficient for every Purpose of Trade and Commerce, will be thereby lormed and opened between Birmingham and /Worcester, and also between the Towns and Places of any Import-smec which such proposed Canal would, if executed, communicate with, or extend to, and therefore such proposed Canal cannot be in any Degree necessary or requisite for the Occasions of the Public: And therefore praying to be heard, by their Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law’.

A Petition of the principal Inhabitants and Manufacturers, residing in or near the Town of Stourbridge, in the County of / Worcester,was also presented to the House, and read; Setting Forth, That the Petitioners are informed an Application is again‘making to the House for a Bill to make a Navigable Canal from the Town of Birmingham to thp River Severn, at or near the City of /Worcester; and that there has been already

made and completed, at a very large Expence, One Communication by Water from the Town of Birmingham to /Worcester, by Means of the present Birmingham and the Staffordshire and /Worcestershire Canals, which fall into the River Severn at Stourport, and another Communication is now making under the Sanction of Parliament, and nearly complete, between those Places and the Tipton and other Collieries, by Means of the Junction of the Dudley and Birmingham Canals at Upton; and that the Canals already made have opened a convenient Communication for the Conveyance of Goods ami Merchandize between the Towns of Birmingham, /Wolverhampton, Stourbridge, Dudley, the

Vor,. 46.

City of /Worcester, and the Ports of Biistol, Liverpool, and Hull, and the same is fully sufficient to answer every good and useful Purpose of Trade and Commerce; and that the Petitioners conceive the proposed new Canal is projected, not with a View to open a Communication with any new Mines or new Markets, but to operate as a Rival Navigation to those which have been already formed at a very large Expence, and at the great Hazard of the Undertakers thereof, and that the Projectors of the intended new Canal have founded the pretended Utility of their Scheme on the imperfect State of the Navigation of the River Severn, between the Termination of the Staffordshire and /Worcestershire Canal at Stourport and Diglis, near /Worcester; and that, in the last Session of Parliament, an Act w'as passed, empowering and directing the Company of Proprietors of the Staffordshire and /Worcestershire Canal Navigation to improve the Navigation of the River Severn, between Stourport and Diglis aforesaid, and such Improvements are now carrying on, and the Petitioners cannot help expressing their Surprize at the same Scheme being again offered to Parliament which was presented to and rejected by the House ^the last Session, without waiting the Event of the Improvements of the Severn Navigation now making, pursuant to the Power of the said Act; and that the Petitioners conceive the proposed Canal will operate as a Discouragement to the Improvements of the Severn Navigation, as directed by the said Act, which will be highly injurious to Trade and Commerce, and they apprehend that no Advantage is likely to be derived from the proposed Canal, adequate to the great Injury which the Petitioners and the Public at large will sustain therefrom: And therefore praying, That the said Bill may not pass into a Law.

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are Petition thereunto subscribed, being Owners or Occupiers of aaamst Lands and Estates, through or near which a new' Cajial and Vorce*-Navigation is intended to be made, from or near the ter Canal Town of Birmingham, to communicate with the River B‘*t. Severn at or near /Worcester, was likewise presented to the House, and read,* Setting forth, That the said intended Canal, if made, will totally destroy a large Quantity of valuable Land, and otherwise very materially injure the Estates and Properties through or near which the same is intended to pass; and that there has been already made and completed, at a very large Expence, a Canal Navigation from the Town of Birmingham to the River Severn, and another is now making, and nearly completed, by Mdans of the Junction of the Dudley and Birmingham Canals, and the same are, as the Petitioners conceive, fully sufficient to answer every good and useful Purpose of Water Conveyance from the Towti of Birmingham to the River Severn at /Worcester; and that the Petitioners conceive the proposed Canal from Birmingham to the River Severn at /Worcester is calculated' to answer the private Views of the Schemers thereof, without a Probability of affording to the Public any Advantage adequate to the great Injury which the Petitioners and others w ill unavoidably sustain by it; and that, in the last Session of Parliament, an Application was made similar to the present, and a Bill was presented, for making a Canal in the same Direction as that now proposed, against which Bill the Petitioners and others prayed to be relieved, and the House rejected such Bill:

And therefore praying, That the Bill for making the said intended Canal may not pass into a Law, and that they may be heard, by themselves, their Agents, or Counsel, against the same.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of Birmingham, in the County of /Waneick, to communicate with the 3 If River

cester; and that the Petitioners conceive the proposed Canal from Birmingham to the River Secern at Worcester, is calculated to answer the fjrivate Views of the Schemers thereof, without a Probability of affording to the Public any Advantage adequate to the great Injury which the Petitioners, and others, will unavoidably sustain by it; and that, in the last Session of Parliament, an Application was made similar to the present, and a Bill was presented for making a Canal in the same Direction as that now proposed, against which Bill the Petitioners, and others, prayed to be relieved, and the House rejected such Bill: And therefore praying, That the said Bill may not pass into a Law, and that they may be beard, by themselves, their Agents, or Counsel, against the same.

municate with the River Severn, near to the City of Worcester, on a similar Plan to that which was brought before Parliament in the last Session; and Representing to the House, That there is already formed a Communication, by Inland Navigation, between the Town of Birmingham and Worcester, by Two different Courses, namely, the one by Autherley, near Wolverhampton, and the other by Stourbridge and Dudley, the Object of which Navigation was to open a certain Communication for the Conveyance of Goods and Merchandise between the Ports of Bristol, Hull, and-Liverpool, and also between the Town of ,

the large Manufactories in the Neighbourhood thereof, and the Cities of Worcester, Gloucester, and Bristol, and the several intermediate Parts, and also to supply -the Counties of Worcester, Gloucester, Warwick, ana Hereford, with Coals in a constant and regular Manner, as well from the Mines lying contiguous to the line of the Birmingham Canal, and the several Branches thereof, as also from the Mines lying on the Line of the Dudley and Stourbridge Canals, which have been accordingly effected, and the same is abundantly sufficient for all the Purposes of Trade and Commerce; and that the said Bill for making the proposed Canal does not even profess to open a Communication with any new Mines or new Markets which are not at present accessible by Means of the present Navigations, but is projected with a View to operate as a parallel or rival Navigation to those recently formed, at a very large Expence, under the Authority of Parliament, for great and important Purposes, and which have been productive of great National Utility and Public Advantage, and the Petitioners conceive the Project for' making the proposed Canal is not founded on Principles either of Necessity or real Public Utility, that the Attempt is alarming in its Nature, and, should Powers be panted for making such intended Canal, it must, as the Petitioners apprehend, operate to the Discouragement of the future Progress of useful Branches of Inland Navigation, by rendering uncertain and precarious Property advanced on the Faith of Parliament in such Undertakings; and that, on and near the Line of the present Canals, there have been planted great and extensive Iron Works and other Manufactories, and the heavy Materials used therein, as well as the Produce thereof, are conveyed by Means of those Canals into and from the Severn at Stourport, above Worcester, in order to be sent into the different Markets; and that the River Severn is a free Navigation, and of the utmost Importance to the Trade and Commerce of this Kingdom, and, notwithstanding such River is, in dry Seasons, deficient in Water, yet the Supply of Water for the intended 8 new

A Petition of the Merchants, Tradesmen, and principal Inhabitants of Stourpoin the County of cester, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are informed a Bill is depending in the House for making a new’ Canal Navigation from Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Severn at Diglis, near IForcester, on a similar Plan to that which was offered to, and rejected by, Parliament in the last Session; and that the present existing Canals, which have been formed at an immense Expence, as well as at great Risque to the Undertakers thereof, have already opened a convenient and certain Communication not only for the Conveyance of Coals from all the different Mines lying on or near the Line of the Binning-hani Canal into the Severn Markets, and, by Means of such Communication, the Counties of Worcester, Gloucester, Warwick, and Hereford, have been supplied with Coals in a constant and regular Manner, but also for the Conveyance of Goods and Merchandize between the Ports of Bristol, Hull, and Liverpcol, and also between the Town of Birmingham, the large Manufactories in the Neighbourhood thereof, and the Cities of IForcester, Gloucester, and Bristol, and the several intermediate Parts; and that the Petitioners conceiv-Vot. 46.

And therefore praying, That the House will take the Premises into Consideration, and that they may be heard, by themselves, their Agents, or Counsel, against the same, and that such Bill may not pass into a Law.

A Petition of the several Owners of Vessels, Barge- Petition masters, Carriers, and others, Traders upon the River Severn, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was cn<j Worces-also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, ter ComI That the Petitioners are informed a Bill is now depending in the House, for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from or near Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Secern, at or near to the City of Worcester, upon a similar Plan to the One which was offered to and rejected by Parliament in the last Session; and that there has been already made and completed One Communication by Water, from the Town of Birmingham to ,

by Means of the present Birmingham and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canals, which latter Canal falls into the River Severn at Stourport, and that another Communication is now making and nearly finished between those Places and the several Coal Mines on the Line of the said Birmingham Canal, by Means of the Junction of the Dudley and Birmingham Canals at Tipton, and the Object of making such Canals was not only to convey Coals from the Mines lying on the different Lines thereof into the Secern Market, but also to connect the several Branches of Inland Navigation with the River Secern, and thereby form a general Communication for the Conveyance of Goods and Merchandize between the Ports of Bristol, Hull, and Liverpool, and the Towns of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and other manufacturing Towns and Places on

Taking Notice of the Bill for building a Bridge, at or near the Ferry over the River Ouse, from Selby, in the West Riding of the County of York, to the opposite Shore, in the Parish of Hemingborough, in the East Riding of the said County of York; and Setting forth.

That, by virtue of Two Acts, passed in the Thirteenth Year of King George the First, and the Fifth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, the said Trustees were authorized to make the said River Ouse more Navigable for Ships and other Vessels, and to remove all Gravel Beds, and other Impediments whatsoever, which might hinder the Navigation, either in sailing or hauling Ships or Vessels upon the said River, and are entitled to receive divers Tolls for Goods and Merchandize conveyed upon the said River above a Place called Wharf s Mouth; and that the said Navigation hath been improved at a very considerable Expence, and particularly by the Erection of a Lock and Dam, at the Distance of about Five Miles by Water from the said City, in order to' raise the Water in the said River above such Lock and Dam, and the Tide flows up to the said Dam, so that Vessels of considerable Burthen can safely navigate from London and other Ports to the said City; and that many Parts of the said River, below the said Lock and Dam, are shallow, and, by Reason thereof, and of frequent Floods in the said River, and otherwise, the Navigation thereof is frequently rendered difficult and precarious, so that any Interruption, which may occasion Delay or Inconvenience in the free Passage of Vessels, would materially, prejudice the said Navigation, and subject the Navigators thereof to much Expence and Injury; and that a considerable Number of Vessels pass through the said Lock to York Annually, and return through the same, many of which cannot lower their Masts, and, the Petitioners apprehend, if any Bridge should be erected at or near Selby, the same would be very dangerous, and occasion great Delay to all Ships and Vessels having Occasion to pass through the same, and would materially affect the Trade upon the said River above Selby, and greatly decrease the Tolls and Duties which the Petitioners are authorized to take as Trustees of the said Navigation, and more especially if the Clauses and Provisions of the Kill for building such Bridge should not be adapted to prevent every possible

8 as

as well as to the Peace and Quiet of the Country, the Petitioners are apprehensive of the most serious Consequences, if the District in which they are classed be not as much confined in Point of Extent as possible, and every Discrimination betwixt the Two Kingdoms entirely removed; and that, independent of the Distress apprehended from the said Clauses to their Manufactures and Commerce, and the Danger of Scarcity and Popular Commotions, the Petitioners beg Leave to represent, that subjecting their Part of the United Kingdom to a separate Regulation respecting Oatmeal, especially when it is considered that such Regulation must have the Effect to raise the Price of it in Scotland above that of ,is not only subversive

of the Right which every Subject of Britain has to the Enjoyment of equal Laws in Matters of Trade and Commerce, but may be drawn into a Precedent to justify a partial Tax of the Raw Materials of our Manufactures, to which Grain and all Kinds of Provisions are precisely similar, or any other Commodity in particular Districts of the Kingdom, altogether irreconcileable to the Rules of Justice and sound Policy: And therefore praying the House, to afford such Relief in the Prenfises as to them shall seem proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the said Bill is re-committed.

Petition re- A Petition of several Householders within the Ci-Servanu ^es London wad Westminster for themselves and Characters, others, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That divers evil Practices have been carried on by Persons falsely assuming the Names and Characters of Masters, Mistresses; and Employers of Menial Servants of both Sexes, and by forging and counterfeiting Certificates of their Characters from such Masters, Mistresses, and Employers, to the manifest Detriment not only of such Masters, Mistresses, and Employers, thereby imposed On, but also to the Prejudice of all good and faithful Servants, who are deserving of being distinguished from those of bad Characters, and of being solely employed; and that the Petitioners have great Reason to believe many Robberies have been committed by Servants who have been thus hired, and that such evil Practices are the chief Source from which the many House Robberies, Committed in and hear the Metropolis, as well as in other Places, do arise, and they are informed that the Laws now in being do not extend to punish the Evils complained of, and conceive, that if a Law was made to put a Stop to such pernicious Evils, it would be of great Benefit to the Community in general, and have a strong Tendency to reform the Morals and Behaviour of Servants throughout the Kingdom: And therefore requesting the Attention of the House to the Evils complained of, and that they will make such Provisions for remedying the same as to the House shall seem meet.

Lord Dudley going on in Chancery for hiking the Accounts of the late Lord Dudley's Personal Estate ? he said, There is a Decree for that Purpose. — He also said. That he does not conceive that he had such a Discretion as to entitle him to subscribe to the present Undertaking; and that if he had done so, he should have expected to have received a very severe Censure from the Court of Chancery; that there has not been any Call made for any Sum'of Money whatever on the Executors of the late Lord Dudley. — Being then asked, In what Respect he conceives that the Estate of the late Lord Dudley can receive any Injury by the Names of the Executors being inserted in the List of Subscribers? he replied, That must undoubtedly be Matter of Opinion; he should rather think that the Estate of Lord Dudley could not be affected as far as the Subscription goes, because it is so improper a Thing in his Opinion for Executors to subscribe to, that if they were liable at all to pay their Subscriptions they must be Personally liable. — -And being asked, Whether he considers the Executors of Lord Dudley as Subscribers or not? he said, They certainly have not subscribed; but if the intended Bill was to pass into a Law he thinks they would be injured, because he conceives it would he competent to any of the Proprietors to sue them for their Subscription. — And being asked, Whether it is his Opinion that any Person could be sued, who had not actually subscribed ? he said, He had not given any Opinion as to the Success of such a Suit; but he should incline to think that they would not be liable, yet they might be put to great Expence in defending any such Suit — And being asked, Whether the present Petition ha3 been presented with the Knowledge of the other Executors, and of the Trustees of the Estate of Miss Ward? he replied, It was presented at the Request of the other Executors; he himself is One of the Trustees; another lives in Northumberland; and it has been presented with the Knowledge and at the particular Request of Mr. Wilson, who is Solicitor for the other Trustee, and Miss Ward ;Dr. De Salis is One of the Trustees, he cannot say whether he has been consulted, but Mr. Wilson can answer to that Fact. — The Witness being further asked, Whether he had any Consultation with Mr. Roberts, previous to presenting the present Petition? he said, He had, on Tuesday last; that Mr. Roberts then stated, that he thought Lord Dudley's Estate was entitled to a Preference, on Account of his having subscribed to some former Undertaking; lie believes he also stated, that the Executors of Lord Dudley being named as Subscribers was intended for the Benefit of the Estate. — And being asked, Whether Mr. Roberts did not tell him, that before the Bill went into a Committee the Executors would have Time to know whether it would or would not be a Benefit to the Estate, and that no Person would be named as Proprietor in the Bill without his Consent, and that any Proprietor might be at Liberty to withdraw his Name or not, as he should think proper ? he replied, Mr. Roberts did express himself to that Effect, but he (the Witness) then said that it would be impossible for the Executors to avail themselves of that Advantage, if it was any; and that he thought it a Justice as well to themselves as to the House, to state the Circumstances to the House; that lie had no Opportunity, after the Conversation with Mr. Roberts, to state the Matter to any of the other Executors; that he does not know whether Mr. Bume was a Subscriber to the present Scheme last Session, but believes Mr. Roberts said he was a Subscriber in his own Right; Mr. Burne was then Receiver, appointed by the Court of Chancery, of the Estate of the Infant.

Mr. Thomas Brettel being next examined, was asked, How many Shares the Executors of Lord Dudley have in the Stourbridge and Dudley Canal Navigation ? he said, Ten in the Stourbridge, and Eighteen in the 7

Dudley. — And being asked, Whether Lord Dudley was ever a Subscriber to the present Undertaking? he answered, That the present Scheme did not take Place till after his Lordship’s Death. — And being further asked, Whatever the Number of Shares were, for which the Name of Lord Dudley stood, were they not Shares in an Undertaking totally distinct from the present? he said, Totally so, the present Scheme has not the least Connection with it; the Number of Shares, to the best of his Belief, amounted to Twenty.

Mr. Vernon being again examined, was asked, Whether the Option, which is alleged to have been given to the Subscribers to the Undertaking of 1786, to become Subscribers in the present Undertaking, was, and when, communicated either to Lord Dudley in his Life Time, or to his Executors of Trustees since his Death? he replied, It could not be communicated to Lord Dudley in his Life Time, because he died before the present Plan was set on Foot; and it has never been communicated to the Witness, nor to any of the other Executors or Trustees since.

Mr. Wilson Aylesbury Roberts being then examined, was asked, Whether he did or did not consider the Executors of Lord Dudley as Subscribers to the present Undertaking? he replied, That he did not consider them as Subscribers, or intend to insert their Names in the Bill, till he had applied to them, and received their full Approbation; and this he told Mr. Vernon before the Petition was presented; and he further told him that it was intended as a Benefit, and that he thought it would have been an Act of Injustice if the Executors had not been inserted. — And being asked, Whether he did not, when he produced the Subscription List, as Agent for the Bill before the former Committee, wish that Committee to consider the Executors of Lord Dudley as Subscribers ? he replied. If the Committee had asked him any Questions on that Subject he should have explained it, that neither himself, or any of the Agents for the Bill, considered the Executors as bound until they had given their fuH Approbation, but they were set down as Subscribers as an intended Benefit, and were to have an Option to remain Subscribers or not, as they should think proper. — And being asked, Whether Evidence was not produced at that Committee to prove that the List delivered in was a true Copy of actual Subscribers ? he said. It was not intended as a true Copy, but as an actual List of those Persons who had subscribed, and of a very few who were considered as Subscribers. — And being asked, Whether he did or did not mean to comply with the Standing Orders of the House at that Time? he said. Certainly. — And being further asked, Whether the Subscribers to the Undertaking in 1786 did not claim an Option of subscribing to the present Scheme? he replied. Most of them did, and were admitted as such; the late Lord Dudley was One of those Subscribers for Twenty Shares.

Mr. Vernon being further examined, was asked. Who drew the Petition now before the Committee? he said, Mr. Wilson, Miss Ward's Solicitor; he believes Mr. Cartwright signed it on Saturday or Sunday last.

Upon the whole Matter, your Committee unanimously came to the following Resolution;

viz.

Resolved, That it appears to this Committee, from the Evidence of the Witnesses produced to prove the Allegations of the Petition, That the Undertakers of the proposed Canal from Worcester to Birmingham meant to give an Advantage to the Estate of Lord Dudley; and that the Imputation of intended Fraud, expressed in the said Petition, is unwarranted.

The said Resolution being read a Second Time, was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed to by the House.

which appears to them of so novel and extraordinary a Nature, and so repugnant to the Rights of those with whose Property the Petitioners are entrusted, and to whose Interests, without being negligent, they cannot be indifferent, they might be deemed to acquiesce in the Propriety and Justice of it; and as the Petitioners conceived that any Step to be taken by them for the Purpose of assembling the numerous Persons in every Class and Condition of Life, who are interested in the Public Funds, and collecting their Sentiments, might be productive of great Alarm, and perhaps occasion Public Disturbances, the Petitioners have been induced to acquit themselves of their Duty, in the Discharge of a great and important Trust, by preferring a plain and faithful Representation to this House of the serious Consequences to the Public Creditors with which the Petitioners are fearful this Measure is pregnant.

and One other sufficient Person to be their Accountant To the present Moment, the Contract between the B*nk Divi-General, and that so much of the Monies by this Act Public and the Public Creditors, has been unimpair- denJs b*1'* appropriated for this Purpose, as shall be sufficient, ed, and the Public Faith preserved inviolate; no Al-froin Time to Time, to answer the said Annuities, teration, of the slightest Kind, has ever been made in shall, by Order of the Commissioners of the Treasury, the Contract, but with the Consent of those whose without any further or other Warrant to be sued for in Property might be affected by such Alteration, and that Behalf, from Time to Time, and at the respective the Money to pay the Annuities has invariably been Days of Payment in this Act appointed for Payment issued with Punctuality to the Extent of the Public thereof, be issued and paid, at the said Receipt of the Engagements for the full Payment of the Public Exchequer, to the said First Cashier of the Bank, by Creditors. But by the Bill now proposed, out of Way of Imprest, and upon Account, for the Payment the Money actually issued to the Bank, in pursuance of the said Annuities, and that such Cashier shall, of Public Compact, and in the Performance of solemn without Delay, pay the same accordingly, and render Engagements, entered into for a full and valuable Con-his Accounts thereof according to the due Course of sideration, £. 500,000 is proposed to be taken back the Exchequer; and, by a subsequent Clause it is from the Bank into the Exchequer, and to be divert-Enacted, That the Bank shall be continued a Corpo- ed to other Purposes, in which the Owners of that ration for the Purposes of the said Acts, until all the Money which is to be taken, have no Concern but Annuities shall be redeemed, notwithstanding the Re- what is common to them with every other Subject demption of all or any of their own Funds: By the of the State. And the Principle upon which that Acts of Parliament from which what precedes has been Measure is introduced to the House, and which seems extracted, and which assure to the Public Creditors not to be concealed in the Bill itself, is such as must their respective Annuities in Return for the Money naturally excite the most serious Apprehensions: For contributed by them to the Public Service, not in the Petitioners beg Leave to observe, that so far from Obedience to a Law, but upon the Faith of a Public its being pretended that this is Money remaining in the Compact, the Legislature, One of the Parties to a Possession of the Bank without an Owner, it is ex-Contract of borrowing and lending, has expressly pressly admitted that it is not of that Description, nor stipulated with those whose Money the Public have can be taken upon that Principle, perhaps the only had the Benefit of, that, for their more easy and sure one which could justify the Seizure of Money levied Payment, the full Sura of their Annuities, at the and issued to pay those whose Money the Public bad Periods when they become due, shall be issued to the received; but because those to whom it belongs have Bank, for the Use, Benefit, and Convenience, of those suffered it to remain in the Place where they have sti-entitled to them, until all the Annuities shall be re- pulated it should be paid to them, a Right is claimed deemed, and besides, that this Mode of Payment is to take it back and to apply it to other Purposes,

Part of the original Stipulation of the Public, and is without entering into any new Contract with the incorporated into the Body of the Contract between Owners, and without their Consent; in effect, to seize the Public and the Public Creditors; it has also in its upon it in the Hands of the Agent for such Owners,

Favour the prescriptive Sanction of long Usage, and merely because those who alone have the just and the confirmed Habits of all who have invested their lawful Dominion over it chose to let it remain in the Money in that great Mass of Property constituting Possession of such Agent, and because the Use of it the Public Funds. The Money in the Bank, and out may be convenient in the Interval to those who have of which the Sum in Question, forming a large Portion the Power to seize it The Petitioners conceive it to of it, is to be taken, is the Balance of the Quarterly be their bounden Duty, not only to those whose Money Issues made by the Exchequer to the Bank for the this is, but to those whose Money they may be here-Payment of the Dividends contracted by Parliament after obliged to take, in order to replace what is now to be paid, and which the Proprietors suffer to re- to be taken away, and also to the Public Creditors at main in the Bank till it suits their Convenience to re- large, whose Property is invested in the Funds, and ceive them, and not from the Amount of unpaid Di- may hereafter, in various Ways, be materially affected vidends of any considerable Standing which may have by the Application and Extension of this Precedent, been forgotten by the Owner, or may be unknown to to represent against a Measure which appears to them him: That such is the Fact, clearly appears from the so unjust in itself, and so pernicious in its Principle.

Account which has been presented to the House of This Bill appears to the Petitioners to strike directly Arrears of all Dividends issued by Government to the at Two Principles regarded as sacred by the Law and Bank of England for Payment of the Public Creditors, Constitution of their Country — It appears to them at from the original Establishment of the Bank to the 31st once a Violation of Public Faith, and an Infringement December 1 787, and which remained unpaid on the 31st of Private Right; for after Parliament has entered into December 1790, of which Arrears, in all the different a solemn Contract, and has pledged the Public, as in Public Funds, the Total is, £. 127,457 3 4 Justice it was bound to do, for the punctual Issue of

the Annuities due to the Public Creditors for their Payment; to issue £. 500,000 less upon any given Day stipulated by Parliament for the Issue, would be a manifest Breach of Contract; and to take back £. 500,000 after it has been issued as now proposed, is only a Difference in Form, but not in Substance. In either Case, the Contract with the Public Creditor is equally broken, and a Power to dispose of their Property is assumed, not’ warranted by any existing Law,

possible Injury from the Seizure of it: — But whilst that Money has a lawful Owner, the Fotver to seiie Upon it, by whomsoever claimed, must be repugnant to the lawM Right of the Owner, and subversive of the Principles by which private Property is secured from Invasion. The Money may not be employed by the Owners, but the Right of any other Power to seize it can never be founded upon that Circumstance. The Money \Vhrch is useless to the Owner may indeed be usefUl to others; but as little can that Circumstance found a Right in another to take it from the Owner; Two Rights so adverse to each other cannot exist consistent with the Rules of Property, on its just Security. Acts of Parliament for granting Annuities in Consideration of Money borrowed from Individuals for the Use of the Public, are, as the Petitioners conceive, rather Compacts than Laws: The Public borrow; Individuals lend; and all the Obligations of Justice attach upon such Contracts, and enforce as strict and faithft.il an Observance of them as of any other of the Conventions of Men. The Owners Of the Money proposed to be taken back are many in Number, dispersed in different Parts of the World, and include Persons under various legal Disabilities, 'as Well as those of all States and Conditions in Life: There must also bfe ttaany Persons among them improvident, or negligent, who, disregarding the ordinary Means of accumulating their Fortunes, leave their Money in the Bank of England, from established Confidence in its Security, and lortg Experience of "the Facility with which, upon the first Application, the Money can be procured, except only where those, who have had the Power of disposing of it, have, by their Testament, clogged that Disposition with such Limitations as impede the simple and easy Mode of Transfer in tJse at the Bank. On Behalf of all these various Descriptions Of Persons, the Petitioners humbly re-

?' rfesent, that none Of the Circumstances in which their VOpeity is involved at the Bank, and which may, in Some Instances, create temporary Obstructions that Yetard sometimes the Transfer of the Annuity itself, and sometimes the Application for the Dividend, can 'possibly afford any just Right to take their Money. — in no other Case than the present, would, as the Peti-

ThO Petitioners humbly suggest to the House, the Guardians of the Public Faith, that no slight or temporary Convenience, from the Use of Money not actually employed by the lawful Owners, would seem to justify the Establishment of a Precedent upon the Statute Book, by the Assistance of which the Property of the Public Creditors may be hereafter, and in worse Times, daringly and successfully invaded; nor do the Circumstances of the present Times seem to call for such a Measure, or offer any Excuse for a Deviation from the even and constant Regard which has been had to Public Engagements. — This Step is not about to be taken during the Pressure of an expensive and unsuccessful War, nor is the Time at which it is recurred to marked by any great Public Calamity, or distinguished by any Circumstances peculiarly inauspicious. But, on the contrary, it is generally understood, and the Petitioners believe, as they hope, truly, that the Affairs of the Nation are prosperous; its Trade and Commerce flourishing; its Finances thriving; its Resources abundant. — If, under such Circumstances, the Money issued to pay the Public Creditor* be taken back, and diverted to other Purposes, what may not justly be apprehended for their Property from this Example, at any Time of National Adversity, when Impatience and Discontent under Public Burthens may impel those, charged with the Conduct of Public Affairs, to take extraordinary Courses in order to obtain Revenue without taxing the People, and when this Precedent, the first of its Kind, will be in Force to justify every future Attack on the Property and Rights of the Public Creditors? If the Principle of this Bill were just, and its Object unexceptionable; if it were merely a Bill for directing the Application of Public Money lying in the Bank, the Petitioners would still be under the Necessity of soliciting from the House a more clear and explicit Direction for their Conduct than they have been able to discover in it after the most attentive Examination, and of entreating that, in a Bill which is to regulate their Conduct in the Execution of a Public Trust, they should not be left to collect the Intention from uncertain Implication, and doubt-

tioners apprehend, a Law affecting private Property *be suffered to proceed without the Consent of the Persons interested: The only exception, of which the Petitioners are informed, to a Legislative Rule of such Importance to the Property of Mankind, is the Case of Public Works, beneficial to the Nation; and even then the Individual, whose Property is necessary to them, is only compelled to part with it upon receiving the full Value of it, estimated on "Oath by a Jury. By this Bill the Property of Individuals is proposed to be taken without their Consent, and without their Knowledge. The Security of the Bank of England, which they now have for it, is to be taken from them, and their legal Remedies to recover it from the Bank, !in Case of Refusal or Delay in the Payment, are to he annihilated; and, in Lieu of what is thus to be taken from them, they are to have ’the contingent Security of any Money in the Receifit of the Exchequer, of the Aids or Supplies granted to His Majesty for the Service of the Current Year, or any preceding Year, or of any Monies arising 'from the Surplus of the Consolidated Pund, which may remain at the ‘End of afiy Quarter for the Disposition of Parliament, or of any Monies to arise by virtue of Exchequer Bills to be made Out in pursuance of this proposed Act: All 'which Securities, valid and available as they may be, do not, as the Petitioners submit, in the smallest Degree, justify the substituting them in Lieu df the Money itself in the Possession df the Bank, whefe "the rightful Owners have chosen to leave it, and in Lieu df tho Security of the Bank for its forth-coming when’ Called for, ‘with which the Owners are content.

fill Inference; but in the Distribution of Money, in which Individuals have also Interests, and which by various Acts of Parliament is appropriated, as it comes into the Hands of the Bank, to the Payment of those Individuals, it is peculiarly necessary to explain that which is ambiguous, and elucidate that which is obscure. — The Bill proposes that, out of Money issued for the Payment of any Annuities or Dividends payable at the Bank, which shall have become due at any Time previous to the 5th of January 1791, £. 500,000 shall be paid into the Receipt Of the Exchequer. It is not supposed that this Money, though lying in the Bank, is not due to the Public Creditors, and will not, or, at least, the greatest Part of it, be called for by the Owners: The Petitioners conceive it is not explicitly declared whether they are immediately to pay it when called for, and, if they are to pay it, out of what Fund; for the future Half Yearly -Issues are already appropriated by the respective Acts of Parliament which direct them to he made, and they are to be applied to the Payment of the Half Year s Dividends to which they belong — When the Money which is now the Property of the Creditors, whose Dividends became due previous to the 5th of January 1791, shall be taken away, the Petitioners are in Doubt, whether the Money belonging to the Creditors entitled to any subsequent Half Year’s Dividend is to be takch from such Creditors, and applied to the Payment of the Creditors of the Old Arrears; and whether the Money expressly appropriated by former Acts of Parliament to the Payment of One Set of Men is now intended to be diverted to the Payment of another.

’ if

If that be the Intention, the Petitioners hope it will be so declared in the Bill, should the same pass into a Law: Whilst the Bank had Money enough to pay the Dividends to all the Public Creditors, there was no Necessity for keeping different Cash Accounts in the Bank — But that Necessity, as the Bill stands, will now arise, for if Money belonging to those who were Public Creditors previous to the 5th of January 1791 be taken, and if the future Issues be, as they are, appropriated by the different Acts to the Payment of the respective Half Year’s Dividends, the Bank of England cannot disobey the Acts of Parliament, and reimburse One Set of Men with the Money of another; the Accounts of the Two cannot be blended. If it be meant to consider all Annuities but those which became due the preceding Quarter as Annuities in Arrear, and to throw into One common Mass, for the Payment of those Arrears, all former Issues of Money, annihilating all Claims of particular Creditors upon any particular Issue, except they demand the Payment within Three Months — In that Case, the Petitioners conceive, a special Provision for that Purpose will be necessary. And when the several Doubts hereby suggested are cleared up, the Petitioners hope it will be found proper to extend the Indemnity provided for the Petitioners, so as more clearly to secure them against the Provisions of the former Acts of Parliament, and the Misappropriation or Misapplication of Money which is still to be issued Half Yearly, under those Acts of Parliament, for the Use of the Persons entitled to the respective Dividends; the Breach or Non-observance tof which Acts, without the plain and precise Warrant of a new Law to justify it, may hereafter involve the Petitioners in Embarrassment and Perplexity. The Indemnity, as it now stands, is a Security only for what may be done or omitted to be done in pursuance of the proposed Act; but, if die Petitioners should be

prietors, make any Alteration either in respect to their Securities, which consist principally in Funds specifi- j

cally appropriated to the Payment of their Annuities, or in respect to the Mode of their Payments, expressly-stipulated and delineated in the several Statutes that fix the Conditions of the Public Loans; and that the Petitioners have seen, with equal" Concern and Astonishment, a Bill brought into Parliament by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the avowed Object of which is to take back £.500,000, Part of the Sums that have been issued, by the Exchequer, to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, in pursuance of many Acts of Parliament, and particularly of the Consolidated Act, passed in the Twenty-seventh Year of His present Majesty, being Part of the Funds ap* propriated by Law to the Payment of the Public Creditors, and expressly Enacted not to be divertible to any other Use or Purpose whatever: That the Principle of the said Bill appears to the Petitioners to have a direct Tendency to destroy that Confidence which Natives and Foreigners have hitherto reposed in the Equity and Justice of Parliament, to violate Ml

as such in the Books of the Bank of England, to excite Alarms and Apprehensions of the most serious and dangerous Nature: That the Petitioners wish to be beard, by Counsel, if it shall appear to them to be necessary, although it is a Case that does not depend upon nice and intricate Subtilty, or on a deep Knowledge of the technical Forms of Law, but on the Rights of British Subjects, which ought in no Case whatever to be invaded, and they petition for do more than a sacred Observance of National Contracts, containing express Stipulations, easily understood, and ratified by solemn Acts of the Supreme Legislature: Under anxious Apprehensions, not more sensibly felt on their own Account, than for the Good Faith, the Public Credit, and the Honour of the Nation, and impressed with a Sense of the Duty they owe not only to themselves, but to the Community at large, the Petitioners intreat the House to take the Premises into their most serious Consideration: And pray, That no Alteration in their Security, for the better or the ,

worse, may take Place without their Consent, and that the said Bill may not pass into a Law.

To prove the Allegations of the First-mentioned Petition, Mr. John Gregory being examined, said, That the Poor of the said Parishes are maintained 'and supported at a very heavy Expence — That if Powers were given for providing a proper Place for the Reception, Employment, and Government of the Poor, it would be very conducive to the better Relief and Support of those who, by Age or Infirmities, are unable to maintain themselves, and it would be a Means of better employing the Able and Industrious, and the Poor Children would be early inured to Habits of good and moral Behaviour, and the Idle and Disorderly much reformed — That if Power was given to agree for the Employment of the Poor of other Parishes in the Place to be provided for the Poor of the above Parishes, it may be very advantageous to such Parishes.

To prove the Allegations of the Second-mentioned Petition, Mr. John Gregory being examined, said, That the Poor of the Parish of Baschurch, and the Districts of Hadnal and Little Ness are very numerous, and maintained at a great Ex pence — That it would be a Means of lessening the Ex pence, and the Poor would be more comfortably maintained, if the said Parish and Districts were included in the intended Bill for the better Employment of the Poor of Ellesmere.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for the better Relief and Employment of the Poor belonging to the several Parishes of Ellesmere, Middle, Baschurch, and Hordley, and to the several Chapelries or Districts of Hadnal, otherwise Hadnal Ease, and Little Ness, in the County of Salop: And that Mr. Hill and Mr. Kynaston do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Handsworth sir Edward Littleton reported from the Committee,

who declared themselves neuter; and that the Whole Property interested in the Inclosure consists of 2,975 Acres and 103 Messuages, and there are, in the Whole,

71 Acres of Open Field Land; and that no Person appeared before the Committee to oppose the Bill); and that the Committee had gone through the Bill, and made several Amendments thereunto, which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered the Bill, with the Amendments, in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the Amendments were Once read throughout; and then a Second Time, One by One; and, upon the Question severally put thereupon, were agreed to by the House.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Report which was made from the Committee, to whom the Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Severn, near to the City of Worcester, was committed, be taken into further Consideration: And that the Petitioners be then heard, by their Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition.

Low Duties, from the Average of all the Ports of England, is not in the Opinion of the Petitioners so proper as the Plan of each District regulating these Circumstances from the State of its own Ports, as the Average in the former Case would always be against the manufacturing County of Lancaster', where there is by no Means a sufficient Quantity of Corn raised for its own Consumption; and that the Petitioners conceive that, from the Increase of Population and Luxury, and the Extension of Commerce and Manufactories, which have occasioned a larger Consumption of all the Necessaries of Life, this Country cannot raise Corn sufficient for its own Support: They therefore rely on the Justice of the House, and trust for such Security against a Probability of Scarcity as the House shall think proper.

addressed to the Court of Directors, dated the 14th of October 1788, and followed it by a Remonstrance, stating his Case more at large, dated the 15th of December 1789, whereof the following is a Copy: — “ I have received a Letter from Mr. Secretary Morton of the 27th of last Month, wherein be tells me, “ that be is ordered by the Court of Directors to acquaint me, that they do not consider me as coming under the Description of Persons, entitled by their Orders “ to receive Pensions, and that therefore my Request “ cannot be complied with; but that they have agreed “ to my returning to my Rank in the Company’s Service in Bengal, by One of the Ships of this Season.” “ In Answer to this Notification of your Pleasure, I “ can only plead that I have done ail that could be “ required of me to establish my Claim to the Pension “ I petitioned for near Fourteen Months ago. By “ your Letter of the 2 ist of September 1785, you au-u thorized the Government of Bengal to signify to your “ Servants out of Employment, that they had your “ Permission with their first Convenience to return to “ Great Britain, where they should enjoy certain Annuities, according to their respective Ranks, on certain Terms and Conditions described in the same ‘‘ Letter, till the Time they should again be put into “ Employment. You declared that your final Deter* “ mination was, that a Senior Merchant, whose Fortune was not equal to £. str. 10,000, should receive “ from you as much as with the Interest of his own “ Money should yield him an Annuity of £. str. 400 “ per Annum. The Case so described and provided “ for by yourselves was precisely mine. I was out of “ Employment in India. Your Permission to return “ to Great Britain was signified to me by the Governor General in Council. In their Letter to you of “ the 12th January 1788, they said, “ we have perrrtitted Mr. Joseph I'oeoke to return to Europe on the Subsisteoce allowed in your General Letter of the 21st

“ of September 1785, to Servants of his Rank.” On my “ Arrival in England I applied to you for the Performance of your own solemn Engagement to your “ Servants abroad, on the Faith of which I quitted “ Bengal, in the Seventy-second Year of my Age. I “ complied with the Condition prescribed to me by “ yourselves, to entitle me to the Pension allotted to a Senior Merchant; X laid before you an Inventory “ of my little remaining Fortune upon Oath, and I “ am now at the End of Thirteen Months informed “ by your Authority, that you do not consider me as “ coming under the Description of Persons entitled “ by your Orders to receive Pensions. The Reasons, if there be any, for this Decision, are withheld from “ me. Standing the refore oh the clear and unquestionable Justice of the Case, made out and esta- blished in your own Terms, I must and do presume, that no Reasons, (not external to the Case itself) can be assigned for refusing my Claim. Jf I were aware “ of any, I would endeavour to answer, or I should “ certainly submit to them. When I entreated the “ Favour of you, on the 29th of December 1788, to be “ permitted to return to my Rank in your Service in “ India, I was not heard; my Constitution then gave “ me a Chance, and barely a Chance, of performing *another India Voyage; at present my debilitated “ State of Health makes it impossible for me to think “ of it; so that I cannot be benefited by your Per- mission of returning to my Rank in the Company’s “ Service by One of the Ships of this Season. Thus “ your rejecting my Claim of a Pension may be con- sidered as a total Dismission of me from your Ser- vice. But Deprivation of my Pension, or Dismission “ from your Service, are not the only Points on which “ I appeal to your Justice. You have hurt my Credit as a Merchant, by having obliged me, near Thirteen Months since, to deliver upon Oath an “ Inventory of my Effects, which revealed my straitened Circumstances to the World, by which Knowledge, if the Bitterness of my Misfortunes should u ever force me again Abroad, People might become “ shy of taking my Bills on , and apply to

“ others, whereby I should be totally excluded from M the Diamond Trade, should it ever become Free: “ What that Loss might be to me is not easy to esti-M mate, but it would be all I should have to lose. “ If it were ever so inconsiderable, you had no Rigfit “ to force me to declare myself a Pauper, unless you “ were resolved to relieve me. In plain Sense and “ common Justice, an Enquiry into my Circumstances could not possibly precede a Resolution to “ deny the Pension attached by yourselves to such “ Circumstances as mine. It was naturally the last “ Thing to be done in order to fix the Amount of an *? Allowance which the Enquiry itself admitted to be u due to me to some Amount or other, in Proportion “ to the Remnant of my Fortune; in any other View “ the Enquiry was useless to you, and could only “ operate as an Injury to me. By a Reliance on the w Good Faith of the Court of Directors, I have been “ cruelly misled to make a long Voyage of Eight Months, in a very advanced Age, and at an Expence " of full £. 700, to resign all Expectations of itn-proving my Fortune from your Service, or my own “ Industry; I have been kept in Suspense for near “ Sixteen Months, at the Expiration of which, I am “ told I may return to the Place from whence I came; “ without the smallest Consideration for my Expences “ out, my Expences home, my Expences in England, “ or for the Anguish of Disappointment. I am told “ to return to Calcutta, only to receive there what is “ refused to be paid me here, with a Violation of your “ Promise. My Father served you Fifty Years with “ Fidelity, without once quitting his Station; and it “ is now Fifty-three Years since I first entered your “ Service. I am now in the 74th Year of my Age,

“ and, after the personal Calamity which has lately “ fallen upon me, I cannot expect that Life should “ last much longer; yet even in this hopeless State,

“ after being so deeply wounded by your unmerited “ Severity, I mean not to solicit your Compassion; I “ mean only to satisfy you that your Justice cannot “ long be a Burthen to you.” — And that the Petitioner, having thus laid before the House the simplest Relation possible of his Sufferings, humbly submits himself to their Justice, to grant him such Relief as to their Wisdom shall seem best.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the same, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Burke, Mr. Baker, &c.:

And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to send for Persons, Papers, and Records.

A Petition of the Merchants and Inhabitants of Petition from Liverpool, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was LiverP°°l presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, thTcorn8R*-That the Petitioners conceive, the making any Alte- guiation CiU. ration in the Import Prices at which Foreign Corn hath heretofore been admitted, is inexpedient and unnecessary, and that the Admission of Com from Ireland, and His Majesty’s Colonies in America, at lower Average Prices than from Foreign Parts, will produce so much Uncertainty with respect to the Necessity for Supplies of Corn from Foreign Parts, as must deter every prudent Merchant from attempting to introduce such Supplies into this Country in Time to provide for its Wants, and it would be more expedient that a . Preference be given to Ireland and His Majesty’s Colonies in America, by imposing a greater Duty on Corn from Foreign Parts than from those Places; and that the Liberty heretofore allowed of Warehousing Foreign Com, when not importable at the Low Duties, is, as the Petitioners conceive, a Measure essential to the Existence of the Com Trade, and, without such Provision, great Quantities of Foreign Corn destined for this Kingdom, and which frequently arrive in a heated State, must be entirely ruined before they can reach any other Kingdom, and the Contingency of so much Risque would effectually discourage the Attempt to draw Supplies of Com from Foreign Countries, and that thereby the Resources, which this Kingdom hath hitherto enjoyed in Times of Scarcity, would be entirely lost; and that it would tend much to render this Kingdom a Granary for Foreign Corn, and to increase the Security of Remittarfces from Abroad to the British Manufacturer, if Foreign Corn, having paid the Duty, was continued under the King’s Lock, deliverable at any Time afterwards for Home Consumption, or for Exportation with a Drawback of the Duty, and it would further promote that desirable End, if such Corn was Warehoused at the Public Expence, the Importer to fix upon his own Warehouse, and to be allowed a certain Rate per Quarter for the Rent:

And therefore praying, That the House will take the Premises into Consideration.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Com imported, and of the Bounty on British Corn exported, is again re-committed.

Petition A Petition of several Persons, whose Names are

thereunto subscribed, being Trustees for putting in rough and Execution the several Acts of Parliament made for Leicester repairing the Road from the Borough of , in

Canal Bill, the County of Leicester, to the Town of Ashby la Zouch, in the said County, and of several other Persons, whose Names are thereunto also subscribed, being Creditors on the 'l olls arising on the said Road, on Behalf of themselves and others, Trustees and Creditors respectively as aforesaid, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Road from the Borough of Leicester, in the County of Leicester, to Ashby de la Zouch, in the said County, was heretofore in very bad Condition, and in many Places ruinous and dangerous, and the Petitioners, Creditors as aforesaid, of those under whom they claim, have subscribed large Sums of Money for the Purpose of making the same a Turnpike Road; and that the chief Object in making the said Turnpike Road* which goes near to the Principal and almost only Collieries in the said County of Leicester, that supplied the Town of Leicester and its Neighbourhood with Coals, was, that such Coals might be regularly brought there at a moderate Price at all Seasons of the Year, which they could not before be, by Reason of the ruinous State the said Road was in, and; that by Means of the said Road being Turnpike, and put and kept in a proper State of Repair, the said Object has been in great Measure effected, and the Tolls taken upon the said Road arise chiefly from the Carriage of Coals thereon; and that the Petitioners are informed a Bill is depending in the House, for making and maintaining a Navigable Communication between the Loughborough Canal and the Town of Leicester, and for making and maintaining a Communication by Railways, or Stone Roads, and Water Levels, from several Places and Mines to the said Loughborough Canal, and for continuing the same by passing along the said Canal to the said Navigable Communication, all in the County of Leicester, and if the said Bill should pass into a Law as it now stands, the Petitioners are apprehensive that the Collection of Tolls upon the said Road will be so much reduced, owing to great Quantities of Coals, which have usually been carried along the said Road, being then conveyed by Means of the said intended Navigable and other Communications, as not to raise Money sufficient to pay the Interest of the Sums subscribed as aforesaid, and keep the said Road in Repair: And therefore praying, That a Clause, or Clauses, may be inserted in the said Bill to indemnify the Petitioners against such Reduction of the Tolls on the said Road, as they are apprehensive will take Place, when such intended Navigable and other Communications are finished, and consequently be the Means of lessening, if not totally destroying, the Securities for the Monies subscribed as aforesaid, and leaving the Road in a ruinous State, or that they may be heard, by themselves, or their Counsel, against such Vo l. 46,

JVhitxvick, and from thence through Talbot Lane, to where the Road leading from the Town of Loughborough to the Town of Ashby de la Zouch, in the said County, comes in from Riley Lane, near to a Place called Snape Gate, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Road above described, from MarkfieldTurnpike to and through Talbot Lane,

was heretofore in very bad Condition, and in many Places ruinous and dangerous, and the Petitioners, or those under whom they claim, subscribed several Sums of Money, to the Amount of 971. 15$. for the Purpose of making the same a Turnpike Road; and that the only Object in making the said Turnpike Road, which goes near to the Collieries at Swanning-ton and Coal Orton,in the County of Leicester, was for opening a uearer and more commodious Passage for Coals from thence to the Turnpiko Road between the Town of Leicester and the Town of Ashby de la Zouch, in the said County, at Markfield Turnpike, and thereby producing a more regular Supply of Coals to the Town of Leicester and its Neighbourhood, at a reduced Price; and that the Tolls taken upon the said Road almost wholly arise from the Carriage of Coals thereon, and such Tolls for several Years past have scarcely been sufficient to pay Interest at the Rate of Two Pounds Ten Shillings per Cent, for the Money subscribed as aforesaid, and now owing to the Petitioners, on the Credit thereof, and leave a very small Sum to be applied in the Repair of the said Road; and that the Petitioners are informed a Bill is depending in the House for making and maintaining a

and, if the said Bill should pass into a Law as it now stands, the Petitioners are apprehensive that their Securities on the said Tolls will be greatly reduced in Value, if not totally annihilated, as the Coals which have usually been carried along the said Road, and produced almost the Whole of the Tolls taken thereon, will be conveyed by Means of the said intended Navigable and other Communications, some Branch whereof, the Petitioners are informed, will go very near to the Extremity of the said Road at Snape Gate:

presented to the House, and read; Taking Notice of the Bill for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Com imported, and of the Bounty on British Corn exported; and Setting forth, That the Clause in the said Bill, called the Warehouse Clause, hath, as the Petitioners are informed, been rejected by the House, and the Petitioners apprehend, that, unless some Provision shall be made in the said Bill for the Landing of Foreign Com under the King’s Lock, that may arrive after the Ports are shut, as heretofore hath been in Practice, the Petitioners will be liable to great Injury, and their Trade very unnecessarily impeded: And therefore praying the House to insert such Clause or Clauses in the said Bill as may be proper to permit such Landing as aforesaid, ana thereby

prevent the Injury and Inconvenience which the Petitioners so justly apprehend.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the said Bill is again re-committed.

Exportation of Corn be passed into a Law, Oat-meal will be importable into England at a Low Duty, whenever the Price of Oats shall be at or above Sixteen Shillings per Quarter, which corresponds nearly to the low Price of Twelve Shillings and Nine Pence per Boll of Meal, weighing 140 lbs. Avoirdupoise, supposing, as estimated in the Bill, that each Bushel of Oats produces 22 lbs. of Oat-meal, but, by the said

Law,

Law, it will not be lawful to ittoport Oat-meal into Scotland till the Price be at or above Sixteen Shillings per Boll, which, by the same Rule, is equal to above Twenty Shillings per Quarter of Oats, and, that it will be lawful at all Times to import Oat-meal into England\upon Payment of a Duty of Three Shillings per Hundred Weight, while it will not be importable into Scotland ut any Rate, if the Price be under Sixteen Shillings per Boll; and that, as the People of Scotland are entitled to the same Privileges, in relation to Trade, as their Fellow Subjects South of the Tweed, the Petitioners conceive these Distinctions to be a most hostile Attack on their Rights, and inconsistent with the Principles and Articles of the Union of the Two Kingdoms; and that the Import Rate for Scotland proposed by the Bill will also be highly destructive to the Manufactures of the Country, as it will tend to raise, in a very high Degree, the Price of Oat-meal, the principal Food of the labouring Poor, and of course the Rate of Wages: And therefore praying the House to allow the Petitioners to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, in Support of this Petition, and to alter the Bill, by making the Import Rates of Oats and Oatmeal the same for Scotland as it is proposed to be for England.

“ Port of Sallee in South Barba rtf and The Cape of “ Good Hope, when, and at such Times, and in such “ Manner, and iu or with such Quantity of Goods, “ W ares, or Merchandize, as he or they shall think fit, “ without any Restraint whatsoever;” and that, if the Views of the Petitioners for such exclusive Grant are only what they set forth, “ to erect Houses, Warehouses, and Places of Security for the Persons employed in their Service, to conduct a general Trade “ nnd Commerce to and with the Western Coasts “ of Africa and the interior Countries of that Continent,” every requisite Provision, as the Petitioners apprehend, is already granted to such Persons, in common with the rest of His Majesty’s Subjects, by the 2«Sth Section of the aforesaid Act, which enacts, “ that it shall and may be lawful for any of “ His Majesty’s Subjects trading to Africa, for the Security of their Goods and Slaves, to erect Houses and Warehouses under the Protection of the said “ Forts, or elsewhere, in any other Part of Africa, “ within the Limits aforesaid, for the better carrying “ on his or their Trade there, which Houses and “ Warehouses shall be the Property of the Person “ or Persons who shall build the same, but shall not “ be disposed of, or let, to any Foreigner whatso- everand that, the Petitioners conceive, the Persons applying for such exclusive Grant are influenced rather by Motives of Private Interest and the Expectation of a lucrative Monopoly, so repugnant to that Spirit of Commercial Freedom which characterises the Opinions of the present Age, than a Regard to the general Good, nor does it appear that such Persons are entitled, from any Services done, to the Public, or otherwise, to any extraordinary Remuneration or Public Favour, and particularly not in a Way circumstanced like the present, which would so very materially interfere with an established System of Commerce in the quiet Enjoyment of which the Petitioners have long remained uninterrupted; and that, if the Application be granted to the Extent prayed for, it would exclude the Petitioners from the advantageous Trade which they have hitherto carried on in the River Sierra Leona, and the intermediate Country from thence to the River Camaranca inclusively, and give to the Persons so applying a Monopoly of the Camwood Trade, enhance the Price of that valuable Commodity to the British Manufacturer, and be, in many other Respects, prejudicial to the Commercial Interests of this Country; that any Monopoly must, in its Consequences, raise the Price of Rice and other Provisions and Necessaries, which have hitherto been furnished by the Natives of that Part of the Coast of Africa to the British Shipping, in great Quantities, and at reasonable Rates, and preclude His Majesty’s Subjects from the Advantages of a free Navigation and Commerce there: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves, their Counsel, or Agents, against such Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law.

Ordered \That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for establishing a Company for carrying 011 Trade between the Kingdom of Great Xou 46.

Ordered, That the Bill, with the Amendments, be ingrossed.

A Petition of the Merchants, Manufacturers, and Petition re-other Inhabitants, of the Town of Sheffield, whose ®Pect‘"gtlie Names are thereunto subscribed, was presented to the tio^ Bill8'1 House, and read; Setting forth, That a regular Supply of Com and Flour, at reasonable Prices, being of the utmost Consequence to the labouring Manufacturers and Poor of that Place, it was with great Satisfaction the Petitioners observed that the House were taking the Subject of the Corn Laws into Consideration, not doubting that such Regulations would be adopted for the Encouragement of the Importation of Corn, when the Prices were high, which, at the same Time, would not prove injurious to the Agriculture of this Country, but it is with great Concern they understand, that in the Bill before the House a Clause, relative to the Warehousing of Corn upon the Importation, when the High Duties prevail, has been rejected by the Committee; and that the Petitioners apprehend such a Clause, by allowing the Merchant Importer a Place where he can deposit his Com under certain Restrictions, will have a Tendency to

encourage

4

445

encourage the Importation, and frequently enable him to avoid the immediate Necessity of a Re-exportation, and the consequent Loss arising therefrom: And

therefore praying the House to re-consider the said Clause, and either to adopt it, or to introduce some other Clause to the like Purport, whereby an Importation may be encouraged when the Prices of Com or Flour are unreasonably high, and, at the same*Time, a due Provision may be made for guarding against any Thing which may be injurious to the Agriculture and Improvement of the Waste Lands in this Country.

Petition re- A Petition of the Merchants of London trading to epecting the the Province of Quebec, was also presented to the UonBiJl House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners observe by the Votes, that a Bill is depending for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and they conceive that some Part of the said Bill may materially affect their Interests, as well as the Interests of the Province; and that there are now in the said Province considerable Quantities of Wheat and Flour for Exportation, the Value of which will be a great Benefit and Convenience to the Petitioners, by facilitating Remittances for their Exports from Great Britain; and that, since the Yeas 1773, Foreign Corn, Meal, and Flour, have at all Times been allowed to be landed at certain Ports in Great Britain, and Warehoused, under the joint Locks of the King and Merchant, and from thence re-exported, or taken out for Home Consumption, upon Payment of the Duties then due, which Privilege has been a great Convenience to Trade, and highly advantageous to the Navigation and Commerce of Great Britain, the Grain and flour imported and Warehoused being re-exported chiefly in British Bottoms, or consumed tn this Kingdom, when the Prices of British Grain rendered Foreign Supplies necessary, and it is not within the Knowledge or Belief of the Petitioners, that the Privilege of Warehousing Grain and Flour has ever been abused, or has been prejudicial to the Agriculture of this Kingdom; and that, deprived of the said Privilege, the Petitioners, and their Correspondents in Canada, will, in Times of general Plenty, be compelled to lodge their Grain in the Granaries of Foreign Nations, to the manifest Loss of the Commerce and Navigation of this Kingdom, and the Petitioners conceive it to be sound Policy of Nations essentially Mercantile to encourage and protect the depdt of Merchandize generally, especially of a Necessary of life; and that the Preservation of the said Privilege to the Province of Quebec is the more essential, because, when the Ports of Great Britain open at the Low Duties, it may happen in the Winter Months, when the Navigation of the River Saint Laurence is closed, and, even if that should not be the Case, the Petitioners may not be able to avail themselves thereof, it being more than probable that Supplies from nearer Countries would shut the Ports before Arrivals could be expected from a Country so distant, in consequence of Advices that they were opened; and that the local Disadvantage of the Province of Quebec in respect to Navigation, its Distance from Great Britain, and the consequent Delay, Expence, and Risque, in importing Corn from thence, together with the Advantage accruing to the Mother Country from the Payments being made by Exports of Manufactures, entitle that Province, in the Opinion of the Petitioners, to the Continuance of the Warehouse Clause as Part of the Bill, and also to some Preference in the Price at which the Ports shall open, not only to Foreign Nations, but even to Ireland, which, front its Vicinity, can avail itself of the Markets of Great Britain at very little Expence and Risque, and the Petitioners are informed, and believe, that the Wheat of Ireland is generally greatly inferior in Quality and Value to that produced in the Province of Quebec: Aud therefore praying, That the House will continue the Warehouse Vox. 46.

Clause a Part of the present Com Bill, and grant such Preference to the Trade of the British Colonies in affixing the Price at which the Ports shall open, as to the House shall seem meet

A Petition of the Merchants of the City of London, Petition reconcerned in the Commerce with the United States of *Pening die America, was likewise presented to the House, and ^0^** read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are engaged in an extensive Export Trade to the United States of America, that their Exports consist principally of the Manufactures of Great Britain ana Ireland, and of Goods imported by the East India Company, and that a very considerable Part of the Remittances thq Petitioners have received in Payment for such Exports, bas been in Wheat and Flour, the Produce of the said States; and that the Petitioners entertain very serious Apprehensions of their Trade being materially injured by a Bill, now depending in the House, for regulating the Exportation and Importation of Com, in case the Price at which Wheat shall be imported on the Low Duty shall, by the said Bill, exceed Forty-eight Shillings per Quarter, or be subjected to the High Duty when under that Average, unless the House, should introduce a Clause in the said Bill, permitting Cargoes to be landed according to the Regulations now in Force, under the Inspection of the proper Officers, such Cargoes to be Warehoused under the joint Locks of the King and the Importer, a Privilege which has been allowed from the Year 1773 in certain specified Ports, where Cargoes landed under such Restriction have remained until the Importer deter-, mined to re-export them, or to take them out for Home Consumption on Payment of the Duties then due; and that the said Privilege has been, and is, very advantageous to the Navigation, Commerce, and Manufactures, of this Country, ’ in as much as the Grain and Flour imported from America, and landed as stated by the Petitioners, are either exported chiefly in British Bottoms, or consumed in this Country, at Times when the Prices of British have indicated the Want of Foreign Grain, and it is not within the Knowledge or Belief of the Petitioners, that the Privilege of Warehousing Grain has been abused, or is likely to be attended with any Prejudice to the Agriculture of this Kingdom, and, that should the Petitioners be deprived of it, they must, be under the Necessity of sending the Cargoes to Foreigners, who will derive those Advantages from the Deposit which this Country has hitherto enjoyed, and it is the more necessary to preserve the said Privilege for Cargoes of American Grain, because those Cargoes are frequently, so heated in Consequence of long Voyages, or so much injured by Sea Water, as to render the Landing them indispensably necessary for their Preservation, and because, when the Ports of Great Britain may open for Importation at the Low Duties, there cannot ba sufficient Time for the Petitioners or their Correspondents to avail themselves thereof, as it is more than probable that the earlier Supplies from Europe will' cause the Ports to be shut before any Arrivals can be expected from America in Consequence of Communications from hence: And therefore praying the House to take their Case into Consideration, and to admit the Importation of Foreign Wheat on the Low Duty, when the Average Price will be at or above Forty-eight Shillings per Quarter, and the Warehousing the same when under that Limitation, subject to the Regulations now in Force.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Corn imported, and of the Bounty on British Com exported, is again re-committed.

complied with; but that, since the Notices were given, upon surveying the new intended Line of Road, it was found that it would be convenient to make a small Alteration in the Termination of it, by bringing it into the 'TittensorTurnpike Road at a Place about 260

Yards distant from where it was intended to terminate when the Notices were given; and that all the Parties, whose Lands were to be cut in making the said Alteration, had given their Consent thereto; und that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the same, as it

appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerks Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, the said Act was read: And,

That it would be of great Public Utility, as well as particular Convenience and Advantage to the Persons engaged in certain Manufactories carried on in the Parish of Stoke upon Trent, if the said Trustees were enabled to make and open a new Road, branching out of, and leading from, the said Turnpike Road in the said Parish of Stoke upon Trent, at the House of standing upon the 9aid Road, known by the Sign of The Black Lion, to Shelton Wharf, at or near Cliffe Gate Bank.^And he added, That by making the said new Road, it will open a more commodious Communication between the present Turnpike Road and the Turnpike Road leading from Derby to the Town of Newcastle under Lyme, and will considerably shorten the Distance for Carriage and travelling between the Two Turnpike Roads before mentioned.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill to enlarge the Term and Powers of an Act, passed in the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for reducing into One Act of Parliament the several Laws now in Force for repairing the Road leading from the Town or Village of “ Tittensor to the most Northern Part of Talk on the Hill, in Butt Lane, in the County of Stafford; and “ for repairing the Road from Darlastone , over “ Tittensor Heath, through the Town or Village of “ Tittensor aforesaidand for making and keeping in Repair a Road branching out of the said Turnpike Road, near the House known by the Sign of The Black Lion, to or nearly to Shelton Wharf, all in the Parish of Stoke upon Trent, in the said County of Stafford: And that Mr. Crawfurd, and Mr. Attorney General do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Sir William Lemon reported from the Committee, to Pilchard whom the Petition of the Fishermen and Adventu- Fishery Ad-rers in the Pilchard Fishery, in the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, was referred; That the Committee porte<L had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the same, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act, made in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act to con-

tinue and amend an Act, made in the Twenty-fifth “ Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for the “ Encouragement of the Pilchard Fishery, by allowing a farther Bounty upon Pilchards taken, cured,

“ and exported,” was read; by which Act an additional Bounty of Two Shillings per Hogshead (not exceeding 20,000 Hogsheads, but if they exceeded that Number, then the Sum of £. 2.000 to be equally divided) was granted on all Pilchards taken in any Season for Five Years: And,

Mr. Thomas Tree re, a Merchant at Penryn, being examined, said, That the Pilchard Fishery has been for several Years in a declining State, till the last Year, when it began to increase — That the Quantity of Fish caught from the Year 1785 to the Year 1790 has been 7,000 Hogsheads Annually upon an Average; but that in the* Year 1790 about 50,000 Hogsheads were caught, and exported up the Mediterranean, except Three small Cargoes, which were exported to France, Tenerife, and St. Sebastian.

And being asked, Whether any Quantity besides those 50,000 Hogsheads were circulated for the interior Consumption of Cornwall? he said, Yes; the poorer Sort of People live chiefly upon Pilchards and Potatoes.

That

That before the Year 1790 the Fishing Craft were in a State of Decay and Ruin; and that it will be attended with a considerable Expence to put them into very good Repair.

And being asked, Whether the Bounty of Two Shillings per Hogshead granted in the Year 1786, was a seasonable Relief to those concerhed in the Pilchard Fishery ? he said, It was, being much wanted; but that the Term of that additional Bounty will expire the 24th of June 1791.

And being asked, Whether a Renewal of such additional Bounty would not probably enable the Fishermen to put the Fishery on a firm and lasting Establishment? he said, It would; nor can it be done without they have some further Aid. Then,

Mr. Philip Ball,a Fish Curer, being examined, confirmed the foregoing Evidence; but he did not speak to the Quantity of Pilchards exported, it hot being within his Province.

Mr; Treere being again called, was asked, Whether it would not be of great Advantage to the Fishery, if the Bounty was to be permanent? he answered, Yes; and that he does not think the additional Bounty, in its present State, would answer the Purpose of supporting the Fishery.

And being asked, What Alteration of Bounty would answer that Purpose ? he said, By a permanent Bounty, to be consolidated and paid at the same Time with the old Bounty; he meant a fixed Sum per Hogshead upon the whole Quautity taken;

The Witness then produced to your Committee several Papers, containing Statements of the present Establishment of the Fishery; which are hereunto annexed, N* 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. And,

Mr. JViUiam Hitchins, and Mr. Edward Tregurtha, Fish Curers at Newlyn,near , being called,

confirmed the Whole of Mr. Treeve's Evidence.

A Petition of the Merchants of London trading to Africa\was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners have observed by the Votes, that Application has been made by several Persons (who have already formed themselves into a Society) praying to be incorporated under the Description of The Saint George's Bay Company, with an exclusive Right to be vested in them of a certain District called The Peninsula of Sierra , and such Lands adjoining as they may make a Purchase of hereafter, or obtain by Grant from such of the African Princes as may have a Right therein; and that the said Peninsula commands tfte Entrance of the River Sierra Leona, which is the only commodious Harbour for Shipping to shelter themselves in in case of Distress of Weather, and wherein alone can be procured Water, Wood, and Provisions, at an easy Expence, and without Trouble, unless in a Distance of near One thousand Six hundred Miles along the Coast, which Articles of Refreshment are absolutely necessary to the Shipping of this Country, as well as those of different Nations, who have usually resorted thereto, not only on that Account, but also for the Cultivation of a very valuable Commerce in Wood, Ivory, &c. which are brought down the said River from the interior Parts of the adjacent Country, and which Articles will be denied to the Petitioners, should an exclusive Grant be made of the said Peninsula commanding the said River, and, by such Grant, the Petitioners conceive that the British Shipping only will be excluded from partaking of the Benefits of the said River, which must continue still a Place of great Utility to Foreigners, who, by the Treaty of Peace with France in September 1783, are “ permitted to resort to the Coast of Africa, “ according to the Usage that hath hitherto prevailed,” which Restriction must operate and prove very oppressive and detrimental to the Interest of the British Merchants, inasmuch as they will be totally excluded from the Benefits of a Situation so highly necessary to their Shipping, as well as to their Commerce, whilst the Benefits resulting from that advantageous Situation will continue to be enjoyed unmolested by the Subjects of all other European Nations trading to the Coast: And therefore praying, That the Premises may be taken into Consideration, and that the House, from what has been suggested, will not suffer the said Bill to pass into a Law.

A Petition of the Committee of the Company of Merchants trading to Africa,was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That by an Act of the Twenty-third of his late Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for “ extending and improving the Trade to ,” the

said Trade is declared to be free and open to all His Majesty’s Subjects, who shall trade to or from any of the Ports or Places of Africa between Cape Blanco and The Cape of Good Hope, who shall for ever after be a Body Corporate and Politick, by the Name of The Company of Merchants trading to Africa, and that the Direction and Management of the Affairs of the said Company shall be in and by a Committee of Nine Persons to be chosen Annually; and that the Petitioners, being the present Committee of the said Company, understanding that a Bill has been brought into the House, for the Purpose of obtaining to certain Persons, styling themselves The Saint George's Bay Company, an exclusive Grant of a considerable District of Country in Africa, within the Limits granted to the said free Company, by the said Act of Parliament,

and in direct Violation of the same, they beg Leave to represent to the House, that this Country derived little or no Benefit from the African Trade, while it continued for near Ninety Years in the Hands of a Joint Stock Company, aided by every Encouragement, Countenance, and Support, which Government could afford it, but that immediately after passing the said Act, for the Establishment of a free and open Trade, it improved with astonishing Rapidity, and has continued for several Years to be One of the most valuable and important Branches of the British Commerce, from whence it is evident, that the Nation is indebted solely to the Enterprize and Industry of the Adventurers under the present free Establishment for those great Advantages, and in Consideration of which the' Petitioners, on Behalf of the said free Company, trust in the Justice of the House, that they shall not be deprived of any Part of the Rights and Privileges which they have so deservedly enjoyed under the said Act; and that the Petitioners are very sensible, if the Evils resulting from the intended Monopoly were to be estimated only by a Comparison of the Thirty Leagues required by the said Bill, with the whole Extent of the Coast of Africa, from the Port of Sallee to The Cape of Good Hope, the Injury to the free Trade would, upon that Principle, appear very trifling, and if the Monopolists had been satisfied with the Thirty Leagues at either End of that Line, they would not have presumed to trouble the House with any Application against it, but they beg Leave to represent, that the free Trade, and the National Benefit derived from it, would be very materially injured by an exclusive Grant of any Part of the Coast between Cape Blanco and the Extremity of Angola, which are the usual Limits of the British Commerce, and more especially of that particular Part, which is the Object of the present Bill, because, upon the Windward Coast of Africa, comprehending a Space of about Three hundred Leagues, and nearly in the Center of which that District of Country is situated, the Ships are not destined to particular Ports as in other Places of Trade, but perform their Voyages by a general Barter or Exchange of Commodities along the whole Range of it, an Interruption in the Center and most valuable Part of which would often prove destructive to their Voyages; and further, because this very Bay, now called George's Bay, is the only good Harbour upon that Coast, where Ships of any Burthen may lie in Safety at all Seasons of* the Year, the only Place where they can have good Water, where they can Wood with most Convenience, and the Country upon which they have generally the chief Dependence for their other Provisions; and that the Petitioners further beg Leave to observe, that an exclusive Grant of the above District, while it would be attended with infinite Prejudice to the British free Trader, could not possibly produce any real Advantage to the Grantees, and might be a Means of leading this Country into Disputes with other European Nations, because the Right of Trade upon the Coasts of it has been always claimed, and actually enjoyed, by all the different European Nations trading to Africa, and in the last Treaty of Peace with France It is particularly stipulated, that the unappropriated Coast, of which that was known, and always admitted to be, a Part, should be resorted to by both Nations, in like Manner, as was practised before the War; and that the Petitioners finally beg Leave to remind the House, that this is not an Opposition of the private Interest of One Merchant,- or Company of Traders, against those of another, that the present Petition is in Defence of the most valuable Interests of the Nation at large, against the Views of a few Individuals, who, without Public Service, or any other Claim to preeminent Favour, are attempting, on this Occasion, to sacrifice the Public Good to their own private Emolument: And therefore praying, That the House will take 9 the

the Premises into their serious Consideration, that they will not suffer any Bill to pass through the House, for the Purpose of granting exclusive Privileges, or a Mo* nopoly of any Part of the Trade to , to the Prejudice of the free Trader, but, on the contrary, that they will be pleased to -take such Measures as to them may appear necessary, not only for the more effectual Security, but for the further Encouragement and Improvement of the free and open Trade to all His Majesty’s Subjects.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the Bill for establishing a Company for carrying on Trade between the Kingdom of Great Br, and the Coasts, Harbours, and Countries of Africa, and for enabling the said Company to hold, by Grant from His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, and from the Native Princes of Africa, a certain District of Land, commonly called The Peninsula of Sierra Leona, now vested in His Majesty, or belonging to the said Princes, for the better enabling the said Company to carry on the said Trade, be read a Second Time.

Ordered, That there be laid before this House, Copies of the several Accounts transmitted from the Officers of the Customs in the British West India Islands, or elsewhere, as far as relate to the Importation of Negroes from the Coasts of Africa to the said Islands, or other His Majesty’s Colonies, together with an Account of the Certificates, from the said Officers, delivered by the Masters and Surgeons of Ships employed in that Trade, and of the Bounties paid to such Masters and Surgeons in consequence thereof, and in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, passed in the last Session of the last Parliament, intituled, “ An Act to amend and continue, for a “ limited Time, several Acts of Parliament for regulating “ the shipping and carrying Slaves in British Vessels “ from the Coast of Africa ”

Ordered, That the Order of the Day, for the Second Reading of the Bill for establishing a Company for carrying on Trade between the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Coasts, Harbours, ana Countries of and for enabling the said Company to hold, by Grant from His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, and from the Native Princes of Africa, a certain District of Land, commonly called The Peninsula of Sierra Leona, now vested in His Majesty, or belonging to the said Princes, for the better enabling the said Company to carry on the said Trade, be now read.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for enlarging the Powers of an Act, passed in the Twenty-ninth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Actr for re-building the Parish Church of “ Saint Chad, in tire Town of Shrewsbury, and County

Resolved, That this House will, upon Monday Morning next, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, upon the said Bill.

A Petition of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty, of Merchant Venturers of the City of Bristol, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners observe by the Votes, that a Bill is depending for the Purpose of incorporating a Company for carrying on such Trade as in the said Bill is mentioned, by the Name of The Saint George's Bay Company, and for granting them the sole Use, Property, and Possession, of The Peninsula of Sierra , as now vested in His Majesty, and for making further Purchases there: That the Creation of Corporate Bodies, liable only in that Capacity, and not Individually, to the Payment of their Debts, and for Purposes like, the Subject of the present Application, in which considerable Debts may, and most probably would, be contracted, ought to he regarded with the most jealous Eye, after the Mischiefs which at former Periods the Public has felt from this Cause, and however respectable the Persons may be who patronize the present Project, yet’it may hereafter fall under the Management of designing Individuals, and become in their Hapds the Implement of Fraud.and Deception: That exclusive Companies, if necessary or politic in any Point of View, can only be so where the Commerce proposed is of too great Magnitude or Extent to be undertaken by Individuals, but that this by no Means is the Case with the Trade which is said to be the Object of the present Application, for, if it has the Appearance of being lucrative and advantageous, sufficient Capitals will readily be embarJced in 'it, without granting the Privileges and Restrictions proposed by the Bill, and which are so inimical to the free Spirit of Trade; and that such Restrictions can only operate on the Subjects of Great Britain, as Sierra Leona has ever been a free and open Port to all European Nations, and the Right of the French to trade there was recognized by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 between His Majesty and the Most Christian King, and it would be highly impolitic and unwise to give Umbrage to Foreign Powers by any Assertion or Claim of Right to that Territory, especially unfounded in Justice, as the Petitioners conceive such would be:. That the . intended Restrictions will directly infringe the Privileges given to British Subjects by the Act of the Twenty-fifth of his late Majesty King Georthe Second, Chapter the 31st, in which it was enacted, that it shall be lawr ful for all His Majesty’s Subjects to trade to and from any Port in Africa, between Sallee in South and

The Cape of Good Hope, when, and at such Times, and in such Manner, and in or with such Quantities of Goods, Wares, and Merchandizes, as they shall think fit, without any Restraint whatsoever, winch Act was passed after repeated Contests, with exclusive Companies, and the Experience of those Mischiefs which the present Attempt is calculated to revive: That the Act above alluded to, authorizes the Persons applying for the intended Bill, in common with all others His Majesty’s Subjects, to erect Houses and Warehouses within the aforesaid Limits, for better carrying on their Trade, and, under that Provision, the Petitioners conceive what is held forth as the ostensible Object of the Bill now depending may be equally as well obtained as if it should pass into a'Law; and that the said Application, if attended with Success, will have an immediate Effect to check and injure a Trade which the Petitioners have always looked on, and are now authorized by a late Decision of this House to consider, as of the utmost National Importance, and the Petitioners cannot but imagine the present Attempt is intended indirectly tq affect that Commerce which the Wisdom of the House has not permitted to be 6 A. - shaken

shaken by any open Attack: That this Supposition of the Petitioners must appear not void of Foundation, when it is remarked that the River Sierra Leona affords the only Harbour in a great Extent of Coast where Vessels of any Size can safely enter at all Seasons without a Pilot, and it is of the utmost Importance to those resorting to that Coast, and requiring Repairs, or a Supply of Wood, Water, or Provision; and that, should the intended Bill pass, it must raise the Price of those Provisions and Necessaries, with which the Natives of that Territory furnish the British Shipping in great Quantities, and at reasonable Rates, must give a. Monopoly of the Camwood Trade to the intended Company, enhance the Price of that Article to the Manufacturer, and be prejudicial in other Respects to the Commercial Interest of this Country: And therefore praying, That such Bill may not pass into a Law.

Ordered', That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Report be received from the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for establishing a Company , for carrying on Trade between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Coasts, Harbours, and Countries, of Africa, and for enabling the said Company to hold, by Grant from His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, and from the Native Princes of Africa, a certain District of Land, commonly called The Peninsula of Sierra Leona, now vested in His Majesty, or belonging to the said Princes, for the better enabling the said Company to carry on the said Trade, is committed.

Acres of fertile-and- valuable Land; and that a Line of Boundary bfttvveeOv the said Company’s Lands and the ancient Marshes in the.said Parishes of Flint, Holywell, ford, and Uanasaph,-has been set out and agreed to,

and the Lands severed, by- the River Dee in Northop Parish/and by the said Line of Boundary, in the other Parishes now - petitioning, are, among others, the Lands'proposed to be erected into a Township sepa-. rate.from, and independent of, the said Parishes; and that- the-Company' have embanked and inclosed a large-Quantity of Land in- Haroarden Parish, and have,. for Pifty-Years- past, had the Benefit of the- Labour of the ^Inhabitants-ofbhe- neighbouring Parishes thereon, but-:have^oot built- any Habitations for the Abode of Labourers, who therefore cannot acquire Settlements oh their Lands, but, in Age and Infirmity, become burthensome to the Parishes where they inhabit, and, if the said Clauses pass into a Law, the River Dee Company (being.entire Owners of all the Lands corn-prized-therein, and acting in Concert under the Go-, vernment of one Interest, which is anxiously watched oVer by a permanent Committee) may prevent the Residence ' of Labourers, the hiring of Servants for a Year, - and the; charging1 of any of the numerous Taxes collected -under the Names -of Land Tax, Church Rate, Poor Rate, and County Rate, and consequently they -will- be exempt from the Parliamentary Taxes,-dhd other -Public-Burthens, which all other Landed Property in the Kingdom is subject to; and that the Consequences to the petitioning Parishes are obvious,’ they being divided into very numerous Inheritances, and occupied by Tenants of various Interests, employed in different Pursuits, the Intrusion of Poor Persons employed by the Company could not be prevented,* the Increase of -Settlements could not be guarded against, and, whilst the Company would enjoy all the Benefit of the Labour of the Poor, the Inhabitants of these Parishes, where their Domicils woqld be, would have to bear the Burthen of their Maintenance; and that the Lands which the Company have already inclosed re-pay them in great Yearly Repts, and the Channel of the said River produces them a considerable Income from. Tonnage Duties paid for all Vessels1 navigating thereon, which ought to be subject to the Taxes for the Relief of the Poor Of the Parishes in which they are received, and that there is no Provision made in the BUI for erecting Chanels or Places of Public Worship in any Part of the

great Tract of Land belonging to the said Company, the Inhabitants must therefore for all Religious Purposes, attend the neighbouring‘Parish Churches; and that all beneficial Corporations for making Canals, for recovering or embanking Lands, or any other Purposes, from whidh the Undertakers derive or‘expect Benefit, are, by the Laws creating them (as the Petitioners have been informed) subjected, or left1 subject, to the TaJtes and Duties of the Parishes in which they jay, and the Petitioners submit to the House, that it would be contrary to the Policy of the Legislature in all other. Instances, and of the Laws for the Relief of the Poor, as well as highly injurious and unjust to the Petitioners, if the said Clauses pass into a Law; and that the Petitioners had not, collectively or individually, any Notice or Intimation^ whatsoever of the said Bill, or of the said Company’s Intention to get. their Lands erected into a Township, and severed from the said Parishes, nor did they dis-i cover that such Intentions existed, until an Alarm,1 raised in the said Parish of Hawarden, was spread through the Country, and the Petitioners were convened by Public Advertisement to meet, the Petitioners are* therefore justifiable in concluding, that thq Clauses they oppose were intended to be surreptitiously passed into a Law as unopposed, or tacitly consented to, by them: And therefore praying. That the Clauses in the said Bill for erecting the Lands of the said Company, mentioned in the Bill, into a separate Township, and for maintaining the Poor within the same by the Inhabitant^ and Occupiers of Lands therein, shall not be enacted into a Law.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the said Bill is committed; anti the first mentioned Petitioners are to be heard, by themselves, or Counsel, before the said Committee, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee to whom the said Bill is committed.

Sir Adam Fergusson reported from the Committee, to whom the Petition of several Householders within the Cities of London and Westminster, for themselves-and others, w>as referred; That the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the same, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Doctor Richard Brocklesby gave the Committee the following Information: That within these Three

Years, being in Want of a Servant, he advertised; upon which a proper Servant, seemingly, offered, and referred him to the Master of a House in Chappel Street, May Fair, where there was every Appearance of Credit and Character: The pretended Master gave the Man an excellent Character, and the Witness hired him: That, having served him a little more than a Month, he told the Doctor that his Service would not suit him; whereupon he Was discharged the same Night — he had also persuaded Three other Servants to quit the Service of the Doctor at the same Time. — That, within a few Days after the Servants left him, his House was robbed, and Plate, which cost nearly £. 200, was taken from a Chest where it was usually kept, and which was in a Room on the Ground Floor, behind his Study — the Robbers did not appear to have gone to any other Part of the House. Early in the Morning, it was perceived that One of the Windows in the Drawing Room, where there are Pictures (and which Room is not commonly used) was open, and supposed to have been left so before the Servants left the House; for by this Window the Robbers appeared to have entered, from a Foot Mark found on the Lamp Iron, and on the Ledge of the Window, the Shutter of which is usually secured by an Iron Bar across it, but on which no Mark of Force appeared.

The Witness further said, That he procured a Warrant, and had all the Servants before a Magistrate, but nothing could be made out against them, although their Lodgings were searched — That, on the Examination of the Man Servant above mentioned, he owned before the Magistrate that he had paid a Guinea to the Keeper of the House in May Fair for a Character, and was to give him in Proportion to the Time of

Petition relating to Kingston and Sheetbridge Road Bill.

his Stay in the Doctor’s Service — That the Magistrate sent to the House in May Fair, and it was found that the pretended Housekeeper had decamped a Fortnight before; and on Investigation of his Character, he appeared to have been on the Suspicious Books at Bozo Street.

John Free, Esquire, being next examined, informed your Committee, That about Two Months since, being in Want of a Coachman, he was much pleased with the Appearance of a Man who offered himself to him in that Capacity, particularly so when he told hiift he had lived in his last Place Three Years and a Half; that he had left it about a Month, and that Bis Reason for so doing, was on Account of his Master’s having put down his Carriage' on some Family Misfortunes — He told him his Master’s Name was that he lived in Suffolk, but came to London about this Time of the Year for Three or Four Months, and was then at his usual Place of Residence when in Town, at Doctor Palin's, N° 48, Gr Russell Street, Bloomsbury — The next Morning, on being told by the Coachman that his Master would be in the Way, the Witness called on Mr. Pointer, who confirmed all the Coachman had said, and gave him so good a Character, that the Witness almost suspected the Truth of what he said; however, the Appearance of the House, and a Servant in Livery, soon did away his Suspicions, and he hired the Coachman — That, about a Week afterwards, having some Company, a Friend of his directly knew him, from his having lived with his Father about a Twelvemonth past — this rather alarmed him, and, from some Words that dropped from his Friend, he began to fear he had received a false Character of his Servant — That the Witness interrogated the Servant, and on his not giving a satisfactory Account of himself, ordered him to take off his Livery, and quit his House — That, after paying him his Wages, he again interrogated him, and brought him to confess, that Pointer was a Man notoriously in the Habit of giving false Characters to Servants out of Place, and that for what he had said of him he had paid him One Guinea — He said, a Fellow-servant who had been successful in getting into a Family by this Man’s Mearts, had advised him to adopt this Me-' thod. — That the Witness called at Doctor Palin's this Morning, and found the Impostor was gone; but from his Landlord’s Account, he understood that he

had hired his Lodgings for a few Weeks, passing himself off for a Man of Property in Gloucestershire, but that he had been discovered by some Person in the Neighbourhood, and had left his House — The Witness was also informed that he went by the Names of Punter, Pointer, and Pritchard; by the latter Name he has endeavoured to find him out, particularly at a Place that he often frequents, the Orange Tree, in Orange Street, Bloomsbury, a Rendezvous for Servants out of Place.

The Witness further said, That this Man has carried on the Trade a long Time, hiring Lodgings at different Times, in reputable Situations, and passing himself for a Country Gentleman, come to Town for a short Time. — And he added, That a Friend of his had made Application to Sir Sampson lVright, who informed him that the'Person above mentioned was well known at the Public Office, but advised him to let the Matter drop, as nothing could be done towards punishing him.

Then,

Mr. James Tluntingford being examined, said, That about Two Years ago his Mother hired a Feihale Servant, . recommended to her by David Reid, a Taylor, near Dean Street, Soho — That, having some Suspicion that his Mother had been imposed upon by the

Witness applied to him, and asked him, Whether the Certificate was given by him ? which he acknowledged; and confessed that she had paid him very handsomely for her Board, and that he therefore gave her the Certificate; which, although it was forged, no Punishment could be inflicted on him.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill to prevent the forging and counterfeiting Certificates of Servants Characters: And that Sir Adam Mr. Adam, and Mr. Hawkins Browne, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

The House being informed that Mr. Farhill, Secretary Account of to the Commissioners for Reduction of the National of

Debt, attended at the Door; he was called in; and at pre. the Bar, presented to the House, pursuant to the Direc- scnted. tions of an Act of Parliament,

The Account of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt.

And then he withdrew.

And the Title of the said Account was read.

The said Account is as followed!viz.

That your Memorialist, since the Close of his Account to the 31st Day of December 1789, has, in pursuance of Directions from the said Warden of His Majesty’s Mint, earned on divers Prosecutions relating to the Gold and Silver Coin, from the said 31st Day of December 1789 to the 31st Day of December 1790; and that the Amount of Expences incurred thereby, to the 13th Day of July only, amount to the Sum of £ 598. 6. an Account whereof has been delivered into the Mint Offifce by your Memorialist: But the Expences of Prosecutions for further Offences committed in the said Year 1790, aihount to the Sum of £. 932. 3. 5. an Account whereof has ako been delivered into the Mint Office by your Memorialist.

That the several Particulars above-mentioned amount together to the Sum of Two thousand One hundred and JSixty-two Pounds Nine Shillings and Three Pence, which Sum still remains due to your Memorialist.

OFFICERS of the Mint Report on Memorial of J. Vernon, Solicitor to the Mint — Payment of Expences

incurred in carrying on Prosecutions against Coiners.

To the kight honourable the Lords Commissioned of His Majesty’s Treasury#

May it please your Lordships,

In Obedience to your Lordships’ Order of Reference, signified by Mr. Long, the 14th Instant, directing us to consider and report our Opinion.on a Memorial of Mr. Vernon, Solicitor to the Mint, craving Payment of several Accounts therein specified, for Expences incurred in carrying on Prosecutions against Offenders, relating to the Gold and Silver Coin; — we beg Leave to report,

x That the Accounts, as stated by the Memorialist, from 31st December 1788 to 30th June 1789, and from 3ist^ December 17^9 to 13th July 1790, being within the Yearly Allowance established by Parliament for this Service, are in Course paid by this Office; and therefore, the farther Expences incurred in each Year for Prosecutions, as spt forth by the Memorialist, are only what remains to be provided for.

Tffjat having ^lready reported to your Lordships* (30th June 1790) that it appeared to us, on due Examination of the Memorialist s. Account, from 30th June to 31st. December 1789, there was due to him thereon the Sum of Six hundred One Pounds Nineteen Shillings and Ten Pence; — and having carefully examined the Account lately delivered to this’Office, of Expences incurred for like Prosecutions carried on by the Memorialist, from 13th July to 31st December 1,790, ule find the Charges conformable to Allowances regulated and established by a Warrant of King George I. dated 29th July 1715, and that he has produced Vouchers for Money paid in Fees to Counsel,

and other Disbursements, as far as seems practicable to obtain them; and to which is also added a Charge of Thirty Pounds, paid by the Memorialist in Rewards, by your Lordship’s Order; and that after correcting some Errors in the Account, the Charges therein, upon the Whole, appear to us to be Such as have been usual in like Cases, and amount to the Sum of Nine hundred Sixty-three Pounds and Five Pence, which, with the Account above-mentioned, making together the Sum of £. 1,565. — 3. is, in our Opinion, proper to be allowed and paid to the Memorialist, Mr. Vernon. — But the Means for doing it must be submitted to your Lordships’ great Wisdom, by,

Together with a List of the said Papers.

And then he withdrew.

And the said List was read.

Ordered, That the said Papers do lie upon the Table, to be perused by the Members of the House.

The said Papers are preserved amongst the other

Papers of this Session.

Mr. Ryder reported from the Select Committee, to whom it was referred to examine and state the several Accounts and other Papers, presented to the House in this Session of Parliament, relating to the Public Income and Expenditure, and to report to the House what has been the whole Amount of the Public Income and Expenditure during the last Five Years, and what may be expected to be the Annual Amount thereof in future, and also what Alteration has taken place in the Amount of the Public Debt since the 5th Day of January 1786; That the Committee had examined the Matters to them referred, and had directed him to make a Report thereof to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered the same, together with an Appendix thereunto, in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the Report was read, and is as followeth; viz.

Your Committee have proceeded to consider the Matter referred to them, under the several Heads of Income, Expenditure, and’ National Debt; and have thought it right to state separately, under each of these Heads, the Result of their Enquiries, as it applies either to the last Five Years, or to the Expectations which may be formed for the future.

I. INCOME.

§ .

The Net Produce of the different Branches of the ordinary Revenue (exclusive of Land and Malt) for each of the Five Years, from the 6th of January 1786 to the 5th of January 1791, both inclusive, appears to have'been

After deducting £. 522,500, of respited

Vol. 4,6,

§ 2.

Your Committee, observing that the Report of the Report on former Committee, in 1786, has been referred to them, have thought k their Duty, in considering the past Income of the Country, to compare the Expectations then, formed with the actual Produce of the Taxes upon which they were grounded.

The Committee of 1786 proceeded upon a Supposition that the Permanent Taxes then subsisting were likely to produce Annually - £. 12,797,471.

It appears, that those Taxes, according to the best Information which your Committee have been able to collect, have produced,

In 1786

Making, upon an Average,

- 12,812,952

- 13,209,871 13,782,393

Appendix (B.) N° I.

- £ 12,879,308.

It is to be observed, that an alteration was made in the Horse Tax, in the Session of 1786, by which Persons of certain Descriptions were exempted from it; and that, in consequence, the Assessment, which in the Year ending the 5th Day of April 1787, was £. 133*087, in the subsequent Year fell to £. 101,284. Appendix The Accounts from the Tax Office calculate the Di- 9‘

minution, by comparing the Assessment of 1786 with that of 1789, and make it amount to 37,687.

Some Allowance ought evidently to be made for this Circumstance, in comparing the Produce of the Four last Years with the Expectations of the former Committee. But, as a small Part of this Decrease may be supposed to have arisen, either from the Operation of the Tax in reducing the Number of Horses, or from the Increase of Evasions, which, from Information givei> to your Committee, have been considerable, they have not thought proper to state any particular Sum on this Account.

Some further Allowance ought to be made on Ac- Appendix count of a Tax upon Linens and Stuffs, imposed in (B.) N° 3. 1784, which produced in 1785 £. 27,655, and which was also a Part of the Income upon which that Com-’piittee grounded their Expectations. This Ta* was repealed in 1785; and the ad valorem Duty, which was imposed in that Year to replace it, having proved unproductive, was also repealed by the Consolidation Act in 1787.

§ 3:

It appears that the Committee of 1786, in Addition to their Calculation of the general Produce of the Permanent Taxes, had made a particular Estimate of what might be expected to be raised by certain Duties, the future Annual Produce of which they considered as likely to be different from their actual Amount in the Year immediately preceding.

These Duties were expected to produce Annually ...../. 2,107,186;

And have produced, upon an Ave- Appendix

Your Committee have hitherto confined themselves, in Annual their Statements, to the Permanent Taxes. Taxe*.

With respect to those which are Annually granted; the Land Tax, after deducting all the Charges previous to its coming into the Exchequer, except the Payments on Account of the Militia, was calculated at ----- £. 1,967,650.

This Estimate was formed upon the Average Produce of the Aids for the Seven Years from 1776 to 1782, both inclusive, upon which the Payments were supposed to be compleat at the Period to which the Accounts before that Committee referred. It ap- Appendix pears, however, that, subsequent to this Period, a (D.) N° 1.

Appendix [D.) N* 3.

Sum of £. 34,106 was received on Account of the Aids for the said Seven Years, which would have made an Addition of £.4,872 to the Average stated by them, and would have raised their Calculation to - £ 1,972,522.

From the Manner in which this Duty is collected, the Accounts of the Payments of the Aids granted for the Service of the Years 1789 and 1790 cannot yet be made up, and there are still some small Arrears on the Aids of 1787 and 1788. Your Committee, however, think it right to observe, that the Sum charged Annually upon the Country, on Account of the Land Tax, is exactly the same, and is subject to no other Deductions (except the Payments for the Militia) than what arise from the Poundage, which is also invariable, and from some other small Charges, the Fluctuations of which do not appear to have been such as to deserve particular Notice. Whatever, therefore, may be the accidental Variations in the Times of Payment, the real Produce on Account of each Year must ultimately prove nearly the same. If your Committee had taken it at the full Amount of the Assessment, deducting only the Poundage and the above Charges, upon an Average of the Years 1786, 1787, and 1788, the Result would have been.....£ 1.973,65*;

But, allowing a small Sum for any casual Loss, it may be stated at - £. 1,972,000.

The Malt Tax was estimated at - £. 632,350.

The Accounts of the actual Produce of the several Annual Malt Taxes appear compleat only for the Years 1786, 1787, and 1788.

The Average Produce paid into the Exchequer, of the Aids granted for the Service of those Years, has been.....£. 597,*7i-

§ 5-

Your Committee proceeded to consider, what may be expected to be the future Iniome of the Country. And, in order to estimate the Produce of the Permanent Taxes, they have not thought it necessary to go back to a more distant Period than Three Years. The successive Alterations which have taken Place in various Branches of the Revenue, the material Changes arising from the Consolidation Act, and from the Commercial Treaty with France, and the particular Circumstances attending the preceding Years, seem to make a more remote Retrospect inapplicable to this View of the Subject.

The Produce of the Permanent Taxes from the 6th Day of Jamiary 1788 to the 5th Day of January 1791,

both inclusive, appears to have been,

In 1788 - '- - £ 13,007,642

1789,- - - 13,433,068

1790 - - - 14,072,978

Making a Total of £. 40,513,688

Your Committee, however, think it necessary to remark, That the Account for the Year ending the 5th Day of January 1790, includes Fifty-three Days of Weekly Payment upon the Letter Money; that the Account for the next Year includes the same Number of Dap of Weekly Payment upon the Customs, Excise, Stamps, and Salt; and that the Amount of the Payment upon all those Articles together, on the 4th and 5th Days of January 1791, has been.....£. *93,657-

As this Circumstance must recur rather oftener than in the Proportion of Once in every Six Years, if the above Total had been formed upon the Produce of Six Years it would not have been necessary to make any Deduction upon this Account: But that Total having been formed (for the Reasons already stated) upon the Produce of Three Years only,

Half the Amount of that Weekly Payment, being a Sum of £. 96,828, must be deducted, and would leave.....£.40,416,860.

The Average of those Three Years would then be - - - £. 13,472,286.

It is also to be observed, on the other Hand, That, in order to form as accurate a Calculation as possible, some Addition ought to be allowed for beyond this Average, on Account of whatever may be the Excess of the Taxes imposed in 1789, above what may be sufficient to replace the Shop Tax, which was repealed in that Year.

It appears by the Observations in Appendix (B.)

N# 1, that the actual Receipt on Account of those Taxes cannot be accurately ascertained; but if a Calculation ' were to be formed, by deducting from the Produce of the Three last Years what was received on Account of the Shop Tax, and what is calculated to have been received on Account of the Duties imposed in 1789, and by substituting in each Year what may be expected as the future Produce of the last-mentioned Duties, the Result would be an Addition to the Average of between £. 20,000 and£. 30,000. But, from the Shortness of the Period since they were imposed, the several Accounts from the Stamp and Tax Offices do not appear suffi- (M N’5-6-7-ciently clear and distinct, to enable Your Committee to state any precise Sum upon this Account. ♦

A similar Observation arises from the Increase of the (A.)N»j. 3. Revenue upon the Article of Tobacco, since it has been (E.)N*i. put under the Management of the Excise; and, though Your Committee are here also unwilling to hazard any particular Calculation, it may be supposed, from the Papers referred to, that if this Regulation, which took place only in October 1789, had existed during the Whole of the Three Years, it would have added a considerable Sum to the Average above stated.

In considering what is to be taken on Account of the Annual Land Tax, Your Committee have adopted the Estimate Taxes-already mentioned, for the Reasons there given, and band Tax. state it at - -£.1,972,000.

The Produce of the Duty on Malt, not being, like Malt Duty, that of the Land Tax, uniform in its Amount, can only be estimated from some former Average. If this Estimate were formed from its Produce in 1786, 1787, and Appendix

1788, the Result would be - - £.597,171. (D.) N* 1.

But as the Reasons which led the Committee to confine their Consideration of the Permanent Taxes to Three Years, do not apply to this, it may be proper to include a greater Number of Years in the Average, especially as the Produce of this Duty depends so much on the Variations of the Seasons. If taken Appendix upon an Average of the last compleat Five Years, (D0 *s" included in the Account given in, it would amount to about ----- -£. 586,000.

The Total Average arising from the Permanent Taxes, and the Annual Duties upon Land and Malt, exclusive of any additional Allowance for the Taxes imposed in

1789, or for the Increase upoji Tobacco, would be, upon the above Estimate,

Permanent Taxes - - £.13,472,286

Land Tax - 1,972,000

Malt Duty - 586,000

£. 16,030^86

§6. /

Your Committee are sensible, that any Estimate which can be formed of the future Produce of a Revenue, arising from so great a Number of Articles, and necessarily varying with the Fluctuations of an extensive Commerce, must be liable in its Nature to Uncer- -tainty. They think it right however to remark, that the Average on which they have grounded their Expectations, is formed upon a Revenue which has £1 been

been Annually increasing (a)\ and that a considerable Proportion of this Increase (as appears from the Papers referred to) has taken Place upon Articles of general Consumption; and particularly upon those to which the Attention of Parliament has lately been directed.

Your Committee, having stated all that they think necessary to observe, relative to the past or future Produce both of the Permanent Taxes, and of those which, though Annually voted, form a Part of the Ordinary Income of the Country, have judged it proper, before they proceed to the other Branches of their Enquiry, to take Notice of such Extraordinary Resources, exclusive of Money raised by Loans, as have arisen during the Period referred to them.

From the Nature of the Articles which have composed these Extraordinary Aids, it is evidently impossible to form any Estimute of what further Receipt may be expected under such of those Heads as can recur in future;.

The Re-payment of Imprest and other Monies may still be supposed to yield some additional Sums; but as these principally arise from the Settlement of Accounts for Monies issued during the last War, this Resource cannot be relied on for any Length of Time; and even while it lasts must be expected to become every Year less productive.

» The Extent of the Resource of a Lottery (which has

become within these few Years an Object of increased Importance) necessarily depends upon Circumstances, which make it impossible to form any certain Estimate of the Profit to be expected from it; but there is no apparent Reason to imagine, that, as long as Parliament thinks proper to avail itself of this Mode of raising Money, it may not continue to furnish as large a Sum in Time of Peace as it has lately produced. — No Notice is here taken of Army Savings, as they are allowed for, to a certain Extent, in the Army Estimates.

§2.

No precise Estimate having been formed by the . Committee of 1786, of what might be expected to be the Total Expence of all those Services, previous to a permanent Peace Establishment, it is impossible to draw the same Kind of Comparison as to the Expenditure which Your Chmmittee have attempted to do as to V the Income.

Thinking, however, that it would be satisfactory to the House, to have before them, at One View, a distinct Statement of all the principal Charges which compose the above Totals, arranged under the general Heads adopted by that Committee, they have drawn up a Table for that Purpose, to which they beg Leave to refer.

§3-

The next Object pointed out for theif Enquiry, was Future Ex-the probable future Expenditure; which they have stated penditur*. in the same Order,

The Annual Interest and other Charges payable upon the Public Debts, as they stood on the 5th Day of January 1791, including the Interest on the Stock which has been purchased by the Commissioners, was.....£.9,289,110.

From this is to be deducted £.14,000, being the Interest of the short Annuities granted in 1789, because the Fund from whence this Interest is paid does not appear as Part of the Income - - £. 14,000.

There must be added, on the other Hand, the Interest on the Tontine Loan. It appears, that on the 5th of April 1791, £.21,431 was set apart in the Exchequer to pay Half a Year’s Interest on that Loan, but that the future Annuity' cannot be ascertained with perfect Accuracy. Taking, however, the whole Year’s Interest according to this Proportion, it would stand at - - - - £. 42,862.

The whole Amount of the Interest and Charges would then be - £-9i3l7>972.

§ 9.

The expected Expence upon the Articles usually included under the Head of Miscellaneous Services, is stated according to the Estimate received from the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, and amounts to ----- £.128,416.

§ 10.

The Amount of the Taxes which still remain appropriated for particular Purposes, not included under any of the preceding Heads of Charge, appears to have been, upon the Average of the Three last Years, - - - - £.40,252.

§ 11.

The Sum directed to be issued in each Year, to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, is.....£.1,000,000.

The Total of the Sums above stated, is £.15,969,178.

§ 12.

It does not appear to your Committee, that it falls within their Province to consider what other Extraordinary Expences, not included in any Estimate before them, may occur in a Course of Years; as the Nature and Extent of such Services depend upon Circumstances which cannot be foreseen, and must be decided upon by the Wisdom of Parliament, as the Occasions arise.

The only Article of this Nature which has been brought distinctly under the View of your Committee is the Amount of the Money remaining due upon the Principal and Interest of the American and East Florida Claims, which has been directed by Parliament to be paid by Installments.

The Principal appears to have amounted, on the loth of October 1790, to the Sum of £.1,546,062, exclusive of the Interest payable Half Yearly upon such Part of it as remains undischarged, and exclusive of such further Annual Payments as are made for the temporary Support and Pensions of American 7

As, however, in the Estimate of the Income of the Country, no Credit is taken for any Aid from a Lottery, or from, any incidental Payments, those additional Resources may be considered as applicable towards defraying this and other Charges of the like Description.

„ . § >3-

Your Committee have hitherto stated the Result of Comparative their Examination respecting the past and future In- Statement of come and Expenditure, considering them in the same View, and arranging them under the same Heads, as p the former Committee. These Heads appear to comprehend all the Articles which are necessary to be included on each Side of the Account in that View of the Subject.

But in order to ascertain, with as much Precision as they were able, the Means by which the whole Amount of the Public Expence, during the last Five Years, has been defrayed, they have thought it necessary to consider the Income and Expenditure of that Period in another Point of View, for the Purpose of forming such a Comparative Statement of their Total Amount as may render the Account as distinct as possible, according to the several Heads of Service under which Money is issued from the Exchequer.

The Total Produce of the Permanent Taxes, for the Appendix Five Years, has been - - - £.65,303,877. (A.) N» u

There was received from the East India Company in 1786, on Account of Duties due before that Time, the Payment of which had been postponed, Appendix

£.522,500. (A.) N» 2.

The whole Sum of £.2,750,000, raised upon the Credit of the Land and Malt Tax Acts, is actually, received from the Bank in each Year. Exchequer Bills to this Amount are made out, and deposited from Time to Time with the Bank; and the Sum by which the Produce of those Duties paid into the Exchequer, up to the Time of settling the respective Accounts with the Bank, falls short of re-paying both the Principal and Interest of such Exchequer Bills, is paid over at such Time to the Bank, and is Annually stated as an Article of Expenditure, under the Head of Deficiency of Land and Malt. It will be inserted as such on the other Side of the Account now to be formed; and it is evident, therefore, that in this View of the Subject, the full Sum so raised must be taken as a Part of the Receipt for the last Five Years - - - - £.13,750,000.

Arrears of Land Tax - 171,166.

Arrears of Malt Duty - 16,489.

These are Sums received at the Exchequer subsequent to the Period at which the respective Accounts were closed with the Bank, and the Balance paid, and therefore form a Part of the Public Income, in Addition to the whole Annual Sum of - £. 2,750,000.

The whole Sum raised by Way of Lottery is placed upon this - Side of the Account; the Amount of the Prizes, and of the Charges of Management, being stated as an Article of Expenditure - - £.3,758,724.

Imprest Monies, and Monies re-paid £. 820,165.

It appeared, upon Examination, that the Whole of the Sums contained in the Papers referred to under this Head were applied to the Public Service of the Years in Question, either by specific Votes, or by being carried to the Consolidated Fund, except £.100,000 paid by the East India Company in Part of the £.400,000 voted for the Supply of 1781, and £.5,000 which belonged to the Civil List. The Remainder, after deducting both these Sums, forms the Total above stated.

Monies in the Exchequer on the 5th

of January 1786 - £1,172,119,

which were applied to the Public Service in that and the subsequent Year, as appears by the Explanation subjoined to the Account referred to.

It appears further, that there have been applied, as Part of the Ways and Means, during this Period, the following Sums;

Arising from Army Savings - £. 1,091,147.

Raised by Way of Tontine - - - 1,002,140.

Raised by granting Short Annuities - 187,000.

Re-payment in Part of a Loan for

Foreign Secret Service - - - 34,000.

Arising from the Sale of French Prizes 3,000.

The Total Amount of the Receipts appears to have been - - £.87,832,327.

It is to be observed, that the Annual Exchequer Bills, furnishing in the Ways and Means exactly the same Sum by which they increase the Charge on the Supply, are omitted on both Sides of the Account.

The First great Article of Expenditure, is the Interest and Charges of the Public Debt; and it appears that there has been issued from the Exchequer, during the last Five Years, under that Head, the Sum of - - - - £46,187,010.

The Charges upon the Aggregate and Consolidated Funds have been, on Account of the Civil f List £. 4,481,000.

\ And upon sundry other Accounts - 474,751.

The Sums granted by Parliament (exclusive of the Armament of 1790) for the Service of the Navy, have been.....£. 11,649,539.

Of the Army ----- 9,639,626.

And of the Ordnance - - 2,308,344.

The Expences incurred under the Name of Miscellaneous Services, include a Variety of Articles of different Descriptions, and among them some of those which have been already stated as appearing on both Sides of the Account; your Committee, therefore, have thought proper to distinguish them under several Heads.

It has been already observed, that the Deficiencies of Land and Malt are Annually stated as Articles of Expenditure, and would be inserted on this Side of the Account; and the Manner in which they arise has been sufficiently explained. It must, however, further be remarked, that the Ways and Means are usually opened to Parliament, and the Committee of Supply closed,.some Months before the Accounts with the Bank, relative to the Exchequer Bills issued upon the Credit of those Duties, are actually settled. This Deficiency, therefore, is then only stated upon Calculation; and, as its real Amount, whatever it may prove, must be paid out of the Supplies of the Current Year, it follows, that if it should turn out more than the Calculation, if would be One Cause of a Deficiency in the Whole of the Grants for that Year. If it should be less, it would either occasion a Surplus of those Grants, or diminish by so much any Deficiency which might arise from other Causes.

The Sum stated by your Committee is not the Estimated, but the Actual Deficiency of Land and Malt; and, as this is in Part occasioned by the Expence of the Militia, the Whole of which is paid out of the Land Tax before it comes into the Exchequer, no separate Charge is made for that Branch of Service in this Statement of the Account.

The Sums stated under the Head of Interest and Charges of Exchequer Bills, in the Paper referred to, are the Amount of the Interest paid out of the Supplies in each Year respectively, upon Exchequer Bills issued by virtue of Acts passed in the preceding Year. Vol. 46.

As it has been the constant Practice not to make any Report on Provision for this Interest before-hand, eithfer a Part or the Whole of this Ex pence (according to the Excess or deficiency of the Ways and Means, compared with the other Charges upon the Supplies) is thrown upon the Year subsequent to that in which it is actually paid, and appears Annually under the Head of Deficiency of Grants. From what has been just observed it follows, that, in Addition to the Charges incurred during the last Five Years, and stated in this Account as the Interest of Exchequer Bills, any Sum which was paid in the Year 1786, to make good the Deficiency of Grants in 1785, must be inserted amongst the Expences defrayed out of the Ways and Means of that Period.

It appears equally evident, that any Sums voted under foe Head of Deficiency of the Grants of any of the succeeding Years, must be omitted in this Statement of the Account, as all the Services of each Year (including what is paid for the Interest of Exchequer Bills, and for the Deficiency of Land and Malt, as above explained) are stated at their full Amount, under their proper Heads, as Articles of Expenditure.

It is necessary, however, here to observe, that the Interest of Exchequer Bills, paid in 1790, will be provided for in 1791, under the Head of Deficiency of Grants of the preceding Year, and will account for a Difference, to that Amount, between the apparent Receipt and Expenditure of the whole Five Years.

Having premised these Remarks, your Committee Appendix proceed to state the Deficiencies of Land and Malt (°,) N° 1. at.....£ 2,033,764.

and requires no particular Explanation.

The Expence incurred upon those Articles of Mis- »-cellaneous Services, which were expressly stated by foe former Committee, has been - - £.507,580.

Other Miscellaneous Articles, consisting principally (O.) N° 1. of incidental or temporary Demands, have amounted

to -.....£ 929>676.

The Total Expence occasioned by the Relief of foe American Loyalists, appears to have been £. 1,336,377.

Your Committee have omitted a Sum of £. 33,890 for foe Purchase of Lands at sundry Places, as it is included in the Ordnance Account They have also thought proper to leave out in this Place a Sum of £. 112,101, stated as the Deficiency of the Consolidated Fund on the 5th Day of January 1789, being the Sum which was then wanted to compleat the Quarterly Issue to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, and which w’as defrayed out of the Supplies of that Year; because the Sum of £.4,750,000, which is inserted below, is the full Amount of all the Quarterly Issues under this head, and consequently includes, as a Part thereof, the Sum of £.112,101, above stated.

The whole Produce of the Appropriated Duties having been comprehended in the Total Produce of the Taxes, such Part of it as has been applied to foe Services to which they were appropriated, and which-do not appear in this Statement of the Account, must be considered as an Article of Expenditure: This has Appendix been - - - - £.231,935.

There will then be left unaccounted for a Sum of - - - - £. 76,861,

The Difference between the Totals, which may be supposed to arise only from Fractions, may be entirely overlooked.

Amount of the several Articles of Receipt which it has been possible in this Statement to ascertain.

It would certainly have been more satisfactory if the Totals now drawn up had been found to tally with perfect Accuracy. It must however be recollected, that the Accounts referred to your Committee include a Period when the Revenue was incumbered with a Variety of minute Appropriations: And, although the

which occurred to them, proceeded to examine the Disposition Papers of each Year; and have taken the Surplusses of the Sinking and Consolidated Funds (as before) for each Quarter, from the 5th of April 1786 to the 5th of January 1791, both inclusive; deducting only the Sums carried to them to make good the Annuity Funds, which do not appear as Articles of Expenditure.

In order, however, to throw still further Light upon this Part of the Subject, your Committee have thought proper to add a brief Statement of the Account in a different Point of View.

For this Purpose they have stated as the Income, the several Surplusses of the Sinking and Consolidated Funds, as they stood at the End of each Quarter, from

Surplusses by a Sum equal to the Amount of the Charges

These Deficiencies were Sums which, prior National Debt — and the Produce of the Appropriated to the Consolidation Act, were Annually made good, Duties, as above stated; being Articles of Expence out of the Sinking Fund, to the various other Funds which are not included in the Annual Grants of

The Coincidence between the Income and Expenditure, as here stated, sufficiently proves that the Difference which appeared in the former Statement must have proceeded from the Omission of Sums, to the Amount of that Difference, on the Receipt Side; and the Cause from which such an Inaccuracy may be supposed to have arisen, has already been mentioned.

referred to them, by comparing the State of the Debt on Report on the 31st of December 1785 with that of the 31st of De- .

cember 1789; and, by deducting from this Increase the Sura of £. 200,000 voted by Parliament,

It would then stand at - - - £.457,950.

The Deficiency of the Grants of 1790, which falls Appendix upon the Revenue of 1791, is - - ,£.207,728. (W.) N° 5.

III. NATIONAL DEBt.

Your Committee find, that there has been applied to the Discharge of the Public Debt, during the Period referred to them, a Sum of - - £. 4,750,000,

arising from the Quarterly Payments directed by Parliament; and a further Sum of - - £. 674,592,

arising from the Interest of Stock bought, and of Annuities expired or fallen in: Making together a Sum

of.....£ 5,424,592.

The only Increase of the Funded Debt, during the same Period, which is to be set against the above Decrease, has been occasioned by a Loan raised by Annuities, with the Benefit of Survivorship.

The Capital so raised was - - £. 1,002,140.

A further Sum of £.187,000 was raised by Short Annuities in 1789, of which £. 34,000 has been since repaid. But as this Loan, which was intended to replace a Sum advanced for Foreign Secret Service, is to be repaid by Installments, in such Proportions as will be equal to the Sums necessary for discharging both the Principal and Interest, by the Time at which the above-mentioned Annuities are to determine, it did not appear to your Committee of a Nature to be stated as an Increase of the National Incumbrances.

In comparing the outstanding Debt of the Navy, on the 31st of December 1785, and on the 31st of De-

cember 1790, there appears to have been an Increase of £ 105,530.

On the 31st of December 1789, there had been an Increase of £. 657,950. But in the Year 1790, a Sum of £. 200,000 was granted by Parliament towards discharging this Debt, and has been included in the Statement of the Expences of the Five Years; which would have reduced the Increase to £. 457,950.

Your Committee think it necessary to remark, that, from Information received from the Navy Board, the apparent Decrease which has taken Place in the Year 1790, beyond what can be accounted for by the Grant of £. 200,000, appears to have been in Part occasioned by the Circumstances attending the late Armament, and the Sums voted for defraying it

Credit has been taken, in making up this Account, for so much of those Sums as was intended to replace the' Stores delivered out in the Course of the last Year, which apparently diminishes the Debt, till that Service has been fully performed. Some of the Works proposed in the extra Estimate of 1790 having been necessarily suspended, in consequence of the Exertions for the Armament, left a Part of the Sum voted on that Estimate applicable, in the Course of that Year, to the Reduction of the Debt

A further Sum arose from the Additional Expence of the Armament having been stated as including the Purchase of Hemp and other Articles, which, although immediately necessary for the Extraordinary Preparations then made, are stated to have been in Fact defrayed out of the Grants of Parliament for the current Service of the Navy. Your Committee, therefore, having Reason to believe that the great apparent Decrease of the Debt during the last Year would have proved only Temporary (even if the Navy had continued this Year upon the usual Establishment) have thought proper to state the Increase of the Period

Vol. 4*6.

But the Deficiency of Grants of 1785, which was defrayed out of the Income of 1786, was only £. 127,138.

The Difference, therefore, must be added to the Increase of the Debt in the whole Period, and makes a Sum of - - - - £. 80,590.

There appears by the Ordnance Account to have been, on the 5th of January 1791, a Sum due, for Articles not provided for by Parliament, amounting to.....- - £.61,909.

which has been since voted, and must be considered as a Part of the Debt incurred in the Five Years preceding.

The whole Excess of the Sum applied to the Discharge of the Public Debt, beyond those by which it has been increased (during the last Five Years) appears to have been, according to the above Statement, .....£. 3,822,003,

The Amount of the unfunded Debt arising from the Exchequer Bills annually issued by the Authority of Parliament upon the Credit of the Supplies, is £. 5,500,000, being the same as at the Commencement of this Period, exclusive of those issued in Consequence of the late Armament, which are charged upon Taxes appropriated to that Purpose, and not included in the Statement of the future Income of the Countiy.

The Amount of the Exchequer Bills Annually issued on the Credit of the I and and Malt, which are now outstanding, is not stated by your Committee as a Part of the unfunded Debt, because Money applicable to the Discharge of those Bills is constantly in a Course of Collection, and no other Charge is occasioned by them to the Public, except the Annual Interest, which is already stated as a Part of the future Expenditure.

It is further to-be observed, that, in the Year 1786, the growing Produce of the Sinking Fund was taken up to the 5th of April 1787, which included the Surplus of Five Quarters, and appears to have been for the Time an Anticipation, to a certain Extent, of the Revenue of the subsequent Year; and that the growing Produce of the Sinking and Consolidated Funds has, since that Time, been taken from April to April. The Surplus of the Consolidated Fund had produced, on the 31st of December 1790 (being the Day on which the Account of tfyat Fund was made up) within £. 176,347 of the whole Sum for which it had been taken, up to the 5th of April 1791. This Sum, therefore, was, on the 31st of December 1790, all that remained of the Amount of that Anticipation. Your Committee having called for an Account of the Produce of the Taxes from that Day to the 5th of January 1791, find that it amounted to £. 200,468.

If, therefore, the Balance had been struck upon the Consolidated Fund Account on the 5th of January in 1791, as was done in 1786 (instead of so many Days earlier than usually happens in the Course of the Exchequer) the Produce of the Three last Quarters would have been rather more than sufficient to make good the whole Charge on the growing Produce of that Fund for the Supplies of the Year 1790, without any Anticipation.

Your Committee beg Leave also to remaik, that an Alteration was made with respect to the Time of Payment of certain Annuities, by an Act of the Twenty-

6 I sixth

Appendix sixth of His present Majesty, One Quarter was paid (G.) N# i. on 10^j of Qct0ber 1780, and the future Payments were directed to be made Half Yearly, on die 5th of April, and the 10th of October. By this Change the , Public availed itself, in that Year, of the Amount of One Quarterly Payment upon these Annuities, which would have been payable on the 5th of January 1787 (in Addition to that issued on the' 10th of which Quarter was not afterwards to be paid till the 5th of April 1787; and, on the other Hand, the Public became bound, for the future, to pay, on every 5th of April, Half a Year’s Interest, being in Fact an Advance of One Quarter, which would not otherwise have been payable till the 5th of July following. The Result of this is, that, on the 5th Day of January 1791, there had been paid, upon the Whole, One Quarter less, on Account of the Interest of these Annuities, than would have been issued if the above-mentioned Alteration had not taken Place.

It is further to be observed, that the Abolition of all the distinct Appropriations, and the charging all the Quarterly Issues for the Interest of the Public Debt on One General Fund, to which all the Permanent Taxes are carried, has produced the Effect of making the whole Amount of the Revenue in the Exchequer applicable, at the End of each Quarter, to the Dis-

charge of the Demands then existing; whereas, under the former System, that Part of the Revenue which consisted of Taxes distinctly appropriated to the Payment of the Interest of particular Annuities, could only be applied to the Half Yearly Payments on those Annuities; in consequence of which, there remained, at the Expiration of each Quarter, certain Sums of this Description useless, till the Expiration of a subsequent Quarter.

The Capital Stock bought by the Commissioners for discharging the National Debt, up to the 1st Day of Fcbruai'y 1791 (being the Day on which they made up their Accounts of the Application of the Sums issued in Appendix the preceding Year) was - - £ 6,772,350. (Y.) N° 1.

The Annual Interest of the same is £. 203,170.

To this must be added the present Amount of the Appendix Annuities expired or fallen in, which appears to be 00 N* 2.

£51.634-

Both together make a Sum of - £ 254,804.

which is at this Time an Addition to the Million Annually applied to the Reduction of the National Debt, resulting from the Adoption of the Plan for that Purpose, and now increasing at Compound Interest.

Inspector General’s Office, Custom House, London, February 25, 1791.

Thomas ,

Inspector General of the Imports and Exports of Great Britain, &c.

EXPLANATION:

Prior to the Act of the 27th of His Majesty, which consolidated the Customs, &c. no Account was kept of the Drawbacks paid upon each separate Article; nor was such an Account carried into Effect until the Commencement of the Year 1789, after which Period the Drawbacks actually paid within the Year are in the Two latter Years of the above Account deducted from the Gross 4^. Receipt, in order to form the Net Produce; whereas in the Years 1786, 1787, and 1788, the Drawbacks payable upon the Quantities exported within the Year are cast and deducted from the tO Gross Receipt, in order in like Manner to form the Net Produce.

In the Years 1786 and 1787 the Gross Produce upon East India Goods imported and sold by the Company is given, there being no possible Means of ascertaining the Net Produce in-these Years; but in the Three latter Years the Net Produce is stated.

On the 5th July 1786 a Part of the Duties on Wines was transferred from the Customs to the Excise j and on the 10th October 1789, & Part of the Duties on Tobacco, viz. 9 d- per lb. was also transferred to the Excise.

(1) CONSOLIDATION ACT.

As this Act did not take Place till the 10th of May 1787, and the Accounts dusing that Year are blended, the exact Increase of Revenue arising from it, previous to the 5th of January 1788, cannot be ascertained: But it appeared to your Committee that the nearest Estimate which they could form, would be by taking Half the Increase which it produced in the subsequent Year. The Period is more than Six Months; but it must be recollected, that there is always a considerable delay, before the Produce of any new Duties, and particularly of such as are received at the Out Ports, can be paid into the Exchequer.

13,782,393

(2) ASSESSED TAXES.

It appears that nothing was received on Account of these Taxes in the Year 1739. — 'The only sum stated distinctly by the Receivers, as having been paid into the Exchequer on Account of these Duties in 1790, is £ 14,875. But your Committee having reason to believe, in consequence of Information from the Tax Office, that nearly the whole Amount of the Assessment upon these Taxes had been received during that Year, have thought proper to deduct a Sum equal to that Assessment, allowing only for the Charges of Management.

(3) STAMP DUTIES.

Your Committee have deducted from the Produce of this Year only the Amount of the Stamp Duties actually received at the Head Office in London; as little or nothing could have been paid into ihe Exchequer in that Year in consequence of the Consignments to the Country Distributors; and the precise Amount of such Payments, if any, caunot be distinguished, as they are blended with those made on Account of the other Stamp Duties.

<4) STAMP DUTIES.

Your Committee have thought proper to take Two Thirds of the whole Consignment sent into the Country dnring these Two Years, as equal to the Sum probably received during that Period; allowing for about One Third, which may be supposed to remain on Hand*

(5) SHOP TAX.

It is evident that such Part only of the Produce of the Taxes of 1789 ought to be deducted from the Revenue of 1790, ill thi^ View of the Subject, as exceeds the former Average Produce of the Shop Tax, which they Were in Part intended to replace> so much only having been an actual Addition to the Income,

N. B. — The Duties on British Spirits being consolidated from and after 10th May 1787,

the Exchequer Payments on British Spirits, by Act of 26th Geo. III. cannot

be ascertained otherwise than by Computation; but a Sixth Part of the consolidated Duty on Spirits, paid into the Exchequer after that Period, is returned in

this Account as the proper Proportion, the Old Duty being Five Pence, and the Additional, One Penny per Gallon.

N. B. — The Duties on Sweets, previous to the 26th Geo. III. were 18 s. per Barrel, together with the per Cents, thereon, and by that Act were raised to 24 per Barrel, together with the per Cents.; by the Consolidation Act which commenced 1 ith May 1787, these Duties were again reduced to 18$. 4i being within a Fraction the same as those subsisting previous to the passing of the 26th Geo. III.; it is apprehended, therefore, that no Return can be made of the Additional Duties after the 11 May 1787.

The Diminution which took Place in the Amount of the Horse Tax can only be ascertained by comparing the Assessment made for a Year prior to passing the above-mentioned Act with a Year’s Assessment made subsequent thereto; the First Half Year’s Duty cannot be the proper Criterion to judge by, because the Assessors, on passing the Act imposing the said Duty, could not discriminate what Horses were chargeable therewith, and certainly did assess a greater Number of Horses than were afterwards found to be subject to the Duty, particularly the Horses belonging to Farmers, for Want of knowing the Value of their Farms: The Year 1786 is therefore selected to make the Comparison, and from which, compared with the Year 1789, being the last for which the Accounts can be qiadeup, there appears a Difference of 37*687. 15. 1.; but it is here necessary to observe, that a small Proportion of the said Sum, about 2,000, has most probably happened from a Decrease of the Duty itself.

(1) The greater Part of this Decrease must have arisen from the Alteration referred to in the Report.

(2) As this Duty is declining in its Produce, the Decrease would be greater if the Average was taken upon the Three last Years.

(3) If the Average were taken upon the last Three Years, there would appear a Decrease instead of an Increase in the Produce of this Duty.

(4) The Calculation of the former Committee, relative to this Tax, appears to have been formed upon erroneous Grounds.

(5) Including about £ 30,000 arising from the Duties on Horses and Carriages imposed in 1789, but exclusive of the Shop Tax, except to the Amount of £6,142.

Several Duties imposed in the Years 1784 and 1785 are omitted in this Comparison; viz'.

Linens and Stuffs, for Reasons given elsewhere. — £15 perCent. Excise, because it cannot now be distinguished, having been blended, by the Consolidation General Produce of the Duties under the Management of that Board. — Letter Money. This cannot vary,' being a Weekly Payment of a certain Sum. Though it appears that the Increase of the Produce of the Duties upon Salt has been more than the Sum estimated, it cannot be ascertained how far this been occasioned by the Regulation referred to by the former Committee.

Memorandum:

The Management on Annuities 29° Gij. 3*“ not being settled cannot therefore be charged.

By an Act 29® Gij.3'“, £.1,002,500 were directed to be raised by Annuities on Lives, to commence from 10th October 1790: But by some Persons not compleating their Subscription, £. 1,002,099 only was received at the Bank; and as the First Payment was not due till 5th April 1791, the same is not included in this Account, nor the Principal added to the Debt.

In pursuance of the said Act £. 50,104. 195. was issued to Charles Tozimhcnd, Esquire, One of the Deputy Tellers of the Exchequer, to be paid over to the Contributors for One Year and One Quarter’s Interest, at £.4 per Cent, from 5th July 1789 to 10th October 1790.

Note. In the Year 1786 Three Quarters Annuity only was paid on Account of the Long and Short Annuities, in pursuance of an Act passed in the Year 1786, for altering the Days of Payment of those Annuities; but in each of the following Years a compleat Year’s Payment was made; and the Difference in the several Totals arises from a Reduction in the Charges of Management, and from the Addition of Half a Year’s Payment on Account of Short Annuities granted in the Year 1789, and a whole Year’s Payment on Account of the same Annuities in the Year 1790.

OBSERVATIONS.

In addition to these Estimates, some Expences may be expected to arise for making up the Deficiency of Pensions to Officers Widows, Ac. in pursuance of the Resolution of the House of Commons on the 20th Day of April, in the Year 1787» and for some other casual Articles.

We must further beg Leave to observe, that the Extraordinary Preparations, in the Course of the last Twelve Months, having interrupted the preliminary Measures necessary for ascertaining with Precision the Amount of the several Articles of the Peace Establishment, it has been impossible to forin the Estimate with perfect Accuracy; some Variations may take Place in many of the Articles* but jve are confident that there is no Ground to suppose the whole Expence of the Navy, on a permanent Peace Establishment, can exceed the Sum of Two Millions*

N. B. — The foregoing Articles are not supposed to require, in every Year, the Sums set opposite to them; in some Years more may be necessary, in others less; but, one Year with another, it is computed that the Sums set down will be wanted for each Article, and that the Amount- of the Estimate will be sufficient to defray the Expence.

which is an Increase of £. 11,271. Ss. id. and is accounted for asltillows

By an Augmentation to the Establishin* of the Royal Regim* of Artillery, of One Bbmbardier and Ten Gunners per Company, and Twq Staff Serjeants to each of the Four Marching Battalions, making 448 Men; also the Difference of Pay between a Second and First Lieut*, to put the Officers of the Cadet Company on the same Footing as those of the other Companies, and an Addition of 2 s. per Day to the ray of the Surgeon General - . -

By the Pay of First Gunners still remaining on the War Establishment - -

By an Augmentation of One Captain, One Capt. Lieut*, Two First Lieut*’, and One Second Lieutenant, to the Establishm* of the Corps of Royal Engineers -

‘ ' £ The Remainder of the Difference arises from the new Establishment of the Powder Mills at

But it is to be observed, that the Regiment of Artillery is, in the Estimate for 1791, still £. 1,198. 8, 4. above its regular Establishment; this Excess will gradually decrease, as the First Gunners, who are the Cause of it, die

off, or are provided for; after which the Ordinary, on a permanent Peace Establishment, including the Increase Report on of the Regiment of Artillery, and Corps of Engineers, will not require more than about £.220,000 per Annum, ^EipJndkute. which is an Increase of £. 10,000 per Annum.

With respect to the Extraordinaries, they were computed at £. 138,600; and from a careful Revision of them, and the Experience of Three Years, it is presumed that Sum will be sufficient for the Annual Current Expence of those Articles which are enumerated in the former Paper given. in to the House of Commons, excepting in the Case of the Six West India Islands, where the considerable Works that have been erecting will necessarily-occasion an Increase of Expence for maintaining them: The Sums computed to be necessary when there were no other Fortifications than Batteries, or very slight Works, were £.1,000 for. each of the Six Islands: It is imagined it cannot be less than £.3,000 for each Island, when the Works are finished, which will be an Increase of £.12,000.

With respect to the Contingencies of the Regiment of Artillery, it is also found necessary to make an Addition-of £. 1,000 per Annum.

There will also be an Increase of £. 2,000 per Annum on Account of the Islands of Bahama and Bermuda, if the first should be thought proper to be continued, and the latter to have an Ordnance Establishment; and also £. 2,000' for the Powder Mills at Waltham Abbey; all of which are new Articles, not included in the Estimate of 1786.

These Additions of £. 10,000 in the Ordinary, and £.17,000 in the Extraordinaries, increase the permanent Peace Establishment for the Land Service from £.348,000 to £.375,600 per Annum.

In respect to the Sea Service, the Allowance of 45. per Man per Month for the Number of Seamen voted, has been found by Experience to be inadequate to the Expenditure and «ust.vary in Proportion to the Number of Seamen Annually voted.

The Trustees are possessed of a Lease of a Dwelling House, and other Buildings, in Austin Friars, London, used for the Purpose of carrying on the Business relating to the Harbour, which Lease was granted by Richard Henry Clarke, and others, to the said Arnold Aiello, and others of the Trust, for the Term of 60 Years from Lady Day 1788, at the clear Yearly Rent of £.60; upon which Premisses the Trustees have expended in Repairs thereof, in the Years 1788 and 1789, the Sum of £. 3,50b and upwards.

The Trustees have purchased Freehold Property at Ramsgate, Part whereof is let off, and the Annual Rents amount to £. 37. 5 s.clear.

It also appeared to your Committee, That the Accounts of the Treasurers of the said Trust have been audited and passed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London, in pursuance of the said Acts, from the Commencement thereof to the 24th Day of June 1787; but from that Time the Accounts of the Treasurers have not been passed by the said Mayor and Aldermen, although presented to them for that Purpose, they, the said Mayor and Aldermen considering

that large Sums of Money had been expended contrary to the Spirit and Intent of the said Acts of Parliament, as appears by the Report of the Committee of the said Mayor and Aldermen, dated 12th April last, appointed to audit and examine the said Accounts.

It also appeared to your Committee, That the Annuities payable to the now surviving Annuitants amount, in the Whole, to the Sum of £.1,093. 2 6d.

Annually, as appears in the Appendix, N* 1.; and that the Sums Annually paid in Salaries and Gratuities to Officers, do amount, in the Whole, to the Sum of £.1,155: Which Salaries and Gratuities, together with the Employments of Officers, appear in the Appendix, N° 2.

It further appeared to your Committee, That the Revenue has exceeded the Expenditure very considerably, and that it is an unnecessary Burthen on the Public to raise so great a Sum, however useful the said Harbour has proved; and there being the said Balance of £.33,034. 145. 10 in the Treasurer’s Hands in June 1790, and the Income arising from the Money invested in the Public Funds being more than sufficient to keep down the growing Payments of the Annuities (the Whole whereof, from the advanced Age of the Annuitants, may be expected to end in a few Years) your Committee observe, that the present Acts are defective in Powers as to the Appropriation of the funded Property, the internal Government and Regulation of the Harbour, and in other Particulars.

To the Amendment made by your Lordships, in Press 9, Lines l and 2, which is, to leave out from “ notwithstanding” to “ And” in Line 26, the Commons cannot agree: Because,

This Clause was inserted in the Bill by the Com- tnons, in order to prevent Persons who gravel on the said Road with their Carriages evading the Payment of the Tolls, which they ought to be compelled to pay; and the Clause will affect only such Persons as purposely and fraudulently attempt to avoid the Payment thereof.

For these and other Reasons, which have induced the Commons to disagree to the said Amendment, and which other Reasons the Commons decline offer- ing at present, the Commons hope that your Lordships will not insist on the said Amendment, as the Loss of the Bill will, as the Commons apprehend, be attended with considerable Public Inconvenience.

withstanding these Grievances, the Petitioners observe with great Concern a Bill brought into the House to establish a Court of Civil Jurisdiction in Saint John's, which they conceive will be the effectual Means of destroying that valuable Trade, as such will have Authority to call Men from their Employments, perhaps at a Time when tire Welfare of their Voyage may be at Stake; that the Trade has been very seriously injured, and its Decline has been very rapid; Merchants have become Bankrupts, and Boat-keepers become Servants, and many for Want of Employment remain idle at Home; and, without a Removal of their Grievances, and further Encouragements given, the Fishery must dwindle away, and be totally lost to this Country; and, that the Fisheries are variously situated, and that should any Man be liable to be summoned to Saint Johns, Ruin will be certain, and if not liable, the Hardships will be partial ou the Inhabitants, &c. of Saint Johns; should there be a deputed Power to each Harbour, the Number of Officers must be greatly increased, and Injuries accumulated, and Judgment left, not with a Jury, but with a Deputy Judge; and the Petitioners, from Experience, are of Opinion, that nothing but the Laws passed under the Reign of King William the Third, with some further Encouragements, can restore the Fishery to its wonted Greatness: And therefore praying, That the House will closely examine the Returns Annually sent Home to Government for Years past, and thereby ascertain the Value of the Fishery, observe the Number of Men employed in and about the Fishery, and the evident Decrease for a few Years past, and that they will also examine into the Number of Officers stationed on the Island of NeuJ'oundland,the Salaries paid them, and

compare such with the Revenue collected, and they conceive the House will immediately see the Inutility of the Regulations since the Act of King William the Third, the Difficulties under which the Fishery labours, and the Necessity, not only of preventing the Bill now before the House passing into a Law, but of repealing all the Acts complained of, remove the Customs and other Revenue Officers, leaving it on the free State on which alone the Petitioners conceive, and are convinced, that most valuable Branch of all the British Commerce can be retained and flourish.

Duties) from Ireland, and the Province of Canada, and Fifty-four Shillings per Quarter from all other Parts of the World, and that Twenty-six Shillings per Quarter is the Price fixed on Middling British Barley before Barley can be admitted to an F.ntry (at the Low Duties) from Ireland and the Province of , and Twenty-seven Shillings per Quarter from all other Parts of the World, and that Oats, Beans, &c. are fixed at such Prices as, the Petitioners apprehend, will nearly amount to a Prohibition; and that the Petitioners beg Leave to state to the House, that the Western Part of the Kingdom does not grow Com sufficient for the Consumption of its Inhabitants, and that the Counties of Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, Monmouth, and Somerset, Part of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, the South Part of JValcs, the North Parts of Devon, Cornu 'all, Wiltshire, and a Part of Oxfordshire, all

de|)cnd on the Port of Bristol for a Supply of Foreign Grain in Times of Scarcity; and, to illustrate this Fact, they think proper to mention, that, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, 526,623 Bushels of Wheat, and 56,000 Barrels of Flour, were imported into Bristol chiefly from America, which was consumed in the said City, and the Counties above mentioned; and they beg Leave to state to the House, that the great Body of Labourers and Artificers, employed in the numerous Manufactories carried on in various Parts of this Kingdom, cannot afford to purchase Bread for the Support of their Families when Middling Wheat is at Fifty-four Shillings per Quarter, as at such Times the best Wheat will in general be at least Sixty Shillings per Quarter, and they conceive that the Measures proposed to be adopted by the present Bill, will not encourage the Growth of Wheat in this Country, as the high Price of every other Produce of the Land will prevent the Farmer from converting his Pasture Ground into Arable: And therefore praying, That the House will not permit the said Resolutions of the Committee to pass into a Law, but that they will see the Necessity of letting the Prices of Wheat, Barley, Beans, Oats, &c. remain as they now are, and of extending the Time for the Importation of Foreign Grain from Three to Four Months (a Period scarcely sufficient for a Voyage to and from America) and will permit the same, when not admissible at the Low Duties, to be Warehoused, which the Petitioners trust and believe will be the only certain Means to keep the Price of Bread, in Times or Scarcity, within the Reach of the labouring Poor, for without a Supply in Reserve we may be in the utmost Danger of Want from a bad Harvest, for, should such happen in England, it may reasonably be concluded such would happen in Ireland, and, before a Supply can be obtained from Foreign Parts, we may experience a Want bordering on Famine, and see the Poor in Tumults throughout the Kingdom.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Corn imported, and of the Bounty on British Corn exported, be read the Third Time.

ral Letter to Fort Saint dated 3d November 1749, directed a Council to be appointed at Madras, of which Mr. Fawke was to be Second. By their General Letter to the same Place of the 12th of January 1749-50, they named certain Persons to compose the Council for the Management of all their Affairs on the Coromandel Coast Establishment, in which Mr. Fawke was to be Fifth.

On the 7th of May 1750, the Governor and Council of Fort Saint David chose to suspend, by their own Authority, on Grounds or Pretexts by them assigned (and which arc annexed in the Appendix, N* 1.) the Execution of the Plan sent out to them to be executed.

That it appears to your Committee, That the then Members of the said Council proceeded in a secret Manner, and gave Mr. Fawke no Sort of Notice of the Company's Directions regarding him.

It appears to your Committee, That by some Means this Proceeding of the Governor and Council of Fort Saint David's came to the Ears of Mr. Fawke: In consequence of his receiving this Intelligence, on the 22d of May 1750, Mr. Fawke wrote a Letter to the Board, such Secretary of State, testi- desiring to have a Copy of the Company’s Orders lying the Day on which such concerning him, and of the Board's Resolution thereon; which the Secretary was directed to send him. Mr. Fawke w rote another Letter to the Board on the 4th of June 1750, upon the Subject of his being excluded from his Appointment of Second at Fort Saint George till the Company's Pleasure should be known. ’

It also appeared to your Committee by the Fort Saint George Consultations of 9th July 1750, That the Board had resolved that Mr. Fawke should continue there until the Arrival of Mr. Saunders at Fort Saint David, and until they are acquainted with the Resolution of that Board, whether Mr. Fawke is to remain, as Second of Council at that Place, or accept of the Company's last Appointment.

That it appears to yogr Committee, by the Company's General Letter to Fort Saint George, dated 23d August 1751, That they appointed a new Council for the Management of their Affairs at Fort Saint George, and named Mr. Joseph Fawke as Fifth in Council; but

Heport of Mr. Fowke Petition.

692 7° Junii.

it appears Mr Fowke could not have known of this last '* Appointment, as by General Letter from Fort Saint David, dated 30th Septembor 1751, the Company were informed he was coming to England.

It appears ter your Committee, That Mn Fowke did return to England, and did continue in England for several Years; and your Committee examining the said Mr. Fowke concerning the Cause of his having been so long a Time out of the Company’s Employment, he informed your Committee as follows: That very shortly after his Return, but how soon he could not say, the Court of Directors were very desirous of making some Regulations in their Governments Abroad; the Salaries and Allowances of their Presidents being thought fully unequal to the Labours they sustained in their Offices: They wished therefore to put them upon some honourable Footing, and for this Purpose the Secret Committee of the Court of Directors, consisting of Messrs. Drake, Mab-

bott and Burrows, sent a Deputation to him, without any Application of his, either by himself or Friends, desiring he would accept the Charge of their Affairs at Fort Saint George, on the Coromandel Coast. This he objected to upon the Regulations that then existed, and made Proposals to them of serving them upon a fixed Salary, excluding all Perquisites whatever. He had many Conferences with these Gentlemen, who were esteemed the Mouth of the' Court of Directors, and had Power to act by themselves, which ended in their Declaration of their not being empowered to give him any fixed Salary, as it would draw on Applications from the Court End of the Town too powerful to be resisted. Why will not you, said they, accept of this Government on the Terms that other Persons have before you ? Take the Post, and do as others have done before you. — Mr. Fowke replied, If they would utter this in full Court, he would accept of the Government. That they could not do, they said. — His Answer to which was, That he could not accept privately what they could not promise publicly. The Salary was £. 150 per Annum, and the Diet Money about ,£.3,000 a Year, for feeding all the Servants; ana what Mr. Fowke demanded would have come to near £. 5,000 a Year. After this Business went off. Sir llilliam Baker proposed to him the Government of Calcutta, still on the Part of the Direction. To that Government he objected on other Motives, and would accept it on no Terras, as he saw the Fort at that Time was utterly indefensible, and he did not care to risk his Honour in it. That in 1764 he did apply for the Government of Fort Saint George, upon the warm Recommendation of Lord Clive, the Government being then put upon the Footing of fixed Establishment m hich he had first suggested. That Mr. Fowke stated this to the Committee, to shew that his Character has been uniform through Life, as he had been recommended by Men of the first Character in India; that this was a Matter of Notoriety to all those who were concerned in the Affairs of at that Period; that

lie at that Time printed a Paper, stating nearly these Facts.

That it appears to your Committee, That in the Year 1770, Mr. Fowke presented a Petition to the Court of Directors, for Permission to return to Fort Saint George under the Character of a Free Merchant, which having been referred to the Committee of Correspondence, they reported, that having Reference to the particular Circumstances of the Case of Mr. Fowke, who had served the Company many Years on their Civil Establishment at Madras,in the Station of One of the Council

in a Manner highly satisfactory, the Committee were of Opinion that he be permitted to proceed to, and reside at. Fort Saint George os a Free Merchant, notwithstanding the Order of the Court, that no Free Merchants or Free M miners be permitted to proceed to

India that Season; and the Court, by their Order of the 31st October 1770, permitted him to proceed there accordingly.

It appears to your Committee, That Mr. Fowke, then in India, waa re-admitted into the Service of the Company, and on the 8th of January 1778 appointed the youngest Senior Merchant on the Bengal Establishment, with Leave to reside at Benares on his own Account

That it appears to your Committee, That the Governor General and Council, by their Order of 28th December 1780, appointed Mr. Joseph Fowke to an Office, that of Compiler of Standing Orders, with a Salary of 1,500 Rupees per Month.

That it appears to your Commttee, That upon a general Reduction of Offices for the Purpose of (Economy, this Appointment was taken away, and the Subsistence 6f 1,500 Rupees per Month, granted to Mr. Fowke by the Governor General and Council, in consequence thereof was, by Order of the Court of Directors, finally abolished on die 28th September 1785.

In this Manner Mr. Fowke, then in an advanced Age, and without any Complaint against him on the Part of the Directors, which your Committee have been able to discover, was left without any Office under the Company.

That it appears to your Committee, That the Court of Directors, pursuing their Ideas of oeconomical Reform, and willing at the same Time not utterly to ruin deserving or innocent Servants, by the General Letter of their Court to Bengal, dated 21st September 1785, signified their Determination to make certain Allowances to their Servants, according to their Rank and Fortune, during the Time they should be out of Employment, and authorized the Governor General and Council to signify to their Servants out of Employment, that they had the Court's Permission to return to England, where they should enjoy their Annuities till the Time they were again put into Employment

' That it appears to your Committee, That this Order having been made public in Bengal by Earl -

Us, Governor General, and the Council, the Petitioner Joseph Fowke, being then out of Employ, and enjoying, in common with all Servants out of Employment, onFy the mere Allowance of his Rank as Senior Merchant did apply to Earl Cornwallis to return to Europe on th© Terms and Conditions of the Declaration and Assurance of the Court of Directors, made in their Letter of the 21st of September 1785; and that in consequence thereof the said Earl Cornwallis and Council did give him their Permission to return to England, as follows in their Minute dated the 6th December 1787.

“ Bengal General Consultations.

“ Agreed, that Mr. Fowke be permitted to return “ to Europe in the Princess Royal, to draw the Subsistence or Pension allowed to Servants of his Standing, according to the Provision made by the Court “ of Directors in the 75th, 76th, and 77th Paragraphs “ of their General Letter, dated 21st September 1785.”

It appears to your Committee, That the Governor General and Council did inform the Court of Direc-ors of their having given Mr. Fowke Permission to return, and of the Terms on which they had given the said Permission, in their Letter of the 12th January 1788, as follows:

“ Par. 44. We have permitted Mr. Nicholas Grueber, Mr. Joseph Foivke, and Mr. Arthur of

“ your Civil Service, to return to Europe: Mr.

“ las Grueber for the Benefit of his Health; Mr. “ Fowke on the Subsistence allowed in your General “ Letter of the 21st September 1785 to Servants of his “ Rank; and Mr. Molony for the Settlement of hii 12 “ private

2

private Affairs: Messieurs Grueber and em-

“ ir.irkcd in the Princess Royal, and Mr. in the

41 Busbridge”

That Air. Fowke., in consequence of the said Permission, and on the Faith of the said Order of the 21st of September 1785, took his Passage for Europe in the Month of December 1787, before any other Order concerning the Allowances to Servants out of Employ had arrived in Bengal.

Your Committee find, That the Court, by their General I ^et ter to Bengal of 27th March 1787, directed, that on Leave been granted to any of the Company's Civil Servants on the Bengal Establishment to return to their Stations, it be on Condition of their consenting to make the Proof required, and to accept the Allowances agreed to be made them by the General Letter of the 21 st September 1785, and also that they give Bond to re-pay to the Company what may have been paid them or their Agents in Bengal beyond those Allowances. — And that such of the Company’s Servants on the Bengal Civil Establishment as have resigned on the before-mentioned Pensions, and have notified their Arrival in England, and requested to remain on those Pensions, be called upon to signify ther Consent to the aforesaid Conditions, and acquainted that in Failure thereof they will be considered as having relinquished the Company’s Service.

It appears also, That the Court of Directors, after the Departure of Mr. Fowke from Bengal, did make and notify to the Governor General and Council, by their General Letter to Bengal, dated 28th March, 178S, that they had resolved, That no Civil Servant is entitled to the Allowances mentioned in the Court’s Orders to Bengal, of the 21st September 1785, and 27th March 1787, who came Home either on Account of Health, or private Affairs; that those Pensions be confined to such Persons only as were actually deprived of their Situations and Employments, or who were out of Employment in consequence of the Retrenchments made in the Bengal Establishment; that, to entitle any Person to receive such Pensions, he must give satisfactory Proof to the Court as to the Amount of his Fortune at the Time of his leaving Bengal, in which Case, agreeably to the Court's beforementioned Orders, he will be entitled to receive as follows; viz. — A Senior Merchant, whose Fortune at the Time aforesaid was not equal to £. 10,000, as much as, with the Interest of his own Money, shall

field him an Annuity of £.400 Annum’, a Junior lei chant in like Manner £. 300 per Annum; a Factor, or Writer, £. 200 per Annum’, and the Court directed the Governor General and Council to cause the foregoing Resolutions to be published for the Information of their Servants at that Presidency.

That it ap[wars to your Committee, That by various untoward Accidents Mr. Fowke did not arrive in England until August 1788; and that on the 14th Day of October in that Year, he acquainted the Court of Directors of his Arrival in England, and at the same Time made Application for the Pension of £. 400 per Annum, to which, agreeably to their Orders, he was entitled: That on the 15th of October, the said Application was referred to the Committee of Correspondence to examine and report

That Mr. Fowke having waited for some Time the Effect of the said Report, he did, on the 13th of the following November, deliver in an Attestation of his Fortune to Mr. Morton, the Company’s Secretary.

Mr. Fowke still hearing nothing concerning his Application by Letter to the Court, of the 29th December 1788, pressed for a Decision upon his Application for the Annuity; and requested, if the Court should reject his Petition, to have Permission to return to his Station at Calcutta in one of the Ships of the Season.

That it does not appear to your Committee that any Notice whatsoever was taken of this Application; Vol. 46.

but several Months baring elapsed without his receiving any Satisfaction, on the 18th of June 1789 Mr. Fowke wrote another Letter to the Court, reminding them of his former Letters, and of the Severity of his Situation, and pressing for Relief, which Letter on the 24th of June was referred to the Committee of Correspondence to examine and report.

That it app 3ars to your Committee, That no Report was made uiflil the 11th of November 1789, near Four Months after the Reference, and above a Twelve-month from his first Application, when the Committee, in their Report of that Date, offered it as their Opinion to the Court, that Mr. Fowke does not come under the Description of Persons entitled, by the Court’s Orders of the 2tst 1785, and 28th

March 1788, to receive Pensions, and that therefore his Request in that Respect be not complied with; and the Committee offered it as their further Opinion, that he be permitted to return to his Rank in the Company’s Service in Bengal by one of the Ships of this Season.

On reading the Report, the Court resolved, That Mr. Fowke be permitted to return to his Rank this Season: And Mr. Morton, by Letter of the 27th of November 1789, acquainted him with the Court’s Determination.

That your Committee do not find that any Reason is assigned in the Report, or in the Determination, why either the Committee or the Court did not conceive Mr. Fowke to be within the Orders of 1785 or 1788, one or either of them.

Your Committee find. That Mr. Fowke, who had come to England on the Faith of the Orders of the 25th of September, and conceived himself within the true Intent and Meaning of all the Orders, made a Remonstrance to the Court of Directors, in a Letter of the 15th of December 1789, cotnplaining of the hard Treatment he had received at their Hands, which Letter was referred to the Committee of Correspondence, to examine and report.

It appears to your Committee, That it was not until the 22d of April 1790 the Committee, on considering Mr. Fowkes Letter, determined, that they saw no Reason to depart from the Opinion given in their Report of the 11 th of November last; which Resolution, as before, without any Reason assigned, was, on the 23d of April, reported and agreed to by the Court — Mr. Morton, by Letter of the 26th of April 1790, acquainted Mr. Fowke with the Court’s Determination.

That it appears to your Committee, That since that Period, Mr. Fowke never did receive any Pension or Allowance, or any Satisfaction why no Pension or Allowance was given to him, although, as in his Petition he states, he had given in upon Oath, upon Faith of the Company’s Engagements, an exact Inventory of his whole Fortune, as he saith, exposing his Poverty, and the Distress of his Situation, to the World, and doing an irreparable Injury to his Credit, if at his Time of Life, loaded with Years and Infirmities, he was to undertake another Adventure to India, for the Sake of Trade.

That your Committee, being desirous of laying a full Information of all the Particulars of the Case, both on the Part of Mr. Fowke, and on that of the Court of Directors, before the House, did severally examine the said Mr. Fowke concerning his Proceedings, and Mr. Devaynes, then Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors, in order to discover the Principles upon which the Court had delayed to answer Mr. Applica-

tion, and had finally rejected it.

Mr. Joseph Fowke being examined, said, That the Court of Directors did not assign any Reason to him why they continued so long without taking Notice of his Petition, but observed a total Silence; that, soon after his Arrival in England, he waited on Mr. Smith,

the Chairman, but was denied — he waited upon him a '» Second Time, and met with die same Fate; that he then applied to Mr. Devaynes by Letter, in which he begged an Interview with him, but to that Letter he never received any Answer; that no Reasons which induced the Court of Directors to declare his Petition, founded on their Letter of the 2tst September 1785, a9 not coming within the Terms of, their Resolution, have been communicated to him — That, as well as he can recollect, his Father was Fifty Years in the Service of the Company, Thirty of which he was a Member of Council at Fort Saint ‘George — That he was born at Fort Saint George, and will be Seventy-five Years of Age next October.

And Mr. Fowke being examined with respect to the State of his Health‘since he came to England, said, That it was pretty good for the first Year, but that he received a severe Stroke of the Palsy on the 1st of August 1789, which took away the Use of one Side of him, and he continued same for some Months, with his Face distorted, and a Ix»ss of Speech, which he did not recover completely in Six Months afterwards, and he at present feels the Effects of it, though wonderfully recovered — That he suffered severely from the Gravel, which almost crippled him for Two Months last Winter — That he was totally deaf for Two Months some Time ago, and at present hears very ill — That his Voyage Home had been attended with great Expence, as he paid Five Hundred Pounds for his Passage, and believes any one that is acquainted with the Expences of a Passage will not think Two hundred Pounds an unreasonable Charge for him, with a Servant, especially as after he had taken his Passage the Ship was ordered to Bombay.

And being asked, What he had to live on during the Time he was soliciting for the Allowance from the Company ? he said, The Stock he bought amounted to Forty-eight Pounds per Annum.

Your Committee, being desirous of knowing upon what Ideas the Court of Directors proceeded in their Delay to enquire into the Ground of Mr.

Claims, and on which they finally rejected them, asked Mr. Devaynes, late Chairman of the East India Company, Upon what Terms Mr. Fowke came Home? he said, He understood Mr. Fowke was a Pensioner before he came Home.

And your Committee, conceiving that this Answer did not tend to throw any great Light upon the Question, asked, If it w:as on that Principle Mr. Fowke had a Licence to come Home ? he said, That he conceived there was some Contradiction or Misunderstanding between the Orders of the Company and the Resolutions of the Government abroad.

And being asked. Whether he did not consider the Reduction of the Company’s covenanted Servants, and the putting such of those who were not provided for on Pension, with certain Conditions relative to their Fortunes, as a Regulation adopted by the Company? he said, With respect to' any Offices that were abolished, Yes; but with respect to Pensioners, he had his Doubts.

And being asked, What Inducement was there for a Servant, who enjoyed a Pension, and had not the Fortune required by the Company to put him above the Pension, to come over in consequence of the Company's Regulations, and thereby to unload the Bengal Establishment from the Claims of such Servants as were unemployed? he said, He thought the Pensioners were ordered to be struck off, which makes the Distinction between Servants in Office, whose Offices were abolished, and a Pensioner.

And being asked, How it came to be a smaller Hardship for a Man to be dismissed from his Pension than from his Office ? he said, He thought there was a great Difference between a Man in Office and a Pensioner.

And being asked, What was the Reason of the Dif-

nil.

ference with regard to the Hardship? he said, He thought that if (Economy was absolutely necessary, that the Case of a Man who was deprived of an Office was different from that of a Pensioner.

And being asked, If there was any Rule or Order of the Court of Directors which hinders a Pensioner from having as good a Title to a new Office as a Man displaced from Office ? he said, He did not know that there was any.

And being asked, If he recollected, whether Mr. Fowke was not the Person actually deprived of Office? he said, He believed not.

And being asked, Whether he had not been possessed of an Office for the Purpose of compiling and digesting the Company’s Orders to their Government in Bengal, conferred upon him in consequence of the favourable Recommendation of the Company ? he said, He thought there was a Minute of the Council, stating that the Office was made and given him in consequence of such Recommendation.

And being asked, Whether he was not removed from that Office ? he said, He was pretty clear he was; but was not clear whether afterwards the Office had not some additional Duty made to it for his Successor.

And being asked, Whether he was removed in consequence of any Complaints that came to his Knowledge? he said, None that he recollected.

And'being asked, If Mr. Fowke came to Europe upon the Company’s Pension, and actually received it, giving up that on the Bengal Establishment, what would be the Saving to the Company by the Difference? lie said, He did not see that there was any, the Difference only being, that one was paid in England and the other in India.

And being asked, What was the Difference to Mr. Fowke, between losing his Pension in Bengal and getting none in England? he said, He stated some Account by which he made the Claim.

And being asked, Whether Lord Cormcallis, on Mr. Fozoke’a coming from India, notified to him that he was to lose his Pension or Allowance as a Senior Merchant in the Company’s Service, without any Compensation to be given him in England ? he said, He did not know that he did.

And being asked, Whether Mr. Fowke came away with the Knowledge and Consent of Lord Cornwallis, as a Company’s Servant removed from Office, or not provided for by an Office ? he said, He came over with the Leave of the Government, but they do not commonly assign a Reason.

And being asked, Whether be thought he came Home under a bond Jide Expectation of receiving a Pension, Allowance, or Annuity, from the Company, in consequence of their Regulation ? he said. He did not think that the Company’s Regulation was so clear, but believes he came Home with such an Expectation.

And being asked, Whether, when Mr. Fowke came Home, he took the Oath relative to the Extent of his Fortune, agreeably to the Company’s Regulation with regard to Servants out of Employment? he said, He believed he did.

And being asked, Whether Mr. Fowke made any Application to the Company for the Allowance in consequence of the Declaration of his Fortune ? he said, He thought he did Twice.

And being asked, How long it was before he received an Answer to his First Application ? he said. He could not tell.

And being asked, If it wa9 not a considerable Time? he said, As the Committee are in Possession of the Papers, they will shew it more certainly.

And being asked. If he could assign any Reason why so long a Time was taken in giving an Answer to that Old Man ? he said, No.

And being asked. What Answer did the Court give when they did take his Application'into Consideration?

deration? be said. He thought they considered his Claim ill-founded, and negatived it

And being asked. For what Reason they thought his Claim ill-founded ? he said. He believed principally from his being a Pensioner, and not a displaced Servant.

And being asked, If they entered any Minute in which this Reason of Refusal was assigned ? he said, The Report of the Committee may possibly state a Reason.

And being asked. If any Reason of the Refusal was communicated to Mr. Fowke by any Order of the Committee or the Court? he said. The Report was certainly communicated to him.

And being asked, Whether Mr. was ever beard before the Committee or the Court in Support of his Claim? he said, He believed not; it is a Thing very rarely admitted.

And being asked, If be was heard privately by the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman, or by any other of the Committee ? be said, He did not know that Mr. Fowke was, nor did he think it necessary he should, as every Person is desired to state in Writing every Tiling the y have to say.

And being asked, W’hether it is of Course for the Chairman ami Deputy Chairman not to hear privately or publicly the Servants of Standing in their Service relative to their Claims or Pretensions? he said, He always made it a Practice to admit, from the Governor General to a Common Soldier, any Person that came to his House, excepting it was of a Court Day, when he was under the Necessity of being at the India House by Eleven of the Clock in the Morning.

And being asked, Whether Mr. Fowke ever waited upon him ? he said, He believed he did.

And being asked. Whether he saw Mr. Fowke? he said, He thought he did.

And being asked, Whether Mr. Fowke explained his Case to him ? he said. We had some Conversation on the Subject

And being asked, If he recollected when and what it was? he said, It was impossible for him to recollect when, as he generally had Twenty People every Morning.

And being asked, If he recollected whether he assigned to Mr. Fowke the Reason of the Committee ? he said, No, be did not think he saw Mr. Fowke after the Determination of the Committee.

And being asked. If he recollected whether at any Conversation previous to the Determination of the Committee, he assigned to Mr. Fowke any Reason why his Application would probably meet with no Success ? he said, He did not suppose he did; for if the Chairman of the East India Company was to discuss the Points of every Application to the Company, Ten Years would not suffice to do One Year’s Business.

And being asked, Whether it was a Thing of Couree for facilitating of Business, that he never assigned a Reason for granting or refusing the Object of any Appli cation ? he said. He seldom did.

Your Committee finding a material Difference in the Account given by Mr. of his having

admitted the Petitioner to an Audience, and conferred with him upon his Case, and the Declaration of the Petitioner, that be had frequently applied for an Audience but received no Answer, and never had seen the late Deputy Chairman; — the Petitioner offered to make Oath to the Truth of his Allegation, and did present to your Committee the following Affidavit:

Joseph Fowke, of Great Portland Street, London, maketh Oath, That some Time after his Arrival in England, in August 1788, he waited upon Mr. Smith, then Chairman of the Court of Directors of the English East India Company, with an Intention of explaining himself on the Subject of his Return to England, but unfortunately Was denied Admittance; and, to the Vox. 46.

best of his Remembrance, he repeated the Visit with no better Success. — That, upon this Failure, the said Joseph Fowke waited upon Mr. the Deputy

Chairman, who was likewise denied to him; and, that nothing might be wanting on his Part to procure an Interview, he afterwards directed a Letter to him, begging, in respectful Terms, to be favoured with a Meeting, to which he received no Answer. — He further maketh Oath, That he has never seen Mr. Devaynes since his Arrival in England, being an utter Stranger to his Person, nor is conscious that he has ever seen him in his Life.

before m., 1 j , WiUm,

the 4th Day of June 1791./

Your Committee also observing that the late Deputy Chairman alluded to a supposed Pension which had been possessed by Mr. F, and taken from him, asked Mr. Fowke concerning the Nature of the Pension, and its Continuance, *before he left Bengal ? to which he answered, That he had a Pension of near 400 Rupees a Month in common with all Servants of his Rank, and which was paid till the Time he left Bengal.

That it appears to your Committee, That the late Deputy Chairman did not exactly recollect the Circumstances, or had taken some other Person for Mr. Fowke.

Extract of Fort Saint David Consultations, the 7th May 1750.

The Honourable Company, in their Commands just received by the Portjicld, having directed the Appointment of Mr. Joseph Fowke to the Station of Second of Council at Fort Saint George. As the Reasons he gave for declining to accept of being readmitted into the Service, when tendered to him last Year in consequence of the Honourable Company’s Orders, still subsist, and we conceive our Honourable Masters, when acquainted therewith, may therefore deem him undeserving of that Station, and probably be displeased should we make their Service so cheap as to admit of its being declined or accepted of as it suits People’s Conveniency — It is therefore Agreed to suspend complying with their Directions regarding Mr. Fowke, till we are acquainted with their Resolution, upon Receipt of the Advices we transmitted them of the Refusal of Mr. Fowke, and the rest of their Madras Servants, to be re-admitted into their Service, upon the Terms it was offered them, of being under the Council of this Place, as some of the Members of it were Juniors upon the Madras Establishment; and, as we have taken this Step, it is judged unnecessary to give Mr. Fowke any Advice of the Honourable Company’s Directions regarding him.

Appendix, N* 2.

Mr. Fowke's Statement of his Grievances and Offer of

his Services to the East India Company, but never presented.

Mr. Joseph Fowke was taken into the East India Company’s Service in 1736; served in the Secretary’s Office at Fort Saint George nearly Five Years; served as Secretary at Fort Saint David Two Years; had the Charge of the Public Accounts at Fort Saint George for about Two1 Years, and much Trouble in adjusting those Accounts, which were greatly disordered; was taken Prisoner by the French at Fort Saint George in 1746; was dismissed the Service immediately by the Governor and Council at Fort Saint David upon no Plea or Pretence, but that be happened to be in Saint George when it was taken, though no way concerned in the Surrendry of that Place; Weak, however, as this Pretence was, the Court of Directors confirmed the Resolution of their Servants at Saint David; but

again

A. 1791.

again positively ordered the Reinstatement of Mr.

Fowke as Second of Council at Fort Saint George, by their Letter of 3d November, 1749, which the Governor and Council of Fort Saint David thought proper, not only to set aside, but omitted to give Mr. Joseph Fowke the least intimation of the Matter; and as this was a very extraordinary Kind of Proceeding, Mr. Fowke wishes the Consultations at Fort Saint David were turned' to, under Date May 7, May 28, June 8, and September 18, 1750, which sets the whole Business in a very clear Light. In 1752, Mr. Fowke returned home; the Court of Directors very soon made him an Offer of the Government of Fort Saint George; but there having been many Perquisites of a Governor, at that Time inconsistent with his Oath of Fidelity to the Company, Mr. Foa ke found himself under an unavoidable necessity of refusing it, though he offered to take the Charge upon a certain clear Salary of 5,0001, per Annum.This Proposal the Court of Directors could not comply with, and Mr. Fowke had the Mortification to see others enjoy the Government afterwards, when it was in Part reformed upon his own Plan. Mr. Fowke submits his Case to every impartial Man, and is at this Instant willing and desirous Of rendering the Company any Service, and in any Station which the Court of Directors may think consistent with his Honour. Mr. Fowke can testify that he never received from the Company for the many Years of his Service, a Sum altogether exceeding 1,200l. including every Emolument whatever.

This Statement was printed about the Year, or between the Years, 1766 and 1770; the Copies were intended to be made public, but very few were distributed, if any.

Resolved, That it appears to this House, That the Petitioner, Joseph Fowke, has proved the Allegations of his Petition.

Resolved, That it appears to this House, That the said Joseph Foake is entitled to the Pension, or Allowance, engaged to be paid by the East India Company to their Servants, under certain Descriptions, and under certain Conditions, expressed in the Letter from , the Court of Directors, of the 21st of September 1785, to the Governor General and Council of Bengal, from the Time in which, by the said Letter of the 21st of September 1785, Persons described in the said Letter were to receive the same.

The other Order of the Day being read;

Committee The House resolved itself into a Committee of the on Report of vi)0ie House, to consider further of the Report, which,

Mr. Speaker left the Chair.

Mr. Jodrell took the Chair of the Committee.

Mr. Speaker resumed the Chair.

Mr. Jodrell reported from the Committee, That they had come to several Resolutions; which they had directed him to report, when the House will please to receive the same.

And the House, having continued to sit till near One of the Clock on Wednesday Morning;

Ordered, That the Report be received this Day.

And then the House adjourned till this Morning, Eleven of the Clock.

A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That admitting the future Income to meet the estimated Expenditure, or even so to increase, as with the Aid of a Lottery to satisfy the above certain extra Demands, in the- Course of the Five Years next ensuing, yet will the Public Income remain wholly unequal to afford the smallest Aid to any new and' unforeseen Demand that may arise, either for any Armament or any other unforeseen Contingency within that Period, or to spare the smallest Surplus towards the Reduction of the unfunded Debt, already increased to a Degree, and continued at an Amount, wholly unprecedented, in Time of Peace, in the Annals of this Country;

And the previous Question being put, That that Question be now put;

It passed in the Negative.

A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That the Experience of the Three last Years, in the Course of which the unexpected and heavy Expence of Two Armaments has been incurred and satisfied, while a Third remains to be provided for, would render it highly improvident in this House not to advert to the Probability of similar Events recurring;

And the previous Question being put, That that Question be now put;

It passed in the Negative.

A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That the Sum stated by the Select Committee to have been actually applied to the Discharge of the Public Debt, amounts to £4,750,000 ;from which it is admitted that there should be deducted the Tontine Million increased on the Navy Debt, and other Articles of Debt contracted, to the Amount of £ 1,602,589, leaving a Balance of £ 3,147,411;

And the previous Question being put, That that Question be now put;

It passed in the Negative.

A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That, in the Account of the Debt contracted, no Allowance is made for such Part of the Old Navy Debt as now bears Interest, and which must be considered as Additional Debt; nor are the Short Annuities granted in 1789 admitted, although the Installment repaid, instead of being paid over to the Commissioners for reducing the National Debt, was applied to the Services of last Year;

And the previous Question being put, That that Question be now put;

It passed in the Negative.

A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That the Annual Interest of the Capital Stock, stated to have been purchased by the Commissioners for reducing the National Debt, up to the 1st of February 1791, amounts to the Sum of £ 203,170; from which is to be deducted the increased Annual Charge for the Interest of the Tontine Loan, viz. £ 42,262, leaving the Sum in Favour of the Commissioners £ 160,908; and if from this Sum a further Reduction is made for the Increase of Interest on the Navy Debt, stated, since the Report of the Select Committee, to amount to £ 49,888, that Sum will be reduced to £111,020;

And the prei^ous Question being put, That that Question be now put;

It passed in the Negative.

A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That the permanent Addition to the Peace Establishment, stated by the Select Committee of 1791, as to remain on the Five Articles before enumerated, amounts to £ 434,295; so that, while, an Annuity to the Amount of £111,020 has been redeemed by the Commissioners on Behalf of the Public, in the Form of re-purchasing Debt, an Annuity of Four Times that Amount is proposed to be entailed on the Nation, in the Form of increased Establishment;

And the previous Question being put. That that Question be now put;

It passed in the Negative.

A Motion was made, and the Question being put, That, upon due Consideration of the Report made this Day from the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Consideration of the Report from the Select Committee of 1791, was referred, and also upon Consideration of the Two Reports of 1791 and 1786, and of the several Accounts before the House relative to the Public Income and Expenditure, it appears proper and necessary to declare, that the great Increases

Report respecting the Applies^ tion of Money eoted for Carlton House.

The Lord Sheffield reported from the Committee, who were appointed to esquire respecting the Application of the Money voted for the Additions to, and the furnishing of, Carlton House; That the Committee had enquired accordingly, and had directed him to make a Report thereof to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

Your Committee find. That the Sums voted by Parliament for the Additions to, and furnishing of, Carlton House, amounting to £-55,200, were issued from the Treasury to Mr. Lyte, Treasurer to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, a\ various Times; and that by the express Command of His Royal Highness, the said Sums were set apart, and kept separate, in an Account at Messrs. Ransom, Moreland, and s, and

made subject to the Order of Mr. Henry Holland, the Architect, to be applied to the Purposes for which they were issued.

And your Committee further find, That the Whole of the said Money has been paid to Mr. Holland, excepting the Sum of £. 4,450, paid by Mr. Hammersley to the Upholsterer, on Account, for Furniture.

It appears to your Committee, That the Money so received by Mr. Holland, has been paid to different Persons employed in the Works of Carlton House', whose Names, and the Sums paid to each, have been, laid before your Committee.

It appears, That such Payments have been made on an open Account, leaving a considerable Balance due for Work already done; and it also appears to your Committee, That the Additions to, and furnishing of, Carlton House, are incomplete.

It also appears to your Committee, That the Estimate of the 14th of May 1787 is stated by Mr. Holland as having been made in great Haste: That the same appears to have been referred, in July following, by the Command of the Prince of Wales, to the Officers of His Majesty’s Works, who declined giving any Opinion on the Particulars thereof, further than that the Prices proposed to be allowed to the Tradesmen, as far as they went, agreed with those usually allowed in His Majesty's Works: That no other Estimate was formed till His Royal Highness ordered the Estimate of November 1789 to be prepared, which Estimate was afterwards reduced nearly One Half, by His Royal Highness Himself.

That in the Title of this last Estimate, there appears a material Error in referring to the Date of the Application to Parliament in 1787, and stating Articles of Furniture as being for other State Rooms not then projected, the Meaning of which is now explained by Mr. Holland to be this — That it is an Estimate of Furniture intended to replace Articles designed to be used before any State Rooms were projected, and certain Articles of which were intended to be employed in the State Rooms, until an Alteration was made in the Plan of Furniture, as stated and explained 10 the Letter of Colonel Hulse and Mr. Holland, of November 17th 1789, which is before-the House; but Vol. 46.

The Lords have agreed to

Oyster Fisheries Bill, with an Amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

that the State Rooms are the same as described in the Building Estimate of May 14th 1787, and that no new Buildings or Rooms have been aidded, although some Alterations have been made in the Arrangement of the Apartments.

Ordered, That the said Report do lie upon the Table.

Ordered, That such a Number of Copies of the said Report be printed, as shall be sufficient for the Use of the Members of the House.

Qj Can you form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Duration of His Majesty’s Illness ?

A. The Time necessary for obtaining the Cure cannot be ascertained.

House acquainted with the Continuance of His Majesty* 111-ueU.

Examination of Hi* Physiciana delivered in.

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the House, That they were again assembled in the same pnhappy Circumstances which he had been under the melancholy Necessity of communicating at their last Meeting, the Continuance of His Majesty’s Illness still preventing any Measures either for opening the Sieflion, or proroguing the Parliament, and rendering it for the present impossible for His Majesty Personally to attend to any Public Business — That in this Situation the Privy Council had thought it their Duty to call before them His Majesty’s Physicians, and examine them, on Oath, concerning the State of His Majesty’s Health; a Copy of which Examination he had in his Hand — That as he could in no other Way give the House any Information equally accurate and authentic on this important SuBjedt, and as he had the Permission and Direction of the Privy Council to tender this Paper to the House, he wished to know their Pleasure as to the Mode of communicating it; and if there appeared no Objcdtion in Point of Form, which he conceived there could not, he would propose to deliver it in at the Table, and move, that it might be read by the Clerk,

Which being agreed to by the House;

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer accordingly deli-ycred in the said Paper, containing the said Examina-

Q. Whether, in that particular Species of the Disorder that His Majesty has fallen into, it has been found, from Experience, that the greater Number of Persons so affected have been cured ?

A. It is not in my Power to ascertain the Species, because no known Dillemper has preceded, that can account for it.

Whether, so far as Experience enables Dr. Warren to judge of His Majesty’s Disorder, he thinks it more probable that His Majesty will, or will not, recover, so as to render him capable of attending to Public Business ?

A. I have not, and I believe it is impossible for any one to have. Data sufficient for the Answer to this Question.

Q. What Degree of Experience has Dr. Warren had himself, or does he know others to have had, in this particular Species of Disorder ?

A.It has fallen to my Lot to fee a great Number of Persons, in the Course of Twenty-seven or Twenty-eight Years Practice, who have had the same Disorder with which His Majesty is now afflicted; I have generally attended them for a fiiort Space of Time, and have seen some of them get w-ell, sometimes under my foie Care, sometimes in Conjunction with Physicians who profess this Branch of Medicine only. It has frequently happened, but not always, that if the Patient did not soon get well, 1 left him under the Care of the Physicians who professed this particular Branch of Medicine only, who sometimes afterwards sent for me in Consultation.

Sir George Baker, Baronet, called in, and sworn s and examined, as follows;

You are desired to acquaint this Board, whether the State of His Majesty’s Health is such, as to render Him incapable of coming in Person to His Parliament, or of attending to any Kind of Public Business ?

A. His Majesty, in His present State, is unfit for any Public Business.

What are the Hope? you entertaiq of His Majesty’s Recovery ? '

A. The

A. The Hopes that I entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery depend upon the Experience of Physicians, particularly those who attend the Public Hospitals, by which we learn, that the greater Part of those who have been affected, as His Majesty now is, have been cured. f

£). Can you form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Duration of His Majesty’s Illness ?

A. 1 can form no Conjecture of the Duration of His Majesty’s Illness.

Sir Lucas Pepys, Baronet, called in, and sworn; -and examined, as follows:

You areddired to acquaint this Board, whether the State of His Majesty’s Health is such, as to render Him incapable of coming in Person to His Parliament, or of attending to any Kind of Public Business > 1

A. Undoubtedly the State of His Majesty’s Health is such.

ijj. What are the Hopes you entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

A. There is a Probability of His Majesty’s Recovery.

4J. Does Sir Lucas Pepys found the Opinion, given in his Answer to the preceding Question, upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Disorder, or upon general Experience in other Cafes of the same Nature, or upon both ?

A. I do not found my Opinion of the Probability of His Majesty’s Recovery on any particular Symptom or Circumstance peculiar to the same of His Majesty, but on the general Consideration that the Majority of those who are afflicted with Symptoms of a similar Disorder do recover.

Q. Can you form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Duration of His Majesty’s Illness ?

A. It will be impossible to form any Opinion upon that. /

Q. What Degree of Experience has Sir Lucas Pepys tad himself, or does he know others to have had, of this particular Species of Disorder ?

A. I have occasionally attended Patients who have had a similar Disorder j but more frequently with those Physicians who have made it their particular Practice to attend such Patients.

DoCt T Henry Revel! Reynolds called in, and sworn;

and examined, as follows:

i^. You are desired to acquaint this Board, whether the State of His Majesty’s Health is such as to render Him incapable of coming in Person to His Parliament, or of attending to any Kind of Public Business ?

A. I think the State of His Majesty at present is such as will prevent Him from doing that.

4J. What are the Hopes you entertain of His Majesty's Recovery ?

A. I think that the Probability is in Favour of His Majesty’s Recovery.

i^. Does Dr. Reynolds found the Opinion given in his Answer to the preceding Question upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Disorder, or upon general Experience in other Cafes of the same Nature, or upon both ?

A. Upon general Experience — upon my own Experience, and upon the Experience of Gentlemen older in the Profession than myself, with whom I have conversed upon such Subjects.

Can Dr. Reynolds form any Judgment, or pro-

Vol. XLIV.

bable Conjecture, of the Diiration of His Majesty’s Illness ?

A. No, I cannot — It may be some Weeks — It may be some Months-»but it'is impossible to ascertain the Time.

Q. What Degree of Experience has Dr. Reynolds had himself, dr does he know others to have had, in this particular Species of Disorder ?

A. 1 have been very near Twenty Years in the Practice of my Profeflidn — I have seen several Persons afflicted with the Malady with which His Majesty is afflicted, both singly and in Consultation with Gentlemen who have dedicated themselves to that particular Branch.

Dr. Anthony Addington called in, and sworn; and examined, as follows:

Q You are desired to acquaint this Board, whether the State of His Majesty's Health is such as to render Him incapable of coming in Person to His Parliament, or of attending to any Kind of Public Business ?

A. Most certainly it is.

Q. What are the Hopes you entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery ?'

A. The same Hopes that I should have of any other Patient in whose Family this Disease is not Hereditary — His Majesty has no Symptom whatever, that I know of, but what I have seen in other Patients who have recovered.

Q. Can you form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Duration of His Majesty’s Illness ?

A. 1 protelt I cannot with any Kind of Certainty.

Whether, so far as Experience enables Dr. Act dington to judge of His Majesty’s Disorder, he thinks it more probable that His Majesty will or will not recover, so as to render Him capable of attending to Public Business ?

A. 1 Should think it more probable that His Majesty will recover, so as to be in Health, to enable Him to attend to Public Business — by which I mean in as good Health as He was before He had the Miffortune to labour under His present Illness.

What Degree of Experience has Dr. Addington had himself, or does he know others to have had, of this particular Species of Disorder ?

A.It is impossible to be a Physician for any Length of Time, without being concerned with Patients afflicted with this Disorder — They were so common in the Neighbourhood of Readinthat I built an House contiguous to my own Dwelling House for the Reception of such unfortunate Patients; in this House I had constantly Patients attended by myself every Day, unless I was ill, for Five Years — The House usually contained Eight or Ten such Patients — of those I believe 1 never saw an Instance of any (who wafc not reasonably deemed to be an Incurable before he or she were brought to my House) but what recovered within the Year, and many in much less Time — I never saw but Two Patients of my own confined longer than One Year — perhaps it may be material to say, that several of these Patients had been afflicted for Two or Three Years before they came into my House.

A MEMBER returned upon a new Writ took Member take* the Oaths, and made and subscribed the Declaration, and took and subscribed the Oath of Abjuration, and delivered in to the Clerk of this House an Account of his Qualification, and took and subscribed the Oath of Qualification, according to the Laws made for those Purposes.,

Mr.Chancellor of the Exchequer reported from the Report fro*» Committee, appointed to examine the Physicians who have attended His Majesty during His Illness, touch- examine Hit ing the State of His Majesty’s Health, and to report £*ai!ty’* such Examination to the House; That the Committee y tias" had examined the said Physicians j and had directed him to report such Examination to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; v.

Your Committee have, pursuant to the Order of the House, proceeded to examine the said Physicians; which Examination is as follows:

Doctor Richard Warren called in, and examined*

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health is, or is not, such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

His Majesty’s State of Health is such as to render Him incapable of coming to Parliament, or attending Public Business.

What Hopes has Dr. Warren of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

The Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery must depend on the Probability of Cure; and that can only be judged of by what has happened to others in similar Cafes; and, as the Majority of others have recovered, there is a Probability that His Majesty may recover likewise.

Can Dr. Warren form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time which His Majesty’s Illness is likely to last ?

No.

What Degree of Experience has Dr. Warren had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afflicted ?

In the Course of 27 or 28 Years Practice I have seen many Persons disordered in a Manner similar to that of IJis Majesty; some have soon recovered under

3 my

29 Geo. III.

my foie Care j when that has not happened, I have always called in the Persons who make this Branch of Medicine their particular Study, and have sometimes attended in Coqjundtion with them, but have oftener left the Patients to their Care, and have afterwards attended in Consultation only, and in many Cafes not at all.

Whether, when Dr. Warren speaks of others in limilar Cafes to that of His Majesty, he means to include all the different Species of the Disorder, or to confine himself to that particular Species with which His Majesty is afflicted ?

I do not mean to confine myself to that particular Species with which His Majesty is afflicted* but to include all the different Species of the Disorder.

Can Dr. Warren state how many particular Species there are of this Disorder ?

No.

Can he state any distinct Species of the Difbtder ?

Yes — though the immediate Causes of this Disorder cannot be ascertained, yet some of the remote ones are well known. — Injuries received from Blows or Falls — sudden Affections of the Mind — the Effect of Fever. Besides these, there are several Internal Causes of this Disorder; namely, Exoftofes* Indurations, and Ill-Conformatiod of the Parts.

Whether this Disorder may not sometimes exist, when it cannot be referred to any of those Causes which Da-. Warren has specified ?

Yes.

Is His Majesty* Disorder, in your Opinion, refer-rible to any of the Causes enumerated By you j or can you assign any known Cause to which, in your Judgement, it is referrible ?

I cannot assign His Majesty's Malady to any Cause whatever, as I have not Data sufficient to ground an Answer upon.

In those Species of the Disorder* which are not referrible to any assignable Cause, is the Probability of "Cuteigreater or lefsthan the 'Probability estimated cm all the Species taken together ?

i cannot tell.

Can Dr. Warren state what the comparative Probability is, in -each of the Causes which he has assigned ?

The Disorder proceeding from External Injuries, such as Blows, is frequently cured if Medicine be ex-peditioufiy applied. When the Malady arises from sudden Affections of the Mind, it is very frequently cured — when from the Effect of Fever, it is oftener cured than when from any other Cause. — When the Malady proceeds from the(Internal Causes mentioned above, no Good can be done by Medicine.

Can Dr. Warren state what Proportion, of the whole Number of Persons afflicted with this Malady, have been so, owing to each of the Causes he has enumerated, and what Proportion, where it can be referred to no assignable Cause ?

I cannot state any precise Proportion j but, out of a great Number, there are very few Cafes where it is possible to ascertain that it proceeds from any af-signable Cause.

Is there any one of the particular Causes enumerated, to which Dr. Warren can say that the Disorder with which His Majesty is afflicted is not to be referred?

1 do not think His Majesty’s Disorder appears to proceed from any one of the Causes enumerated by me.

Cap Dr. Warren say with Certainty, whether His

1

Majesty’s Disorder may; or may not; have proceeded from Injury by Blows or Falls ?

I cannot.

C4n Dr; Warren say with Certainty; whether His Majesty’s Disorder may, or may not, have proceeded from sudden Affections of the Mind ?

I cannot.

Can Dr. Warren say with Certainty, whether His Majesty’s Disorder may, Or may not, have been the Effect of Fever ?

I can say with Certainty it has not.

Can Dr. Warren say with Certainty, whether His Majesty’s Disorder may, or may not, have proceeded from any of the Internal Causes he has mentioned ?

I cannot.

Whether, in those Species of the Disorder which cannot be referred to any assignable Cause, the Probability of Cure may not be various in different Cafes, according to the Symptoms of the particular Cafe, or the apparent Degree of the Disorder ?

I think not, unless Signs of Convalescence are coming on.

Whether the Knowledge of the remote Cause is of Assistance towards promoting the Cure ?

In many Cafes I think it is, but sometimes not.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Dr. Warren fees any present Signs of Convalescence?

No.

Whether every Cure, in the same Person, of a Disorder which has returned, is included in the Calcubu tiens of the whole Number of Cures ?

I consider every same that comes as a new Cafe, and have included them in that Calculation; but believe that, excluding them, the Majority still are cured.

Whether, of those Persons whose Disorder cannot be referred io any assignable Cause, the greater Number have, or have not, been cured ?

I cannot answer that with Accuracy.

Has the greater Number of Men, that have been afflicted with this Disorder, recovered ?

Yes.

Has the greater Number of Persons recovered, whose Disorder has lasted, without Signs of Convalescence, as long as that of His Majesty has already done ?

Yes.

Withdraws.

Sir George Baker called in, and examined.

Whether, in your Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health is, or is not, such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

I think that the State of His Majesty’s Health is such, as renders Him incapable of coming to Parliament, or of doing any other Public Business.

What Hopes has Sir George Baker of His Majesty’s Recovery?

I hope that His Majesty will recover, because I think it probable. My own Experience, and the Experience of other Physicians, leads me to think, that His Majesty’s Disorder is curable.

Can Sir George Baker form any Judgment, or pro-

bable Conjecture, of -the Time which His Majesty’s lllness is likely to last ?

I can form no Judgment or Conjecture as to the probable Duration of His Majesty’s Disorder.

What

«. „ 10° Decembris.

What Degree of Experience has Sir George Baker had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afflitted ?

I was formerly a Pupil of Dr. who attended

an Hospital, where I had an Opportunity of seeing many Instances of this Disorder. I have likewise had private Patients, from Time to Time, under that Disorder; but whenever the Disorder has been of some Continuance, I have desired the Assistance of Physicians who particularly attended Persons so disordered.

Whether Sir George Baker founds his Opinion, in his Answer to the Second Question, upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Cafe, or upon his Experience of the Disorder in general, or upon both ?

Upon my Experience of the Disorder in general.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Sir George Baker fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

I do not ice any present Signs of Convalescence.

Whether Sir George Baker learns from Experience, that the greater Number of Persons, who have been afflicted with this Disorder, have recovered ?

Upon general Experience, the greater Part have recovered.

Whether every Cafe, in the same Person, of a Disorder which has returned, is included in the Calculation of the whole Number of Cures ?

I will not undertake to answer that Question.

Has the greater Number of Men, that have been aJHi&ed with this Disorder, recovered ?

1 think so.

Has the greater Number of Persons recovered, whose Disorder has lasted, without Signs of Convalescence, as long as that of His Majesty has already done ?

Yes, I can answer that in the Affirmative.

Was Sir George Baker in Attendance upon His Majesty, as His Physician, previous to His being afflicted with His present Disorder ?

Yes.

Whether Sir George Baker can assign any known Cause, to which, in his Judgment, His Majesty’s present Disorder is referrible ?

1 can assign no known Cause to which His Majesty’s present Disorder is referrible.

Was the Attack of His Majesty’s Disorder sudden, or gradual ?

Sudden.

When did that Attack take Place ?

The first Suspicion 1 had of this Disorder, was in the Evening of Wednesday% the aid of October last.

Whether any Fever, or other Complaint, had preceded that Attack ?

There had been Fever, and other Complaints; but on that Morning His Majesty had no Fever.

Whether, in Cafes where the Attack has been sudden, the Recovery has been sudden also ?

My Observations on this Disorder do not enable me to answer that Question.

Withdraws.

The Reverend Doctor Francis Willis called in, and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health is, or is not, such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

He certainly is not capable.

What Hopes has Dr Willis of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

1 have great Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery. If it were any other Person but His Majesty, I should scarce entertain a Doubt: When His Majesty reflects upon an lllness of this Kind, it may depress His Spirits, and retard His Cure more than a common Person.

Can Dr. Willis form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time which His Majesty’s lllness is likely to last ?

I cannot.

What Degree of Experience has Dr. Willis had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afflicted ?

A great deal, for a8 Years; I imagine I have never had less than Thirty Patients every Year of the Time.

Whether Dr. Willis founds his Opinion, in his Answer to the Second Question, upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Cafe, or upon his Experience of the Disorder in general, or upon both ?

Upon both.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Dr. Willis fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

I cannot say that I do; at the same Time there is every Thing leading towards it, as the Irritation has in a great Measure subsided, which must precede Convalescence, or any Appearance of it. It must come on very gradually.

Whether Dr. Wtllir learns from Experience, that the greater Number of Persons, who have been afflicted with this Disorder, have recovered ?

A very great Majority; I do not think 1 Should speak false, if I said Nine out of Ten, of those that have been put under my Care, within Three Months after they had begun to be aifii&ed with the Disorder.

Whether every Cure in the same Person, of a Disorder which has returned, is included in the Calculation of the whole Number of Cures ?

If a Person has been Twice brought under my Care, and Twice cured, I reckon two Cures, as I should of a Fever.

Has the greater Number of Men, that have been afflicted with this Disorder, recovered ?

I never calculated that; I did not think there was any Difference between the Two Sexes as to the Facility of Cure.

What State of his Patients does he consider as- a Cure? %

Their being able to take upon themselves the Conduit of their own Affairs, and to do the same Business they were used to do before they fell ill.

What is the shortest Space of Time within which, in his Experience, he has known Persons, affeited as His Majesty is, restored to Health ?

Six Weeks, or Two Months, is the shortest, I believe.

Does Dr. Willis see any Thing in His Majesty's Case, which enables him to pronounce that His Majesty may not be restored to Health within that Compass of Time from the Commencement of his Attendance on His Majesty ?

I do not fee any Thing to enable me to pronounce that he may not.

Does

Does Dr. Willis see any Thing in His Majesty's Case, which enables him to pronounce that His Majesty will be restored to Health within that Space of Time ?

1 cannot presume to say that He will.

What has been the longed: Space of Time for which the Disorder has lasted, in the same of such Patients as have beert brought to him within Three Months from the Beginning of the Attack, and as have recovered ?

A Year and an Half, I believe, has been the longed of such Patients as have been brought to me and few have been so long.

What is the most ordinary Space of Time he has found necessary for the Cure of such Patients ?

1 should think Five or Six Months, as near as I can calculate.

How long has Dr. Willis attended His Majesty ?

Since Friday Morning lad.

Whether, from your own Observation, or from the Particulars which have been communicated to you, you can assign any known Cause, to which, in your Judgment, His Majesty’s Disorder is referrible ?

From my own Experience with regard to His Majesty, I cannot say any Thing; but from a very particular Detail of His Mode and Manner of Life for Twenty-seven Years, I do imagine, that weighty Bu-finess, severe Exercise, and too great Abstemiousness, and little Rest, has been too much for His Constitu-tkm. — It is very early to give an Opinion, and I may be mistaken, but I am the more inclined to think myself right, because the Medicine that has been given His Majesty ever fipce Sunday Morning, and was intended to meet and counteract those Causes* has.had as much Effect as I could wilh; and His Majesty has certainly been gradually better from the First Six Hours of His taking it.

Whether you have Reason to believe, that the Circumstances you have enumerated are frequently Causes of this Disorder ?

I believe they are very frequently.

Where the Disorder has arisen from such Causes, have you frequently known it cured ?

Very frequently.

Have the greater Number of those Cafes been cured or not ?

Certainly. I believe they are more easily to be cured, than where the Disorder proceeds from excessive Drinking, or other Intemperance, or some other Causes.

Doctor ’Thomas Gijbome called in, and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health is, or is not, such as to render His Majesty incapable of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business?

1 think He is absolutely incapable.

What Hopes has Dr. Gijbome of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

I think there are Hopes.

Can Dr. Gijbome form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time which His Majesty’s Illness is likely to last ?

1 think that is impossible.

What Degree of Experience has Dr. Gijbome had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afflicted ?

Not much particular Experience. I have seen Persons affected in the same Way, even to a greater Degree, who have recovered.

Vofc. XUV.

Whether Dr. Gijbome founds his Opinion, in his Answer to the Second Question,. upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Cafe, or upon his Experience of the Disorder in general, or upon both ?

Upon both.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Dr. Gijbomr fees any present Signs of Convalescence \

1 think that can hardly be said.

Whether Dr. Gijbome can assign any known Cause to which, in his^ Judgment, His Majesty’s present Disorder is referrible I No.

Withdraws.

Doctor Anthony Addington called in, and examined.

Whether, in your Opinion^ the State of His Majesty’s Health is, or is not, such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of’ attending to Public Business ?

I think He is incapable, at least He was when I saw His Majesty last: It was about a Week ago.

What Hopes has Dr. Addington of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

I think there are very good Grounds of Hope.

Can Hr. Addington form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time which His Majesty’s Illness is likely to last i

It is a very hard Matter to form any certain Judgment or Conjecture.

What Degree of Experience has Dr. Addington had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afHicted ?

I had Patients, in a House that I built at,

for Five Years antecedent to the Year 1754, when I came to London.

Do you found your Opinion, in your Answer to the Second Question, upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Cafe, or upon your Experience of the Disorder in general, or upon both ?

I think there is some Reason to found it upon Symptoms, as well as Experience. — Though I have seen His Majesty very unquiet, it did not arise tt> that Degree of Inquietude which denoted a Disease that would be of very long Duration. I thought there, was something in the very Habit of Body, as well as in His Majesty’s Complexion, and in what had beep H is Way of Life, that was very favourable to a Cure. — Where there is not a very great Exertion of Body or Mind, Persons who have lived in the Way His Majesty has done, are very rarely liable to this Illness. — From the Account I had from my Brethren, who had the Honour to attend His Majesty, I had very great Expectations that it would end happily, from this Circumstance — that it had not for its Forerunner that Melancholy which usually precedes a tedious Illness of this Sort. — I never knew an instance of an Illness, that, under proper Care, run to any great

Length, which had not been so preceded. ----- -- — As

for Experience, I have visited a considerable Number of Patients in that Disease, in and round finding the y could not be taken so much Care of as they ought to be in their Houses, and that I might be as little interrupted as possible in the Practice of other Branches of my Profession, I built a House, contiguous to my own, for the Reception of such Patients. — I visited them there constantly every Day. — I had from Eight to Ten Patients there usually at a Time, — during that Time, Two Patients were admitted, who were reasonably deemed to be incurable at the Time of their coming, and for Years before. — During the Charge of my Patients, for Five Years together,

D At

*o i o° Decembrts. . 1788.

at that House, I never had more than Two Other Patients that were not cured within the Year, and continued well, as far as ever I knew. Some recovered in much shorter Time; and I had several that were quite well within a Quarrer of a Year. — If any of those Persons had relapsed, I believe, from the partial Opinion of their Families, I should have heard of it. — Where there is a Relapse, I should not call it a perfect Cure.

What State of the Patients did Dr. Addington coh-fider as a Cure ?

When the Patient was able to do every Thing that a Man in Health does.

What were the particular Circumstances of the Two Patients before mentioned by Dr. , which

occasioned their being deemed incurable ?

One of these Persons had been for many Years under the Lare of a very skilful Physician, in an House for the Reception of Patients order this Disorder. It was a same that was different from all others with which I have been acquainted, both in the Cause, and in the Circumstances which preceded and attended it. — The other was a Patient who„ I.believe, had been ill very many Years; (he had been for some Time under the Care of an eminent Phvfician, who wished her to be put into a House where (he might be taken Care of for Life; (he was Atrabilious in the highest Degree, and died, from the Lffetts of that Disorder, in about a Week.

Whether the Majority of the Patients under your Care were Men, or Women ?

I think nearly equal.

Whether Dr. Addington profelfed to take, and did in.Fad take, all Patients that were offered him ?

I had not always Room. — I excluded none on Account of the Nature of the Disorder.

What has been Dr. Addington's Attendance on His Majesty ?

I saw His Majesty for Three Days successively, and for Twice each Day for a considerable Time.

Whether, during the Time of that Attendance, he observed any Signs of actual Convalefcctace in His Majesty i

No.

Whether, from your own Observation, or from the Particulars which have been communicated to you, you can adign any known Cause to which, in your Judgment, His Majesty’s Disorder is referrible ?

I cannot pretend to say what the Cause was, either from what I saw, or what was communicated to me. — I do not chuse to hazard a Conjecture.

Withdraws.

Sir Lucas Pepys called in, and examined.

Whether, in your Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health is such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

The State of His Majesty’s Health is certainly such as to render Him incapable of coming to Parliament, or attending to Public Business.

What Hopes has Sir Lucas Pepys His Majesty’s Recovery ?

I have the same Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery as I should have if He were labouring under any other Disease, of which I knew that the Majority labouring under it did recover. That the Majority do recover, 1 am satisfied from my own Experience, and from the Assurance of a Person who has most Experience in Cafes of this Sort.

Can Sir Lucas Pepys form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time which His Majesty’s lllness is likely to last ?

It is impossible to form any Conjecture on that Subject.

What Degree of Experience has Sir Lucas Pepys had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afllicted ?

I have occasionally seen several Persons under that Disorder, sometimes alone, but more frequently with those whose Practice leads them more particularly to attend to it.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Sir Lucas Pepys fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

His Majesty is more quiet than He has been; but there are no present Signs of immediate Conva-lefcence.

Are there any actual Symptoms at present, which lead Sir Lucas Pepys to entertain more favourable Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery, than he has hitherto had during his Attendance ?

I think there are very material Symptoms, as His Majesty’s general State of Health is certainly much better than it was.

Is the Amendment that has taken Place, only in His Majesty’s general State of Health, or is there any Abatement of His particular Disorder ?

From His Majesty’s general State of Health being better, His Sleep is more quiet, His Appetite is better, and He is more in His usual State; all which Circumstances mull previously oedur before Recovery: But these are only leading Steps towards Recovery — the Disorder still remains j it is difficult to say whether it is actually abated.

What does Sir Lucas Pepys mean by His Majesty being more in His usual State ?

More quiet, and in a less perturbed State.

Whether it is Sir Lucas Pepys's Opinion, that there is, or is not, at present any Abatement of His Majesty’s Disorder ?

I have answered it, by saying that it is difficult to say whether there is any actual Abatement, and I wish to explain my Meaning in these Words. — The only Way of explaining it is by Analogy to some other Complaint. In the same of a Mortification, where the Bark would most probably effect a Cure, 1 could not say, during several Hours after its being taken, whether there was, or was not, any Abatement of the Mortification: So, in the same of His Majesty, I cannot say, whether the Return of general Health has, or has not, yet produced any actual Abatement of the particular Disorder; but such a Return of general good Health would lead me to be of Opinion that an evident Abatement might be expected. I can however say, that no actual evident Abatement has yet taken Place.

When Sir Lucas Pepys, in his Answer to the Second Question, dates that the Majority of Persons labouring under the same Disorder with His Majesty do recover, does he mean to include all the different Species of the Disorder, or to confine himself to that particular Species with which His Majesty is affected i

I mean in that Estimate to speak of the Disorder generally, and not fpccjally.

Can you assign any known Cause to which, in your Judgment, His Majesty’s present Disorder is refer-rible ?

I know no evident, or assignable Cause.

Is His Majesty’s a frequent Species of the Disorder ?

It is a frequent Species of the Disorder.

In

Committee appointed to examine Precedents of Proceedings in the same of the PersonalExcr-

cifeot ^e Royil Authority being interrupted*

In this Species, do the Majority recover ?

Certainly, in this Species the Majority do recover.

Doctor Henry Revel Rey called in, and

examined.

Whether, in your Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health ip, or is not, such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

His Majesty is certainly incapable of it.

What Hopes has Dr. 1 R of His Majesty’s Recovery I

I think there are well-founded Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery.

Can Dr. Reynolds form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time which His Majesty’s lllncfs is likely to lad ?

No.

What Degree of Experience has Dr. Reynolds had of the particular Species of Disorder with which His Majesty is afflicted ?

I have been almod Twenty Years in Business, and io the Course of that Time I have seen a great Number under this Disorder, both singly and together with others.

Whether you found your Opinion, in your Answer to the Second Qucdion, upon the particular Symptoms of His Majesty’s Cafe, or upon your Experience of the Disorder in general, or upon both ?

Rather upon general Experience though I think there is nothing peculiar in His Majesty’s same which forbids the Preemption of Recovery.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, you fee any prefenc Signs of Convalescence ?

I do not fee any present Signs of Convalescence though I think His Majesty’s being quieter, and in a better State of general Health, would lead me to hope that it is a Step towards it.

And allb where there ben grete and grevous riotes doon in the Weste Countrey, betwene Th'erle of Devonshire, and the Lord Bonevile,' by the whiche fom Men have bemurdred, some robbed, and Children and Wymen taken: It is thought that if suche Protestour and Defenfour were had, that suche riotes and injuries (huld be lbuner punyslhed, Justice largely miaiftred, and the lawe more duely to procede: Wherfore ic myght lyke the said Lieutenaunte and all the Lordes, to be goode meanes unto the Kynges High-iiefle, that fuclie a persone myght be purveide fore and had. And theruppon it was answered by the Arche-bislhop of Caunterbury, Chaunceler of England, that the said Lieutenaunt and all the LordeS, wolde comon and delibre uppon theire desire, and they (huld have suche aunswere as (huld be plcafyng to God, and profitte to the land.

32. ITEM, the Saturday, the xv day of the said De eodem. moneth of Novembr’, the said Burley, accompanied in grete nombre of the Communes, in name of all theire (elawes, come before the said Lyeutenaunc and all the Lordes in this present Parlement, openyng before theym* that howe uppon Thursday last past, it was desired by theym that were comen for the Communes of this lande, that for afmoche as it liked the Kynges Highnesse for certeyn causes meovyng hym, and that he myght not personelly entende to procede in matiers of Parliament, to assigne the Due of York to be his Lieutenaunt in this his high Court of Parliament, to procede in suche matiers, as in the Kynges Letters Patentes theruppon made, radde and declared before the said Communes of this lande, is plainly conteyned.

That it myght like their good Lordlhippes, to be good meanes to the Kynges Highnesse, that if he for suche causes myght not personelly heraftre entende to the defense of this lande, to ordeyn and provide an liable persone to be Protedlour and Defenfour of this lande.

It is yit thought to theym that be come to this high Court of Parlement for the Coes of this lande, that where there be mony grete and grevous riottes done in the West Contrey, where fom Men ben robbed and fom flayn, and mony grevously hurte and injuried, if the Kyng (huld be vexed and troubled with suche matiers* and that his people (huld have recours to his Highnesse to complayne, and sue to hym for their grevaunces, matiers and fuetes, it (huld be overe grevous and tedious to his Highnesse, and that there fiiuft be a persone to whom the people of this lande may have recours to sue to for remedy of their injuries* for these causes, they that be comen for the Communes of this lande to this high Court of Parliament, required the said Lieutenaunt and all the Lordes, that it myght like theire good Lordlhippes to be good meanes to the Kynges Highnesse, that suche persone myght be ordeyned and purveide, that (huld mowe entende to the protection and defence of this lande, and that they myght have knowelege of hym, his power and auCtorite, the whiche (huld be to theym right grete comfort and consolation. Wher-uppoh it was aunswered by th’assent of the said Lieutenaunt and Lordes, by the mouthe of the (eid Chaunceler, that the said I ieutenaunt and all the Lordes woold comon uppon their desire, trustyng to God they (huld have therof good and comfortable aunswere.

33. ITEM, this same day, astre the voidyng of the Eleflio pr0-said Burley and of theym accompanied with hym out teaoru* of the Parliament Chambre, this question was axed by the said Chaunceler of the Lordes* feyng, my Lordes, for afmoche as the Communes have made twies theire desire and request, and that it is underftoud that they woll not ferther procede in matiers of Parliament, to the tyme that they have answere of theire desire and request, what is thought to your wyfdomes that (huld be done in this behalfe ? To the whiche question it was aunswered by all the Lordes: That for the causes above meoved by the said Communes, it were right expedient and behovefull, that suche a Protestor and Defenfor (huld be had as the Communes desired. And than the said Chaunceler feide to all the Lordes: sith it is expedient and behovefull that suche Protestor and Defenfor (huld be had, asked who that persone (huld be, and that it (huld lyke theym to name hym. And there it was aggreed by all the Lordes Spirituelx and Tempo-relx, every Lord severally yevyng his voice and assent, considered the grete noblenefle, ladnefie and wyfoome 6 of

of the Due of York, the fad governaunce and polletique rule had in this lande, the tyme that he was l&ft Pro-tedlour and Defenfour of the land, that he shuld nowe take the charge uppon hym ayen, astre semblable pre-fidences as he had it before: to the whiche the said Due of York aunswered, praiyng and defiryng all the Lordes, that for afmoche as he knewc well that he was no persone liable neithir in wisdome ne in governaunce to take so grete and chargefull occupation uppon hym, to name and take anothir persone more able to so grete charge than he was, and be fully therof to be discharged: The whiche desire the Lordes in no wyfe wold admitte. And than the said Due of York feyde, that if so were that he shuld nedes take that occupation uppon hym, but onely for the grete trust that he had in the Lordes, that he wuld have of theym in that be-halfe supportation, good affistence, counfeill and aide, and also certeyn protestations, and that he myght ther-uppon be advised.

Requeflartno- 34- ITEM, the Monday, the xvii day of the said t«'p* Commoneth of Novembre, it was shewed to the said Lieu-«a"re ha^ ° tenaunt and all the Lordes, by the mouth of Burley, bcn4', accompanied in notable nombre of the Communes, in

the name of all their felawes, that howe the said Communes had dyvers tymes made requestes to theire good Lord ships, that they shuld be good meanes to the Kynges Highnesse, that there myght be chofyn and made a Protedour and Defenfour of this land, of the whiche requestes as yit they have none aunswere.

THE Proceedings in the Two Cafes of the Restoration and the Resolution, appear to your Committee to fall within the Order of the House appointing your Committee, and to contain many Matters highly desirous of the Attention of the House in the Consideration of this Subject. But as these Proceedings are printed at length in the Journals of Parliament, your Committee have judged it unnecessary to make any other than a general Reference to them.

Your Committee having proceeded so far, thought fit to advert to such Proceedings of the Parliament of Scotland as appeared to relate to the First Head of the Matter referred to your Committee. In the printed Edition of the Scotch Statutes, they found the following Acts j viz.

1 Ja* VI. C. 34. With the Commission by Queen Mary annexed.

3 Ja* VI. C. 44. Also,

Table of unprinted Acts annexed t<5 the Acts of that Parliament.

Alfb, '

Acts and Orders of the Meeting of the Estates in 1689 prefixed to the Acts of W" and Mary.

Acts of the First Parliament of W* and Mary, C. i and 2.

Your Committee then proceeded to search for such Acts of Parliament as have been passed previously to provide for the Admin istration of Government, with a View to the Cafes of Minority and found the following Acts; viz.

25 H. VIII. C. 22. Sec. 11.

28 H. VIII. C. 7.

' I & a Phil. & Mary, C. 10.

1 & 2 Wm & Mary, Self. 2.

6 Anne, C. 7.

24 G. II. C. 24.

5 G. III. C. 27.

All the above Acts are in the Statute Books, except that of 28 H. VIII. C. 7. which is nearly similar to that of the 25th of the same Reign; and, except the Act of the ill and 2d of W“ and Mary, which not being printed in the Statute Books, your Committee have inserted a Copy thereofviz.

Vol. XLIV.

Anno Secund'oGuliehn & Mari*.

An Act for the Exercise of the Government bjMHer Majesty during His Majesties Absence.

WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament made Iri the First Year of Their Majesties Reign, intituled, “ An “ Adk declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and settling the Succession of the Crown/’ it is amongst other Things Enacted, Established, and Declared, That the Crown and Regal Government of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, shall be and continue to Their said Majesties, and the Survivor of them, during Their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of them; and that the entire, perfect, and full Exercise of the Regal Power and Government be only in and executed by His Majesty, in the Names of both Their Majesties, during Their joint Lives:

And whereas the King’s Mod excellent Majesty hath resolved to make a Royal Voyage, and go in Person into Ireland, for the speedy and effectual reducing of that Kingdom to its due Obedience to Their Majesties, and hath likewise declared His Pleasure to leave the Administration of the Governmentrin the’ Hands of the Queen’s Most excellent Majesty during His Absence out of this Kingdom:

Be it Enabled by the King and Queen’s Most excellent Majesties, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That whensoever, and as often as it shall happen that His said Majesty shall be absent out of this Realm of England, it shall and may be lawful for the Queen’s Majesty to exercise and administer the Regal Power and Government of the Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the Plantations and Territories thereunto belonging, in the Names of both Their Majesties, for such Time only, during Their joint Lives, as His said Majesty shall be absent, or continue out of this Realm of England, any Thing in the said Act to the contrary notwithstanding.

Provided always, That nothing in this Act shall be taken or construed to exclude or debar His Majesty, during such his Absence out of this Realm, from the Exercise or Administration of any Act or Acts of Regal Power or Government within this Realm, the Kingdom of Ireland, or any other Their Majesties Dominions whatsoever j but that all and every such Act and Acts shall be as good and effectual as if His Majesty was within this Realm, and shall not be contradidled or controlled but by His Majesty only* and that neither the passing of this Act, nor His Majesties Royal Voyage or Absence out of this Realm, shall be any Way taken or construed to dissolve this present Parliament, or avoid or determine any Commission or Commissions which have been or shall be granted by His or Their Majesties; nor to avoid any other Act or Acts of Government executed or to be executed by His Majesty.

Provided always, That as often as His Majesty shall return Into this Kingdom of England, the foie Administration of the Regal Power and Government thereof and all the Dominions, Territories, and Plantations thereunto belonging or annexed, shall be in His Majesty only, as if this Act had never been made.

THE Committee then called for such Precedents as Could be found of the Appointment of Custodes Regni, and Locum Tenentes, and of Commissions to Lords Justices in Cafes of the King’s Absence.

Your Committee received from Thomas Aftle, EC* quire, Keeper of the Records in the Tower, a Book which he’understood to have been copied from the original public Records, by Order of Lord Chancellor

JL Macclesfield,

Your Committee have, pursuant to the Order of the House, proceeded to examine the said Physicians.

They also proceeded to some Length in examining, with respect to the Situation in which Dr. John Willis has attended His Majesty j and from such Examination are of Opinion, that he comes within the Order of Reference to this Committee: But as his Examination might have greatly protracted their Proceedings, and as they have Reason to suppose Dr. , Senior, fully informed of every Particular necessary to the Object of . their Enquiry, which could be stated by Dr. John , they have forborn to examine the latter, conceiving, that it is of the utmost Importance, that their Report Should not be any longer deferred.

The Examination of the Physicians is as follows, and that Part of it which relates to Dr. John , is added at the End of this Report.

Sir Lucas Pepys called in, and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health does, or does not, continue to be such as to render His Majesty incapable either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

It certainly continues such as to render him incapable either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business.

What Hopes does Sir Lucas Pepys now entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

The Hopes I now entertain are founded exactly upon the same Ground upon which they were when I formerly gave my Opinion.

Can Sir Lucas Pepys now form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time that His Majesty’s IUness is likely to last ?

9 I can

I can neither form Judgment or probable Conjecture of the Time that His Majesty’s Disease is likely to last.

Whether> in His Majesty’s Disorder, Sir Ljucos Pepys fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

On the 27th of December, in the Evening, I saw His Majesty in such a Calm, and approaching towards a rational State, I was in Hopes, had it continued, Signs of Convalescence would soon have appeared: Those good Symptoms appeared only for an Hour; since which I have l'een no Signs of approaching Convalescence.

Are there any attual Symptoms at present, which lead Sir Lucas Pepys to entertain more or less favourable Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery, than he has hitherto had during his Attendance ?

I think His Majesty is more easily controuled, and therefore I Should hope that he was advancing towards Recovery, though no actual Symptoms appear.

Whether it is not usual for Persons in the Situation of His Majesty to become more easily controuled, when they are put under the Care of Persons used to attend Patients in that Disorder?

Certainly — but He is more easily controuled now than He was a Fortnight ago, when under the same Care.

Whether this does not happen often, independant of any Advancement towards Recovery ?

As Controul is the principal Means used for Recovery, 1 consider Patients submitting to it more readily as a Mark of some Sort of Ground being got.

Does Sir Lucas Pepys consider the Circumstance of His Majesty being more easily controuled, as being in itself such a clear Symptom of the Abatement of the Disorder, as induces Sir Lucas Pepys from that Cause to entertain stronger Hopes of His Majesty’s speedy Recovery, than when Sir Lucas Pepys was last examined ?

Not stronger Hopes of His Majesty’s speedy Recovery, but Hopes of His more speedy Recovery.

Whether, in Sir Lucas Pepys's Judgment, Management or Medicine is the more operative Cause of Recovery in Cafes of this Sort ?

1 think without both Patients are not so likely to recover, as under either; neither would have Effect singly.

Does Sir Lucas Pepys think, that the Persons who usually have the Controul and Management of Persons in His Majesty’s Situation, are better, or worse. Judges of the true Inference arising from the Fast of quiet Submission to such Controul, than Physicians who have not made this Disorder their particular Study ?

I think they are better Judges.

What is the Degree of Attendance of the Physicians who are not constantly with His Majesty ?

Either myself, Dr. Gi/borne, or Dr. , are at

Ke:v, in Rotation, from Four o’Clock every Day, till Eleven the next Morning; at Ten o’Clock every Morning, either Sir George Baker or Dr. comes to

Kew, visits His Majesty, and consult with the Physician who has remained there all Night, and Dr. Willis, and usually remains there about an Hour.

Whether there are any other Medical Persons that

attend His Majesty ?

Two Surgeons and Two Apothecaries.

Whether Accounts are not received from them respecting His Majesty’s Situation ?

No regular Account is given by them, but they are frequently alkcd.

Whether those Surgeons and Apothecaries, or any of them, -arc Persons who have made this Disorder their particular Study, or who have usually had the Controul

and Management of Persons in His Majesty’s Situation ?

I cannot say whether they have made this particular Disorder their particular Study. — -I conclude they occasionally fee Patients in this Disorder, though they may not have the Controul and Management of them.

Whether you think them capable of relating Fadts with Accuracy and Integrity ?

I would trust the Judgment and Integrity of any of them.

Whether those Surgeons and Apothecaries have the same Opportunities of observing the particular Situation of His Majesty as Dr. Willis has ?

Not the same Opportunity as Dr. Willis has, but the same Opportunity as any other of the Three Physicians have who attend in Rotation.

Whether Dr. Willis is present with the King often, or for any considerable Length of Time, when some one of those Surgeons and Apothecaries is not present ?

Very frequently, and for a considerable Length of Time, when none of them are present.

Are not some of them present at Tithes in which Dr. Willis is not present ?

Sometimes, but not often.

When Dr. Willis takes Rest, who is it that attends, the King ? ,

A Page, and one of Dr. Willis's Men.

Do no Physician or Apothecary ever come in at such Times ?

There is a positive Order that Nobody shall go into

His Majesty’s Room without Dr. Willis's Leave.

Who gave that Order ?

I don’t know — it is written up in the Outer Room.

Did you never ask who gave that Order ?

I never asked.

What do you mean by the easier Subjection to Controul ?

I mean a slighter-Degree of Intimidation.

Is the easier Submifilon to Controul, in your Opinion, produced by actual Abatements of the Disorder, or do you only consider it as facilitating the Management which may produce a Cure ?

I conceive it as an actual Abatement of the Disorder as far as that goes.

Whether Persons who have been for any Length of Time under a Degree of actual Controul, do not, from that Circumstance, more easily substiit to Controul, independant of any Abatement of the Disorder ?

I think not, as I have seen Patients under the strong-eft Degree of Coercion for Months together, who have not been, at the End of that Period, more under Controul than they were at first.

Whether you have not known Patients who, after having been under Coercion for some Time, have become more manageable without any Symptoms of Recovery appearing ?

Certainly without any Symptoms of Recovery, but not without Symptoms of an Abatement of the Disorder.

Whether or no you have not known such Symptoms of Abatement in Consequence of Controul to have existed, without any Recovery having followed ?

Certainly.

Whether after His Majesty has been submifllve to Controul, as by you stated. He has not afterwards grown less manageable ?

Certainly — but not less manageable than He was before Coercion was used.

When

2pG£0. III. 136 j

When was it last found necessary to life Coercion ?

The Middle of last Week, as far as I can speak from my own Observation — I understand it has been used firice.

Whether, before Dr. Willis came about the King, the same Modes of Coercion were used ?

No.

Whether there is not a greater Probability of Recovery where Symptoms of Abatement of the Disorder have appeared, than where the Disorder has remained for the same Time without such Symptoms of Abatement ?

The Probability of Recovery is always in Proportion to the Frequency and Degree of Abatement of the Disorder, except in Cafes of sudden Recovery.

Does the Majority of Persons in His Majesty’s Situation, with its present Symptoms and Appearances, recover ?

It is my Opinion that they certainly do.

Whether you consider the Chance of Recovery in a Person who has passed Ten Weeks without Symptoms of Convalescence, to be equal to that of a Person who has paHed only Six Weeks without any such Symptoms ?

I think the Difference between Six Weeks and Ten Weeks-perfectly immaterial in Cafes of this Sort, the Period is so short. '

Do you mean the Majority of Persons in general have recovered, or do you mean the Majority of those who are about the same Age as His Majesty ?

I cannot speak from any Observation of my own, nor do I know that any such Observations have been made by others, whether the Majority of Persons afflicted with that Disorder at that Time of Life do or do not recover.

Do you consider His Majesty’s present Chance of Recovery (all the Circumstances of His Majesty’s same that have fallen within your Observation being attended to) as being greater, or less, than it was when you was last examined here, or as being equally good ?

From the Circumstances which I saw on the 27th of December, I chink I can speak with more Certainty, when I say that I conclude His Majesty will recover, than I did when I was last examined.

Was Dr. Willis present on the 27th of , at

the Time you observed the Circumstances you alluded to ?

Only for a very few Minutes, and those at the End of the Time j but his Son was there the whole Time.

Since Dr. Willis has attended His Majesty, whether either Dr. Willis or his Son has always been present, when you attended, during the whole Time?

I have sometimes been with His Majesty alone, more commonly in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son.

Have you observed any Difference in His Majesty when you have seen Him alone, and when in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son ?

Sometimes His Majesty is more irritable when either Dr. Willis or his Son is present, and at other Times the contrary.

Whether on the 27 th of December His Majesty shew-ed any Consciousness of the Situation He then was, or had been in ?

There was no Consciousness shewn at that Time of His then present Situation; but He spoke of His having been delirious at Windsor, and was surprized on my telling Him, that His Delirium had continued above Three Weeks.

Whether there has been any direct or indirect Attempt made by any of the Physicians, at any Time, to Vol. XLIV.

fantlarii 49

controul or influence you with respect to die Account to be given of His Majesty’s Situation ?

Certainly not.

Have not Symptoms of Irritation in His Majesty’s same been frequent since you was last examined here ?

Very frequent.

Whether the Means of Coercion have not been more 1 frequently resorted to since that Period than before ?

More frequently.

Whether you have consulted any eminent Person conversant in those Cafes, and not attending on His Majesty, respecting His Majesty’s Disorder ?

I have spoken with Dr. Mwho has seen more Patients than any Practitioner ever did fee, Upon the Point only of the Probability of His Majesty’s Recovery, but not with regard to Medicine or Treatment.

Whether Sir Lucas Pepys has not founded his Opinion as well upon the Reports of the Two Surgeons, and Two Apothecaries, and other Persons in Attendance upon His Majesty, as upon his own Observations ?

I ground my Opinion upon my own Observation only.

How long before your last Examination were the Means of Coercion at all resorted to ?

I believe only Once, if at all; I am not sure.

Do you then conceive the Irritation to have been greater since that Examination than it was before ?

I do not consider that the Irritation was greater; but the Means of Coercion were not in our Hands till about the Time* of Examination.

Had the Irritation, previous to the Time of the Examination, in any Manner subsided ?

Not so much as it has since.

Whether, notwithstanding the Symptoms of Irritation in His Majesty’s same has been frequent since Sir Lucas Pepys was examined here, and notwithstanding the Means of Coercion have been more frequently resorted to since that Time than before, Sir Lucas Pepys can speak with more Certainty when he fays that he concludes His Majesty will recover, than he did >when he was last examined here ?

Yes, I think I can.

Can you speak with greater Certainty with respect to the Time of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

I can say nothing about Time.

Withdrew.

The Reverend Doctor Francis Willis called in, and examined.

Whether, in your Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health does, or does not, continue to be such as to render His Majesty incapable either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

Certainly not capable.

What Hopes does Dr. Willis now entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

Such Hopes, that if a Patient under the same Indif-position was in my House, I should not have the least Doubt of his Recovery.

Can Dr. Willis now form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time that His Majesty’s lllnels is likely to last ?

Not any; — I could not fix upon any; — I would not hazard an Opinion of that Kind.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Dr. Willis fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

About a Fortnight ago His Majesty would take up Books, and could not read a Line of them j He now will read several Pages together, and make, in my Opi-

O nion.

nion, very good Remarks upon the Subject: I think, in the main, His Majesty does every Thing in a more rational Way than He did, and some Things extremely rational.

How often has Dr. Willis found it necessary to use Coercion to His Majesty, since he was last examined here ?

I cannot say, but very often: Before that Time, the Occasions were continual, but in a different Mode.

What Period of Time do you mean, when you say before that Time ?

I believe I was Five Days before I used any particular coercive Mode, but endeavoured to persuade and explain what Method must be made use of, if there was not a ready Compliance.

- When did you first begin the Mode of Coercion ?

I really don’t know the particular Day.

Whether Dr. Willis keeps any Diary of his Proceedings?

Not before the 7th or 8th Day I was there, as I believe. '

To what Period did you refer when you said, before your last Examination there had been continual Occa-lions for Coercion, though in a different Mode ?

I believe it was so when I came, and for some Time after; and I understood from the Pages, it had been lb a considerable Time before.

Whether the King was in this State of Irritation, requiring Coercion, at or about the Time you was examined here before ?

He was at Times, not always.

Do you understand from Information that, previous to that Time, the Occasions for Coercion were without any Intermission ?

In all Probability there must have been Intermissions.

Whether the Instances of Coercion, in whatever Mode, were more frequent from the Time of his Arrival to the Time of his last Examination, than they have been since ?

Certainly more frequent.

Whether, during the Period in which you endeavoured to persuade and explain what particular Mode of Coercion must be made use of, and to the Day of your Examination, other Modes of Coercion were made use of, and more frequently, than after you had adopted the particular Mode ?

Certainly.

Whether, at the Time of your Examination before the former Committee of the House of Commons, the particular Mode of Coercion now alluded to by you had been resorted to ?

I really don’t know.

Whether, if the Irritation had in a great Measure fub-sided in consequence of the ordinary Modes of Constraint used upon His Majesty, you would have thought it necessary to have resorted to the particular Mode ?

If I had been confident of succeeding as well without, certainly I Should not have recurred to that Mode, for many Reasons.

Question repeated.

No, certainly not.

Whether Means of stronger Coercion have not been used since your last Examination than before ?

Certainly, a more firm Coercion, but not so teizing to the Patient, and therefore used.

Whether you can now inform the Committee, or can by Tomorrow enable yourfelfto inform them, when, and how often. Coercion has been used since your last Examination ?

I believe I could not; I will endeavour to do it, but I have no Idea that I can.

When did you last use Means of Coercion to your Patient ?

Either Saturday or Sunday, I don’t recoiled! which.

Whether there has been any direct, or indirect, Attempt made by any of the Physicians, at any Time, to controul or influence you with respect to the Account to be given of His Majesty’s Situation ?

I have once or twice refused to sign the Certificate, thinking His Majesty was better than the Certificate implied.

Do you mean that you did not sign ?

I persisted in the Refusal till it was altered, and then I did sign it; but latterly I have scarcely read it over, and did not mind whether it was exactly agreeable to my Opinion or nor, rather than have any Words.

Did you, in the Instances to which you refer, differ in Opinion from all the other Physicians attending ?

The Two Physicians present, I differed from; there are but Two attending in the Morning to sign it, except my Son.

Do you mean that this was such a Difference of Opinion that frequently happens among Medical Men upon the State of the Patient ?

Very frequently } but more likely in this Cafe, where the other Two Physicians have scarce seen a Patient in this Way for an Hour together; and I have attended various Patients in the same House, and known the Effect of Method and Medicine every Hpur.

What Means did you use to persuade the Physicians to alter the Account, and adopt your Opinion ?

That if I had a Patient at Home that had parted so many Hours in such a State, I Should conclude that Patient was better.

Did Dr. Willis use any other Means than Arguments of that Kind; did he hold out any Idea of pleasing, or displeasing, considerable Persons ?

No, none at all.

Are you sure, that on Friday last, the 2d of,

you did not use such Arguments ?

I will not be sure that I might not say the Alteration that was sent down by a certain Personage was not worth while disputing, and at the same Time that £ thought it nearer the Truth; for Dr. Warren did hold out, that he Should think no Person better, tiil they were perfectly well, under such an Indisposition. I asked the Doctor, if a Person, so indisposed, Should not say one sensible Word in 24 Hours, and the next 24 Hours say but one Word, that he would not say, if he was not indisposed, whether he would not think him better; and he told me — No. '

When you answered the last Question but one, had you in your Memory the Circumstance you have mentioned ?

I had not; I do not know that I certainly did say it; but I thought it, and very likely might say it.

Whether those Alterations, sent down by a certain Personage, were, or were not, suggested by you ?

They certainly were not; they were brought down by Two Ladies. — The Paper, as sent up, was concerted among the Physicians then present; was carried up, I believe, by General Gordon, and was returned by the Two

Ladies, I believe.

Do you recoiled whether the Alterations were made on the same Paper on which the Account was drawn up by the Doctors, or on different Paper sent down ?

As well as I remember, it was not altered at all — but proposed by the Ladies to be altered. — I believe the Alterations were not adopted — I am not sure, but I think not. — I believe the Account went to St. James's

in

13° Januarii.

5i

in the same Form. — I really do not charge my Memory with it; it was not worth while for me to remember.

Whether the Conversation you (late to have passed between you and Dr. Warren,passed when you were alone, or before Witnesses ?

Before those Ladies and the Physician, and One of the Surgeons, I don’t remember which, and my own Son.

Whether Dr. Willis does not conceive the Account sent to St. James’s to purport to contain the true and

exact Opinion of the Physicians who sign it, upon the State of His Majesty’s Health ?

Yes j as well as Three can agree in Opinion.

Do you mean to say, that you signed your Name to any Statement of the King’s Situation to which you do not agree ?

If it was not so favourable as I thought, I signed it, rather than have any Dispute.

Then, in Point of Fad, have you signed Accounts of the King’s Health, which in your own Mind and Confidence you did not believe to be correct ?

I believe no Three Physicians ever writ a Prescrip-tien for a Patient that was exactly conformable to each of their Wilhes.

Whether you consider the Account sent to St. James's as a Prescription, or as a Statement of Fads ?

As a Statement of Fads, as near as we could agree.

Do you mean to say, that it is usual for Physicians to sign their Names to Statements of Fads, which they are not sure are true and correct, for the Sake of Agreement ?

I have been told, by the Physicians here, that the Opinion of One should give way to the other Two; and that they were surprized I should hesitate about it.

Do you mean by the Physicians now attending His Majesty ? '

Yes.

Who are the other Medical Persons that are usually in constant Attendance on His Majesty ?

No Medical Person fits up with His Majesty — one of the Pages, and one of my Servants, are in the Room with him; and in the Anti-Room, one of each, who change every Two Hours, if they find it convenient.

What is His Majesty’s State this Day ?

I have not seen him since the Morning; he had a very good Night, and was Yesterday better than ever I saw him, and was calm this Morning.

Do you mean that there was a greater Appearance of rational Interval Yesterday, than at any other Time?

Yes.

Was there less Irritation Yesterday than before ?

A great deal less — he read and attended to reading for an Hour together.

Do you now consider the Irritation to have in a great Measure subsided ?

He is still extremely irritable.

Whether you wrote to the Prince of Wales, Yesterday, any Account of the King’s State ?

I believe I did on Monday.

Whether you do not consider the subsiding of the Irritation, as a necessary Prelude to Symptoms of Con-valefcence ?

I do. — His Majesty is not now so irritable as He was, nor does the Consequence of the Irritability continue a Tenth Part so long — not nearly so irritable as at the Time of my last Examination.

Withdrew.

Doctor Richard Warren called in, and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health does, or does not, continue to be such as to render His Majesty incapable either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

Incapable.

Name the Physicians from whom you received that Information ?

Sir Lucas Pepys and Dr. Warren.

Are the Committee to understand that the Public have been, in any Measure, deceived by those Accounts sent to St. James's, as far -as the Authority of Dr. Willis's

Name was concerned ?

I have done my utmost to prevent their being deceived.

What do you mean by having done your utmost ?

I argued with the Physicians as much as I could for other Words to be put in, but in vain.

Do you recoiled: whether the Alteration, which you stated to Dr. Warren not to be worth disputing, was a material one ?

If I had thought it worth disputing, I should have thought it a material one.

Do you remember what the Alteration was ?

I cannot answer that, but it may be known.

Whether you have, at any Time, made any Complaint or Protest to any Person in Authority about the King, or to any of His Majesty’s Ministers, upon the Subject of the Accounts sent to St. , or given

them Information that such Accounts were not to be depended upon as correct, as far as your Name was concerned ?

I don’t remember any Thing at all about it.

How many Hoqrs in a Day is it usual for you to be iO personal Attendance on His Majesty ?

I can’t tell — Four or Six Hours, perhaps, according

His Majesty is employed.

3

What Hopes does Dr. Warren now entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

My Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery Hand upon the same Foundation as they did when I was examined before, excepting that a little more Time has passed, which does not add to my Hopes, but is so little that it hardly ought to fubtrad from them.

Can Dr. Warren now form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time that His Majesty's Illness is likely to last ?

No.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Dr. Warren fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

No.

Whether there has been any Cefiation of the King’s Disorder at any Time since its Commencement ?

No, as far as I can judge. I vific His Majesty every other Morning, converse with Him as long as I think it necessary, and form a Judgment of the then State of His Majesty from the Knowledge which I obtain from conversing with Him: — The rest of my Knowledge of His Majesty’s State is obtairled from the Information given by the Physician who has attended from Four o’Clock in the Afternoon till the Time I get to Kew, and from Doctor Willis and his Son, and from the Information of Mr. Charles , Mr. , Mr.

Dundas, and Mr. Battifcombe, one or othfr of whom are constantly in the House in Attendance. From the Knowledge thus acquired, and Information thus obtained, I conclude that there has been no Cefiation of His Majesty’s Complaint.

Whether Dr. Warren thinks that the Information he

gathers

gathers from those Gentlemen is material to the forming of his Judgment ?

These Gentlemen have attended His Majesty from the Beginning of His IUness till this Minute, were about Him before He was ill, and are perfectly well acquainted with His Majesty, and are very intelligent Persons: — From these Circumstances I conclude that they are very competent Judges how far His Majesty’s present State deviates from His former.

Do you consider them as competent Judges of the Progress of His Recovery ?

Yes.

Whether or not Dr. Warren has understood from Dr.

Willis, or others, that His Majesty has been in a rational State ?

No.

Does Dr. Warren know, whether the Majority of those who, at His Majesty’s Time of Life, have been afflicted with the Disorder His Majesty labours under, have recovered ?

I have been making an Enquiry lately, in order to satisfy my own Curiosity respecting this Question; and I believe it will be still Two Days before I can give a satisfactory Answer.

Where are you making that Enquiry ?

By examining the Books of Bethlehem

What CircUmftaricefi, in your Judgment, would constitute a Cessation of His Majesty’s Complaint, as con-tra-distinguished from a Cure ?

My Rule of judging whether a Person in this Situation is recovering, is as follows: — If the Patient recovers his Reason, or becomes himself again, only for an Hour, I pronounce that the Complaint has ceased, and that he is mending; if the next Day, or any ftiort Time afterwards, the Interval becomes Two Hours, I pronounce him better; if the Interval becomes longer and longer, I pronounce him advancing in his Cure.

What Circumstances, in Dr. Judgment, form

a Cure ?

The Patient remaining perfectly himself, without any Return of his former Complaint.

If the Patient appeared to be perfectly himself for a smaller Term than an Hour, would Dr con-

fider him in a State of Amendment ?

Certainly I Should, if the State of the Patient during that Time could be accurately ascertained.

Whether those Circumstances, which in your Judgment would form a Cessation of His Majesty’s Complaint, ought to be considered, in your Judgment, as Signs of Convalescence ?

Certainly.

Whether the Gentlemen you have named, namely, the Physicians, Apothecaries, and Surgeons, are Persons who, in your Judgment, have made this Branch of Physick their particular Study ?

I do not know that they have.

Withdrew.

v

Doctor Warren called in again, and desires to add' to his Answer to the last Question but Two, these Words — “ But if the Interval does not “ increase, no Stress mull be laid upon it at all."

If a Patient in His Majesty’s Disorder did not soon recover under Dr. Warren'sCare (Dr. Warren receiving his Information, as to the Facts of his Patient’s Cafe, from Gentlemen whom he did not know to have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study) would not Dr. Warren think it his Duty to

call in Persons whom he did know to have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study ?

No, not on that Account. Dr. , and all

other Physicians, are obliged to receive their Accounts of Fasta from Nurses, and other unfcientific Persons; and if they are People of common Sense, they are able to give a very good Account of Fasts; from the Fasts, as related by them, the Physician must form his Judgment, assisted by the Knowledge which he acquires by visiting and examining the Patient himself.

Whether, in point of Fast, where Persons in the Disorder under which His Majesty labours have not soon recovered under Dr. Warren's foie Care, he has not always, or generally, called in Persons who made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study i

Yes, if the Patients could afford it.

Whether, in Cafes where the Patients could afford it. Dr. Warren has not oftener left the Patients to the Care of Persons who have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study, than he has attended in Conjunction or Consultation with such Persons, if they have not soon recovered under his foie Care ?

Yes, oftener.

Whether, as Dr. Warren has answered the last Question affirmatively, he has not been determined so to act, by-a Conviction that, where the Circumstances of a Patient would admit of that Mode of Treatment, that such Mode of Treatment was the belt which his Conscientious Judgment could dictate ?

This Mode of Treatment has often arisen from Ne-cefllty, as it was requisite, for the Good of the Patient, that he Should be removed to a Distance from Town, where it was impossible for Dr. Warren to attend with Regularity, consistent with his usual Business: This Re-r moval was necessary for the Sake of Quiet, and other Conveniences, which the Patient could not have in Town; sometimes from the Necessity of Coercion, which Dr. Warren has no Means of applying; sometimes for the Sake of particular Nurses and Keepers, which Dr. Warren does not furnish; and from that Diffidence' which Dr. Warren ought always to have in himself when his Patients do not recover as soon as can reasonably be expected.

Has that Diffidence led Dr. Warren to place Patients, who have not soon recovered, under the Care of Persons who have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study >

Sometimes.

Does Dr. Warren mean to say, that Persons who have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study, and who follow that Branch of Medicine principally, are not better Judges of the Disorder, but have only better Conveniences for the Management of Persons labouring under it, than Physicians who practise Medicine generally, without particular Application to this Branch of it ?

Provided their Parts and intellectual Powers are equal to their Business, they will become more expect in the curing of this Complaint than other Physicians; otherwise they will deserve no Preference but for the Conveniences they provide for their Patients.

Whether the same would not be the same with Physicians who have not made that Branch of Medicine their particular Study, if their Parts and intellectual Powers are not equal to their Business ?

Certainly.

Whether, if Nine Persons out of Ten, placed under the Care of a Person who had made this Branch of Medicine his particular Study, had recovered, if they were placed under his Care within Three Months after they had begun to be afflicted with the Difordcf,.

6 Dr.

zp Geo. III. 1 x* Januar53

Dr. Warren would hot deem such Person either very (kilful or very successful ?

If he was a sensible Man I Should deem him (kilful, if he was not, I Should deem him successful.

Whether Dr. Warren has not understood from Sir Lucas Pepys, that since his former Examination, he thinks His Majesty more likely to recover, than he did at the Time of rhAt Examination ?

There was one Evening, less than a Fortnight since, that Sir Lucas Pepys said, he observed that His Majesty talked more like a reasonable Man; but this Appearance was so totally gone a few Hours afterwards, that I had no Doubt of its being a Misapprehension in Sir Lucas, arising from his Zeal.

Has Dr. Warren any Reason to believe, that Sir Lucas Pepys is still under what Dr. Warren calls a Misapprehension in this Respect ?

I do not know what Sir Lucas now thinks of his Opinion of that Night j but his Opinion Yesterday, when we were together at Kew, was, that His Majesty was no better.

Has Dr. Warren communicated to Sir Lucas Pepys his Reasons for thinking the Opinion of Sir Lucas Pepys a Misapprehension ?

I do not know whether I gave him Any formal Reaions on the Subject, but I know that I expressed my Doubts about it.

Whether Dr. Warren has not understood from Dr. Willis, that he was more confirmed lately, in his Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery, than he was at the Time of his former Examination before the Committee ?

Dr. Willis spoke very sanguinely of a speedy Cure, soon after the Time of his former Examination; he has held the same Language ever since, but spoke in stronger Terms of Amendment being actually obtained last Week, than at any-other Time.

Has Dr. Warren ever heard from Mf. Hawkins, Mr. Keate, Mr ,_Dundas, and Mr. that His Majesty is in a State of actual Amendment as to IntelleC!; and that the Probability of His Recovery is greater now than at the Time Dr. Warren was last examined ?

No.

Has Dr. Warren understood, on the contrary, from any or all of these Gentlemen, that His Majesty is not in an actual State of Amendment as to Intellect; and that the Probability of His Recovery is not greater now than at the Time Dr. Warren was last examined ?

.From some of them I have heard that His Majesty is not in a State of Amendment; but 1 have not talked to them upon the Probability of Cure, my Discourse with them being chiefly confined to Fads.

Has Dr. Warren ever heard from any of these Gentlemen, that there has at any Time been any Return of Reason in His Majesty since the Commencement of His Disorder ?

No.

Has Dr. Warren known any Instance of any Physician, or other Person attending on His Majesty, fending any written Account of His Majesty’s Situation, dating His Majesty to have been in a cairn and mended State, at a Time when he (Dr. Wa) had Reason to know that His Majesty’s Situation and State were the Reverse ?

Dr. Willis has written Letters to the Prince of Wales, expressing His Majesty to be much better than I apprehended His Majesty to be at that Time, declaring Progress in Cure that I could not discover.

Has Dr. Warren had any Discourse, or Difference of Opinion, with Dr. Willis, respecting any other Letter, of the same Description, to any other Person ?

Vol. XLIV.

I was informed that Dr. Willis wrote such a Letter, at Twelve o’Clock at Night, the Day of the Debate in the House of Commons -, I spoke to Dr. Willis on the Subject of this Letter the next Morning, and told him that he did wrong to write such an Account, when it was not true: I afterwards enquired, and could not find that the Doctor had written such a Letter, and told him that I had done him an Injury in charging him with it, as I could not prove it.

Does Dr. Warren recoiled! to whom that Letter was supposed to be written ?

The Report was, that it was written to Mr. Pitt.

Does Dr. Warren recoiled! from whom he received that Information ?

There was a Report current throughout the Town that Mr. Pitt had read such a Letter at White's, at Five o’Clock in the Morning.

Does Dr. Warren recoiled! only the current Report, but not any particular Person from whom he heard it ?

Indeed I cannot recoiled! any particular Person.

Does Dr. Warren recoiled! what was dated to be the Substance of that supposed Letter ?

In general Terms, that His Majesty was greatly better, and was likely to be speedily well.

Does Dr. Warren recoiled! in what Terms he dated to Dr. Willis his Disapprobation of his writing such a Letter, or the Substance of them ?

That, as His Majesty was remarkably bad, and vinder Coercion that Nighc, he , could consider it only as a Political Letter, which he thought wrong from a Physician.

When did Dr. Warren tell Dr. ,that he had done him an Injury in charging him with having written such a Letter ?

Tp the bed of my Recollediion, it was the next Time of my going to Kew after I had charged him with writing it, which, if so, must have been the Second Day after the Charge.

Had Dr. Warren then had an Opportunity of seeing the original Letters written to Mr. on the Day of the Debate to which he alluded, and on the following Day ?

I had seen a Letter, written, as I 'thought, by Dr. Willis's Son, dated at Half an Hour after Five in the Afternoon of the Day of the Debate — I do not know whether I saw a Letter written the Day after or not. — I believe I might have done so if I pleased.

Whether the Letter which Dr. Warren did fee, did contain a just Description of His Majesty’s Situation, according to Dr. Warren's Opinion ?

When I came to Kew the Morning following, I was informed by Dr. Willis that His Majesty had had a violent Paroxysm that Night, which came on at Seven o’Clock the Evening preceding; but how His Majesty exactly was at Half an Hour after Five, I do not know.

Whether the Letter, dated at Half an Hour after Five, gave a favourable Account of His Majesty I

To the bed of my Recollection it contained a favourable Account.

Whether Dr. Warren had any Information given him of the Time when this Letter was received ?

I don't remember that I had.

Did Dr. Warren understand, from any of the other Attendants on His Majesty, that His Majesty had been, in any Part of that Day, in a particular amended State ?

No.

P Did

Did Dr. Willis make any Reply, when Dr. Warren told him he had done wrong to write such a Letter, when it was not true ?

Dr. Willis,by his Behaviour, appeared to me at that

Time to own it.

Why Dr. Warren thought it necessary to acknowledge afterwards to Dr. Willis that he had done him an Injury ?

Because Dr. Willis complained that I had charged him with a Fast that was not true. — I made all the Enquiry I could to find out the Truth, and discovered that a Letter had been written at Half an Hour after Five, but could not discovef that a Letter had been written at Twelve at Night, and consequently concluded that there had been an Error with respect to the Time; and therefore that I had done him wrong in charging him with writing it at Twelve, and took the first Opportunity of retrafting what 1 had said.

What Enquiry did Dr. Warren make, in order to find out the Truth ?

The Lord Chancellor informed me of Dr. Willis's Complaint, and said he would write to Mr. Pitt for all the Letters he had received from Dr. Willis on that Day; Mr. Pitt sent them, and the Chancellor shewed them to me.

Did Dr. Warren fee Mr. Pitt’s Answer to the Chancellor ?

Yes.

Does Dr. Warren underfLnd, upon Recollection* that the Circumstances which satisfied him that the Letter had not been written as supposed, were produced in Consequence of his Enquiry, or of an Enquiry made in his Name, or in Consequence of Dr. Willis’s Representation on his Uneasiness upon what had paSTed with Dr. Warren ?

I suppose the Letters were produced in Consequence of my W ilh to ascertain the Truth.

When Complaint was made to Dr. Warren, on the Part of Dr. // illis,did Dr. Warren make any Enquiry into the Truth of the Fast of those Persons from whom he received the Information that such Fast exited ?

The Chancellor said, the only Way to find the Truth, was to send to Mr. Pitt for the Letters. — I do not know of whom I received the Information.

Whether Dr. ICarren ever saw any Paper, purporting to be a Copy of this Letter supposed to be written at Twelve o’clock at Night; and if he did, by whom the same was Shewn to him ?

I don't recoiled that I ever saw a Paper, purporting ^0 be a Copy of it.

Can Dr. Warren take upon himself to say, that he never did fee any Paper, purporting to be a Copy of the Letter supposed to be written at Twelve o’Clock at Night ? 1

No; I do not recoiled that I did.

Did Dr. Warren ever hear any Person, whose Name he could mention, say that he had a Copy of a Letter supposed to be written by Dr. Willis to Mr. , at Twelve o’Clock that Night I

No.

j

Dr. Warren having said, that a Letter of Dr. Willis's to the Prince of Wales contained a more favourable Account than he thought His Majesty’s Situation jollified, does Dr. Warren mean to say, that such Letter contained a more favourable Account than Dr. Willis believed to be true ?

It is impossible for me to say what Dr. Willis believes.

Dr. Warren having said, that in a same where Nine out of Ten Patients placed under the Care of a Physician, who has applied himself to a particular Branch of Medicine, within Three Months from the Commencement of their Disorder, have been cured, he Should deem such Physician Skilful, if he was a sensible Man, and if not, should think him only successful; whether, if such Success had attended that Physician’s Practice for Twenty-eight Years, he Should aferibe it to good Fortune only ?

There is no other Way of judging but by Success; yet it does not follow, that that Judgment is right; it can never be supposed, that an ignorant Man has Knowledge, or that a Man who has no Rule to go by can aft' systematically, be his Success what it will.

Whether, in order to induce Dr. Warren to believe that, for Twenty-seven Years, Nine Persons out of Ten had been cured, he would not require some other Evidence than the Assertions of the Man pretending to have performed such Cures ?

I certainly Should.

Whether there has been any direct or indirect Attempt made by any of the Physicians, at any Time, to controul or influence you with respect to the Account to be given of His Majesty’s Situation I

Dr. Willis, on Friday last, made a very unwarrantable Use of the Name of a Great Person; I call it unwarrantable, because I cannot believe that he could have Authority to ule it to influence me, while the Report to be sent to St. James's was composing.

Will Dr. Warren relate the Circumstances of that Tranfaction ?

The Report proposed to be sent was written thus: — *% His Majesty paSTed Yesterday quietly, has had a very good Night, and is calm this Morning.” Dr. Willis desired that some ExpreSTion might be made use of, indicating that His Majesty was advanced Since the Day before in His ure; I objected to this, because I had ample Reason, from my Conversation with His Majesty, and from the Information which I had received from Mr. Charles Hawkins, to think the contrary true — Dr. Willis then said, “ a certain Great Person will not “ suffer it to go so, and it will fall upon you.”

Are you sure you are correct in those Words ?

I believe I am; I took the Words down as soon as I came Home — Dr. Reynolds was present when the Words were Spoken. — I made no Observation to Dr. Willis on those Words; but, after talking with him a little more on the Subject of His Majesty, composed, together with Dr. Reynolds, the following Report“ His Majesty paSTed YeSlerday much in the same Manner as “ He did the Day before; has had a very good Night; and is this Morning as He was Yesterday.” Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Willis, and Dr. Warren, Signed this Report; it was sent up Stairs, and was returned, with an Order to change the Words, as He was Yesterday,” into “ continues to mend.” — Dr. Warren delired the Honour of an Audience; and, upon Slating his Reasons why no Amendment had taken Place, the Words, “ continues to mend,” were given up; and the Sentence, “ is this Morning in a comfortable Way,” was substituted in their Place.

When Dr. Willis used these ExpreSTions, “ a certain *e Great Person will not suffer it to go so, and it will fall upon you;” whether Dr. Warren understood those Words to convey to him, that a Perseverance in his Opinion would draw upon him the Displeasure of the Great Person alluded to ?

I was clear that Dr. Willis meant I should think

so.

Whether the Fear of the Displeasure of that Great Person would, or would not, be a powerful Motive of

4 Action

Action with Dr. Warren, in any same where his Conference and Honour did not prevent him paying Attention to such a Motive ?

It most certainly would.

Were the Words Dr. W flared to have been given up, given up immediately after his dating his Objections ?

After I had dated my Objections, and supported them with several Arguments, the Words were given up; and upon my saying, “ That though His Majesty was “ not mended lincc Yesterday, yet that He was in a “ comfortable Way this Morning, which I hoped tended to a Cure,” the Word “comfortable” was immediately adopted.

Whether, upon Dr. Warren'dating, that he objected

to those Words, they were immediately given up? or, Whether there was any Inclination diewn to induce Dr. Warren to sign the altered Report, after he had dated that he objected to the Alteration ?

There was no Inclination shewn to give up the Words, till the Word “ comfortable” had been uled.

Qnedion repeated.

After my Arguments had been repeated, and seemed to be underdood, and I had added, that I had received Information from One of His Majesty’s Attendants, of the State of His Majesty’s Health that Morning, the Words were given up.

Whether there was any Period, after the Witness had declared that he objected to the Alteration, in which an Inclination was shewn to induce him to sign it ?

Till I was completely underfiood.

Does the Witness mean, by being completely understood, till it was underdood that he objected, or till the Arguments upon which he founded his Objections were completely underdood ?

Till the Arguments upon which I founded my Objections were completely underdood.

Is the Committee to underdand, then, that, during that Period in which it was underdood that Dr. objected, but the Arguments upon which he objcCted were not underdood, an Inclination was dill diewn to induce him to sign the altered Report ?

The Great Person seemed to be I'o drongly persuaded that there was a real Amendment that Morning, that it was necessary to produce several Arguments to convince that Person of the contrary; until that Conviction was obtained, there appeared an Expectation that I Should adopt the Words continues to mend.”

Is the Committee to underdand, that that Expectation continued to appear after Dr. Warren had dated, that he objected to the Alteration ?

In the Interval after dating that I objected, and before the Arguments had been dated, that Expectation appeared to concinue.

Whether Dr. Warren did, or did not, peremptorily refuse to sign the altered Report ?

No; — that Great Person adopted the Word “ comfortable,” and I immediately retired to put it into the Report.

Whether, subsequently to this Audience, any Thing paded relative to this Tranlaction ?

Yes; — Lady liar court, and Lady Charlotte,

followed me down Stairs, and inquired of me, who the Person was from whom I had my Information relative to His Majesty’s Health that Morning? I answered, from Mr. Charles Hawkins. When Mr. Charles Hawkins appeared, he was asked by the Two Ladies what he had laid to me that Morning respecting His Majesty’s Health ? He gave them an Account, and they retired. The next Time that I wont down to Ke I was treated with Marks of Attention and Respect that I had not received for ibme Time before.

What was the Line of Argument employed by Dr.

Warren, in order to convince the Great Person of whom he has spoken, that in the King’s Situation that Morning the re was no real Amendment ?

Fird of all I mentioned the Rule by which I judged of the Health of Perfor.s in His Majesty’s Situation, and which I have given in the former Part of this Examination. I then drew an Argument from the Conversation I had had with His Majesty, without mentioning the Particulars of it. I then observed His Majesty had often been in the same State without its remaining many Hours (which turned out to be the same on that Day.) I then brought another Argument from the Information I had received from Mr. Hawkins.

Withdrew.

Jovis,8® die 'Januarii 1789.

Sir Lucas Pefys again called in, and examined.

Did Sir Lucas Pepys ever endeavour to induce Dr. Willis to sign any Report sent to St. , re-

specling the King’s Health, which Report Dr. Willis affirmed to be contrary to the true State of the King’s Situation ?

The only Conversation which appeared at all like Altercation, respecYing the Account sent to St. f,

was, Whether the Words “ very good Night,” indead of “ good Night,” should be put in.

Did you ever tell Dr. Willis that it was usual for Physicians to sign their Names to Statements of Facts, which they are not sure are true and correct, for the Sake of Agreement ?

Certainly never; — but upon such Trifles as above mentioned, I dated that it was the usual Cudom, when Two one of Three were of the same Opinion, for the Third to acquiefoe.

Does Sir Lucas Pefys mean, that that Opinion of his was confined to such Trifles as related to the wording of nearly the same Opinion ?

At that Time it related merely to those Words; and though I underdand Differences of Opinion have arisen about wording the Account sent to St. yet

when I have been present none have arisen.

Did Sir Lucas Pcfys ever inform Dr. , that the Opinion or Medical Judgment, connected with any Statement of Fact of One Physician, Should give Way to the other Two, and that he was surprized that Dr. V/illis Should hefltate about it ?

Unless the Word “ very "above mentioned may be considered as connected with a Medical Ea&, I know of no other Conversation upon the Subject.

Did Sir Lucas Pefys on that Occasion employ any vehement Persuasion, so as to bring on Words or Altercation with Dr. Willis, so as to induce Dr. to sign

such Reports against his Judgment, in order to avoid such Altercation ?

I was writing during the whole Time; and so far from using vehement W'ords, 1 advised him, in the quieted Manner, to avoid all Altercation about Trifles; and, though Sir George Baker and 1 were Two Opinions against One, finding Dr. w'as anxious to

retain the Word “ very," Sir George Baker gave up the Point, and the Report went as Dr. Willis had aefired it.

Whether Sir l.ucas Pefys does not hold himself responsible in his Character to the Public, for the Truth of the Report sent to St. , to which he signs

his Name ?

Certainly not for the whole Truth; as we considered it as unnecessary to wound the Feelings of Her Majesty and the red of the Family, by saying more than was absolutely necessary.

Whether you do not hold yourself bound to let your

Name

Name to no Account which contains any Thing which ' you think not true ?

I certainly do.

Whether, if Sir Lucas Pepys happened to be of Opinion, upon any Morning, that the Words “ continues “ to mend,” would be an apt Description of His Majesty’s Cafe, and Dr. Warren and Sir George Baker should think the Words " His Majesty is in a comfortable Way” more proper, intimating at the same Time, that they hoped that that had a Tendency to a Cure, Sir Lucas Pepys would think he acted unwarrantably in giving up the Words “ continues to mend,” and agreeing to the Words used by the other Two Physicians, namely, “ His Majesty is in a comfortable Way,” those Words being so explained as to their Tendency ?

It is impossible that those Words, “ comfortable Way,” and, “ continues to mend,” could have the same Tendency, and be of the same Import.

Whether, if Dr. Warren had used rhofe Words, ‘‘ His Majesty is in a comfortable Way this Morning, *c which I hope tends to a Cure,” Sir Lucas Pepys would have thought he acted unwarrantably in using those Words in Conjunction with the other Physicians, fb explaining in Fadt their Sense of them ?

1 should have thought I had acted unwarrantably in signing my Name to such an Explanation, which could never be an Explanation of “ continues to mend.”

Was Sir Lucas Pepys of Opinion, the Day before Yesterday, that he ought to have no better Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery than he had when he was formerly examined here ?

I stated Ytfterday, that the Hopes of Recovery must be (hill on the same Ground upon which I had stated them to be at the former Examination; for, though I saw occasionally Abatement of Symptoms, I saw no Symptoms of approaching Convalescence.

Does Sir Lucas Pepys continue to think this Morning as he did Yesterday, that, all the Circumstances of H is Majesty’s same being duly attended to, he can conclude with more Certainty that His Majesty will recover, than he could when he was examined before the former Committee ?

Though the Hopes of Recovery must have been the fame, yet, from the Consideration of the Abatement of Symptoms, I continue in the Opinion that I was Yesterday, that I can speak with more Certainty of the Prospect of His Majesty’s Recovery.

Whether, if there has been any Error or Imperfection in the Accounts sent to , Sir Lucas

Pepys conceives it to have confided in representing His Majesty’s State to be worse than it is ?

Directly the contrary. — I have always endeavoured to represent His Majesty’s Situation in the most favourable Light.

Whether Sir Lucas Pepys considers it to be his Duty to take Care, as far as depends on him, that the Report sent to St. James's shall convey such an Account as may not tend to millcad the Public, respecting the State of His Majesty’s Health ?

Till after the Examination before the Privy Council, every Account was purposely framed to give the Public no Sort of Information of His Majesty’s Situation. Since that Period, we have endeavoured, as much as possible, to represent His Majesty’s Situation as favourably as possible, confident with Truth, though without mentioning particular Circumstances.

W hether, under any Explanation of the Words continues to mend,” Sir Lucas Pepys would think himself warranted to sign a Report containing those Words, if he was not convinced, either by his own Observation,

or the Information of others, that there had been previous Signs of Amendment as leading to Convalescence ?

Nothing could induce me to sign the Words “ con-c< tinues to mend,” unless I had from my own Observation discovered evident Signs of gradual Approaches to Convalescence, under any Explanation whatsoever.

When Sir Lucas Pepys said there was an Endeavour to represent the King’s Situation in a favourable Light, did he speak of the Reports signed by the other Physicians, or more particularly of those signed by himself?

I am satisfied, from repeated Conversations on the Subject, that the rest of the Physicians concurred with me in always endeavouring to give the most favourable Account.

Whether you know when the Order mentioned by you Yesterday, that no Person Should be admitted without the Leave of Dr. Willis, was first made ?

I cannot justly say whether it was Five, Six, or Sevetl Days ago, but somewhere thereabouts. As far as I can recoiled, it must have been on Friday last — I never saw . it till I was down the Time before last — it was when I came down at Four o’Clock on Friday.

Do you recoiled the Terms of the Order ?

The Purport of it is, that it is ordered that no Person shall go into His Majesty’s Apartment without the Leave of one of the Dr. Willis's.

Whether, to your Knowledge, any improper Persons, either by Means of the Physicians, or of others, had obtained Admission into His Majesty’s Apartment, to make the issuing such an Order necessary ?

I know of no Person having been admitted into His Majesty’s Apartment, except those who are in usual Attendance upon Him, unless Dr. Willis's Son, the Clergyman, may be considered as such.

Is that Son a Physician ?

No.

Whether you have not observed that Patients under this Malady may enjoy a State of considerable Bodily Health, the free Uie of all their Bodily Organs, and of all the Bodily Fundions, and yet still labour under a mental Distemper I ' Undoubtedly.

Whether in this Malady there may not be a temporary and partial Use of Understanding, when at the same Time the general mental Faculties continue much deranged ?

Certainly.

Whether or no the Persons who are used to the Dif-cipline employed in this Malady, and to the Means of Coercion, are not known to obtain a considerable Dominion over the Persons under their Care ?

Certainly.

Whether you have not observed, that the favourable Circumstances which occur in one Day, have frequently been overturned in the next (

Continually.

Withdrew.

Sir George Baker called in, and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health does, or does not, continue to be such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

Certainly.

What Hopes does Sir George Baker now entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

My Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery stand upon the same Grounds they did when I was here last.

Can Sir George Baker now form any Judgment, or

probable

*9 Geo. III.

i 30 Januarii.

probable Conjecture, of the Time that His Majesty’s Disease is likely to last ?

I can form no Judgment, of probable Conjecture, with respect to the Continuance of the Disease.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Sir George Baker fees any present Signs of Convalescence?

None.

Can you inform the Committee, whether a Majority of Persons, who have been afflicted with this Malady at His Majesty’s Time of Life, have recovered ?

1 can only ani'wer that by Conjecture) I believe not;

Does Sir George Baker (all the Circumstances of His Majesty’s Cafe, which have fallen within his Observation, being duly attended to) think the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery greater, or less, than it was at the Time he was examined before the former Committee, or equal to what it was, in his Judgment, at that Time ?

In my Judgment it is precisely the fame.

Whether you consider the Continuation of the Malady Four Weeks longer, without any Signs of Convalescence, as making any Difference with respect to the Chance of Recovery ?

My Experience leads me to answer, that it makes no Difference.

Do you not hold yourself responfible in your Character to the Public for the Truth of the Reports sent to St. James's, to which you sign your Name ?

I have never signed my Name to any Thing that 1 had not thought true, or very near true: We have always taken it in the most favourable Light.

Would any Argument or Motive have induced you to sign your Name to A less favourable Account of His Majesty’s Situation than, in your own Conviction and Conscience, you thought the Fad was ?

Certainly not.

Did you ever endeavour to induce Dr. Willis to sign any Account of His Majesty’s Health, which he (Dr. Willis) declared not to be correct, or fufHciently favourable, according to Dr. Willis's Opinion ?

Never.

4

Did Sir George Baker ever inform Dr. Willis that it was usual for Physicians to sign their Names to Statements of Facts, which they were not sure were true and correct, for the Sake of Agreement ?

Never. — I suppose I know what that alludes to.

To what does that allude ?

It alludes to this: — One Morning, when the Report was to be sent to St. James's, His Majesty was reported to have slept Four or Five Hours I think — Dr. Willis infilled that the Report Should run “ His Majesty has had a very good Night.” — Sir Lucas , who was there, and myself, said that we were very willing to say ic was a good Night. — Dr. Willis peremptorily infilled that it Should be written “ a very good Nightother-ways he would not sign it. — I said to Dr. upon

that Occasion, I never knew an Instance, before the resent, when, in Matters of no Importance, One Phy-cian did not yield to Two; however I will have no Dispute with you, I will allow it to be a very good Night.

Then you confine your Opinion, that One Physician Should yield to Two in Matters of little or no Importance ?

I do.

On whose Report and Authority did you form your Judgment, with respect to the Manner in which His Majesty had passed the Night ?

On the Report and Authority of the Pa^es, the Medical Attendant, and Dr. Willis.

Whether Sir Georg* Baker does not conceive, that if Vol. XLIV.

the Fact of the Manner in which His Majesty passed that Night was disputed, the Medical Attendant, and others, from whom Sir George Baker teceived his Information, would be the Persons who could give the most correct Account of that Fact to this Committee ?

Certainly.

Do you recollect whether the Medical Attendant, dr other Persons attending, or any of them, said that His Majesty did pass a very good Night ?

I really cannot recollect — there is so little Difference between a good Night, and a very good Night, that I did not think it worth charging my Memory.

Sir George Baker then cannot say, upon Recollection, that they did not say that His Majesty had passed a very good Night ?

I do recoiled that Dr. Willis's Son did state, that it was a very good Night; — as to the others, I cannot recoiled.

Did Dr. Willis’s Son fit up with His Majesty ?

I really do not know;

Is it usual for His Majesty to be attended by Dr. lis's Son through the Night?

No.

Does Sir George Baker conceive, if the Medical Attendant, and the other Persons whom Sir George Baker understood actually to have attended His Majesty through the Night, had reported to him, that His Majesty had had a very good Night, that he Should have hclitated to have so stated it in the Account ?

I mult observe, that the Medical Attendants do not fit up with His Majesty, so that our Report depends upon the Pages and Dr. Willis's Men.

Whether the Medical Attendants are Persons who could give the most correct Information to this Committee, of the Fact how His Majesty passed the Night?

Certainly, if the Medical Attendant did not fit up, he could not.

Whether you do not think that those Four Medical Attendants on His Majesty are capable of giving Information, respecting His Majesty’s Situation, worthy the Attention of this Committee, in addition to the Information they receive from His Majesty’s Physicians ?

The Four Medical Attendants are very sensible Men; each of them flays in the House Twenty-four Hours in his Turn; and I think each of them capable of giving this Committee Satisfaction with respect to any Quel-tiens thCy may ask.

Whether those Gentlemen have not frequent Access to His Majesty when the Physicians are not present ? They have.

Whether they do not examine into the State and Manner in which His Majesty passed the Night, previous to the Arrival of the Physicians ?

They used to do so till lately.

How long have they ceased to do so, and upon what Account ?

I think it was last Saturday Morning, that I saw a Paper stuck up over the Chimney of the Pages Room, with an Order to this Effect; “ No One, except the “ Pages, is allowed to go to His Majesty, except introduced by One of the Two Dr. Willis’s."

When was you at Kew before that Time ?

That must be ’Thursday.

Was the Paper not there then ?

I did not fee or hear of it.

Does Sir George Baker conceive that he must have heard of it, if any such Order had been then issued ?

I conceive that I must have heard of it.

Does Sir George Baker know of any Ir\stances of im-

Q_ proper

proper Persons having been introduced to His Majesty’s Apartment, either by the Physicians or others, to cause the issuing of that Order ?

No.

By whose Authority was that Order ifltied ?

I asked Dr. Willis -, he said that he wrote it, without any further Answer.

Did Sir George Baker converse with any of the Medical Attendants respecting that Order, or understand from them that they were excluded by it from entering, as they were used to do, His Majesty’s Apartment, unless with the Permission of Dr. Willis or his Son ?

It was generally understood by the Physicians, that the Order was intended to exclude them and the Medical Attendants, unless introduced by Dr. Willis or his Son.

Did Sir George Baker hear, either from the Physicians, or from any of the Medical Attendants, any Reason assigned, as the probable Cause of that Order ?

No.

Was Sir George Baker at Kew on the Friday before that Saturday ?

No.

If there has been any Error or Imperfection in the Account sent to St. James's, does Sir George Baker conceive it to have consisted in representing His Majesty’s Situation, worse than it is ?

If there has been any Error or Imperfection, it has been in representing His Majesty’s State better than it is.

Is it usual, when a Patient is put under the Care of a Person who has made this particular Branch his Study, for that Person to be consulted respecting the Persons by whom the Patient is to be seen, or attended, and the Time ?

When I attend a Patient with Dr. Munro, he and I consult and settle the Times of Attendance — the Apothecary goes in without his Leave — and there is a certain Attendant or Two always with the Patient.

Whether the Physicians, or some of them, since this Order was made, have Daily seen His Majesty ?

Always, with Doctor Willis.

Whether, previous to the issuing of that Order, and since Dr. Willis has been attending His Majesty, Sir George Baker has not had frequent Opportunities of seeing and conversing with His Majesty, not in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son ?

When His Majesty first came from Windsor to Kew, I conceived that I was at Liberty to visit His Majesty at any Time; but afterwards I found it was disagreeable to Dr. Willis that I Should go in without him, and therefore I have of late very seldom, if ever, visited His Majesty but in Company with Dr. Willis.

Whether Sir George Baker thinks he can form as accurate a Judgment of the actual State of His Majesty, from conversing with His Majesty in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son, as when allowed to converse with His Majesty as he had used to do ?

In my Opinion, it makes very little Difference.

Whether, by Dr. Willis's Advice, a Course of Medicine has been prescribed to the King, different from that which had been previously used, or would have been otherwise recommended by His Majesty’s Physicians ?

No Medicine has been given the King, since Dr. Willis's Arrival, but with the Consent of the other Physicians.

Question repeated.

I believe there was one Pill of Calomel given to the King by Dr. Willis’s Desire, but I know of no other.

Whether that had the desired Effect in promoting His Majesty’s Convalescence ?

It had the common Effect of Purges, and no other.

Whether, before Dr. Willis's Arrival, the peculiar Mode of Coercion and Management, which has been since used, had been employed in the same Way, or in an equal Degree ?

Neither in the same Way, nor in an equal-Degree.

> Have they produced that Effect towards the King’s Convalescence, which was not- experienced from the former Management ?

They have made His Majesty quieter, more manageable; but I am not sure that any Thing has been done by them towards Convalescence.

Is Sir George Baker sure, that it was on Saturday the 3d Instant, that he first saw the Order that no Person should be admitted into the King’s Apartment without the Leave of Dr. Willis or his Son ?

It is a Thing f would not take my Oath to, but I believe it to be so.

Did you then hear that any Dispute, or material Difference of Opinion, had taken Place on the preceding Day, between Dr. Willis and Dr. Warren ?

I had heard it before 1 saw the Paper, and that it happened on the Friday.

Did you understand that it was upon the Information received from some of the Medical Attendants, who had then Access to His Majesty’s Apartment, that Dr. Warren had in some Measure supported the Opinion he maintained ?

I certainly did.

_ Do you recollect that Mr. Charles Hawkins’s Authority had {been quoted by Dr. Warren, on that' Qc-casion ?

I heard that it had been quoted.

Does Sir George Baker conceive, that Dr. Warren, or himself, or any other Physician attending His Majesty, would now be deprived of the same Means of Information, respecting the State of His Majesty in their Absence, upon which Dr. Warren then formed, in Part, his Judgment, unless with the Permission or Consent of Dr. Willis or his Son I

If that Order, set up by Dr. , takes Place, it will not be in the Power of any of those Medical Gentlemen to give us any Information.

How long have you been employed as Physician to His Majesty I

Ever since the Death of Sir Richard Jebb — about a Year and a Half, I think.

Has Sir George Baker attended His Majesty on'y, or has he been employed in attending the Royal Family ?

Both His Majesty and all the Royal Family: I mean the Family at Windsor, and at Kew.

Is Sir George Baker now employed to attend on the Royal Family ?

Only the King — not the Royal Family.

Whether there has been any direct or indirect Attempt made, by any of the Physicians, at any Time, to controul or influence you with respect to the Account to be given of His Majesty’s Situation I

None.

Withdrew.

Doiftor

Doctor Henry Revell Reynolds, called in, and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health does, or does not, continue to be such as to render His Majesty incapable, either of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

It does render him incapable, unquestionably.

What Hopes does Dr. Reynolds how entertain of His Majesty’s Recovery?

I think there are the same Hopes now that there were before; not less, certainly.

Can Dr. Reynolds now form any Judgment, or probable Conjecture, of the Time that His Majesty’s 111-ness is likely to 1 aft ?

No, I cannot.

Whether, in His Majesty’s Disorder, Dr. Reynolds fees any present Signs of Convalfcfcence ?

H is Majesty is more quiet, more observant of the Admonition of his Medical Attendants, in perhaps a still better State of general Health, which are favourable Circumstances, and which, I hope, lead to Amendment; but I cannot say that there is any actual Amendment at present in His Majesty’s principal Complaint.

Whether, in Dr. Reynolds's Judgment, the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery (all Circumstances that have fallen within his Observation being duly attended to) is greater, or less, than it was at the Time Dr. Reynolds was examined before the former Committte ? or. Whether, in his Judgment, the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery is as good as it then was ?

The Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery is certainly as good now as it was then, in my Opinion.

Does Dr. Reynolds conceive that the Duration of His Majesty’s Illness up to this Time (all Circumstances of His Majesty’s same being duly attended to) does, or does not, decrease the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery ? f

The Duration hitherto certainly does not militate against His Majesty’s Recovery; few recover so soon from such Maladies.

Whether, from Dr. Reynolds's Observation, His Majesty does, or does not, appear to be more easily controuled now than He was a Fortnight ago, under the same Species of Care and Management ?

I think His Majesty is more easily controuled.

In the Judgment of Dr. , and according tp

his Observations in Cafes of this Kind, is the Circumstance that a Patient is more easily controuled, a favourable Circumstance towards his Recovery ?

It is frequently a previous Step to it.

Whether it is usual, in Cafes such as His Majesty’s, for Physicians, who have not made such Cases their particular Study, to call in the Assistance of Physicians who have made those Cafes the Subject of their particular Attention ?

That depends very much upon the particular Circumstances of the Patient in many Respects; in the First Place, the pecuniary Circumstances of the Patient influence you in proposing a Consultation with another Physician: In the next Place,' it will depend upon the Symptoms of the particular Patient; if no Restraint or Coercion is necessary, from the particular Circumstances of the Cafe, every Physician of Experience will, I have no Doubt, think himself competent to conduit a Patient in such a Cafe; I mean at the same Time to be understood, that in that Cafe, as in every other, no liberal Man wiil have any Objection to a Consultation if called for.

If, in this Disorder, Restraint and Coercion does become necessary, whether Physicians of general Prac-

tice do not usually call in the Assistance of Physicians who have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study ?

It is usual, and for these Reasons kmongst others — that Gentlemen, who have dedicated themselves to that particular Object of Practice, have usually Houses of Reception for Patients so circumstanced, which they superintend; from them therefore proper Assistance can be procured; and as it is necessary to avoid aft Causes of Emotion in such Patients, it may be proper to remove those Patients from their own Families, that the Objects, which are most apt to excite those Emotions, may be kept from them.

Dr. Reynolds fays, that it is usual for these Reasons amongst others; What are those other Reasons ?

I can’t recollect all those Reasons immediately; some of them are, perhaps. Points of Etiquette. We Should be glad to have the Benefit of the Experience of such Physicians in Cafes of this Kind.

Whether such Physicians, who have made this Branch of Medicine their particular Study, do not, from their constant Opportunities of making Observations upon the Cafes of Persons so disordered* acquire the Habit of judging better upon the Probability of the Recovery of Patients, than other Physicians who have not made that Branch of Medicine their particular Study, and who have not {he same constant Opportunities of making the like Obfetva-tiens ?

That must in a great Measure depend upon their relative Capability of observing, and upon their FiA delity in recording what they observed; those being equal, the greatest Experience must have the Preference.

Would Dr. Reynolds think a Person, who has made this Branch of Medicine his particular Study for Twenty-eight Years, and under whose Care Nine out of Ten of the Persons who have been put under that Care within Three Months after they had begun to be afflicted with that Disorder had recovered, a Person lkilful in such Cases ?

Yes, if I could believe the Fast.

Whether/to induce Dr. Reynolds to believe such a Fast, he would not require some further Evidence than the Afiertion of the Person who stated himself to have been so successful ?

I certainly Should require further Evidence than the Afiertion of any Man, to induce me to believe such a Fact.

Does Dr. Reynolds consider an Afiertion made before this Committee, though not upon Oath, as made under an Obligation, on the Part of the Person making it, to speak the Truth, equal to an Afiertion made upon Oath ?

I consider myself under the same Obligation.

If a Physician of long Experience asserted, that he had from Eight to Ten Patients usually at a Time, for Five Years together, in a House,' and never had more than Four Patients who were not cured within the Year, and continued well as far as he ever knew; and that, if any of those Persons had relapsed, lie believed, from the partial Opinion of their Families, he Should have heard of it; he would require further Evidence of the Truth of that Fatt ?

I Should not be satisfied without further Evidence than Afiertion, though I do not mean to impeach the Credibility of any one.

Whether, in Dr. Reynolds's Opinion, His Majesty’s Bodily Strength has increased, or declined, during the last Month ?

H is Majesty’s Bodily Strength certainly has not declined; I am not competent to judge of any Increase

§ of

bf it, for it is not put tb any Exeftiort; He appears to be alert and active.

Whether Dr. Reynolds' thinks His Majesty’s Bodily Health thriving or declining ?

I think His Majesty’s general Health is improved within the last Month.

4

Whether Dr. Reynolds now entertains Hopes of His Majesty’s more speedy Recovery from His present Malady, than when he was last examined ?

It is impossible to ascertain the Time, I cannot venture even to hazard a Conjecture.

Whether, after it has become necessary to resort to that particular Mode of Coercion applied by Persons particularly conversant in that Branch of Medicine, the Patient so coerced is to be considered as affected with the Disorder in a greater Degree than before such Coercion became necessary ?

There is a State without Turbulence, which equally incapacitates a Person from transacting Business as the turbulent State which does require Coercion.v

In which of the Two States is there a greater Prospect of a speedy Recovery ?

When a Patient afflicted with this Malady, who has been turbulent, ceases to be so, he may be laid to be in a State more favourable to Recovery than while he continued in that turbulent State.

Whether Dr. Reynolds knows, or has any Grounds of informing the Committee, whether the Majority of Persons affiidted with this Malady at His Majesty’s Time of Life have recovered ?

I have not sufficient Grounds to answer that Ques-tien.

Do you consider a perfect State of Bodily Health, to-existing with a complete mental Ditemper, a very good Symptom towards Recovery of the mental Dif-order ?

If a Patient shall have been several Months, perhaps a Year, affiidted with the mental Disorder, which Disorder remains without Diminution, I Should not consider perfect Bodily Health as promissory of Recovery from the mental Disorder.

Whether the Improvement of Bodily Health, without any proportionate Improvement of mental Sanity, becomes a probable Symptom of mental Conva-lefcence ?

In a recent same I think it is.

Whether, in the same before us, a State of Quiet has not often succeeded a State of Irritation, and a State of Irritation a State of Quiet — and what was the Difference observed in each State with regard to mental Sanity, in this same ?

There have been frequently such Vicifiitudes, and there have been nearer Approaches to Reason in a State of Quiet than in a State of Turbulence; but I think not invariably so; this is to the best of my Re-collection at prefenc.

Was Dr. Reynolds present at a Difcuffton which took place on Friday the Second Instant, between Dr.

Willis and Dr. Warren, respecting the Account which was that Day sent to St. James's ?

1 was.

Relate what passed upon that Occasion.

When Dr. Warren came down to Kew on Friday Morning the id Instant, I saw him before he visited His Majesty, and told him how I had found H is Majesty the Evening before, and that Morning when 1 visited Him. After Dr. Warren had waited upon His Majesty, he came into the Room where we usually consult, and, after agreeing upon the Prc-feription for the Day, we proceeded to consider what Report we Should send to St. James's % there were then present in the Room, Dr. Dr. John Willis,

and myself; and, as nearly as I can recollect, Dr. Warren and I agreed upon this ReportHis Majesty passed Yesterday quietly, has had a very good “ Night, and is calm this Morning.” I wrote it, read it over, and Dr. John Willis objected to it, alledging that it was not descriptive of His Majesty's Amendment, for that He certainly was much better, having, on the preceding Day and on that Morning, said many pertinent and rational Things. Dr. Warren contended, that several Things said properly proved nothing; but that some Things said immediately afterwards improperly were decisive. Dr. John Willis contended, that a Mitigation of Symptoms was Amendment. Dr. Warren did not consider that any Amendment could take Place, till there was an Interval of an Hour, or more, of Reason and Judgment. While they were in this Argument, Dr. , Senior, came in, was shewn the Report intended to be sent to St. James's, and did not at fjrft reading it disapprove of it; but upon Dr. John Willis’s observing, that it did riot contain so favourable an Account of His Majesty’s Situation, as the Report which had been sent on the preceding Day, he objected to it, contending that there was a material Amendment, which ought to be reported. — Dr. Warren and myself, not seeing His Majesty’s State in the same Light, thought that the Report held out sufficient Hopes to the Public. Doctors Willis (I think both, but I am certain Dr. Willis, Senior) observed that the Queen would not suffer it to go so; and I cannot exactly recollect what Words immediately followed; but Dr. , Senior, addrefting himself to Dr. Wa, said, “ that it would “ fall upon him That Expression I particularly remember. — We talked again upon the Subject, and drew up the following Report: “ His Majesty passed Yesterday much in the same Manner as He did the “ Day before, has had a very good Night, and is this Morning as He was Yesterday.” This Report was carried up Stairs, and when returned, it was accom-' panied with a Desire that we would add to the End of the last Sentence, continuing mendingI speak to the best of my Recollection. — This seemed to Dr. Warren and myself more than the State of His Majesty authorized us to say. Dr. Warren therefore desired the Honour of an Audience of Her Majesty, which was granted; and when he returned, the last Part of the Report was altered as follows: “ and is “ this Morning in a comfortable Way,” instead of “ is this Morning as He was Yesterday.” I speak from Memory — 1 have no Notes. Dr. continued arguing warmly with Dr. 1 barren, while I was writing the Three Reports — they were in the next Room to that in which I was writing — the Door wide open; and I heard Dr. say to Dr.

amongst other Expressions of Disagreement with him in Opinion, that if Dr. Warren held the Opinion which he maintained, that it impeached his Common Sense, or something else; to which Dr. Warren made no Reply, only desired the Persons present, among whom were Lady Harcourt , Lady Charlotte , and General Gordon, to observe thac Dr. IVillis had made use of such an Expression. Dr. Warren conducted himself, through the Whole of this unpleasant Business, with admirable Temper.

Does Dr. Reynolds recoiled! sufficiently the Conversation which passed between Dr. Warren and Dr. Willis upon that Friday, to take upon himself to say positively, whether the following Circumstances occurred between those Persons at any Time that Day; namely, Whether Dr. Willis asked this Question of Dr. Warren, or any Question to this Effect: *If a Person in such an Indisposition as His Majesty, “ Should not say One sensible Word in Twenty-four <* Hours, and in the next Twenty-four Should say but

One

«« One Word that he would not say if he was not indisposed, Whether Dr. Warren would not think him better?” If any such Question, or any Question to that Effect, was asked by Dr. Willis* whether Dr, Reynolds can say positively that Dr. Warren did, or did nor, answer «« No,” or what other Answer he gave to it ?

1 think I fecolle£k that some such Question was proposed by Dr. Willis to Dr. , but I do not

remember that Dr. Warren said “ Noas he admitted, that if a Person in the Situation of His Majesty, was for the Space of One Hour, or more, like himself, that he mould think him mended. 'I remember this Observarion made by One of the Dr.

was not put up when 1 was last in that Room on

Friday.

Was that the Day on which the Difference of Opinion happened between Dr. Willis and Dr. Warren ?

It was.

Did Dr. Reynolds of Dr. Warren in any Measure ground the Opinion, which induced them that Day to differ from Dr. Willis*upon Information received from Mr. Charles Hawkins, or other of the Attendants who were then permitted to have Access to His Majesty’s Apartment ?

I formed my Opinion from what I Personally ob-

Willis’s to Dr. Warren, or something to this Purpose, served in His Majesty “ You will not allow a Person in this State to be better Did Dr. hear Dr. Warren quote the Au-

” 11 jj hc;» wf-n Yes, I will, ’ find Dr. Warren, thorjty of Mr. Hawkins's Representation of the State when I fee him have an Interval, for the Space of in which the K}ng had bwn }n> in Support of his Ob-" aiJ Hour or Two, of Reason and Judgment but not jcfUon to signing altered Report ?

till then. This is as nearly as I can recollect. j

Does Dr. Reynolds recollect what were the Words which Dr. Warren had used immediately before One of the Dr. Willis’s said to him, " You will not allow " a Person in this State to be better till he is well ?”

; No, I do not.

Is the Committee to understand, that Dr. Warren did not answer to Dr. Willis in this Argument, “ that he should think no Person better till they were perfectly well ?”

Dr. Warren did not say that in my Hearing.

Did he say, in Dr. Reynolds’s Hearing, ,c‘ that he

should think a Person better if he was himself for

an Hour or two ?”

Yes, he did.

Does Dr. Reynolds hold himself responsible in his Character to the Public, for the Truth of the Accounts sent to St. James's, and signed with his Name?

I have always wished to give, in that Report, as favourable an Account of His Majesty’s Health as I could consistent with Truth.

Did Dr. Reynolds ever endeavour to induce Dr.

Willis to sign any Account of the King's Situation, by any vehement Argument or Dispute, which Dr. Willis declared to be contrary to his Opinion ?

Never.

Did Dr. Reynolds ever inform Dr. Willis* that it was usual for Physicians to sign their Names to Statements of Fads, which they are not sure are true or cor red, for the Sake of Agreement ?

I never did.

Did Dr. Reynolds ever tell him, that in such Matters the Opinion of One should give Way to the other Two, and that he was surprized he should hesitate about it ?

No.

Should not Dr. Reynolds consider the signing his Name to any Account sent to St. which tended

to mistead the Public into a less favourable Opinion of His Majesty’s State than the Fad warranted, as equally culpable in him, as the giving untrue Information to this Committee ?

1 should think it highly culpable to do so.

When did Dr. Reynolds first hear of the Order, that ho Person should be admitted into His Majesty’s Apartment, Without the permission of Dr. or

his Son ?

I first observed that written Order fixed above the Chimney* in the Pages Room, on Sunday last.

Does Dr. Reynolds know when it was first put up ?

I understood it was put up on Friday last; it

Vol. XLIV.

Does Dr. Reynolds know, or did he ever hear, of any improper Persons having intruded, or being admitted, into His Majesty’s Apartment, to make the issuing of that Prohibition necessary ?

I don’t know any Thing that has made that Prohibition necessary or proper.

By what Authority did Dr. Reynolds understand that Notice or Order to have been fixed up in the Pages Room ?

As it did not seem to me to be signed by any Person of Authority, I paid no Attention to it myielf, and made no other Enquiries about it, except who put it there j and was told Dr. Willis; but I took a Copy of it. I did hear Dr. Willis Today, in the outer Room here, say that it was put up by the Authority of the Lord Chancellor, which I did not hear before; he said so in my Presence, and, I think, in that of Dr. Gijbome.

Whether, in Dr. Reynolds’s Opinion, the Four Medical Assistants, who are in constant Attendance on His Majesty, are not competent to give Information worthy the Attention of this Committee, in Addition to that of the Physicians ?

1 think them all Men of Sense and Judgment, and believe them to be Men of Integrity.

In what State did Dr. Reynolds leave His Majesty Today ?

Pretty much, I think, in the same State as when I saw Him the Time before — a State of Composure and Quiet, but not in a mended State respecting His Mind.

Whether the Four Medical Persons do not, from Time to Time, report to the Physicians the several Circumstantes of His Majesty’s Cafe, in order to enable those Physicians to form their Judgment upon His Majesty’s same ?

The Physicians form their Judgment from what they hear of His Majesty in their Absence, and from what they Personally observe when they have the Honour to wait upon Him.

Whether the Physicians do not receive Information, with respect to what passes in their Absence, from the Reports of these Medical Gentlemen, or some of them ?

They do receive Information from them, and require it from all who they think are capable of giving them useful Information.

Dr. Reynolds having said, that the Chance of His Majesty's Recovery is certainly as good now, in his Opinion, as it was when he was formerly examined before the other Committee — Is that Dr. Reynolds’s Opinion, after giving due Attention to all the Cir-

R cumstances

cumstances which he has mentioned in his Examination this Day, and all other Circumstances which have fallen under his Observation, and notwithstand-fng any Difference, of Opinion which may have arifon between any of His Majesty’s Physicians f

It is my Opinion.

Fetter is, 90 die Januarii 1789.

:, v,-(

Doctor Thomas Gijbome called ini and examined.

Whether, in his Opinion, the State of His Majesty’s Health does, or does not, continue to be such as to render His Majesty incapable, either ,of corning to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business ?

Ithink him incapable of coming to Parliament, or of attending to Public Business.- -

What Hopes does Dr. Gijborne now entertain of H is Majesty’s Recovery ?

I think, as before, that there are (till Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery.

Can Dr* Gijborne now form any Judgment* or probable Conjecture, of the Time that His Majesty’s lllness is likely to last?

No, I cannot.

Whether in His Majesty’s Disorder Dr. Gijborne fees any present Signs of Convalescence ?

1 think the State of His Majesty’s Bodily Health is better than it was Three Weeks ago, and that He is more quiet; it may therefore be hoped, that these possibly may be the Prelude to further Amendment.

Whether the State of His Majesty’s Bodily Health is now perfectly good, or has been at any Time since the Commencement of His present Disorder ?

I think that can hardly be said.

Whether His Majesty’s particular Malady arises from the State of His Bodily Health, to which Dr. Gijborne alludes ?

No, I think not. 1

♦ . , -

Whether you have ever endeavoured to influence

or persuade Dr. Willis to join in any Report of the State of His Majesty’s Health, contrary,to his. Dr. Willis's, Judgment upon it ?

Never.

Do you know any other Physician that has ?

No.

Did you ever inform Dr. Willis that it was usual for Physicians to sign their Names to Statements of Fadts, which they are not sure are true or correct, for the Sake of Agreement ?

No.

Did you ever tell him, that in such 'Matters, the Opinion of One Should give Way to Two, and that you was surprized he Should hesitate about such Matters ?

No.

Would any Motive or Argument induce you to sign your Name to the Account sent to respecting the State of the King’s Health, which you did not in your Confidence believe to be substantially true ?

Certainly not. . .:

Should you not consider the signing your Name to an Account of that Sort, tending to mislead the Public into a less favourable Opinion of His Majesty’s State than the Fadl warranted, in the same Point of View as giving Information to mislead this Committee ?

Yes. ..

Whether, if there has been any Errors or Imper-section in the Accounts sent to St. James's, you conceive it to have consisted in representing His Majesty’s State to be worse than it is ?

I know of no Error; and I was ever as cautious as possible, that the Hopes or Fears of the Public should hot be milled. _

Whether the Report sent to St. James's does always tontafn a full State of His’ Majesty’s real Situation b ' "'I '

I think it impossible that it Should. - -.1 -

Has it ever mentioned His Majesty’s Malady at

aiu \:

I think His Majesty’s Malady is' easily to be cpl-lcdted from It.

Is there any Thing in such Reports that, tends , to give the Public any. Idea of His Majesty’s ConvaleD ceoce from, or growing worse in the Symptoms of, His peculiar Malady ? *

There have hitherto hardly been any Syrnptoms of either Kind to be told.

... . "i.

When did you fee or hear of the Order that*,no Person Should be admitted into His Majesty’s Apartments without -the Leave of Dr. Willis :or hi* Son I ..

I forget; I believe about a Week ago.

Do you know, or have you ever heafd, that-iny improper Persons have been admitted into His jesty’s Apartment, to make! that Order necessary ?;

No; I know of.no improper Persons. - ,

By what Authority do you understand. that Ofder to have been issued ? . -

I was told it was put up at Dr. Willis's Desire.

Whether you ever learnt what Authority Dr. Willis had for putting up that Order ?

’ I think I he?rd him say he thought too many People went in to the King, and that the Chancellor advised him to do that, or something else, to prevent it.

Had too many or any improper People been admitted, to your Knowledge ? ,

Not to my Knowledge-I was not . constantly there, therefore cannot tell.

Were not Three Persons of Dr. Willis's own Family, himself included, of the Number of those who went in to the King ? .; v , i

Yes.

Is there not one of that Family who is no Medical Attendant ? 1

One of them is a Clergyman, and, I believe, does not call himself a Physician.

Does Dr. Gijborne know whether any Persons have gone in to His Majesty at improper Times ? .

No; I do not.

Does Dr. Gijborne know whether His Majesty has, or has not, been prevented from sleeping by the Circumstance of any Persons going into His Room?

No — I do not know that.

Has He been prevented from lleeping ?.

I do not know.

Did Dr. Gijborne understand by that Order, that the Physicians themselves were not to be permitted to fee the King, withput Dr. Wr,. or his Son’s;.Permission ? ' ..

The Words of the Paper are, that no Persons, except the Pages, shall be permitted.

Then you did understand it to extend to the Physicians ? ,

Yes. *

/ Docs

Does Dr. Gijborne, when he goes to Keio, make Enquiry of all or any of the Four Medical Attendants, who are in constant Waiting on His Majesty, to assist himself by their Information in forming his Opinion on the King’s State f (

Yes, 1 do.

jDoes Dr. Gijborne conceive that he Should be deprived of the Means of-material Information! if all those Gentlerrten were excluded from Access to His Majesty’s Apartment ? ..... . ': .

Yes. - - i ' ’

Did Dr. Gijborne hear of any Difpyte, or' material Difference of Opinion, which Had arisen on Friday the ad Instant, between Dr. Willis arid Dr. Warren ? None, relative to the Treatment of His Majesty.

Did you hear of any such Dispute, or Difference of Opinion, relative to the State or Condition of His Majesty ?

No.

Whether, in Dr. Gijborne'sOpinion, the Four Medical Assistants, who are in constant Attendance on His Majesty, are not competent to give Information worthy the Attention of this Committee, in addition to that of the Physicians ?

Yes, surely.

Whether any Medicine is administered to the King, by the Prescription of Dr, Wilis, unknown to the other Physicians ?

No.

Whether there has been any particblar Medicine, at the Suggestion of Dr. Willis, and soon after his Arrival, administered to the King ?'

Not without Confutation of the rest, that I know of.

Does Dr. Gijborne. recollect Dr. Willis having recommended any particular Medicine, in order to tneet and counteract what he. Dr. Willis, conceived to be the Cause of His Majesty’s Malady?

I do riot think I understand the Question.

Does not Dr. Gijborne imagine, from this Account given by Dr. Willis, viz. That from the particular Detail of His Majesty's Mode and Manner of Life “ for aj Years, I do imagine, that weighty BuGness, severe Exercise, and too great. Abstemiousness, and little Rest, has been too much for His Constitution. u It is very early to give art Opinion, and 1 may be “ mistaken, but I am the more Inclined to think myself right, because the Medicine that has been given His Majesty ever since Sunday Morning, and was intended to meet and counteract those Causes, has had as much Effect as I could wish,” that Dr. Willis refers to some Medicine recommended by himself ?

I suppose he does.

What was that Medicine, which had the Effect stated by Dr. Willis, in counteracting those Causes of His Majesty’s Malady, namely, “ weighty BuGness, «« severe Exercise, too great. Abstemiousness, and “ little Rest, for a Course of 27 Years?”

I have not the Recipe in my Pocket.

Does Dr. Gijborne recollect, whether there was any Thing peculiar and new in the Medicine?

The Medicine was approved of in Consultation by us all.

Have you no Recollection what it was, it having produced, as Dr. Willisftates, as much Effect as he could wilh, and counteracting all those Causes ?

I think these are Questions for Dr. Willis alone to answer.

Had the Medicine, in ycur Judgment, any Effect in meeting and counteracting those Causes ?

I think none of our Medicines have had the Effetft to be wished.

Was His Majesty gradually better, from the first Six Hours after He took it, to the Time of your former Examination before the Committee ?

Not materially, that I know of.

Whether, Grice the Order alluded to Dr. Gijborne continues to have every Means of Observation and Information which he deems necessary to direct his Judgment upon the actual State of His Majesty’s Health ?,

Yes, I have. '

Whether Dr. Gijborne observes any material Difference in His Majesty, at such Times as he viftts.Him in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son, and at such Times when neither of those Gentlemen are present ?

I think He is more quiet when they are present.

Does Dr. Gijborne know that any of the Four Medical Assistants have at any Time been refused Admis-Gon to His Majesty* and thereby prevented from procuring the Information necessary to be.laid before tb« Physicians ?

I really do not know.

Has Dr. Gijborne ever heard them complain of any such Refusal ?

I have not heard them complain.

Whether, before that Order, any of the Medical Attendants saw His Majesty early in the Morning before any of the Physicians, or fat up with Him in the Night ?

Yes — they have, I believe, got up to Him in the Night — I believe they never fat up with Him — they have seen Him early in the Morning before the Physicians.

Whether, since that Order, they have beeri permitted to fee Him as usual, without Dr. Willis or his Son’s being present ?

I don’t know.

Since that Order* in what Manner, when those Medical Gentlemen are called upon by the Physicians, do they make that Report? — do they make it in the Presence of Dr. Willis and his Son, or by themselves ?

It is accidental whether they are present or not*.

Dr. Gijborne having observed, that in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son His Majesty is more quiet, he thinks — Whether Dr. Gijborne apprehends that the reducing a Patient labouring under His Disorder into a State of Quiet, is, or is not, likely to be one of the Means of bringing about His Recovery ?

I think Quiet to be good for such Patients.

Whether, if the Effeftof Dr. Willis's Presence is to render His Majesty more quiet, it does not make any Judgment formed of the State of His Majesty’s Mind at that Time more uncertain ?

No. '

Whether Dr. Gijborne does not think that the Judgment formed of the State of His Majesty’s Mind, by a Physician seeing His Majesty in the Presence of Dr. Willis, might be different from that which he would form if Dr. Willis was not present ?

Not if he were a Physician of Judgment.

Whether Dr. Gijborne, in his Conscience, thinks, after duly attending to all the Circumstances of His Majesty’s same which he has related to this Committee, and to all the Circumstances. of His Majesty’s same which have fallen under his Observation, or come to his Knowledge, and notwithstanding any Disputes which may have taken place between His Majesty’s Physicians, or any of them, either relative to His Majesty’s Cafe, or other Subjects, that His Majesty’^ Chance cf Recovery is greater, or leis, than it was, or

as

64

*3° Jam

as good as it was, when Dr. Gijbwme was examined here by the former Committee ?

The Time elapsed is lhort> and therefore I think the Chance as good.

Withdrew;

The Reverend Do&dr Willis again called

in, and examined.

Whether the several Circurristances of His Majesty’s Cafe, which have fallen within your Observation, or come to your Knowledge* being duly attended to, you* in your Confidence, think that the Chance of His Majesty’a Recovery is greater, or less, than, or as good as, it was when you was examined before the former Committee ?

Much greater.

When Dr. Willis fays* that the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery is much greater, docs he found his Idea that the Chance is much greater upon his Observation that, in His Majesty’s Cafe* such Circumstances have occurred as he has usually observed in the same bf Persons who have laboured under the same Malady and afterwards recovered!

Certainly. Yes.

Does Dr. Willis consider His Majesty’s Age as making a material Difference in the Chance of His Majesty’s recovering or not recovering, after duly attending to all the Circumstances of His Majesty’s same which have fallen within his Observation,' and come to his Knowledge ?

I don’t judge that the Age is of any Signification, tinlefs the Patient had been afflicted before with the same Malady.

Dr. Willis having stated to the Committee, that His Majesty, a Fortnight ago, would take up Books and could not read a Line, but that He will now read several Pages, and make, in his Opinion, very good Remarks upon the Subject j Does Dr. Willis's Observation and Experience of what has happened in other Cafes, enable him to say that such a Circumstance does, or does not, afford him a more solid Ground of Hope of His Majesty’s Recovery, than he had when he was examined before the former Committee ?

Certainly a more solid Ground of Hope of His Majesty’s Recovery.

Is that Hope the Effect of the Doltor’s Judgment, formed upon his Experience of Twenty-seven or Twenty-eight Years ?

Certainly.

In the Judgment of Dr. Willis, who has said that His Majesty is very irritable, is His Majesty more or less frequently in an altual State of Irritation than He was about the Time when Dr. Willis was examined before the former Committee ?

Nothing near so frequently irritated; and when irritated, the Irritation does not last a Tenth Part so long.

Has Dr. Willis, in his Observation and Experience, or has he not, remarked, that a Change of the same Nature has usually taken Place in the same of Patients who have afterwards recovered ?

Yes.

Dr. Willis having said, in his Examination before

the former Committee, that His Majesty’s Irritation had then in a great Measure subsided; Did Dr. Willis mean, when he so expressed himself, that the Irritation was at that Time less than it had been when he first saw His Majesty ? or did he mean to suggest, that the Irritation had then subsided in such a Degree as to imake what Dr. Willis calls firm Coercion unneceffery ?

I was at that Time in Hopes that the Irritability

A. 1789.

would not be so great as to require any firm Coercion; and perhaps, had there been no Blisters applied to His Majesty’s Legs, which had an Effelt upon His nervous System, which I was not aware of, from being cold that His Majesty was scarce sensible of the Blisters that had been applied at Windsor, there never would have been any Occtfion for such Coercion; but His Majesty’s Blisters not operating kindly, had a very extraordinary Effect, as I thought* upon His whole System, and made me sensible that we were wrong in applying the Blisters — though perhaps in the End they may not have retarded a Cure. — For the same Medicines that I apprehend had abated His Majesty’s Irritability ac that Time', haVe. been continued ever since, except about Eight Days \ and I have Reason to think have had the intended Effect.

Whetheri in Point bf Fait, when Dr: Willis was examined before the former Committee, His Majesty’s Irritation at that Time had in a great Measure subsided ?

It had subsided greatly; in Comparison to what it was when I first came and first saw His Majesty, and gave me great Hopes that the Medicine was given with a proper Intention.

What did the Medicine, which has had the Effelt you speak of, consist of ?

The Bark and Saline Medicines occasionally. The Bark sometimes every Four Hours, and sometimes a Saline Draught.

Whether any Pills were Part of this System of Medicine ?

We thought it necessary to give occasionally, within those Eight Days, Alterative Pills, with a very trifling Part of Calomel.

Whether His Majesty had not taken Bark before you prescribed for him ?

I understood His Majesty had at Windsor, for one Day or two, — but I don’t know , — upon Enquiry, it was thought His Majesty was calmer afterwards.

Whether the Medicine which you mentioned in your Examination before the former Committee, as having been given His Majesty since the Sunday preceding that Examination, was, according to the Accounts, which you had received, understood to be different from the Medicine which His Majesty had been in the Course of taking for some Time before that Sunday ?

Very different, to the best of my Memory and Information — indeed it was mentioned to me, that it was intended to give His Majesty that Medicine, if they had not expelled my coming.

Whether you, when you first attended His Majesty, did not look over the File of Prescriptions made before you came to attend His Majesty ?

I did not, but had a general Account from Dr. Warren, as we went down to Kewwhat Medicines had been given.

Dr. Willis having said, in his Examination before the Committee, that he kept a House for Twenty-eight Years for the Reception of Persons afflilted with this Disorder j Whether he can give to the Committee an Account of the gross Number of Persons entertained in his House, from his first admitting such Patients to the present Time ?

I can give no Account.

If you can give no Account at present, have you no Means, by confuhing your Papers, of giving that Information to the Committee ?

Not any — I have not kept any Account at all.

Can you inform the Committee what Number of Persons have been difmififed from your House as radically cured, from the Beginning of your undertaking this Business ?

1 I can

u

I.

2.9 Geo. III. 130 y

I can give no Account; nor have I been confined to One House or Ten Houses, because I put the Patients to such Places as suited their pecuniary Circumstances.

Having fald that this Business was not confined to one, but to many Houses, whether you can give any Account upon the Whole of the Number of Persons radically cured ?

Not at all.

If you can give no Account to the Committee of the whole Number of Persons that have been received at your Houses, and no Account of the Number of Patients that have been dismissed from your Houses as radically cured, upon what Ground did you say, in your former Examination, that you do not think you Should speak false, if you said, that Nine out of Ten, of those that had been put under your Care, within Three Months after they had begun to be afflicted with the Disorder, had recovered ?

My first Calculation and Observation, concerning the Numbers cured, was from my remarking that the first Fifteen were cured; and I had often recolledted, upon Retrofpedtion, that Ten had gone together, and that I very rarely milled curing any that I had so early under my Care i I mean radically cured.

Whether, from all the Circumstances Dr. Willis has stated, in his Answers to the preceding Questions, relative to the actual State of His Majesty’s Health, he has Reason to entertain Hopes of His Majesty’s more speedy Recovery, than when he was examined before the former Committee ?

Yes.

Upon what particular Grounds are those Hopes founded ?

Because every bad Symptom is abated — and His Majesty will attend to any Subject, in a much better Manner than I ever hoped He would do within this Period of Time.

Whether, in those Patients, who have been compleatly cured within Five or Six Months, a considerable Progress towards Acts of Convalescence has been eenerally made within the first Month ?

No.

Has the Progress now made in His Majesty’s Cafe, been as great, or greater, than has been usually made within the same Time in such Cases ?

I think greater.

In Dr. Willis's Answer to the Second Question put to him, when he was last examined before this Committee, why has he spoken less positively of the Certainty of His Majesty’s Cure, as at present situated, than he would of a Patient under the same Indifpo-fition in his House ?

On Account of His Station in Life, which requires more Attendance, and more Persons to fee His Majesty: Also, His Majesty’s Ideas of who He is, and the Feelings that His present Indisposition may occasion.

Whether Patients labouring under this Indisposition, whil$ under Dr. Willis's Care, are usually under such a Degree of Controul in his Presence, as to influence their Conversation and Behaviour ?

Very frequently.

Whether a Person, who has hot particularly dedicated himself to this Branch of Medicine, is able to form a certain Judgment of the State of the Mind of a Patient so afflicted, by seeing and conversing with such Patient only in the Presence of Dr. , or of any other Person who has acquired the same Degree of Influence over the Patient ?

Vol. XLIV.

anuarii. 5

Yes, if they converse with them for a Length of Time, and frequently.

Dr. Willis having said that he can give no Account of the Numbers who have been under his Care, he is desired to inform the Committee, as well as he can from Memory, what the Number may have been ?

They certainly amount to many Hundreds j I have? attended many in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire, who were not in my House.

Dr. Willis having said that his first Fifteen Patients were cured, and had often recollected, on Retrofpec-tien, that Ten had gone together; does he mean to say, that he had often recollected one Instance of Ten going together, or that he had recollected many Instances of Ten going together ?

Several Instances of Ten going away successively.

Does Dr. Willis mean that Ten Persons, who had come successively one after another, had all gone away cured, consequently that no one of those Ten had remained uncured ?

I mean that.

From Dr. Willis's Observations upon His Majesty since his Examination before the former Committee, is he confirmed or altered in his Opinion, that Weighty Business, severe Exercise, too great Abstemiousness, and little Rest, have contributed to occasion His Majesty’s present Complaint ?

Yes, confirmed.

From whence do you derive this Confirmation of your Opinion ?

From Quiet and the Effect of Tonic Medicines.

Whether those Circumstances which Dr. Willis has particularly mentioned in stating the Ground of his more favourable Hopes of His Majesty's Recovery, have been communicated or known to the other Physicians ?

I have told the Physicians my Opinion, and gave my Reasons for it, and have kept nothing a Secret from them. 1

Whether the Pills you mention to have been given His Majesty within these Eight Days, have been given upon your Suggestion ?

Yes.

Whethef you recollect if any Fill, with a Portion of Calomel in it, had been given a little before the Time of your former Examination ?

Yes; it was the First Night J Came, I believe it made Two Pills; and it was thought right that His Majesty Should have a Cathartic Draught the Morning after, in order to prepare Him for the Bark.

Whether the Calomel Pills were the Medicine which you alluded to, when, in your former Examination, you say “ that the Medicine given His Majesty ever “ firtce Sunday Morning, and intended to meet and xc counteract the Causes of His Majesty’s Malady, had “ had as much Effect as you could wilh ?”

The Pills and the Draught were, as 1 said before, preparative to His taking the Bark, which was the Medicine I alluded to.

Whether the Bark was given, at the Time alluded to, by yoUr Suggtftion ?

Yes.

Withdrew.

Doctor Ricbafd Warren again called in, and examined.

Dr. Warren desires the Two following Questions and Answers to be read; viz.

0^ " Whether Dr. Warren ever saw any Paper,

S purporting

1'

13° Januarii. A. 1789.

66

“ purporting to be % Copy of this Letter supposed to be written at Twelve o'Clock at Night; and if he “ did, by whom the same was shewn to him ?

A. “ I don’t recoiled that I ever saw a Paper “ purporting to be a Copy of it.

Qi. " Can Dr. Warren take upon himself to say* u that he never did fee any Paper, purporting to be a “ Copy of the Letter supposed to be written at Twelve o’Clock at Night ?”

A. “ No j 1 do not recoiled that I did.”

Dr. Warren then stated.

Late on Wednesday Night the Committee asked me, Whether I had not seen a Copy, or something that purported to be the Copy, of a Letter supposed to be written by Dr. Willis to Mr. Pitt, at Twelve o’Clock at Night, during the Debate on the Day of the First DiviGon in the House of Commons. I could not at that Time recoiled any Thing to which I could apply ' the Word “ Copybut the next Morning I recol-leded, that on my Arrival at Kew, the Day after I had heard the Rumour of such a Letter being written. Sir Lucas Pepys informed me, that he had a Message for me from the Prince of Wales, who had been at Kew the Night before, and had ordered him to deliver the Message to me when I should come the next Morning. Sir Lucas had taken the Message down in Writing, from his Memory, soon after the Prince left him. The Message was to desire me to enquire into the State of His Majesty’s Health at a particular Time, because the Prince had been informed, that a Letter had been written by Dr. Willis, stating, that the King was in a very good Way at that Time, when the Prince had understood that He really was not so, and then recited other Words of the supposed Letter, which I cannot recoiled. I do not remember that I took this Paper from Sir Lucas. I remember that, in talking about this Letter, I made use of the Word lt Copy,” when I ought rather to have said, that I had only seen an Account of the Letter in Writing. The First Account of such Letter being written, I learnt from Rumour; the next Information that 1 had of it was from the Message delivered to me by Sir Lucas Pepys.

Whether, in consequence of the Message delivered to Dr. Warren by Sir Lucas Pepys, he did, or did not, afterwards inform the Prince of Wales of the Enquiry which he had made, with relped to the Truth of the supposed Fad which was the Subject of that Message, and of the Circumstances which had taken place between Dr. Warren and Dr. , in consequence of that Enquiry ?

I did; and the next Day, or second Day after, I acquainted the Prince that I had done wrong with respect to Dr. Willis, as I could not find that any Letter had been written by him at the Time mentioned; that I must retract what I had said to Dr. , and acknowledge my Error. — He approved of my intended Conduct.

Is Dr. Warren still unable to name any other Person besides Sir Lucas Pepys, from whom he received Information that Dr. Willis had written the Letter in Question ?

I positively declare, that I do not know from whom I first heard the Report; and I paid very little Attention to it till I received the Message from Sir Lucas.

Had Dr. Warren, upon his last Examination, when he said that he did not recoiled from whom he received his Information, that the Letter mentioned in the former Question had been written, and said, that the Substance of the supposed Letter had been stated to him in general Terms, forgotten the Circumstance of

a Message having been delivered to him from the Prince of Wales by Sir Lucas Pepys upon that Subject, such as he has now stated ?

I declare positively, from the Fatigue of Examination, or some other Circumstance, I know not what, I could not recoiled it; I took Pains about it as soon as I left the Committee, and, as I was going to Kew the next Morning, I gradually made it out, and immediately determined to acquaint the Committee with it as soon as I had an Opportunity, though I knew it was at the Expence of appearing to have concealed the Truth the Night before.

When did Dr. Warren put in Writing what he had thus recollected on his Road to Kew ?

Soon after I got Home Yesterday.

Did Dr. Warren communicate this Paper to any Body before he read it to the Committee ?

I communicated it to my Brother this Morning; I read it to the Prince of Wales about Noon; I read it over with my Son this Afternoon.

Does Dr. Warren understand that the Prince of Wales, having heard the same Report which he (Dr. Warren) had heard before, desired Dr. through Sir Lucas Pepys, to enquire into thele contradictory Reports, as stated in the Message delivered by Sir Lucas Pepys ?

Yes.

Did the Prince of Wales direct Dr. Warren to take any further Measure, or to make any Communication to any other Person on the Subject ?

No. — I am not quite sure whether he did not desire me to (peak to the Chancellor upon it.

Whether Dr. Warren knows, or has any Reason to believe, that Dr. Willis has signed more favourable Accounts of the King’s Health than Dr. Willis believed to be true, though Dr. Warren differed in Opinion with him ?

I cannot possibly tell what Dr. Willis believes.

Question repeated.

I do not know; I cannot assign any Reason to believe it, but that it differs very much from my own Way of thinking.

Whether Dr. Warren has received any Advice, Counsel, or Command, from any Person, to represent the King’s Malady in a worse Condition than he found it ?

No.

From whom did Dr. Warren receive Directions, and to whom did he conceive himself accountable, in his Conduct and Attendance on His Majesty, while His Majesty remained at Windsor, since the Commencement of His present Malady ?

The Prince of Wales.

Did the Prince of Wales then take upon him to direct that the Orders, Advice, and Regulations of the Physicians Should be duly carried into Execution ?

Yes.

Whether, since the Order alluded to, forbidding any Person to go into the King’s Room, except introduced by Dr. Willis or his Son, Dr. Warren has continued to have such Means of Observation and Information as are sufficient to enable him to form an accurate Judgment upon the State of His Majesty’s Health ?

Yes.

Whether Dr. Warren has observed any Difference in His Majesty, at such Times as he has seen and conversed with His Majesty in the Presence of Dr. Willis or his Son, and at inch Times when neither of those Gentlemen were present ?

A very

49 Geo. III.

130 Januarii.

61

A very great Difference; when Dr. Willis or his Son are present, His Majesty is under great Awe; when they are absent. He talks and acts very differently.

Since the Order alluded to, has Dr. Warren seen His Majesty, except in the Presence of one of the Dr.

Willis's ?

Yesterday 1 desired Dr. John Willis to retire while I was with His Majesty, that I might observe the Difference of His Behaviour, and report it to the Committee, if required — Dr. Willis retired accordingly, and His Majesty immediately held a Language very different from that which He used while Dr. Willis was present.

Was any other Person in the Room besides Dr. Warren, when Dr. Willis retired ?

Two of the Pages.

Whether, notwithstanding the Order alluded to, Dr. Warren (till continues to think himself fully authorized to vilit His Majesty as often as he shall judge necessary, without either of the Dr. Willis's being present ?

I have made it a Rule, ever since Dr. Willis came, not to go in without asking the Doctor or his Son, whether it was a proper Time; but I should go in, notwithstanding that Order, if I thought there was a Necellity for it.

Whether Dr. Warren does not think, that it is in general discreet to alk Dr. , or his Son, whether the Time at which Dr. Warren proposes to go into His Majesty’s Room was a proper Time for that Purpose, supposing the re is ho particular Necessity for acting otherwise ?

Certainly.

Whether Dr. Warren has ever been present with His Majesty, when He has entertained Himself with reading ?

Yes.

Has it been for any considerable Space of Time, and upon a Subject which would require much Thinking?

1 have never seen him read more than a Line and an Half at a Time.

Has that been lately ?

The Third Time from hence that I was there — on Sunday last, I think.

Whether Dr. Warren thinks that the King’s Malady is less at those Times of reading than at any other Times ?

His Manner of reading, when I have been present, is a strong Proof of the Existence of His Malady.

Whether or no, the Patient suffering any Writings or Discourses to be read without Interruption, by Persons who have acquired any Influence over him, appears to Dr. Warren to be any Symptom of Conva-lefcence ?

No.

Whether or no, since the Commencement of the King’s Malady, the Physicians have employed whatever Succours the Rules of their Art, or their Experience, have suggested to them towards His Recovery ?

Yes.

Whether or no there are not certain Distempers fu-pervening on the original Malady, such as Fever, which are sometimes known to aid in the Cure of this Distemper ?

Yes.

Whether any Fever has come upon His Majesty since the Commencement of His Malady ?

Yes. ♦

Has the Disorder abated, in any remarkable Manner, in consequence of that Fever ?

No.

Has not His Majesty had frequent and refreshing Sleep from Time to Time ?

Yes.

Has not that been known to be of sovereign Use in the Cure of this Malady?

A Person sick in this Manner is not likely to get well without Sleep; but he may frequently have refreshing Sleep without advancing in his Cure.

How has it been in this same ?

Sleep has produced- no Advancement towards the Cure.

Has any rational Mode of Controul and Coercion been omitted ?

Not that I know of, since His Majesty came to Kew.

Whether any Progress towards a Cure has been observed in Consequence of this Controul ?

No.

What was the Method which the Physicians meant to pursue, in the Medical Treatment of His Majesty, immediately previous to the Arrival of Dr. Willis?

The Method that we had settled to pursue, was that of endeavouring to restore His Majesty to the best Bodily Health we could; to make His Constitution, if we possibly could, such a one as a healthy Man has-at Fifty. — We attempted to give His Majesty the Bark Twice, I believe, at Windsor, but some Circumstance arising, either from Fever, or some other Cause, prevented our going on with it. — It was determined, I think, just before Dr. Willis came, that the Bark Should be attempted again; but it was-postponed till the Arrival of Dr. Willis, that we might- talk with-him upon the Subject. — I carried Dr. to Kew

in my Chaifc, and gave him an Account of His Majesty’s Mode of Living, former Habits, and present Disease. — He agreed with me, that an Endeavour to restore the Constitution by the Bark, and occasionally adding some other Medicines, which we difeourfed about, was the most likely Way to restore His Majesty’s Health again. — His Majesty was immediately put under this Course.

Is Dr. Warren quite sure that the Return of the Use of the Bark, after Dr. Willis's Arrival, did not happen on the Suggestion of Dr. Willis ?

It did not happen on the Suggestion of Dr. Willis.

Whether the Medicines just stated by Dr. to have been used during the Period immediately preceding Dr, Willis's Arrival, were not of the Class called Tonics ?

I think they were not; but Medicines preparatory to the Use of the Bark.

Whether Tonics had not been used a ftiort Time previous to Dr. Willis's Arrival ?

I do not recoiled! any Tonic but Bark.

Whether the Bark itself is not of that Class of Medicines called Tonic ?

It is.

What new Medicines, not in the previous Intentions of the Physicians, were suggested by him, previous to the Time of his Examination before the former Committee ?

One of the first Things he proposed was Calomel.

What Benefits were had from the Calomel ?

None, with respect to the main Complaint.

Whether or no there has not been frequent Returns of Irritation since the Time of Dr. Willis's Attendance on the King.

Yes.

Were

68 13 ° Januarii.A. 1789.

Were the Returns of these Irritations owing to the ttfe of Blisters ?

Dr. Willis was of Opinion, and declared, that he never knew Blisters applied to the Legs of such a Patient without Benefit: The Blisters were applied* and, contrary to what happened when Blisters were applied before, produced much Soreness and Pain. The Pain undoubtedly made Hrs Majesty much more unquiet, increased the Necessity of Coercion, but did not appear to me to increase or diminish the grand Malady.

Whether or no Dr. Willis consented to the putting on of these Blisters, upon a Representation, that the King, when at Windsor, had been hardly sensible of Pain from them ?

That Circumstance was mentioned to Dr. , but I could not think it his Motive for consenting to the putting on of the Blisters, because he frequently talked of the great Benefit that Persons, afflict!ed like His Majesty, usually received from Blisters; and mentioned, if I mistake nor, his having cured a Perl'on by the Application of several Blisters at once.

Then there was no Persuasion used to induce Dr. Willis to consent to the Use of Blisters ?

No.

At. what Time, to the best of Dr. Warren's Recol-ledlion, were these Blisters used ?

I believe something more than Three Weeks ago.

Has there been any Irritation since the bliftcred Parts have been healed ?

1 am not quite sure that they are healed now, but certainly very near it.

Whether or no Dr. Warren has got the Account respecting the Proportion of Persons cured, who had been afflicted with the Disorder about the Age of Fifty ?

I have not got it — I will endeavour to get it before the Committee breaks up, if I possibly tan.

Whether Dr. Warren, in the Difference of Opinion which he had with Dr. on Friday the ad

Instant, told Dr. Willis that he should think no Person better, till they were perfedUy well, under such an Indisposition ?

No.

Do you recoiled! Dr. Willis's asking you, whether, if a Person so indisposed Should not say One sensible Word in Twenty-four Hours, and the next Twenty-four say but One Word, that he would not say if he was not indisposed, whether he would not think him better ? — and, if such a Question was put, did you answer to this, “ No” ?

I don’t recoiled! that that Question was so put, therefore can say nothing as to the Answer.

Do you recoiled! giving any Opinion upon that Subject, and what was it?

I stated to the Dodfor my Rule of determining whether Persons so indisposed had amended, which I mentioned in the former Part of my Examination, and the Opinion I gave on Recovery was founded on that Rule. I remember that the Doctrine of Recovery, as derived from what happens in a Fever, was declared by me, in Contradiction to Dr. , as inapplicable to the Disorder in Question.

Did you ever inform Dr. , that it was usual for Physicians to sign their Names to Statements of Fadts, which they are not sure are true and correct!, for the Sake of Agreement ?

No, nor to that Effect!.

Did you ever inform Dr. , that in such

Matters the Opinion of One should give Way to the

other Two, and that you wa6 surprized he should hesitate about it ?

No.

Did you ever endeavour, by any vehement Argument or Dispute, to induce Dr. Willis to sign his Name to any Account respecting the King’s State, contrary to his Opinion ?

I have endeavoured by Debate, but not by vehement Argument, to bring the Doctor over to my Opinion, but never to persuade him to act contrary to his own.

Do you consider yourself as responsible in your Charad!er to the Public, for the Truth of the Accounts sent to St. James's, provided you sign your Name ?

Yes, provided you do ndt mean the whole Truth.

Should you not consider the signing your Name to any such Account of the King s Health, tending to deceive the Public into a less favourable Opinion of His Majesty’s State than the Fad! warranted, in the same Point of View as giving Information tending to mislead this Committee ?

Yes.

If there has been ahy Error or Imperfedlion in the Accounts sent to St. James's, has it, in your Opinion, consisted in representing the King’s'State worse than it is ?

No.

When did Dr. Warren fee His Majesty last ?

Yesterday.

In what State did you then leave Him ?

No better than since the Commencement of His Disorder;

Whether, Dr. Warren having said, in Answer to a Question put to him by this Committee, that his Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery stand upon the same Foundation as they did when he was examined before, excepting that a little more Time has passed, which does not add to his Hopes, but is so little that it hardly ought to fubtrad! from them — that is Dr. Warren's Opinion, after attending duly to all the Circumstances which have been stated in his Examination now relative to supervening Fever, the Enjoyment of Sleep, the Use of Coercion and Controul, the frequent Returns of Irritation, the Efted! of Blisters, the Differences of Opinion between the Physicians, and all other Circumstances in His Majesty’s Cafe, which have come to the Knowledge, or fallen within the Observation, of Dr. Warren ?

Yes.

Whether or no, in Fad!, there has existed a Difference of Opinion respect!ing the Treatment of His Majesty’s Disorder ?

There has been no Difference of Opinion with respect! to His Medicines and Diet.

Whether Dr. Warren has ever known a same of so long Difficulty and Continuance, and where so many Physicians have attended, where there was less Difference of Opinion ?

No, with respect! to Medicines and Diet.

Whether Dr. Warren thinks that the Difference of Opinion, respect!ing the Signs of Convalescence, has tended to forward, or retard, the Cure, or to alter the Mode of Treatment ?

It has neither forwarded nor retarded the Cure, nor altered the Mode of Treatment.

Whether Dr. Warren,from the Beginning, has grounded his Hopes of His Majesty s Recovery, upon the Symptoms he has observed in His Majesty’s Cafe, or oo Calculations of the proportionate

Numbers

29 Geo. IIL 130 Januariu 69

Numbers cured to the Persons affected with this Malady ?

On the Calculations.

Whether there has been any Difference of Opinion among the Physicians attending His Majesty, on any Point, since the Commencement of His Majesty’s Disorder ?

Not with respect to Medicine and Diet. Some Difference of Opinion at , whether His Majesty was not going to recover, about the End of His Fever.

As Dr. Warren Hated that he believes he is correct in his Account of the Words used by Dr. ,viz. “ A certain Great Person will not suffer it to go so, and it will fall upon you,” and thought the Conversation material enough to put down a Memorandum of it as soon as he returned Home; Can he state how long it was after he left Kew before he got Home ?

I left Kew about Twelve, I believe, and got Home about Six.

Did Dr. Warren go strait Home ?

No, I went about my Business.

Whether Dr. Warren mentioned the Particulars of the Conversation to any Body before he put them down in his Memorandum ?

I did.

Withdrew.

Sabbatit io® die Januarii 1789.

The Reverend Doctor Francis Willis again called in, and examined.

Did Dr. Willis, when he spoke Yesterday concerning the Medicines which had been given to His Majesty between the Time of his former Examination and the Sunday preceding, mean to take upon himself to say positively, either that those Medicines had, or that they had not, been previously thought of by the other Physicians attending His Majesty ?

I think I said that they had been thought of.

Do you mean to take upon yourself to say, that of your own Knowledge, and in your own Presence, His Majesty has, within the last Fortnight, read several Pages of Books, making at the same Time what were, in your Opinion, good Remarks upon the Subject of them ?

Yes.

Whether, according to the Observations which your Experience has enabled you to make in Cafes such as that of His Majesty, the Patient’s reading, or suffering Books to be read, in the Manner in which His Majesty has done within this last Fortnight, is, or is not, a Circumstance which has, in Point of Fact, happened where the Patient has finally recovered ?

Yes, certainly, in several Cafes, and it is more particularly favourable in His Majesty’s, as, within the Space of Fourteen Days, or thereabouts. His Majesty could not attend or read at all.

Whether your Observation upon Cafes in which Recovery has been obtained, induces you to consider the Circumstance of a Patient having, from Time to Time, refreshing Sleep, as forming afolid Ground of Hope for Recovery I

It is necessary to know the Sleep that the Patient formerly, had required, to make the Comparison of any Effect.

Whether, from the Accounts which you have received of the Sleep which His Majesty formerly usually had, and comparing the Result of such Accounts with Vol. XLIV.

the refreshing Sleep which His Majesty has had, your Observations and Experience enables you to determine one Way or the other, whether the Circumstance of His Majesty’s having had such Sleep is a Ground to hope for Recovery ?

By comparing the Sleep His Majesty, I am told, formerly had, even after great Fatigue, I am inclined to think that His Majesty has, for these last Six or Seven Nights, had more Sleep than one could expect from a Person who has been used to so much Exercise, and has not been able of late to use any.

Whether His Majesty is, within the last Fortnight, more or less quiet than He was previous to the Time when you was examined before the former Committee ?

I can’t remember it; but there is a prodigious Difference indeed.

Whether, judging from adhial Experience, and from what has occurred in the same of Persons who have recovered from this Malady, you think that such Alteration as you mention in your Answer to the last Question, affords a solid Ground of Hope that His Majesty will recover ?

Yes, very solid Grounds; for indeed I don’t think His Majesty has One Symptom that ever attended an Incurable. I mean, that He may have Symptoms that Incurables have, but He has not Symptoms that mark an Incurable.

Can you, from your Experience, say whether His Majesty has any Symptoms that are never observed in Incurables ?

I can’t say.

Dr. Addington having said, in his Examination before the former Committee, that he had great Expectations that His Majesty’s Disorder Would end happily, from this Circumstance, “ That it had not for its “ Forerunner that Melancholy which usually precedes a tedious Illness of this Sort,” Does Dr. llis, judging from Facts and Experience, concur with Dr. Addington in those Expectations ?

Entirely.

Whether Dr. Willis and his Son have not, in Point of Fact, a greater Influence and Controul over His Majesty than any other of the Physicians who attend Him?

Certainly, much more so.

Whether Dr. Willis, judging from Facts and Experience, does, or does not, think it absolutely necessary, in order to bring about the Cure of His Majesty, that some Person attending His Majesty constantly should have and exert that Degree of Influence and Controul ?

Most certainly.

Whether Dr. Willis, judging from Facts and Expe-

rience, can say, that such irritations as His Majesty may have, when visited by Persons in the Absence of those that have this Degree of Influence and Controul, may, or may not, retard His Majesty’s Recovery ?

It certainly may retard it.

Whether that Effect must not depend on the Conduct of those Persons who visit His Majesty in the Absence of Dr. Willis ?

On their Conduct, if His Majesty fees them frequently in the Day, but if only Once in Two or Three Days, it will disturb His Majesty, by creating fresh Ideas.

Whether Dr. Willis is of Opinion, that the other Physicians who attend His Majesty, visiting His Majesty in the Manner they have done since Dr. Willis attended on His Majesty, can have the Effect of pro-

T ducing

7° 12° Januaru. . 1789.

ducing that Irritation, which Dr. Willis has said may retard His Majesty’s Recovery ?

I have thought that it frequently has had that

Effect.

Whether, supposing that Dr. attended One

Person in the Manner in which he now attends His Majesty, and had the Care of another Person, of whose same he should receive Accounts only-every other Morning, he thinks he could promote the Cure of His Majesty and such other Person in an equal Degree ?

The other Person would not have other People to visit him, and consequently to disturb him, and that therefore might possibly balance the Advantage of my seeing His Majesty every Day, or every Hour of the Day.

Whether you have Reason to believe, that, in Point of Fad, any Visit of any Physician to His Majesty has waked His Majesty while He was sleeping, or prevented His Majesty from going to sleep ?

I believe it has happened. Once in particular, His being prevented from going to sleep.

What Physician was it ?

It was Dr. Warren.

What Circumstances formed the Ground of Dr. Willis's Belief, that the Visit which he has referred to did prevent His Majesty from going to sleep ?

The Pages in Waiting, and the Attendants, assured me, that' His Majesty was going to sleep; by Observations I supposed they judged; from His Manner of dropping His Voice and Breathing.

Whether, previous to Friday last, Dr. Warren and the other Physicians had not usually consulted you about the Propriety of their going into His Majesty’s Room at the particular Time when they proposed to go in ?

Sometimes they have, and sometimes they have not.

At the Time you was informed that His Majesty had been prevented from going to sleep, did Dr. Warren consult you or your Son about the Propriety of his going into His Majesty’s Room at that Time ?

I told the Doctor I thought it was improper at that Time, because His Majesty had had a very bad Night, and had had just then Half an Hour’s Sleep, and the Pages thought He was just falling to sleep again.

Whether His Majesty’s State at that Time was such as, in your Judgment, to create any particular Ne-ceflity for Dr. Warren's going into His Majesty’s Room, after you had stated to him what you have mentioned in the foregoing Answer ?

I knew of none — as Coercion seemed to be the only Thing necessary if His Majesty could not rest.

When you stated to Dr. Warren the Objection before mentioned — whether you can recoiled what Answer Dr. Warren gave you ?

When Dr. Warren went into the Pages Room, Mr.

Braund or Mr. Compton, the Pages, delired Dr. Warren not to go in, in my Presence } and he said to them, as he had done to me, that he must go in, for he was a Spy upon them all.

Are you positive that Dr. Warren gave that Answer ?

I am very positive.

Are you positively sure that those were the very Words which Dr. Warren made use of, or do you only mean to state the Effect and Substance of Dr. Warren's Words on that Occasion ?

The very Words j which the Pages have mentioned many Times since.

Will you inform the Committee upon what Day this Conversation passed ?

I cannot say, but it is down in a Journal.

When did you put this down in the Journal ?

That Day.

Did you shew that Part of the Journal which contains the Account of this Matter to the Two Pages that you have mentioned, or either of them ?

I have not.

Whether you mean to admit and avow that you have signed Reports of His Majesty’s State of Health, proposed to be sent to St. James's, which contained less favourable Accounts of His Majesty’s Health, than you think might have been given to the Public, if the whole Truth had been told them ?

To be sure 1 have signed such as I would not have sent to any Relation of a Patient that I was concerned for in the like Situation.

Would the Accounts, which you would have sent to the Relations of other Patients, have been more or less favourable Accounts than those which have been sent to St. James's ?

More favourable, in general.

Would it have been confident with the whole Truth, in His Majesty’s Cafe, to have given more favourable Accounts in general ?

In my Opinion, more confident.

Will you date to the Committee, what were your Motives for giving less favourable Accounts than might have been given in general, confident with the whole Truth.

As it did not affect His Majesty’s Health, or the Cure of His Majesty, I signed them rather than have any Dispute about Words.

Do you mean to assert, that in your Conscience you are fully persuaded that you now speak the Truth, when you say, that more favourable Accounts of His Majesty’s State might have been given, in general, in the Report sent to St. James's ?

I do assert it.

Whether you ever signed any Paper, at the Request of Dr. Warren, relative to the Transaction of that Day, in which you have been informed that Dr. Warren had prevented His Majesty from sleeping?

I did sign a Paper, by the Desire of Dr. Warren, and the Persuasion of Sir Lucas , that Dr.

Warren, as far as I knew, did not go into the Room and wake His Majesty — But I did not sign any Paper, signifying that he did not go in at any Time, when it was thought he might prevent His Majesty’s sleeping.

Whether, at the Time that you gave this Paper to Dr. Warren, you informed Dr. hat you would

not sign any Paper, acknowledging that Dr. Warren had not prevented His Majesty from going to sleep, but that you would only sign a Paper, stating thac Dr. Warren had not waked His Majesty ?

The Paper was offered to me, and I refused to sign it, if it contained any Thing to the Purpose, that Dr. Warren did not go into His Majesty’s Room at a Time when it was probable he might prevent His Majesty going to sleep.

By whom was that Paper drawn up and tendered to

you ?

By Dr. Sir Lucas Pepys.

Are Accounts, usually sent by you to the Relations of your Patients, conceived in as general Terms as those which have been sent to St. James's ?

I fend the Relations Word that they are better, or

worlei

1

29 Geo. III. 13° Janu71

worfej and mention some Particulars — but then that is not often above Once a Fortnight.

Can you recoiled, positively, whether, in the Convention which you had with Dr. Warren Yesterday Sevennight, you did, or did not, ask Dr. Warren, if a Person indisposed Should not say One sensible Word in Twenty-four Hours, and the next Twenty-four Should say but One Word, that he would not say if he was not indisposed, whether Dr’. Warren would not think him better; and whether you can, or cannot, say positively, that Dr. Warren answered. No ?

I can say positively, as well as I can recollect, that Dr. Warren said No, to the Question so put; and I believe the Bystanders remember the fame.

Whether, in the same Conversation, you can, or cannot, say positively, whether you did, or did not, make use of the following ExprelTion to Dr.

rt A certain Great Person will not suffer it (meaning “ the Report) to go so, and it will fall upon you ?”

It was not in the same Room, or at the same Time. — I did say so, or something of that Sort, when the Report was drawn up for me to sign, saying, at the same Time, “ Why Should we fend up what will be “ sent down to be altered ?”

Will you explain to the Committee by whose Authority you so laid, and what your Meaning was in those Words ?

Presuming that the Personage would know from the Pages how His Majesty had passed the Day and Night,

I thought it was not right to fend up a Report which that Personage would not think equal to His Majesty’s present State of Health.

Was that your Meaning in the Words which y6u actually used in that Conversation ?

Entirely so.

What did you mean by the Words, “ it will fall of upon you?”

Sir George Baker, the Day before, when His Majesty had not been quite so well, nor had so good a Night, had made a more favourable Report, and therefore I concluded that Personage must think this Report arose from Dr. Warren.

Did Dr. Warren ever inform you, that he ha*d made a written Memorandum of that Conversation, or of any Part of it, or desire you to explain yourself upon the Subject of it ?

Not that I know of — I don’t remember any such Thing.

Do you remember any Order having been put up in the Pages Room, Yesterday Sevennight, or upon any other Day, directing that no Persons Should be admitted into His Majesty’s Room, without the Knowledge of you or your Son ?

I wrote it, and put it up myself.

What was the Reason of your writing, and putting up, such Order ?

Because sometimes a Physician, sometimes a Surgeon, or an Apothecary (for there are Four concerned — I mean Two Surgeons, and Two Apothecaries) did go into the Room, as I thought, at improper Times, and disturb His Majesty; — and, as I thought it my Duty to do to His Majesty what I should think it my Duty to do for any private Gentleman, \ wrote that Order.

Did you put up that Order of your own Authority, and for the Reasons you have now mentioned; or had you any other Authority for putting up that Order, from any Person, and whom ?

The Lord Chancellor ordered me to do that which should prevent any Body’s going into the Room

without my COnfent, and was not pleased that I had not done it before.

Had you explained to the Chancellor your Reasons for thinking that it would be proper, with respect to His Majesty’s Health, that such an Order Should be given ?

I suppose I did, in Conversation, think it necessary that People Should be prevented from going in and disturbing His Majesty.

Have any of the Physicians, who attended His Majesty, suggested any Complaints to you, that such Order has prevented them from seeing His Majesty at proper Times ?

I don’t remember that they have.

Have any other Persons suggested to you, that they have, been prevented from seeing His Majesty ?

I don’t remember that they have.

Did you ever inform the Physicians, that any Persons had improperly ^intruded into His Majesty’s Apartment ?

I don’t remember that I did.

When did the Lord Chancellor give you the Directions, in consequence of which you put up that Paper ?

I really don’t remember the Time; but, more than once, the Chancellor has mentioned the Necessity of keeping any Persons from going into His Majesty’s Room without some Limitation.

Do you know upon what Grounds the Chancellor thought it necessary to repeat the Necessity of this Precaution ?

I can't remember; it was in Conversation, 1 suppose.

Are you quite sure you cannot recollect when, or where, you had the last Conversation with the Chancellor on this Subject, before you put up that Order ?

I am very sure I can’t fix the Time, but I believe the Place was my own Room at Kew.

Was it before, or after, the Dispute with Dr. Warren, on Friday the 2d Instant ?

I believe before. I don’t know that I have seen the Chancellor since Friday the 2d Instant.

Was it a Day or Two before, or long before ?

I do not remember at all} nor do I remember whether it was the last Time I talked with the Chancellor.

Have you any Memorandum, relative to this Fact, in your Journal ?

Yes.

When did you make that Memorandum?

The very Morning; within a Quarter of an Hour.

On what Day was it that you wrote and put up that -Order ?

I don’t know. I believe the Order itself is dated, but I am not sure. The Journal will ascertain the Date.

Have you kept a regular Journal of Occurrences since you attended His Majesty at Kew ?

I have, from about the 6th or’7th Day, I believe, of my Attendance.

Is that Order up now ?

1 believe so. Sir Lucas Pepys said he saw it Yesterday Morning.

When His Majesty read a Page or Two, and made very good Remarks upon it, whether the Books and the Pages were of His Majesty’s own Selection, or 5 whether

whether they were put into His Hands, and pointed out by you ?

Particularly by His own Selection.

Whether, at the Time, His Majesty read the Pages aloud, to be heard by Dr. Willis, or tohimself?

Aloud; nor could I know, if he did not read aloud.

Whether His Majesty has done this Once, Twice, or several Times'? *

Many Times in a Day, as I understand; and on more Days than One in the last Six or Seven Days.

I have now been absent a great Part of several Days.

Can you remember the last Time you heard His Majesty read One or Two Pages ?

Last Night He did.

Did you hear Him yourself last Night ?

Yes.

Whether you have observed, in your Attendance on His Majesty, that His Eye-fight is at all affected by His present Malady ?

Not that I know of.

Whether, when you or your Son was not present, you have been informed by any of the King’s Physicians, Surgeons, or Apothecaries, that His Majesty has read with Attention, and remarked with Judgment, upon the Objedfs which He had read ?

I think I have heard so by Dr. Pepys; but I think I have heard from several Persons that they have, at Times.

What State was His Majesty in this Morning ?

I came away before He was up.

What State was His Majesty in going to Bed last Night ?

Very quiet.

Whether His Majesty continued, to thfc Time of His going to Bed, to shew Signs of the same Attention and Power of Reflection, as in the Instance of reading in the Manner mentioned by you ?

Yes, to the Time I left Him, which was about Half part Ten; and I understood from the Pages, that He went to Bed immediately after.

Whether any Thing of a contrary Nature was intermixed, during the Time you was with His Majesty Yesterday Evening?

1 can’t say there did.

Whether you observe that the King’s Mind is in a better State in the Evening before He goes to Bed, or in the Morning ?

1 think His Majesty is never so well in a Morning getting up, nor for an Hour afterwards.

How long was you with His Majesty Yesterday Evening ?

I believe, in all, about One Hour and a Half; but I went several Times out of the Room.

Whether any other Physician or Medical Person has been in the Room when His Majesty has either read, or attended to reading, in your Presence ?

I think Dr. Pepys was Twice; I am not sure whether there was any other; I am not sure whether Dr. Gijlornev/zs in the Room last Night, while His Majesty was reading.

Whether at any, and at what, Distance of Time after H is Majesty has read, or attended to reading, in the Manner described. His Majesty has conversed with you on the Subjects He has either read or heard read ?

Very frequently, sometimes several Hours; for I believe His Majesty never forgets what He reads.

Whether, on any subsequent Day, His Majesty has conversed with you upon what has been before read ?

Several Days after; and I think His Majesty can give as good an Account of any Book, or Subject in a Book, that He has read, either since His Illness or before, as to the Morality and Truth of it, as most People can, I think.

Whether you have found it necessary to use Coercion more or less frequently within the last Fortnight, than you did in the preceding Fortnight ?

Much less frequently, and not now for nearly a Week.

Are you, upon Recollection, sure of this Fatt?

I am sure of it.

Whether the Circumstance of His Majesty’s having read, and attended to reading as above stated, is, in your Opinion, a clear and decisive Symptom either of Convalescence actually approaching, or of a very speedy Recovery ?

I look upon it at the Time as Convalescence itself, and certainly a Sign of His Majesty’s Recovery; but I won’t pretend to say how soon.

What do you consider as Convalescence ?

Acting properly upon the Business you are engaged in.

Whether the rcfreshing Sleep His Majesty has had, has been natural Sleep, or Sleep procured by Medicine or other Means ?

No Medicine has been ordered for the Purpose, and no Means but that of having His Majesty go to Bed as quietly as you can.

Whether any other Physician attending His Majesty has ever suggested to you the Idea of pleasing or displeasing any Great Personage, as a Motive to induce you to sign any Report of His Majesty’s Health, more or less favourable than the actual Circumstances then warranted in your Opinion ?

I know not of any such.

Whether, during the favourable Intervals in which you have observed His Majesty, you have remarked that His Majesty had reflected upon the Nature of His Illness ?

At some Times I think He has, but rather seems to avoid hinting any Thing of it.

Have you observed that it has depressed His Spirits, so as.to retard His Cure ?

I can’t suppose that it has retarded His Cure or depressed His Spirits, for I am not sure that He is sensible of it — -He only hinted at it.

Are you sure His Majesty will recover ?

It would be presumptuous for any Man to say he was sure, in the same of any One whatever, or in any Disorder.

What Degree of Confidence or Hope have you upon the Subject ?

I have the greatest Hopes, from what I have already seen of His Majesty’s Amendment.

Have you any Doubt of His Recovery ?

I must doubt of every Thing that has not come to pass.

Is your Confidence such as to say you scarcely entertain a Doubt ?

It is.

Then that is now the State of your Mind upon that Subject ?

I have already said so.

In Answer to a Question before put to you, “ Whe-

ther.

73

zg Geo. III. 130 Januani,

“ ther, the several Circumstances of His Majesty’s Cate, which have fallen under your Observation, *« or come to your Knowledge* being duly attended *« to, you in your Conscience think that the Chance *« of His Majesty’s Recovery is greater, or less, or as good, as it Was when you was examined before “ the former Committee ?*’ Whether you remember having answered “ Much greater ?”

I did say so, and I say so still.

Whether you recollect this Question being put to you by the former Committee, and your Answer upon it:

“What Hopes has Dr. Willis of His Majesty's. f* Recovery ?”

I have great Hopes of His Majesty's Recovery. *f If it were any other Person but His Majesty, I “ should scarce entertain a Doubt: When His Majesty reflects upon an lllness of this Kind, it may *f depress His Spirits, and retard His Cure, more. than a common Person” i

I do.

Dr* Willis having, in his former Examination, declared his Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery to be such, that if His Majesty was a common Person, he Should scarce entertain a Doubt} but that His Majesty’s reflecting upon an lllness of that Kind' might depress His Spirits, and retard His Cure more than a common Person and Dr. Willis having now stated to the Committee, that he has no Reason to think that His Majesty’s Spirits have been depressed, or His Cure retarded, by His having reflected upon His Ijl-ness, or that He has so reflected; and having stated also to this Committee, that he has, in his Conscience, Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery, much greater than he had when he was examined before the former Committee t Dr. Willis is deftred to say, what that Confidence is, which is much greater, with respect to His Majesty's Recovery, than a State of Mind which scarcely entertains a Doubt f

As in the same of a common Patient, the Symptoms are greatly abated, and therefore greater Hopes of His Recovery. As to His particular Station in Life, from my Knowledge of His Majesty’s Sense of Religion, I have greater Hopes that He will, with a proper Resignation, reflect upon what it has pleased God to have affii&ed Him with.

Then do you mean that the Committee should understand that your Apprehensions, with respect to the Consequences of His Majesty’s reflecting upon His lllness, are not the same as when you was examined before the former Committee ?

They are not so great, for the Reason I have given.

Whether Dr. Reynolds was not by at the Convention between you and Dr. Warren, in which you used the Words, it will fall upon you ” ?

Possibly he might j I believe he was.

Did Dr. Reynolds join in the Objection made by Dr. Warren to the proposed Alteration in the Report which was then in Question ?

Dr. Reynolds said nothing} and I have been used a good deal to stand alone in that Sort of Confutation.

Did you hear from Dr. Reynolds at that Time, or afterwards, that Dr. Reynolds did agree to the Alteration proposed ?

1 don’t remembey any Thing of it.

Withdrew.

Vol. XLIV.

Luna, ta* die Janudril 1789.

The Reyerend Doctor Francis Willis again Called in, and examined.

Whether, when you signed Accounts, at the De* . lire of Dr* Warren, and by the Persuasion of Sir Luca.s Pepys, less favourable than the Circumstances

of the King’s Health would have warranted-, you thought that Difference to be a mere Dispute about Words?

I signed no Account, that I know of, by Sir Lucas Pepys' Persuasion — what I signed by his Persuasion was, that Dr, Warren had not waked His Majesty;.

Whether you did at any Time, or at any Person’a Desire or Persuasion, sign Reports less favourable than the Truth would have warranted, concerning the State of His Majesty's Health ?

Not by any Persuasion, that I know of, but in my own Mind, rather than have any Dispute about it. ’

Was it to prevent a Dispute originally, or to put an End to the Continuance of a Dispute ?

As it did not at all respect His Majesty’s Cure, and we had had Disputes about Words before, I did not then think it worth while to have any for the future.

Do you think that the Truth or Ealfehood of a Report, signed by the King’s Physicians, for the Information of His Subjects, to be of no more Consequence than a Dispute about Words ?

It really struck me so then, and I am not at all affected with it now.

Whether or no you have not given to Her Majesty, and to the Ladies who have the Honour to be about Her Person, more exact Accounts, according to your Opinion, and of a more consolatory Nature ?

1 have always given them the Truth, to the best of my Opinion.

Whether those Accounts were in FaCfc of a more fa* vourable Nature?

The Report that was made to the Public, is from the Appearance of His Majesty in the Morning, when the Symptoms have ever been less favourable; the Accounts to the Ladies attending Her Majesty have been frequently in the Day, and therefore, taking the whole Account of the 24 Hours, it must appear much more favourable.

Is it true, that the Report sent to James's does only include the State of His Majesty’s Health as it appears in the Morning, and does not extend to the Night and the preceding Evening and Day ?

It enters into no Particulars of any, except quiet or disturbed State, and Sleep, and that in stating the Whole together j it cannot be so particular as those given to Her Majesty every Hour concerning His Majesty’s Health, which She must be very anxious to enquire after.

Question repeated.

I think several Times the Report might have said, that His Majesty had passed several Hours, the preceding Day, in many Respects better than He had done the Day before. As far as quiet, or not quiet, the Account does include what passed in the preceding Evening and Day — it would not be particular enough to satisfy me whether He was either better or worse.

Whether, taken as a general Report, without en-

U tering

74 i 3° Janu1789.

tcring into Particulars, it is more or less favourable to the State of the King’s Health than the Truth would warrant ?

To the best tff my Judgment, less favourable.

Is it, then, less favourable than the general Result which might be drawn from all the Circumstances of the different Accounts which you give to the Ladies attending Her Majesty ?

Yes, I think it is.

On what Occasion, and for what Purpose, did you sign the Certificate relative to the Transaction of that Day, in which you was informed that Dr. Warren had prevented His Majesty from (leeping ?

A good-natured Purpose, and on the Paper being offered me to sign, and being allured that it would hurt Dr. Warren's Character if I did not.

At the Time of signing that Certificate, did you explain to Dr. Warren,or Sit Lucas or to any other Person then present, the Distinction and Refer-vation which you have now mentioned to this Committee ?

Yes, very particularly to both Dr. Warren and Sir Lucas Pepys — Whether any Body else was by I do not remember.

Whether you called in any of the Physicians attending on His Majesty, or the Surgeons or Apothecaries, or any other Persons than those of your own Family and the Pages, to be Witness of the Circumstances which you have described as appearing on Friday Evening last ?

I did not.

Whether your Purpose, in excluding any Persons from coming to His Majesty, except by your own Per-miftion, does not arise from an Apprehension that the Appearance of such Persons might excite troublesome Emotions ?

Very certainly.

Whether you have ever consulted the Registers of public Hospitals, or other Houses for the Reception of Patients labouring under this Malady ?

I never did. Hospitals take in Patients, and call them thus indisposed. Numbers of them have been foindisposed for Years, perhaps, and they do not give you any Account of the particular Symptoms of the Malady when taken into the Hospital.

As Dr. Willis has said, that the Circumstance of Persons going into His Majesty’s Room may excite troublesome Emotions; whether his Experience enables him to say that such Emotions do, or do not, in general Cafes, retard the Cure of the Patient ?

In my Opinion, very much.

Will you inform the Committee, whether, after duly attending to every Circumstance which you have related to the Committee, and all other Circumstances which have fallen under your Observation, or have come to your Knowledge, respecting His Majesty’s Cafe, and judging from Fatts and Experience derived from your own Practice, you have, or have not, greater Hopes of His Majesty’s Recovery than when you was examined before the former Committee ?

Much greater Hopes.

Whether the State of the Weather, or the Season of the Year, has any Effect upon Patients labouring under this Disorder ?

The State of the Weather, preventing His Majesty from taking Exercise, and keeping up a proper Perfpi-ration, in my Opinion, has had a Tendency to retard His Majesty’s Recovery.

Has His Majesty taken any Exercise from the Time of your Attendance on Him ?

None, for about a Month; before that Time I think He walked out Twice.

Withdrew.

Doctor Gijborne again called in, and examined.

Was you at Kew on Friday Night last ?

Yes.

Whether you saw the King in the Course of that Evening ?

Yes.

At about what Hour ?

From 8 to 10, I think.

Did you play at Piquet with the King ?

Yes.

Did the King play in a steady recolledled Manner ?

Moderately so.

Did He play as a Man in mental Health would play ?

Certainly not so well as that.

Were there, in the Course of Play, frequent Signs of the Continuance of His Majesty’s Disorder?

I have said, in Answer to a former Question, that the material Changes in His Majesty’s Situation, I, think, are a better State of Health, and more Quietness in His Manner. I think that is an Answer. There were Signs of the Continuance of His Majesty’s Disorder.

Whether you was present at any reading with His Majesty ?

No, He did not read while I was present.

Have you at any Time observed, that your goiag into His Majesty’s Room has been a Cause of any Irritation ?

I think less with me than with others.

Do you know that the going in of any of His Majesty’s Physicians, other than Dr. Willis, or the going in of Surgeons or Apothecaries, has been a greater Cause of Irritation than the going in of Dr. Willis or his Son ?

I think those He fees the oftenest irritate Him the least.

Was you present at the Time when Dr. H'iUis seemed to impute a Disturbance of His Majesty to the imfeasonable going in of Dr. Warren ?

I remember Dr. Willis’s saying, he thought the going in of us together irritated His Majesty.

Were you ever present when Dr. Willis did at any Time impute to Dr. Warren, his having gone in so as to prevent His Majesty’s sleeping?

I don’t remember his saying so.

Withdrew.

Doctor Warren again called in, and examined.

Have you seen the King Today ?

Yes.

In what State did you find His Majesty this Morning, and what Account had you of the anteceding Day ?

I found His Majesty in a very irritated State this Morning, and was informed that He has had, in the Whole, but Five Hours Sleep in the Three last Nights — that having had no Sleep at all, or very little, the Night before last, it was proposed to give Him something last Night to compose and quiet Him — such a Medicine was written down, but was not given Him.- — It was proposed YesterJay to carry His Majesty

29 Geo. III. 136 Januarii. 7$

jesty out to take the Air — I was not informed that this was mentioned in the Consultation in the Morning, but I was informed by Dr. Willis, that His Majesty’s Pulse was Yesterday 120 in a Minute — I was likewise informed that He had lain all Night under Coercion, and had sweated a great deal. Some prudent Person advised His Majesty Should not be carried out to take the Air — I have Reason to think that the Pulse became quieter in the Course of the Day. — I found it this Morning between 106 and 108 in a Minute, and observed Marks of Fever on His Majesty’s Tongue. Dr. John Willis told me that he had promisea to carry His Majesty out Today, and desired me to consider, whether the not complying with His Expectations might not irritate Him a great deal. — I was sorry that He had had Rich a Promise; I was ne-ccffitated to take the least of Two Evils, and advised that His Majesty Should not be carried out, the Thermometer being 17, as I am informed, below the freezing Point} and particularly, as Dr. Willis has always observed, that keeping the Pores open always does His Majesty great Good. His Majesty this Morning suffered me to come from Him with great Difficulty, and could not easily be prevailed upon by me to let go my Hand.

When did you fee His Majesty Jaefore ?

The Day before Yesterday — on Saturday Morning.

In what State was He then ?

His Majesty had some Fever then — Pulse between 80 and 90, I believe, but was very irritable; could not be kept to the same Object for any Space of Time — tried to play at Cards with me, but could not, and shewed many strong Marks of His Distemper.

Whether you have ever observed, upon your going in to His Majesty, that His Majesty’s Irritation was increased by your Presence, and whether He has shewn any Signs of Dislike to you ?

His Majesty in general receives me with Eagerness — thinks He has something peculiar to say to me, and frequently proposes to confer Favours upon me} He has done so this Morning,

Whether His Majesty has ever shewn any Signs of Dislike towards you ?

Not lately} but His Majesty sometimes mixes Marks of Dislike with Marks of Favour; but in general those of Favour are greatly predominant.

Since what Time have you chiefly observed Marks of Favour to predominate ?

I don’t recoiled any Mark of Disfavour at any particular Time. I was in great Disfavour at — it continued for some Time after His Majesty came to Kew — it began to diminish soon after Dr. Willis came} I gradually grew into great Favour, and remain so at present, excepting that sometimes He has found Fault with me for bringing Him from but

at another Time told me, I did right in bringing Him from Windsor -, and perhaps found some other Faults, but not lately, that I know of — This is the Progress, to the best of my Recolledlion.

Have you heard that His Majesty has been more irritated by the coming in of His Majesty’s ordinary Physicians. Surgeons, or Apothecaries, in a greater Degree than by the coming in of Dr. Willis and his Sons ?

Not that I know of; I have never been so informed.

Whether the Presence of any Object, which tends to excite strong Emotions in His Majesty's Mind, is favourable, or otherwise, to His Recovery ?

Unfavourable.

Has there, in Fad, been any Introduction of Persons, to your Knowledge, which had a Tendency to

excite such Emotions, and to produce such Irritations ?

Yes. — I Should like to give an Account of the First Consultation we Ind with Dr. Willis. — The Day that I introduced Dr. Willis to the King, I summoned the rest of His Majesty’s Physicians to a Consultation at my House. — It was there first settled as a Principle, that Quiet of Body and Mind were to be endeavoured to be obtained by every Means possible; and that every Thing Should be carefully kept from His Majesty that might tend to prevent this desirable Acqui-fition. — It was settled that a regular Coercion Should be made use of — that every Thing Should be kept from His Majesty that was likely to excite any Emotion — that though His Majesty had not shewn any Signs of an Intention to injure Himself, yet that it was absolutely necessary, considering the sudden Impulses to which His Distemper subjects People, to put every Thing out of the Way that could do any Mif-chief. — To all this Dr. Willis assented — yet the very next Day he put a Razor into His Majesty’s Hand, and a Penknife. — When I saw the Doctor next, I asked him how he could venture to do such a Thing — he said, he shuddered at what he had done. — As he made use of this Expression, I did not think it necessary to say much to him upon the Subject. — On the 12th of December, as I apprehend, the King took a

Walk in the Garden, and some of the Royal Children were shewn to him — this produced a considerable Emotion, which was accompanied with Acts demonstrating that Emotion, as I was informed, to the best of my Memory, by Mr. Keate. — notwithstanding this Effect of seeing the Children, Dr. Willis, the next Day, introduced that Person, whose great and amiable Qualities we all know mult necessarily make Her the dearest and tenderest Object of His Majesty’s Thoughts: — The Interview was Short: His Majesty was soon afterwards in a great State of Irritation, and the strict Coercion was, 1 believe, for the first Time, actually applied that Night — the Blisters were put on that Night likewise. The next Time that I saw Dr. Willis, I spoke to him upon this Subject with some Degree of Sharpness, because it was contrary to my Opinion, and contrary to what had been settled in Confultation} for it had been settled, that whatever could be done by Deliberation, Should be referred to Consultation; that the Conduct of His Majesty, in the interior Room, Should be left to Dr. Willis's Dif> cretion, because it did not admit of Deliberation. — I don’t know that I convinced the Doctor that his Opinion was wrong, but that the Act was contrary to what was laid down in Consultation could not be denied. — I was always considered, by the highest Authority, as the First Physician, and therefore thought myself particularly responsible: I thought myself obliged to look into, and to enquire after every Thing that related to His Majesty: I did not suppose myself in a different Situation upon the Arrival of Dr. Willis, and therefore took the Liberty of speaking to him with some Degree of Authority. — I remember, when his Three Attendants arrived, I sent for them into the Physicians Room, examined them very carefully, particularly as to the Temper with which they conducted themselves towards those whom they attended, and spoke to them, as they were Strangers to me, in such a Manner as to let them know that their Conduct would be strictly observed. — My being First Physician made me talk to Dr. Willis about every Thing that I heard of, that did not appear to me to be quite accurate, and sometimes led to Disputes. — I informed the Doctor, that he was there in a double Capacity, as Physician, and Attendant on His Majesty in the interior Room — that I mull take my Share in directing whatever related to Him in the Capacity of Physician, though I Should not interfere with respect to the Conduct of His Majesty in the interior Room. —

Not

76 >3* 5

Not many Days after this Transaction I observed a Book in His Majesty’s Hands, which affected me much, and immediately determined me to bring a Charge against Dr. Willis, for what I thought bad Practice. I do not mean to bring the Story this Book as a Fault, because I believe there was no Intention to convey such a Book to His Majesty: It was the Play of King Lear, not in a Volume of -Jpeare, but it was a corrected , by Colman, and mixed with his Plays. I can have no Reason to think, that Dr. Willis could suspect that such a Play was in that Volume. 'His Majesty told me that Dr. Willis brought him the Book, and Dr. Willis did not deny it, when I spoke to him on the Subject. — I don't bring this as a Fault, but it was the Circumstance that determined me to put in Execution what I had been thinking of before, with respect to Dr.; for His Majesty’s Observation on the Book affected me strangely. I carried an Account of this to the Prince of Wales, and he desired me, as he had done in every same of Difficulty that had happened, from the Beginning of the Illness, to lay the Affair before the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor went to Kew, 1 believe; and the Result was, when I saw the Lord Chancellor, that the Rules of the Consultation Should be strictly obeyed. — Dr. Willis has, a Second Time, introduced the same great and amiable Person.

I was informed, that some Degree of Irritation came on in the Night; but having collected, as 1 thought, from several small Circumstances, that the Power of introducing Persons to His Majesty was to be left entirely to Dr. Willis, 1 did not make any Complaint about it.

Can you ascertain the Time of the last Interview ?

I cannot.

What Time of Day was the first Interview ?

I apprehend the first Interview was in the Evening — and that the Interview happened, not only without confuting His Majesty’s Physicians collectively, but that Dr. Gijborne, who was in the House that Evening, and fitting in the Anti-Chamber when the Introduction took Place, was not consulted upon the Occasion.

Do you know who were present at the Interview ?

I think I was informed, Dr. Gijborne was in some Part of the Time, if not all.

How soon after the Interview did His Majesty’s State of Irritation take Place ?

I cannot tell, but 1 apprehend a little before, or soon after, He went to Bed: I do not know the exact Time of the Interview.

Had you any particular Account of that Interview, or of the Effect which it produced at the Time ?

If 1 mistake not, Dr. Willi informed me it lasted about Five Minutes — that, during that Five Minutes, every Thing passed agreeably, but that something was then said, that induced Dr. to put an End to

the Visit.

Had you any Account of the Circumstances or Motives which led to that Interview ?

I had no Account previous to the Interview. — Afterwards, in talking upon the Subject with Dr. Willis, he mentioned his Motives, or Reasons, for thinking the Interview would be of Service; which 1 could not agree to.

Whether you recollect the Circumstances which attended your waiting upon His Majesty, upon a particular Day, concerning which it has been since said, that you prevented His Majesty from going to sleep?

I never could accurately learn what Day was fixed — I have only had a Suspicion of the Day. — I wish to have a Day fixed, that I may meet the Charge.

Was there any Day on which Dr. seemed to

anuariu . 1789.

be peculiarly solicitous to prevent, or delay* your going in to the King ?

1 do not recoiled any such Day.

Do ydu recollect any Converfatlort you had With Dr. Willis concerning the King's being asleep, dr disposed to sleep, at a Time when you was going in , to His Majesty ?

I remember a Morning When Dr. Willis said, His Majesty had had a bad Night, which I' myself had been acquainted with by asking the Page, as I passed by the King’s Anti-Chamber, the Door of which I opened as 1 was going into the Physicians Room. — *

In the Physician’s Room I mentioned that I had learnt the King had had a Very bad Night, but was then fallen asleep*- — I fat down, and what Discourse passed between me and Dr. Willis then, about the Night, I don’t know — “a few Words only. — The Doctor soon went out of the Room, and when he returned, said,

“ That the King was not sleeping, for that He spoke.'*

— I got up, the attending Physician of the Day with me, and walked towards Dr. went together

through the Anti-Chamber ;*--when I arrived at the Door of His Majesty’s Bed-Room, Dr. Willis said,

“ You may open the Door,” a Circumstance that I don’t recoiled ever to have happened to me before — somebody else generally opening the Door; — when 1 opened it, I found that the Room was dark — I stepped forwards very slowly; as fooh as I had gone the Width of the Door I was visible to His Majesty* The Door being open. His Majesty immediately ad* dressed himself very pointedly to me, saying, I am glad to fee you,” and adding His Wilh to be relcafed from the State He was then In, which was a State of Coercion. I hefuated; went one Step back to look for Dr. Willis, who was standing very near me* 1 said something to the Doctor, and he immediately replied, in Substance, that if His Majesty complained I might comply with His Request. In consequence of which it was done, by my Desire. I staid but a Abort Time with His Majesty, and, as 1 was walking back, I said,

I had some Doubts whether the complying with " His Majesty’s Request was not improper, for He

is in a very irritated State.” Dr. Willis said, “ His Majesty will rife presently, and then w shall be “ able to do without Coercion.”

Whether Dr. Willisexpressed, at that Time, any

Displeasure at what you had done, or represented to you any Mischief that he conceived likely to ensue from it ?

Not that I remember.

On what Occasion did any Discourse arise, concerning any Certificate subscribed by Dr. Willis, relative to a Tfanfadion in which His Majesty’s Sleep had been prevented or interrupted ?

The Story was so absurd, that I never gave myself the Trouble of confuting it* Sir Lucas said, the Story would do me a great deal of Harm. I told him, I did not value it, or some such Expression. notwithstanding which, without any Intimation from me on the Subject, he wrote down a Paper, without my knowing what it was about, till he was very near the End of it, and in a Minute or Two more shewed it to Dr. Willis, who came into the Room about tliac Time, and said, that he had no Objection to signing of it. I never considerea it of any Importance, nor do I now.

Do you recoiled, that a Paper was offered to Dr. Willis, and that he refused to sign it, if it contained any Thing to the Purpose, that you did not go into His Majesty’s Room at a Time that it was probable you might prevent His Majesty going to sleep ?

I apprehend the Doctor said something upon that Subject after it was signed.

3 k»o

29 Geoj IIL

Do you recollect any Thing further upon that Subject ?

After it was over, I said to Dr. , I would not tell you that I had done you a Civility this Morning, while this Thing was depending, and then mentioned it to him.

Do you recollect any Conversation relative to your saying you was a Spy upon them all ?

I do, and I am very glad this Circumstance was mentioned. — I went upon a certain Morning, immediately after my Arrival at into the Anti-

Chamber, and alked the Page how His Majesty did? he replied, that He had had a very bad Night, was just then fallen asleep, and you must not go in — You know, said I, that I am a Spy, and must fee the King; — I did not mean then; and went immediately to the Physicians Room. — This was spoken in a very good-natured Manner, and meant no more, than that I, from my Situation, was an Inspector. — Will the Committee please to consider, whether any Man, who meant to be a Spy, ever told it of himself ?

Have any violent Disputes ever existed between His Majesty’s Physicians, concerning the Method of His Medical Treatment ?

No, if you mean the Medicines, so far as I know.

Have any Disputes arisen between any of the Physicians among themselves (the Disputes with Dr. Willis excepted) concerning any Part of His Treatment ?

Never.

Do you recollect whether Dr. Willis remonstrated against the Use of Blisters, as supposing them improper in this Cafe, or dangerous ?

On the contrary, the Doctor spoke highly in Commendation of Blisters in similar Disorders.

Do you recollect any Person that was present at this Discourse ?

I believe all the Physicians can speak to his holding this Language — some. of them cap, I certainly know — Dr. Gijborne, Sir Lucas Pepys, Dr. Reynolds,

and probably Sir George Bak.

Whether, upon the whole Consideration of His Majesty’s Cafe, from your own Observation, and the bell Information you can collect, His Majesty is mended, in His particular Disorder, lince you were first examined before this Committee ?

No; He was more disturbed Part of Yesterday, and the Night before, from the Information that I received, and is so this Morning, than I usually fee Him.

Whether, in the Report sent to St. James's, the Words “ tranquil,” “ quiet,” “ calm,” “ pomposed,” and the like, are meant by you, so far as you have signed them, to express any Amendment in the King’s peculiar Malady, or a different State of Temper, the fame, or considerable Symptoms of Derangement existing ?

The Words are not meant by me to express any Amendment of the important Complaint.

Has any Influence, Command, Direction, or Persuasion, been used to you, from any Person whatsoever, to represent His Majesty’s same in a less favourable Light than it appeared to you upon your own Judgment I Certainly not.

When Dr. Warren was examined before this Committee on Thursday last, was he acquainted at that Time with the several Circumstances of Dr. Willis's Conduct which he has this Day Hated to the Committee, as having excited Irritation in His Majesty ? Yes.

Vol. XLIV.

11

Whether the Paper which you received from Dr. Willis was, in Point of Fa<ft, according tO the bell of your present Recollection, an Acknowledgment that you had nbt waked His Majesty, or an Acknowledgment that you had not prevented Him from going to sleep ?

I must refer to the Paper; I can hardly say that I read it with Accuracy — but I am ready to fend the Paper here.

Whether, upon that Morning in which you say, that you used the Words in the Sense in which you have explained them, relative to your being a Spy, you recoiled being desired by Mr. , or Mr.

Compton, or Dr. Willis, not to go into His Majesty’s Room ?

I certainly heard no such Words at the Time I was going into the Room; I have already related what I heard fr9in the Page, when I first went into the Anti-Chamber, at my Arrival at Kew*

Did you, according to the Rule which on Thursday last you Hated to the Committee you had made ever since Dr. Willis came, not'to go in without alking the Doctor or his Son whether it was a proper Time, alk the Doctor or his Son, on that Morning, whether it was a proper Time for you to go in ?

No, I did not; but, upon the Doctor’s observing that the King was awake, I took it for granted that this shewed tjiat it was a proper Time for my going into the King’s Room.

Was there any particular Necessity for your going in that Morning ?

The same Necessity there always was, together with the Circumstance of its having been a bad Night.

Whether the Circumstances which you have mentioned, of the Increase of Irritation, the Quickness of Pulse, ana the other Symptoms, as having been observed or learnt by you since you were last examined by this Committee, produce any material Alteration in the Opinion which you have before Hated to this Committee respecting the Probability of His Majesty’s Recovery ?

No.

Upon what Ground was your Opinion of Recovery founded ?

By Calculation.

Withdrew.

Sir George Baker again called in, and examined.

When did you last fee His Majesty ?

Yesterday Morning.

Will you inform the Committee in what State His Majesty was then, and had been in the Day preceding, according to your own Observations, and the best Information you have received ?

According to the Information which I received, H is Majesty had parted the preceding Afternoon quietly; that He had had a very restless Night, without any Sleep; that from Six o’Clock to Eight in the Morning He was very much disturbed. When I visited His Majesty, He talked for about a Minute a little consistently, but then went into a total Alienation.

How long did you stay with His Majesty ?

Perhaps about Twenty Minutes — I cannot say with Accuracy.

Do you, from what you have observed on this and' former Occasions, believe His Majesty to have been, at any Time lately, capable of reading a Book, with Attention and Observation, for any Length of Time, together ?

From what I have observed lately, I do not con-

X ccive

130 Janu

78 13° Januarii.

ccive that His Majesty has been capable of reading a Book, for any Length of Time, with Attention and Observation.

Whether, when you observed the first Symptoms of His Majesty’s Disorder, on the 22d of you

communicated your Apprehensions to any Person ?

I communicated my Apprehensions by a Note to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

To any other Person ?

No, not that Night, except to Mr. P. Hawkins.

When did you communicate your Apprehensions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer ?

The 22d of October.

Do you recollect the Circumstances of that Communication to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or any Thing that parted in Consequence ?

The Terms of the Communication were, " Sir George Baker is sorry to acquaint Mr. Pitt, that he has just left His Majesty in an Agitation of Spirits “ bordering on Delirium.” In consequence of that Communication, Mr. Pitt called on me, on Thursday the 23d of October, about Two o’Clock in the Morning, I believe, after I was gone to Bed. It was Twelve o’Clock when I came Home, and I sent the Note to Mr. Pitt immediately after. — I endeavoured to give Mr. Pitt a more full Account of what I had observed.

Do you recoiled being asked, in that Conversation, if you thought, under the Circumstances you had mentioned, it was prudent that His Majesty Should be left that Night without any Physician, or something to that Effect ?

I do not recoiled any Thing of the Kind.

Do you recoiled mentioning, after some Conversation on the particular Circumstances of His Majesty’s Situation at that Time, that Mr. Hawkins the Surgeon was in the House, or next Door, and that you thought that fully sufficient ?

I do recoiled that I told Mr. Pitt that Mr. Hawkins and 1 had talked about bleeding His Majesty, and that we waited some Time in Consideration of that, before I left the House; but we found no Alarm had been taken by any of the Family, and that if any Difficulty occurred in the Night, Mr. Hawkins would naturally be sent for, and in an Hour, or an Hour and an Half, I could come to His Majesty.

Whether you mentioned the Circumstance of the King’s Ulness to any other Person near His Majesty, from that Time to the Time of His next Attack ?

I don’t recoiled that I did. — I must explain that; for when I went the next Morning, I found His Majesty had parted a very quiet Night, and was without Complaint, as I communicated to Mr. Pitt by his Messenger.

Then you did not conceive it necessary, or advisable, to acquaint His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, or any other of the Royal Family, with the Apprehensions you had conceived the Night before?

I did not conceive it necessary to acquaint His Royal Highness with my Apprehensions the Night before, for this Reason only, because I thought I had been mistaken.

Did you, for th&fame Reason, abstain from informing Her Majesty ?

For the same Reason.

Whether Sir George Baker observes any further Degree of Convalefcenee in His Majesty, than when he was last examined before this Committee ?

No Signs of Convalefcenee.

Whether Sir George Bak, duly attending to the

A. 1789.

Circumstances which he has mentioned in his Examination this Evening, does, or does not, in his Conscience, think that the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery, from His present Indisposition, is as good, or greater, or less, than it was when he was last examined before this Committee ?

It is as good.

Can you define to the Committee the Meaning of the Word “ Convalefcenee ?”

Some Degree of Recovery, I suppose, it means. — It does not mean a Recovery, it means something towards a Recovery.

Whether, in any Disorder, any Degree of Amendment would come under the Term “ Convalefcenee?”

I think hardly. — In a Fever, if your Pulse was forqewhat quieter Today than Yesterday, I should not say you were Convalescent, but that you were better.

Is it to be understood that a Person may be better, without being Convalescent ?

He certainly may.

When you attended His Majesty Yesterday, what were the Observations you made upon the State of His Majesty’s Pulse, and of the State of His general Bodily Health ?

The State of the Pulse was 84, and as to the State of His Bodily Health, it was much as it had been. — His Majesty is grown extremely thin.

Was there any Fever, or any Thing materially different in the State of His Bodily Health, from what it had been for some Time ?

No, nothing materially different.

Does His Majesty’s general Habit, or His present Disorder, make His Majesty liable to sudden and temporary Variations in the State of His Pulse ?

I do not know the Meaning of the Word Habit but as to the present Disorder, it certainly makes H is Majesty liable to sudden Variations of His Pulse.

I have counted it from 68 to 126, but not within Short Intervals.

Whether you consider some temporary or occasional rational Discourse, a Proof of the Absence of this Malady ?

I do not.

Will you inform the Committee, whether you have, or have not, known many People extremely ill of this Malady, and who have never been cured, that did notwithstanding occasionally use some rational Discourse ?

I have hardly ever seen a Person in that Situation, who cannot occasionally talk rationally.

Whether you do not know Persons in this Malady, who in the Presence of certain Attendants have abstained from those Discourses and Actions which would indicate the Malady ?

Certainly.

How many Persons labouring under this Malady, who had been Three Months ill, have recovered under the foie Care of yourself, during your Life ?

Not one.

Whether a Patient having occasional rational Conversation, while labouring under this Malady, is not more favourable than when that Circumstance is wanting ? r

I like it better; but I am not sure it is more Favourable.

How many Patients have you, in the whole Courfis of your Life, thought it proper to continue under your foie Care, after they had continued Three Months under your foie Care, indisposed in this Malady ?

Twenty, 1 believe.

2 How

ip Geo. III.

How many of those Patients have you cured ?

Noc*One.

Of that Number, which you suppose to be Twenty, are you able to Hate how many of them ultimately did recover ?

I don’t believe any of them. 1

Did those Persons remain under your Care, to the best of your Knowledge, as long as they lived ?

I don’t know that;

Then, do you know whether ultimately they were cui;ed or not ?

I can say nothing at all to some of them*

Can you say under what Care those, to whose same you can say nothing, wete put, after they ceased to be under your Care ?

Some of them have gone into Hospitals, others into* private Houses.

Whether there are particular Symptoms which enable you to state it as your Opinion, that Patients never will be cured ?

When the Disorder degenerates into a State of Fatuity, there are no Hopes of Cure.

Whether it is not common for this Disorder, when it long continues without Cure, to degenerate into such a State ?

Very common.

What is your Opinion of a Calculation, which, under any Management you have hitherto heard of, gives 9 Cures out of io Maladies, provided they are taken into Hand within Three Months after the Commencement of the Disorder ?

As far as I know, from my own Experience, and from the Experience of Dr. , whom I attended formerly, such a Calculation is incredible.

Whether the Eofs of Flesh which you have mentioned, has been attended with Loss of Strength ?

About a Month ago there was no Loss* of Strength — His Majesty has had so little Exercise since, that I can’t judge now.

To what Cause do you attribute the Loss of Flesh ?

To Agitation, and to Perspiration, and less Sleep than usual , those are all the Causes that occur to

79

Do you know any Instance of Dr. Warren, or any other Physician, by improper Interruption disturbing His Majesty’s Rest, or preventing His going to deep ?

I know no such Instance.

Sir George Baker having said, in Answer to a Ques-tien pur to him. That,'duly attending to the several Circumstances which he has mentioned in his Examination this Evening, he does in his Conscience think that the Chance of His Majesty’s Recovery is as good as when he was last examined before this Committee — and several Questions having been addressed to, , and several Answers given by, him since he so declared his Opinion, Does he continue, in his Conscience, to hold the same Opinion, due Regard being had to the several Circumstances referred to in such Questions and Answers ? '

I am of the same Opinion that I was Two Hours ago.

Withdrew.

Sir Lucas Pepys again called in, and examined.

Whether you know any Instance of Dr. , or

any other Physician, by improper Interruption, disturbing His Majesty’s Rest, or preventing Him from going to lleep ?

No Instance.

When did you fee the King last ?

I came from Him this Morning.

In what State did you leave His Majesty ?

Rather quieter than He was last Night j very far from being so calm as I have seen Him.

Have there been, within the last Three Days, great Signs of Fever and Irritation ?

Very considerable.

How has His Majesty been, with respect to Sleep, within that Time ?

From the Report of the Pages, who have fat up for the last Three Nights, it appears that His Majesty has not had above Five or Six Hours Sleep.

A Paper, of which the following is a Copy, was then shewn to Sir Lucas Pepys.

me.

Whether Loss of Flesh, in Cafes of this Sort, affords any Argument as to the Probability of Recovery ?

I think it affords no Argument either Way.

Sir George Baker desired the Two following Questions and Answers, in his Examination on t Xhurjdaylaft, might be read.

*« Has Sir George Baker attended His Majesty “ only, or has he been' employed in attending the “ Royal Family ?”

A. “ Both His Majesty, and also the Royal Family “ — I mean the Family at Windsor and at Kew.”

Kew House,

Dec* 25th, 1788.

A malicious Report having been industrioully

circulated, that Dr. Warren had gone into His Majesty’s Bedchamber, contrary to the Desire, of

Dr. Willis and the Pages, and then and there, in

a violent Manner, disturbed His Majesty out of

His Sleep, in consequence of which He became

more than usually disturbed — This is to certify that

the Whole of the above Report is not true, and is

merely founded in Malice.

ct ‘Thursday Morning.”

£>j “ Is Sir George Baker now employed to attend on the Royal Family ?”

A. “ Only the King, not the Royal Family.”

Sir George Baker then desired that his Answer to the First of those Questions might stand as follows:

“ Both His Majesty and the Quean, and the Royal Family residing with their Majesties.”

And that his Answer to the Second Question might stand as follows:

“ Not on the Royal Family.”

This Paper was written by me, and signed by Dr. Willis, upon the 25th of December last.

What Share had Dr. Warren in procuring the drawing-up or persuading the Signature of this Paper?

Having heard frequently of the Report mentioned in this Paper, and conceiving it to be very injurious to his Character, without any Communication with Dr. Warren on the Subject, and whilst Dr. Warren and Dr. Willis were talking in the Room, I haftilf

wrote this Paper, wishing thereby to put an End to all Altercation. I shewed it Dr. Warren, who im* mediately prelected it to Dr. Willis j and I told Dr.

Willis

Willis I conceived he could have no Objection to sign his Name in contradiction to such a malicious Re-

fort: This he readily did, and Dr. Warren thanked im for having so done. — Nothing more passed on the Subject.

Did Dr. Willis, at the Time, make a Distinction between preventing Sleep, and waking from Sleep — refusing to give any Certificate with regard to the preventing, but consenting to this Certificate with regard to the waking — or any Distinctions to that Effect?

No such Distinction was made to me, nor were there any more Words, to the bed of my Recollection, passed on the Subject. What they might say, I don’t know, for I was writing.

Did you desire Dr. Willis to give a Certificate to the former Effect, which he refused ?

No, I never aflted him any more Questions on the Subject.

Was not this Certificate to meet the particular Charges, which you had heard were circulated against Dr. Warren?

Yes.

t

Will you inform the Committee, whether the Report that had been circulated was, to the best of your Information, that Dr. Warren had, in a violent Manner, disturbed His Majesty out of His Sleep — or, that he had prevented Him from going to Sleep ?

I wished, by the Certificate, to meet the Report of Dr. Warren's having disturbed His Majesty while sleeping, which was the Report that was circulated.

Withdrew.

Martis, 13° dieJanuarii 1789.

The Reverend Doctor Francis Willis again called in, and examined.

Do you remember the Time when you were 'first introduced to attend on His Majesty ?

About Friday Five or Six Weeks.

Do you remember at that Time a general Con-fultation of all the Physicians, at which you was present ?

Yes.

Was the Object of that Consultation to settle the general Rules, upon which His Majesty’s same was to be conducted ?

Concerning Medicines in particular.

Was it agreed, at that Time, to keep out of the Way of His Majesty every Thing by which a Person, under His Distemper, might, from sudden Impulse, be induced to injure himself ?

I don’t remember one Word about it: Things of that Sort, I understood, were left to me to judge at the Moment.

Do you remember your having put a Razor and Penknife into the Hands of His Majesty, the Day after the Consultation ?

His Majesty had not been (haved for a long While, perhaps a Fortnight, or Three Weeks; and the Person that had been used to ftiave Him, could not complete the Parts of His upper and under Lips; and, being confident, from the Professions and Humour of His Majesty at that Moment, I suffered His Majesty to (have His Lips Himself; and then He desired He might have His whole Face lathered, that He might just run it over with a Razor; and He did so in a very calm Manner. His Nails also wanted cutting very much; and upon His Assurance, and upon my Confidence in His Looks, I suffered Him to cut

His own Nails with a Penknife while I stood by Him.

----- It is necessary for a Physician, especially 4n such

Cafes, to be able to judge, at the Moment, whether he can confide in the Professions of his Patient; and I never was disappointed in my Opinion, whether the Professions of the Patient were to be relied on or no.

After having attended a Patient for so Short a Time, as you then had His Majesty, have you suffered them to lhave themselves, or cut their own Nails ?

I don’t know particularly as to that; but I have trusted them with a Knife and Fork at as early a Time, I believe.

As both those Operations might have been performed by other People, was there any' particular Reason which induced you to suffer His Majesty to do them Himself?

The Reason was, the great Uneasiness and Distress His Majesty shewed from the Razor going over His Lips, by the Length of the Hair, and the Person not being able to accomplish it.

Had you any Conversation soon after, with Dr. Warren, on the Subject of that Transaction ?

I believe I had, a Day or two after.

What were the Particulars of that Conversation ?

I don’t know, any further than that the Doctor shewed his Surprize that I had suffered His Majesty to perform those two Operations Himself; — upon which I told the Doctor, as I have now mentioned, I believe — that, at the Moment, I was sure those Instruments were very safe in His Majesty’s Hands; but that it had a bad Effect, because His Majesty imagined, from thence, that He might have the Liberty of doing other Things.

Upon Dr. Warren's expressing his Surprize to you, did you say to Dr. Warren, that you (huddered at what you had done ?

I don’t remember any Thing of it.

At the Consultation, to which you-have already referred, was it not a Principle settled among the Physicians, that Quiet of Body and Mind were to be endeavoured to be obtained by every Means possible ?

I believe it was, but I don’t remember any Particulars of it.

Do you recoiled it having been settled at such Consultation, that every Thing Should be kept from H is Majesty that was likely to excite any Emotion ?

I do not remember any; but understood that, as I was in the House for that particular Occasion, I was to use my own Discretion.

Do you recoiled His Majesty to have taken a Walk in the Garden, at Kevo, on a particular Day, early in the Month of December ?

I think His Majesty walked out Two Days fuc-cefiively, early in December.

Was it'about the 12th of December?

I fancy it was there or thereabouts; He walked out but Twice.

On either of those Days, did His Majesty fee any of the Royal Children in the Course of His Walk ?

When He came by the House, the first Day, He looked up at the Windows where the Princesses are generally, and complained very heavily that they would not so much as shew themselves to Him. — In* consequence of which, the next Day, I did desire that they Should appear, and myself flood at the Window, with Two of the Princesses, when His Majesty was coming by; and His Majesty shewed extravagant Joy at the Sight of them, though He Paid, His Eyes did

not

29 Geo. III. 130 Januarii. 81

not suffer Him to fee the Prlncefs Amelia so well as Was it settled at a Confutation that those Blitters

He could wish.

How long were the Priftceffes in His Majesty’s Sight ?

Not many Seconds*

Do you think that this Circumstance, of having seen those Princesses was attended with any material bad Consequences in His Majesty’s State ?

I think quite the contrary.

Do you, or do you not, think that in the Condu£t of such a Cure as that of His Majesty’s Disorder, it is of Use that the Patients Should be gradually, or at ' Times, accustomed to Scenes of an interesting Nature, such as that you have described ?

I am very sure that such Occurrences can scarce be too frequent, as it comforts the Patient to think thac he is with his Family, and that they are affectionate to him; — and upon Enquiries of Patients who have been cured of the same Indisposition, they have always mentioned those'Occurrences having given them the greatest Comfort, and, as they thought, helped very much towards their Recovery.

Is it your Opinion, that suffering His Majesty to continue anxious for a Sight of His Children would have been attended with more, or less. Inconvenience than the Irritation which the seeing of them might occasion I

There would have been more Inconvenience in His not seeing them, from His Anxiety; — for the Irritation occasioned by a Patient seeing his Friends or Relations is entirely overbalanced by the softening him into Tears, which ever leads to Amendment.

Do you consider the observing those Emotions, which may naturally take Place at the Sight of Relations or Friends, as furnishing Grounds judging with regard to the State of the Disorder, or the Probability of Cure ?

Yes, it is a favourable Symptom, if the Patient shews Affediion, instead of Aversion; which latter is very often the Cafe, in those who are not so likely to recover.

Soon after the Occurrence which you have related, had His Majesty an Interview with the Queen ?

I believe in the Evening of that Day, or the Day after — I think so.

How long did that Interview last ?

' A Quarter of an Hour.

Are you of Opinion that this Interview was attended with any prejudicial Consequences, or the Reverse ?

I can form no Opinion whether it was the one or the other, because that that Night Two Blisters were applied to His Majesty’s Legs, which, from the Consequence of them afterwards, I believe, were the Occasion of His having a very bad Night, and that His having seen Her Majesty had no Concern in itj but that is mere Opinion.

Are these the same Blisters which you have already mentioned before this Committee ?

Yes; — there have been no other since I came.

' Are you of Opinion, that the Application of Blisters is a salutary Remedy in Disorders of that Nature ?

I have had the greatest Reason to think so, if they were not applied upon or near the Head.

Was you of Opinion that the Blisters applied to His Majesty’s Legs, on the Evening of the Day when He saw the Queen, was a proper Measure ?

I thought so at that Time, as I understood Two Blisters, that had been applied at , did not

ftiew that they increased His Majesty’s Irritability.

Vol. XLIV.

should be applied ?

Yes.

Was there a Second Interview with the Queen ?

Yes.

When was that ?

It was while His Majesty’s Legs were bad from the Blisters, before they were at all well.

Were there any bad Effects produced from that Interview ?

I don’t know that there were, nor do I know that there were any good, because of the Blisters irritating Him.

Do you recoiled! any particular Circumstance which led you, in addition to your general Reasoning upon the Subject, to wish the King to have an Interview with some of His Family ?

No other than from His great Uneaftness and De-fire to fee them — and the Necessity 1 think there is to have such Occurrences very frequently.

Do you recoiled! any Thing of the King having seen the youngest Princess before He saw the Queen ?

Yes.

When ?

Just before He first saw the Queen.

Did any Thing arise from that Circumstance, which more particularly led to the Interview with the Queen ?

He persuaded the Princess to prOmife Him that Ihe would fetch the Queen.

Did He give any Signs of much Anxiety upon the Subject! of that Request being complied with ?

Very great — insomuch that the Meeting was extremely moving.

Do you recoiled!, among other Books, to have put the Tragedy of King Lear into the Hands of the King ?

His Majesty alked me to give Him the Tragedy of King Lear. I told Him it was improper. He then desired to have Foote’s Plays, and I did

not know that Colman had put out an Edition of King Leary indeed 1 had never read Caiman's Works, ana when I told it to the Chancellor, he told me he was as ignorant of it as I was; and when I was charged by Dr. JVarren for giving His Majesty it, I thought I had not done it, and politively said I had not and, it being the same Day that Dr. Warren had charged me, in a most extraordinary Manner, for writing what I had not, and doing with a.Political View what I did not, I really thought that the Dod!or had charged me as fallely with the one as in the other; and was very much surprised, when I went into the Pages Room, to fee that King Lear was, I think, in the Third Volume of Colman’s Works. But be that as it may, it was of no Consequence, for at that Time His Majesty could not read Three Words in any Book.

Was His Majesty in a very irritated State Yesterday Morning ?

I just saw His Majesty — I left Him about Half past Seven o’Clock, and He was not so then. His Majesty took hold of my Hand, and said, I should not go to London; and complained of my having left Him so much in the last Week.

At that Time did you feel His Majesty’s Pulse ?

1 did.

In what State was it ?

An irritated Pulse — considerably too quick.

Y Had

ot 130 Januariu A, 1789.

Had the King a considerable Fever upon hirri ? Will you inform the Committee, whether you have

nervous I*ever from Irritability, more than from any other Cause, in my Opinion.

Was His Tongue much assessed?

Yes, His Tongue looked white; — but there are Appearances of an Affection of the Nerves from the Tongue, that is rather of a different Nature from that which is from Fever alone — in short, what appears in Hyftcrical Cafes.

How long were you with His Majesty ?

About a Minute; not more.

Had you proposed to carry out His Majesty to take the Air Yesterday, or the Day before ?

1 had an Intention both Days, because such Appearances of Fever as I judged His Majesty’s to be, are to be removed by Amusement, more perhaps than by any Thing else.

Had His Majesty been in a great Perspiration the Night before ?

On the Saturday Night He had j and that was the only Reason that determined me not to take His Majesty out.

What Physician attended on Sunday Morning at Kew ?

Sir George Baker, I think.

Did Sir George Baker and you agree upon the Impropriety of taking His Majesty abroad after such a Perspiration ?

I don’t remember that we said any Thing about it.

At what Time of that Day did you determine against His Majesty’s going out ?

I believe it was about Two o’clock, but I am not sure.

Did you fee His Majesty this Morning ?

I did not — I saw one of the Pages.

.Was you at Kew Time enough to fee Him last Night?

I saw Him go to Bed, and a long while before — He went to Bed extremely. quiet and sensibly, while I was in the Room, last Night — went to sleep a Quarter past Eleven, and waked a Quarter before Seven, as 1 understand from the Page, and one of the Attendants.

After you had permitted the King the Use of a Razor and Penknife, what were the bad Effects that you apprehended from His thinking that he had a Right to do other Things ?

His Majesty took it ill that I would not let him go up Stairs to fee His Family, and many other Things, which I found it would not be prudent to do.

Whether you have flnee continued to indulge His Majesty in the Use of the Razor and the Penknife ?

Never since, either of them, for the Reason I have already given.

Is it only for Fear He Should ask for other Liberties, which you think it proper to refuse Him ?

Yes.

Do you think that the Expedition of the Liberties which the King might call for would be of more Danger to Him than the Use of Razors and Penknives ?

To be sure, because the Refusal would irritate Him much, and increase His Disorder.

Whether you refuse to the King all Indulgences which: may be safely given, left He Should demand -those that ought to be refused ?

I do a great many that may be safely given.

frequently indulged the King in the View of the Royal Children, since the Interview you mention ?

Not once.

Will you inform the Committee, whether, after the first Interview with the Queen, there was not a Remonstrance made to you upon the Impropriety of that Step ?

Yes, there was.

Was it only made to you by the Physicians, or carried further?

Only by the Physicians, as I know of — I had a Conversation with the Chancellor about it, and I told the Chancellor, as I did the Physicians, that I imagined that those Things were left to my Judgment, and to be done, or not, as it appeared best at the present Moment.

Did the Chancellor encourage you in the Use of that Discretion, without Consultation with the Physicians attending on His Majesty ?

The Chancellor told me that I should consult the other Physicians as much a91 could, but that I was to follow my own Line, and do as I had been used to do with Patients at Home.

Whether any other Physician, besides Dr.

expressed his Disapprobation of your, indulging the King in the Use of foarp Instruments, and in affecting Interviews ?

I don’t know any, except Dr. Warren — I don’t remember.

Were any of the rest acquainted with those Circumstances ?

Dr. Gijborne was present at the First Interview with Her Majesty.

How came the Indulgence of the King in the Sight of Two of the Princesses at the Window to be so short, when the King expressed so much Satisfaction. in it ?

I can give no particular Reason for it: His Majesty saw them as He passed along, and made a little Stop i the Window was not open, and they were up Stairs.

What was the Occasion of the Interview with the Prinqefs Amelia ?

His Majesty’s earned Desire, and the Hope that it might have some good Effect.

Whether the Princess Amelia was brought into the King’s Presence, or only foewn at a Window ?

I led the Princess Amelia into the Room myself.

What happened on the Occasion ?

He was extremely fond of her, and {hewed the greatest Mark of Parental Affection I ever saw.

Did His Majesty suffer her to depart willingly ?

Very willingly, on Condition that foe brought the Queen to His Majesty.

What was the Cause why the Interview with the , Queen did not continue longer than the Time you have stated ?

Because His Majesty gave me His Word it foould be but for Fifteen Minutes.

Are you quite sure that His Majesty’s Discourse did not grow more disordered towards the End of that Meeting than it had been at the Beginning ?

I was not a Judge, because His Majesty spoke in German several Sentences, which I did not understand j — but His Majesty took Leave of the Queen and Princess very properly.

For what Reason, that Nighr, was it thought proper.

ip Geo. lit 130 Januarii. ©3

per, on Confutation, to have Recourse to Blitters, for the first Time since your Arrival ?

To make a Revulsion.

What Occasion was there that Day more than before to have Recourse to that Operation ?

It was determined by us in the Morning to put them on that Night.

Whether the King grew more composed before those Bliflers were put on ?

I do not remember any Thing about it.

Whether, after the Interview with the Queen, the Physicians did not remonstrate against such Interviews ?

I believe they might.

Did you, at that Time, tell them that you were resolved to permit such Interviews at your, Discretion ?

I told them, I believe, that I was sent for there in order to make use of my own Discretion; and that they could not think themselves proper Judges about it.

At what Hour were the Blisters put on, after the first Interview ?

About Ten o’Clock at Night.

Was actual Coercion used on that Night ?

I do not remember.

Years, do you or do you not think, that in the Management of Persons in His Majesty’s Situation, though a general Line of Conduct may be laid down, yet that much Good may result from occasional Devi- ations from it, when made at the Discretion and under the constant Observation of a Physician who is tho* roughly conversant with this Species of Complaint ?

Very certainly.

Do you think that such Deviations not being allowed to such Physician may greatly retard the Cure?

I am very much of that Opinion.

Do you recollect whether you ever told Dr.

previous to Yesterday Morning, that His Majesty had asked for the Play of King Lear, and that you had refused to comply with the Request, as improper, before you brought His Majesty the Volume of Plays ?

I really don’t remember.

Dr. Willis having informed the Committee, that from his Knowledge of His Majesty’s Sense of Religion, he has greater Hopes that He will, with a proper Reflgnation, reflect upon what it has pleased God to have afflicted Him with — whether Dr. Willi's grounds those Hopes upon observing that His Majesty is not irritated by being sensible of His Situation ?

I do not understand the Question.

Can you recoiled! ?

I cannot. — I believe it might be the next Day, or the next Night j I am not sure; it was about that Time, and was the very first Time it was used, I believe.

Whether you declared your Intention in persisting in the Grant of such lndulgencics when you should think proper ?

I certainly did, by Implication.

Did you give any Notice, or consult any Physicians, about the second Interview with the Queen ?

I don’t remember.

When was the Time of the second Interview with the Queen ?

I do not recoiled!.

Have you indulged the King with any further Interview with Her Majesty ?

Only on the Times that have been mentioned.

Has the King been indulged with a View of His Brothers or Sons ?

No.

Whether any, and what Conversation, gave Rife to the King’s Desire of having the Tragedy of King Lear put into His Hands ?

I don’t know of any; I never before read King Lear in my Life.

Why did you represent it as improper to give the Tragedy of King Lear to the King ?

Because I did understand the Charadfer of King Leary though 1 had not read it.

Were any of the King’s Physicians, Surgeons, or Apothecaries present,when the King called for Foote’s or Caiman's Plays ?

I don’t remember.

Whether the King did actually read any Part, however firnall, of Colman's Tragedy of King Lear ?

I had said before, that 1 did not know it was there — I did not fee him read it at any Time.

Did you hear him refer to it ?

1 did not.

On the Whole of your Experience, for near Thirty

Have you observed that the King has appeared at all sensible of His Situation ?

Very much so j and more particularly lately, within these few Days.

What Time do you mean by a few Days ?

Within this Week — but more so last Night.

How come you now to be enabled to answer pofi-tively, on being asked whether His Majesty appeared sensible of His Situation, that He has been very much so within this Week past, when on Saturday last you said you was not sure that He had been sensible of it ?

By His Situation now, 1 mean both His Majesty’s Situation as King, and His Indisposition, taken together; — complaining of His being confined in one Room, when He has other Places that He might be in j — not to dine where He liesand that He Should be deemed a Person so indisposed, as not to be Coffered to be His own Matter; — all which prevented Him, His Majesty told me last Night, from ever thinking of taking the Reins of Government.

Is the Committee to understand from you, that those Sort of Complaints have been made by His Majesty only Once, or frequently ?

They have been made vaguely frequently, but not to make one understand that^Hc was sensible of His Indisposition, and the Consequence of it.

Then, in Point of Faff, Dr. , till last Night, had no reasonable Ground to attribute any Symptoms in His Majesty’s Disorder to His Recollection of His Situation ?

I don’t atribute any of His Symptoms to His Rc-collection of His Disorder; I don’t remember that I ever did.

Have His Majesty’s Spirits appeared deprefied or irritated by this Confcioulhefs, if, in Point of F%&, it did exist ?

Not at all as I know of; they are rather the Consequences of Irritation, than the Cause of them.

Do you remember to have written, on the 5th of this Month, a Letter containing the following Paragraph: <« His Majesty can talk of and be kept to any «« Subject in general much better than heretofore; but is more subject to Gulfs of Passion upon any trifling Contradiction, unless I or my Son are pre-.

\ “ lent;

ij6 Janu

A. 1789.

,c sent; and this 1 rather attribute to His Majesty’s being more sensible of Himself and Situation ?”

Yes, I did write it, and think it.

To whom was that Letter written ?

I fancy it was to the Prince of Walts.

Did that Letter commence by saying, “ 1 am sorry I can’t give your Royal Highness so good an Account this Morning as I gave you when I last did myself the Honour to write to your Royal H ighness and then did the Paragraph last quoted follow ?

It did j the Reason of that Letter commencing with those Words was. His Majesty having had a very bad Night, which the Report to His Royal Highness would plainly shew; but which bad Night did not at all prove that I had a worse Opinion of His Majesty’s Recovery, though I could not give so favourable an Account as I had some Days before, when His Majesty had had Two or Three very good Nights; and I thought it necessary to give His Royal Highness my Opinion of His Majesty’s State separate from His bad Night.

Then you, in saying that His Majesty could talk of and be kept to any Subject in general much better, referred to His Majesty’s general Situation ?

To His Situation at that Time, because the Exacerbations of such Disorders do not weaken in general the Understanding in those Cafes; but as the Patient recovers, we often find that the Understanding is strengthened after each, especially if the Time betwixt each is lengthenedwhich has been the Calc of His Majesty for this last Three Weeks or a Month, I think; for though His Majesty has Gusts of Passion, and is easily irritated, yet they are of very Short Duration, in Comparison to what they were.

Were those Gusts of Passion of shorter Duration than they had been, when you wrote this Letter to the Prince, on the 5th of January ? .

Very much so.

Were they more or less frequent at that Time ?

According as the People who were with Him understood how to speak to Him, they were more or less frequent.

But, in Point of Fact, were they more or less frequent ?

Less frequent I think, too.

Dr. Willis having taken a Distinction with regard to his signing the Accounts sent to St. will

he inform the Committee whether he does not hold himself responsible for the Truth of the Accounts he fends to His Royal Highness the Prince of,

which he signs alone, and that they shall contain the real State of the King’s Situation ?

To be sure.

Will you inform the Committee why you informed His Royal Highness, on the 5th of that His Majesty was more subject to Gusts of Passion upon any trifling Contradiction, unless you or your Son was present at that Time, than before — when you now inform the Committee that those Gusts of Passion were then less frequent than they had been f

His Majesty began to feel Himself more in His own Situation as King, and could not bear to be contradicted so well by either Pages or Attendants, and consequently would break out in Gusts of Passion upon Things that they did for Him, perhaps not in a Manner that His Majesty thought became them, and which they had used themselves to when His Majesty was not so well.

Is k to this that you attribute the Gusts of Passion being then more frequent, as described t

Yes — and it required a more delicate Behaviour than it had done before.

Then your having observed those Circumstances, namely, the frequent Gusts.of Passion, in His Majesty, and that His Majesty felt Himself more in His own Situation as King, so as to make a more delicate Behaviour necessary to Him; and having, on the 5th of January, informed His Royal Highness that you attributed such Gusts of Passion to His Majesty being more sensible of Himself and Situation j — you will now inform the Committee why you declared yourself, on Saturday last, not to be sure that His Majesty had been sensible of the Nature of His lllness j and why you now have informed the Committee that it has been within this Week only, and more particularly last Night, that you have perceived such Symptoms or Effects ?

His Situation, as King, is different from the Na-. ture of His lllness.

Do you not mean, when you state the King in that, Letter to be more sensible of Himself and Situation, that He was sensible both of His being King, and of the Circumstances which must bring to His Mind His Malady ?

No: I mean being King, and being confined in a Room.

Then have you, or have ydu not, seen in the King any Symptoms of His Recollection of His Malady?

I think I did particularly last Night.

Did you never before last Night ?

I may have said that I thought I had, but I am not sure.

Whether the Conversation you had with His Majesty last Night has not now led you to be more certain that, on former Occasions, His Majesty was, in Fact, sensible of the Nature of His lllness, though, at the Time, that Circumstance was only vaguely hinted at by His Majesty, or conjectured by you ?

Much more so.

Is the Committee to understand, that, previous to the 5th of January, the Exacerbations of His Majesty’s Disorder were more strong and more frequent, though His Majesty might become, at that Time, from the Reason you have already given, more subject to particular Gusts of Passion upon any trifling Contradiction, unless you or your Son was present ?

Yes, certainly.

Do you mean to say, that the Observation you made on His Majesty last Night, could at all have affected any Opinion you formed, or any Communication you made, on the 5th Instant ?

Not at all. '

Why you, having observed, as you state in your Letter to His Royal Highness on the 5th Instant that you did, that His Majesty’s frequent Gusts of Passion were to be attributed to His Majesty being more sensible of Himself and Situation — why you informed the Committee, on Saturday last, that you had now less Apprehensions with respect to the Consequences of His Majesty’s reflecting upon His lllness, than when you was examined before the former Committee ?

Because I was then better acquainted with His Majesty’s Principles, and Notions of Religion, than I was before.

Withdrew.

EXAMINATION relative to Dotfor Willis.

Veneris, 90 die J, 1789.

The Reverend Doctor Francis Willis again called in, and asked,

Whether your Son, Dr. John fician ?

Willis, is a Phy-He

He took his Degrees at Edinburgh about Thirteen or Fourteen Years ago — has practised Physic ever since — he was bred up at Oxford — studied Physic there first, and was afterwards Four or Five Years at Edinburgh.

How long has he attended His Majesty ?

He came the Zhurfday after I came — I came on the

Friday.

Has he been consulted as a Physician since he has attended at Kew ?

As to the Medicines — and, though he has not signed the Report, always was consulted about it.

Was Dr. John Willis ever consulted by the other Physicians in forming any Prescription for Medicine to be given to His Majesty ?

I think I answered before that he was.

Has he ever signed his Name to any One Prescrip-tien ?

Several.

For His Majesty ?

I think so — am pretty sure so — there never was any Prescription without his being the re.

Then yon understand that all the other Physicians Consider Dr. John Willis, and aft with him, as a Physician attending on His Majesty, and not an Assistant to you in the Care of the King ?

I understand as a Physician.

Why has Dr. John Willis never signed the Report sent to St. James's ?

I never knew any Reason. '

By whose Direction was Dr. John Willis summoned to attend His Majesty ?

I understood by the Privy Council — Lord Sydney sent the Letter.

When was the Letter sent ?

I believe it was on the Monday or Sunday before he came.

Who informed you that the Privy Council sent for your Son ?

Lord Sydney sent the Messenger, that is all I know.

To whom was the Letter sent ?

To Dr. John Willis.

Whether you know that it was at the Desire of the Physicians the Letter was sent, or at whose Desire ?

I really don’t know — but I believe Dr. Warren first said that I could not attend enough, that it would be too much for me.

Whether you sign the Prescriptions ?

I sign them, or give my Consent to the Physician that writes to sign my Name.

When Dr. Warren mentioned that your Son Should be called on, as you could not attend enough, did you understand that Dr. Warren meant as an Assistant, or as a Physician ?

As a Physician, as well as any Thing else — not as an Assistant distinguished from a Physician.

Do you consider your Son as in any Degree responsible for the Medicines administered to His Majesty?

I imagine so.

Withdrew.

Doctor Richard Warren again called in, and examined.

Whether you consider Dr. ‘John Willis as attending His Majesty in the Character of a Physician, or as an Assistant to Dr. Willis in the Care and Management of His Majesty ?

Vol. XLIV.

s

I have always considered him as an Assistant.

Do you consult with Dr. John , as a Physician, before you prescribe for His Majesty ?

Dr. John Willis is generally, 1 believe I may say almost always, present at the Confutations} we esquire of him how the King has passed His Time — when Medicines are proposed. Dr. John Willis has often spoke upon the Subject of them, and Attention has been paid to what he said — yet at the same Time . I considered him only as an Amicus Curia.

Do you not make the same Sort of Enquiries from the other Four Medical Gentlemen who are in Attendance on His Majesty ?

Yes j but they don’t talk about Medicines.

Do you consider Dr. John Willis as responfible with you in the Prescriptions and Physical Treatment of the King ?

I think not.

' Does Dr. John Willis sign those Prescriptions with you

It is usual for the Writer of the Prescriptions to put down the Initials of the Names of the consulted Physicians — I believe when I have written the Prescription, I have never put his Name down.

In that same then, as far as you are concerned. Dr. John Willis, is not reiponfible for the Medicines administered ?

No.

Does Dr John Willis sign the Reports sent to St. James's ?

No.

If he had acted, and had been consulted, and considered as a Physician attending on His Majesty, would it not have been right and necessary that he Should have taken his Share of the Responsibility in both or either of those Respects ?

It would be certainly right that he Should.

Has Dr. Willisthe Father, signed the Prescriptions, and from what Time ?

I apprehend the Father’s Name is put down to the Prescriptions from the Time that he came.

When did he subscribe his Name to the Reports ?

I do not exactly know the Time; it is easily seen.

Did he desire so to do ?

I understood from the Chancellor that he did.

Have the other Physicians, or any of them, subscribed the Initials of Dr. John Willis’s Name to Prescriptions for His Majesty ?

I do not know — but I have been told that some of them have.

Do you consider Dr. John Willis more in the Character of a Physician, with respect to his Situation about the King, than the Four other Medical Gentlemen attending His Majesty, namely, Mr.

Mr. Keate, Mr. Dundas, and Mr. Battifcombe ?

More Respect is due and paid to him, because he has taken a Degree.

But with respect to his Situation about the King, do you aft with him, or consider him more in the Light of a Physician than those Four Gentlemen ?

No. ’

Would not the same Attention have been paid to any other Physician then present, who had seen His Majesty, though not at all attending as a Physician to His Majesty ?

Provided there was no Impertinence in his being the re.1

If, after Dr. John Willis conversed with Dr. Warren

Z upon

upon the Subject of the Medicines for His Majesty, Dr. John Willis had desired Dr. , when he was

writing the Prescription, to put the Initials of Dr. John Willis to such Prescription, or to permit him, Dr. Join Willis, to do so, Dr. knowing that

Dr. John Willis had been educated at , and had

taken a Doctor’s Degree at , and had

Eraftifed Physic for Thirteen or Fourteen Years since e took that Degree, would have made the same Objection to adding such Initials or permitting them to be added to the Prescription, as he would have done if the Surgeons and Apothecaries, all or any of them, had made the same Request with respect to their own Initials ?

The Question must have been, whether Dr. John Willis was authorized to act there as a Physician.

Considering the Circumstances of Dr. John Willis's Attendance upon His Majesty, and that he is a Physician who has been educated and has taken a Degree, in the Manner mentioned in the last Question — if Dr. John Willis had made such a Request with respect to his Initials, Should Dr. Warren have thought it an impertinent Request ?

Certainly — unless he was considered as responsible for the Medicines.

Then does Dr. Warren consider the other Physicians, if any, who have put the' Initials, or permitted the Initials of Dr. John Willis to be put, to their Prescriptions, as having done, or suffered to be done, an improper Act, considering the Circumstances under which Dr. John Willis attends His Majesty ?

I can only answer for my own Conduct — I think I should not be called upon to judge of others.

If Dr. Warren had permitted the Initials of Dr. John Willis to be put to a Prescription, does he think (answering for his own Conduct, if it had been such) that he would have done an improper Act, considering the Circumstances under which Dr. John Willis attends His Majesty ?

I should never consider it as a Permission, unless I had been alked whether his Initials should be put down i because they are often written by the preferring Physician after the Prescription has been agreed to, and the Initials not particularly examined.

Whether, if his Permission had been alked, when a Prescription was written by himself, or any other of His Majesty’s Physicians, to put the Initials of Dr. John Willis to such Prescription, together with his own Name; and if he had given that Permission, Dr. Warren, answering for his own Conduct, would have thought he had done an improper Act in giving his Permission, considering the Circumstances under which Dr. John Willis attends His Majesty, and considering the Circumstance of his Education at Oxford, the Fast of his having taken the Degree of Doctor of Physic at Edinburgh, and the Fast of his having practised as a Physician for 13 or 14 Years past?

The Propriety of putting the Initials down must depend upon the Responsibility of the Person.

Whether, the several Circumstances mentioned in the foregoing Question* being duly attended to, if Dr. John Willis had this Morning alked Dr. Warren's Permission to put his Initials to a Prescription, Dr. Warren would this Morning have refused to give such Permission ?

Degrees in Physic give no Authority to practise in London, or within Seven Miles of London — there is no other Qualification than that of being a Fellow or Licentiate of the College of Physician*. — If the Circumstance of being about His Majesty induced me to think him responsible for the Medicines, I should have put the Initials down.

In Point of Fast, due Attention being paid, to all

A. 1789.

the Circumstances relative to Dr. John Willis's Attendance upon His Majesty, would Dr. Warren this Morning have refused to permit the Initials of Dr. John Willis to be put to a Prescription, upon the Conviction of his (Dr. Warren's') Mind that those Circumstances do not make him responsible in such a Degree as to make it sufficiently proper that those Initials should be put; and whether the Fast of His Majesty’s being at Kew would induce Dr. Warren to form an Opinion upon the Propriety of giving such Permission, different from the Opinion which he might have on such Propriety if His Majesty was at Windfort

The Rule to guide me, whether the Initials of a Person attending His Majesty should be put ‘down to a Prescription, must be my being informed that that Person is put about the King by proper Authority. ’

Has Dr. Warren, in Point of Fast, written many of the Prescriptions for His Majesty, and subscribed the Initials of the other Physicians ?

I have not written many since His Majesty came to Kew; but when I have written, 1 have put down the Initials of the Physicians present.

Whether you know that a Letter was sent by Lord Sydney to bring Dr. John Willis to Town ?

I know of no such Thing as a Letter.written by Lord Sydney.

Do you know in what Manner Dr. John Willis was sent for to attend the King ?

I consulted the Chancellor and Mr. Pitt on the Propriety of Dr. Willis's Servants being sent for — -They were sent for with the Consent of the Chancellor and Mr. Pitt — Dr. Willis wrote the Letter, and I believe I

advised him to fend for his Son to assist him.

j

Has any other of the Person9 then sent for up been present at a Consultation, and given an Opinion respecting the Medicines ?

No.

Whether Dr. Warren did not know that there was other Approbation, besides the Chancellor and Mr. Pitt, for fending-for Dr. Willis's Servants ?

Not for fending for them, but for making Use of them afterwards.

What other Approbation was there for making Ufc of them ?

I understood that it was communicated to Dr. Willis — the Doctor told me he had Authority to make Ufc of those Servants.

Does Dr. Warren apprehend that Dr. John Willis's Attendance was with the Knowledge or Approbation of any of the Royal Family ?

I could not think otherways, but I never was told

so.

Did Dr. Warren conceive that the Approbation of any of the Royal Family given to the Attendance of Dr. John Willis was given as a Physician, or as the principal Person to direct the Servants of Dr. Willis ?

Not as a Physician, but as Assistant to his Father.

On what Grounds does Dr. Warren entertain that Opinion ?

Because, upon Enquiry, soon after his Arrival, when a Prescription was written, whether Dr. John Willis's Name was to be put to it, he declined it.

By whom and of whom was that Enquiry made ?

By one of the Physicians afleing, at a Morning Consultation, whether Dr. John Willis's Name was to be put to it.

Did Dr. John Willis decline ?

Yes.

Were any Observations made upon it by any one rife ? ‘

I believe not.

Had Dr. John Willis not declined to sign the Prescription, should you have h^d any Objection ?

I should then have supposed that he had had Authority to act as a Physician.

Resolved, That this House will, upon* Friday Morning next, resolve itself into the said Committee.

And then the House adjourned till Friday Morning next. Ten of the Clock. *

E)r. Warren having said, that he believes that other Physicians have put Dr; John Willis's Initials to Pre-fc/riptions, should he, in that Cafe, Conclude that Dr. John Willis has Authority to attend His Majesty ?

Dr. Warren can only answer for the Motives of his own Conduit.

Venerts, i6° Januarii;

- Anno 290 Georgii III*11 Regis, 1789.

Whether, when you recommended- it to His Majesty’s Ministers to fend for Dr. John , you intended to recommend it to them to fend for him in the Character of an additional consulting Physician,

' or as an Assistant to his Father in the Care and Management of the King ?

I did not recommend it to Ministers to fend for Dr.

John Willis at all, that I know of — I recommended it tO' Ministers to fend for Dr. Willis's Servants; and I aclvifed the Doctor to-fend for his Son to assist him, because I thought the Confinement more than he could submit to.

Whether you had, either to His Majesty’s Ministers, or to Dr. Willis, ever suggested a Wilh that Dr. John Willis should be called in to aid His Majesty’s Physicians in Consultation ?

No.

Whether any Notification from Authority was ever made to you, that Dr. John Willis was to be confi-- dered in that Light ?

No.

Whether you have ever heard from any of your Brethren, the King’s Physicians, that any Notification to that Effect had been made to them ?

No.

Whether you explained, either to Dr. Willis the Father, or to Dr. John Wil, that Dr. John Willis was sent for as the Director of Dr. Willis's other Servants, and not in the same Character as Dr. Willis himself, as a Physician who had dedicated his Attention particularly to that Branch of Medicine ?

Dr. Willis's Son was sent for merely at my own Suggestion, as I apprehend, to aftift his Father, without my knowing that he had even taken a Degree.

When’you understood that Dr. John Willis was a regular-bred Physician, did you then make the Explanation as dated in the former Question ?

I don’t recollect that I said any Thing to him upon the Subject.

My Lords, and Gentlemen,

I thank you for communicating to Me the Resolutions agreed to by the Two Houses; and I request you to assure them, in My Name, that My Duty to the King My Father, and My anxious Concern for the Safety and Interests of the People, which must be endangered by a longer Suspension of the Exercise of the Royal Authority, together with My Respect for the united Desires of the Two Houses, outweigh in My Mind every other Consideration, and will determine Me to undertake the weighty and important Trust proposed to Me, in Conformity to the Resolutions now communicated to Me.

Circumstances in which it is committed to My Charge, in which, as I am acquainted with no former Example, My Hopes of a successful Administration cannot be founded on any pad Experience} but confiding that the limitations on the Exercise of the Royal Authority, deemed necessary for the present, have been approved only by the Two Houses as a temporary Measure, founded on the loyal Hope, in which I ardently participate, that His Majesty’s Disorder may not be of a long Duration, and trusting, in the mean while, that I shall receive a zealous and united Support in the Two Houses, and in the Nation, proportioned to the Difficulty attending the Discharge of My Trull in this Interval, I will entertain the pleasing Hope that My faithful Endeavours to preserve the Interests of the King, His Crown, and People, may be successful.

My Duty and Gratitude to the King, and the Sense I mull ever entertain of My great Obligations to this Country, will certainly engage My most earned Attention to the anxious and momentous Trust intended to be reposed in Me by Parliament. It will be a great Consolation to Me to receive the Aid of a Council, of which 1 shall ftiod so much in Need, in the Discharge of a Duty whereiiy the Happiness of My future Life is, indeed, deeply interested, but which a higher Object, the Happiness of a great, loyal, and affectionate People, renders Hill more important.

Ordered, That the said Account do lie upon the Table, to be perused by the Members of the House.

A Petition of the Most Noble Marquis and the humble Petition of the several Commissioners, Owners and Proprietors of Lands, in a certain Dif-tridl of Fen Lands, called Middle Fen Dislriff, lying between Ely and Sobam, in the County of whose Names are thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves and other Commissioners, Owners and Proprietors of Land in the aforesaid District, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That an Act was made in the Thirty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled.

An Act for draining and preserving certain Fen Lands and Low Grounds in the Isle of Ely and County of Cambridge, between the Cam, other- wife Grant, Ouze, and Mildenball Rivers, and

bounded on the South East by the Hard Lands of IJlebam, Fordbam, Sobam, and and for

impowering the Governor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty, of the Company of Conservators of the “ Great Level of the Fens, called Bedford Level, to “ fell certain Lands within the said Limits, commonly called Invejled Landsand that the Commissioners appointed by the said Act have, at a great Expence, raised Banks, erected Engines, cut Drains, and done other Works for the better Preservation thereof, which have obliged them to borrow large Sums of Money on the Credit of the said Act; and that the Floods of late Years have risen to extraordinary Heights, and come down with such Violence against the said Banks, as to occasion great Breaches therein, which obliged the Commissioners to lay out further large Sums in heightening and strengthening the said Banks, and securing the said Breaches, and on other necessary Works which the Nature of the Undertaking required, whereby the Debt contracted on the Credit of the said Act is now become so heavy, as not to leave, after Payment of the Interest and Officers Salaries, a Sum anyways sufficient to carry on the said Work of Drainage, by which the whole Under-

o 9 *

taking is likely to fail, to the great impoverishment of many Families, and to the great Detriment of the said Creditors, unless timely relieved by the further Aid of Parliament; and that the Banks of the several Rivers adjoining to, or running by, the Lands comprised in the said Act, and which are under the Direction of the said Commissioners, are greatly damaged by Horses towing or haling Vessels along the said Rivers, and occasions a considerable additional Expence to the Proprietors of the said Lands, in keeping the said Banks, Haling Ways, and Towing Paths, in Repair, and the Petitioners therefore hope, that the House will think it real'onable that some Compenfa-tien should be made by the Owners of Boats and other Vessels navigated upon the said Rivers, to be applied in Aid of the Rates authorized to be raised by the said Act towards supporting and maintaining the said Banks and Towing Paths: And therefore praying. That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for amending the said former Act, and for more effcdlually draining the said Lands, and supporting the said Banks and other Works belonging thereto, in such Manner, and under such Powers and restrictions, as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

That, by virtue of an Act made in the Thirty-third Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for erecting Piers and other Works for the Security and Improvement of the Harbour of New , in the County of Sussex, and for keeping the same in Repair, Powers were given to Commissioners therein named to make a new Cut through the Sea Beach, opposite the Village called Kingston by Se, about a Mile Eastward of the Town of New Shorehamand to erect a Pier or Piers, and to do such other Works as foould be necessary, in order to make and maintain a new and more commodious Entrance into the said Harbour; and that, in Consequence of the said Act* a large Sum of Money was subscribed for the Purposes therein mentioned, and Piers were erected, and a new Cut made, but, from various Causes, the Channel took a different Direction, and now runs into the Sea near Half a Mile to the Eastward of where the Piers were erected, and the Piers have been washed away, and no other Works since erected; and that the Monies subscribed by virtue of the said Act, together with Interest for the fame, and all Claims whatsoever, as well for the Loss of Property as otherwise, have been paid off, and there remains at present unapplied, in the Hands of the Treasurer or Receiver of the said Duties, about the Sum of £. 500; that the last Annual Receipt of the Duties amounted to £.912, and the Disbursements on Account of the said Harbour fur the last Seven Years, at an Average, have amounted to ,£.112 per Annum; and that the said Harbour of New Shoreham is at present in as good a State as it has usually been for many Years past, and the Petitioners conceive that it is adequate for the Purpose of receiving Ships and Vessels of any moderate Burthen, sufficient for the Trade of the Country} and that, notwithstanding all the Monies subscribed by virtue of the said Act, together with all Claims whatsoever, have been paid and satisfied, and although there is a considerable Balance in the Hands of the Treasurer, yet the full Duties still continue to be collected, and the Commissioners appointed by virtue of the said Act have no Power to lower the Duties more than One-third of what were originally granted, which the Petitioners conceive is a very great Burthen on them and the Public at large, and they are therefore inclined to hope that they, and the Public at large, may be relieved from the Payment of Three-fourth Parts of the Duties imposed by the said Act, and that the remaining One-fourth Part (which the Petitioners conceive will be adequate for the Purpose) may continue to be collected, to satisfy such Demands as shall at any Time appear to be due for the Loss of, or Damage done to, Lands, Hereditaments, or Property, occa-honed by the said new Cut, and for taking up the Shoals, and keeping the said Harbour in a proper State and Condition, with a discretionary Power to the said Commissioners to lower or increase the said remaining Duties, so that the same shall not at any Time

exceed One-fourth Part of the Duties now collected in pursuance of the said recited Act: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for the Purposes aforesaid, and that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall appear just and reasonable.

The House being informed that Mr. Ilarri/on, from Report from the Board of Land Revenue, attended at the Door; L^ndRcvenue. he was called in; and, at the Bar, presented to the House, pursuant to the Directions of an Act of Parliament,

A Fourth Report of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the State and Condition of the Woods,

Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, and to fell dr alienate Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents.

And then he withdrew.

And the Title of the said Report was read.

The said Report is as followeth; viz.

To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled.

The Fourth Report of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the State and Condition of the Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, and to fell or alienate Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents.

Since the Delivery of our Report on the Forest of Dean, towards the End of the last Session of Parliament, we have been employed chiefly in collecting Information concerning the State and Condition of other of His Majesty’s Forests; and we flattered our-selves that we Should have been prepared to lay be- fdre the Legislature a Report on the New Fore/, together with a Plan of it, made under our Direction, from which, with the Approbation of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, we judged it proper to order a Map to be engraved: But the Severity of the Weather having prevented our Surveyors from compleating their Business, and full An livers not being yet returned to all our Enquiries, we have found ourselves under the Necessity of deferring our Report on the Neva Forest some Time longer, being unwilling to make any Report on a Subject of lo much Consequence before our Information concerning it should be rendered as compleat as possible.

The Delay occassioned by thefie Means being unavoidable, and the Act by which we are appointed requiring that we should deliver a Report within a limited Time after the Commencement of each Session of Parliament, we propose, in Compliance with that Requisition, to take the present Occasion of dating what we have done, in purl'uance of the Powers veiled in us to fell or alienate Fee Farm or other Unimproveable Rents, since the Delivery of our Report on that Subjectin the Month of December 1787.

The Sale of the Fee Farm Rents belonging to the Crown is certainly an Object of great Convenience to many

127

many Individuals, by affording them an Opportunity of exonerating their Estates from the Charge, and themselves from the Inconvenience, of a Yearly Attendance at a distant Audit, at an Expence in many Initances far exceeding the Amount of the Rents. This the Act of Parliament has provided for, by an easy and simple Mode of Conveyance, and at a small Expence. The Sale is also a Measure of some Advantage to the Crown: By investing the Produce in the Public Funds, an Income of greater Amount is obtained, liable to no Diminution, and receivable with very little Trouble, and without Expence; and the Salaries and Allowances of the Receivers and Bailiffs employed in the CoBeftion of the Rents, which are a very heavy Charge on this small Branch of Revenue, will be gradually lessened.

To secure to the Proprietors of Estates chargeable with any such Rents the Benefit intended to them by this Measure, a Clause was infersed in the Act of Parliament, directing the Preference of Purchase to be given to them from the Time of the Commencement of the Act, in July 1786, to the ift of January 1788 j and, in order that every one inclined to take the Benefit of this Provision might be apprized of the Opportunity, as well as of the Means of doing it, we took every Method in our Power to make the same publicly known, by inferring Advertisements in the London and Country Newspapers, and by directing the Receivers to circulate printed Notices of the Sale at successive Audits. A very considerable Number of Proprietors accordingly availed themselves of it, within the Time limited by the Act for giving the Preference to them; and many Purchases have since been made by other Proprietors, who, notwithstanding our Advertisements, had not obtained an earlier Knowledge of the Sale.

The Act having required that we Should fell these Rents for the best Price we could obtain, under certain Limitations therein prescribed, we endeavoured, previous to the Commencement of the Sale, to obtain the best Information of the R^ites or Prices at which Rents of this Kind were commonly fold among private Owners; and upon mature Consideration of all relative Circumstances, particularly of the Small-ness of the Payments in general, and the Convenience arising from the Purchase of such Rents to the Owners of the Estates on which they were charged, and that the Purchase ^f the Rents would also extinguish the additional Charges of Acquittance Fees, Alienation Fees, Letters, Messengers, and other incidental Expences, added by the Receivers (Sometimes to a considerable Amount) it was our Opinion that it would, on the Whole, be well worth the while of Owners of Estates lo circumstanced to buy off these Incumbrances at the Rate of Thirty-Years Purchase of the Net Payment to the Crown.

Upwards of Sixteen hundred Rents have been Ibid. and to near 1,200 different Proprietors: But the Payments being mostly very small, the Net Annual Amount of them, deducing the Land Tax on such as were charged with it, does not exceed One thousand Three hundred and Seventy Pounds. The Purchase Money arising from the Sale of these Rents is £.41,000. somewhat more than Forty-one thousand Pounds, £>Sj,oooo. with which we have purchased Fifty-five thousand Pounds Capital Stock in the 3 per Cent. Consolidated Bank Annuities, leaving a Small Surplus yet unin vested.

The greater Number of the Rents which we have hitherto disposed of have been sold to the Persons by whom they were paid; some Rents have however been purchased by others, in order to be annexed to neighbouring Manors and Estates; and we have lately received Proposals for purchasing the Whole of the unfold Rents in some Counties, probably with a View of felling them out again at advanced Prices, to the

Proprietors of the Estates out of which they are payable.

Though we have not yet fold any Rents for less than Thirty Years Purchase, yet, as it cannot be expected that Persons intending to buy a Number of Rents of this Kind together, in order to make a Profit of them by Sale, will give so large a Price, we shall think it prudent to make some Abatement in the Terms, in order to encourage the Sale; and as the Time limited by the Act for giving the Preference of Purchase to the Proprietors of the.Estates is expired, we shall think it right to treat with any other Persons desirous of becoming Purchasers, and willing to give a fair and reasonable Price.

A Petition of the Inhabitants of the Town and Port of New Shoreham, and the Towns, Boroughs, and Parishes, within the Rape of Bramber, and Borough of New Shoreham, in the County of Sussex, and the Neighbourhood thereof, was presented to the House, and read; Reciting an Act made in the Thirty-third Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for erecting Piers and other Works for the Security and Improvement of the Harbour of New Shoreham, in the County of Sussex, and for keeping the same in Repair; and Setting forth. That, contrary to the Spirit and Meaning of the said Act, the Acting Commissioners never applied to the Justices at the Quarter Sessions for any Adjustment of their Account, agreeable to the Act of Parliament, until they applied for a Reduction of the Duties, which the Justices refused interfering with, as they could not take Cognizance of their Proceedings, for this Reason, that the Purposes, for which the said Act had been granted, never, in their Opinion, had been fulfilled or executed; and that, some Time after the passing of the said Act, the Commissioners for putting the same into Execution, at a large Expence, caused certain Cuts to be made, and Piers and Works to be erected, within the said Harbour, all of which Works were washed away before the same were fully completed, not by the Violence of the Sea altogether, but by the Error of the Engineer, employed in making the Pier-Heads, cutting off Ten and Twelve Feet of Timber from divers of the Piles belonging to the said Pier-Heads, by reason whereof, as soon as the Water was let in through the new Cut and between the Plcr-Heads, the Waters

every Tide coming into the Harbour, and returning back out of the fame, soon made a Passage under the Piles, whereby they were left in a fwinging and vibrating Posture until they were washed down; and that large Sums of Money were borrowed for the Purposes aforesaid, and secured upon the Rates and Duties imposed by the said Act, and all the Rates and Duties, made payable by the said Act upon the several Articles therein particularly enumerated, have been'uniformly raised, levied, and paid by the Petitioners and others subject thereto, and the same still continues to be enforced and received; and that the Petitioners have caused Enquiry to be made into the Annual Amount thereof, and find that from the Month of1787 to the Month of May 1788 the Receipt for the same appears to have been £.907. 6s. id. which the Petitioners have every Reason to believe has been equalled since the Act for Registering of Shipping took Place, and taking the Average Receipts thereof in every preceding Year, it will amount, upon a Computation thereof from the ift of July 1760 to the ill of July 1788, taking the same at Twenty-eight Years, to the enormous Sum of £. i6,8co; and that the Petitioners have made proper Enquiries into the Debts and Expences incurred by the said Commissioners on Account of the said Works and Harbour, and for the due Payment of which the said Rates and Duties are by the said Act made chargeable, and find that the same amounts to the Sum of £. 16,000, or thereabouts, and that a great Part, if not the Whole thereof, hath been paid off and discharged by the said Commissioners, out of the Receipts for, and on Account of, the said Rates and Duties, and that a large Balance of Money, arising from the said Rates and Duties, is now remaining in the Hands of the said Commissioners; and that the Cut, Piers, and other Works, erected and made in the said Harbour of New Shoreham, by virtue of the Powers in the said Act contained, before the same could be completed, were, in or about the Month of March 1764, broken down, destroyed, and washed away, owing, as the Petitioners believe, to the Badness of the Work of the Engineer, and the same were never afterwards repaired, re-erected, or made, but the said Harbour from that Time hath been wholly without, and unprovided with, any of the Piers or Works, intended by the said Act for the Security and Improvement thereof; and that there is now as great or greater Necessity for Piers and other Works,

for Security and Improvement of the said Harbour, as existed at the Time of the making of the said Act, with this Advantage in the present Exigencies of the same over the former, that, from accurate Plans and Surveys, which the Petitioners have caused to be made by Men of the bed Judgment and Integrity, it appears, that if new Piers and other Works, for the Security and Improvement of the said Harbour, according to the Plan and Survey annexed to the Petition, were now to be made, the same might be done with much greater Advantages, and at but little more Expence, than the former Works intended by the said Act were or could have been erected, for the following Reasons — Firff, that if new Piers and other Works, for the Security and Improvement of the said Harbour, were adopted according to the said Plan and Survey, a moll capital Harbour and Bason for the Accommodation of Shipping might be made, with the Addition,of Three powerful Sluices for the Purpose of keeping any Shoals or Banks from accumulating before the said Harbour’s Mouth, and a large Tract of rich Land thereby, by reason of its Contiguity to the said River, near the present Harbour’s Mouth, would be saved, otherwise, in Time, a great deal would be totally loft; — Secondly, that the Harbour, when completed according to the said Plan and Survey, will be one of the best Tide Harbours In England as to Navigation, and mult be of the greatest 1 Utility

29 Geo. III. 16° Februarii.

Utility to Government, and all surrounding Nations, from its Situation, as it lies at the very Bottom of the Bay between the Isle of Wight and in

the County of Stiffen, and will, when completed, have at full Tides near Thirty Feet of Water, without any Shoals, and all Vessels harbouring the re may lie a-float in the said intended new Bason, according to the said Plan and Survey, and, when going out of the said intended Pier-Heads, will drop immediately into deeper Water, into the Sea, and so continue till they have made a good Offing, which the Situation of the former Piers and Works could not have admitted — Thirdly, thar, in a Short Time, the present Passage or Outlet to the Sea will get into such a dangerous Situation, that the Navigation and Trade will be greatly injured, if not effectually destroyed; that Three different Estimates have been given in by the said Engineers, the first Plan and Survey whereof amounted to f.8,000, the second to 11,000, and the third

to £. 13,000, which is the greatest Expence it can amount to, as appears by the said Survey; and further Setting forth. That, unless fume new Piers and other Works for the Security and Improvement of the said Harbour Should be made, the Petitioners from the said Port of New Sboreham, and other Traders to and from thence, will not only have paid down large Sums of Money on Account of the Rates and Duties by the said Act imposed, but will also continue liable to pay the said several Rates and Duties, without enjoying the Benefits by the said Act intended, for the Petitioners are well advised, that although by the Clause in the said Act, which directs, that when it Should appear to the Justices therein mentioned, and be so certified, that the Purposes of the Act had been complied with, that One-third Part of the Duties thereby granted Should ccafe, and the other Two-thirds thereof continue to be collected, for keeping the said Piers and other Works in good and sufficient Repair, yer, in the Events which have happened, neither the said Duties, by the Act directed to cease, can confidently cease, the Intention of the said Act not being fully answered, nor, without the Interposition of Parliament, can new Piers and other Works be now erected, in the Stead of those washed away and destroyed, for Want of sufficient Power and Authority in the said Commissioners to erect and make new Piers and other Works for the Improvement and Benefit of the said Harbour, according to the Exigency of the present Cafe; and that the Petitioners, underdanding that the present Acting Commissioners of the said Harbour intend petitioning Parliament for a Reduction of Three-fourths of the present Duties now granted by the said Act, and that only One-fourth Part diould remain for the maintaining and keeping the said Harbour in Repair, the Petitioners beg Leave to inform the House, that in a few Years (Should such a Reduction take Place) the said Commissioners will be under the same Predicament of praying the Aflidance of Parliament to support them in laying on again a great Proportion of those Duties they are now so anxious of reducing, in order to preserve and support the Trade of the said Harbour: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill to amend the said Act, made in the Thirty-third Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, “An Act for erecting Piers and other “ Works for the Security and Improvement of the “ Harbour of New Shoreham,in the County of “ and for keeping the same in Repair,” and to excend the Provisions of the said Act to the executing of a new Pier, or new Piers, and other Works, in the said Harbour, for the Security and Improvement of the fame, according to the said Plan and Survey, and to direct, that the Expences attending this Petition, and the making and passing the said Act, or amending the Vol. XLIV.

fame by One or more Clause or Clauses here prayed, be defrayed out of the Arrears of the Rates and Duties now in the Hands of the said Commissioners for putting in Execution the former Act, so far as the same will extend to pay, and the Deficiency to be made good out of other Rates and Duties to be imposed by such new Bill and Act, or Clause or Clauses to be added to tile now prelcnc Act, or in such other Mode as the House shall direct.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and r.*port the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House.

And it is referred to Sir Cecil Mr. Peachey,

dec.: And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to lend for Persons, Papers, and Records.

A PETITION of the principal Owners and Proprietors of Lands, Commons, Tythes, and Estates, within the Open and Common Fields of South Kilworth, in the County of Leicester, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves and the rest of the said Proprietors, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are possessed of several Lands and Estates within the Open and Common Fields, Common Meadows, Common Pastures, and other Commonable Grounds, in the Manor and Parish of South Kilworth aforesaid, which lie inconveniently intermixed and dispersed over the Whole of the said Parish in small Parcels, and, in their present State, are incapable of any considerable Improvement; and that the said Open and Common Fields, and other Commonable Grounds, are very fit and proper to be divided and inclosed, and would thereby be of much greater Profit and Advantage to the several Proprietors and Persons interested therein: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for dividing and inclosing the Open and Common Fields, Common Meadows, Common Pastures, Common Grounds, Heath, and Waste Grounds, within the Manor and Parish aforesaid, under such Regulations as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring iri a Bill* pursuant to the Prayer of the said Petition: And that Mr. Hungerford and Mr. Pocbin do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

A Petition of the Magistrates for the County of Southampton, and of the Grand Jury at the Assizes holden in and for the said County, assembled at an Adjournment of the General Quatter Session of the Peace for the said County, held during the Assizes;, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners, having fully and deliberately considered of an Act of the last Session of Parliament for better securing the Rights of Persons qualified to vote at County Elections, are of Opinon, that the said Act is totally inadequate to answer the Purposes for which it was intended, and from its extreme Intricacy and Trouble, and being chiefly vested in the Hands of Persons who are unaccullomed to such Business, mull necessarily create great Confusion and Delay, and will, as the Petitioners conceive, rather tend to lessen and abridge the Rights of Freeholders, than to pro-tedl and secure the same j and that, besides the Improbability of the Act being ever carried fully into Effect, the Expence thereof to the said County, where there are Five hundred Districts, as well as to the Kingdom at large, will be enormous, and comes at a very improper Time, when most Counties are burthened with the more necessary and useful Expence of building new G/ols and Penitentiary Houses, in which Expences the said County is already involved, and also now liable to a very heavy Charge to be made on them by the King’s Printers for the Books and Papers already sent down, amounting, as is supposed, to upwards of £. 1,000; and that the Petitioners apprehend, by the Operation of the said Act, many Freeholders will be deprived of their Rights and Immunities, inasmuch as several Penalties are inflicted on Persons offending against the Provisions thereof, on which Account the Petitioners conceive a large Portion of Eledlors will refrain from Registering their Freeholds, merely from the Apprehension of subjecting themselves to the Inconvenience and Expence of Suits in a Court of Juf-Vol. XLIV.

tice, as it is oftentimes difficult to determine the Validity of Votes of a doubtful Nature; and that the Petitioners also conceive; that, if the said Act was to be carried into Effect, it would, in a great Measure, if not wholly, prevent the due Execution of the several Acts of the Seventh and Eighth Of Kiftg William the Third, Cap. 25, and the Twenty-fifth of His present Majesty, Cap. 84, made for the better ordering Elections in divers Cafes, and they are therefore of Opinion, that the said Act of the last Session, for the Rca-fons before assigned, ought to be repealed: And therefore praying the House to take this Petition into Consideration, and; if they shall judge it fit and expedient, that they would repeal the fame, and that the House will take into Consideration the great Expence the Petitioners have been involved in by the said Act, and adopt such Measures as may relieve them from the Burthen thereof.

A Petition of the Freeholders of the County of Radnor, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners apprehend many Inconveniences will arise from carrying the said Act into Execution, as well as its being oppressive to Rack Tenants, who, not being Freeholders, and uninterested, are yet obliged to pay the County Rates, from whence the great Expences of carrying the said Act into Execution are to be defrayed: And therefore praying the House to take the Repeal of the said Act into Consideration, and to do therein as to them shall seem meer.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table.

A Petition of the Baillies and Town Council of the Town of Greenockt and of several other Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by an Act passed in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, *' An Act for deepening, “ cleansing, and making more commodious, the Harbours of the Town of Greenock, for supplying the “ Inhabitants with fresh and wholesome Water, and “ for paving, cleansing, lighting, and watching the “ Streets, and other public Places within the said “ Town,” certain Powers and Authorities were given to the Baillies of the Town of Greenock, and to the other Persons therein mentioned and described as Trustees and Commissioners for carrying the Purposes of the said Act into Execution; and that the said Trustees and Commissioners have proceeded in executing the said Act, and have borrowed and advanced several Sums of Money upon the Credit of the Duties and Rates thereby granted, which Sums, together with the Rates and Duties collected by virtue of the said Act, have been duly laid out pursuant to the Directions thereof, and great Progress has been made in the public Works thereby directed, but the same cannot be effectually completed, and kept in good Order and Repair, and the other Purposes of the said Act fulfilled, unless the Term thereof be enlarged, and farther and additional Powers granted to the Trustees and Commissioners, and other proper Persons, for that Purpose, and the said Act be explained and amended in several Particulars; and it would greatly tend to the more speedy completing of the said Works, if certain Vessels coming into the said Port and Harbour, which are now exempted from Payment of the Rates and Duties, were subjected to the Payment thereof; and that the said Harbour of the Town of Greenock is not sufficiently large for the Reception and convenient lying of Vessels resorting thereto, and it would be of great public Utility, and of great Benefit and Advantage to the Trade and Commerce of the said Town, if the said Harbours were enlarged, and proper Quays and Piers made and credled for the Reception and Safety of Ships and

To prove the Allegations of the first-mentioned Petition, Charles Lyell, Esquire, being examined, said,

S

That the ordinary Methods provided by the Laws of Scotland for repairing the Highways have been found insufficient for repairing and upholding the principal Roads leading through the County of Forfar, which are become so deep and ruinous in many Places that Travellers cannot pass without great Danger.

To prove the Allegations of the second-mentioned Petition, Charles Lyell, Esquire, being examined, said,

That the Powers granted by Law relative to Highways, Bridges, and Ferries, and the Services thereby authorized to be exaCled in Scotland, have not been found sufficient for making, widening, repairing, and keeping in Repair, the Roads, Bridges, and Ferries, in the County of Forfar, and the Performance of Statute Labour when rigorously exacted has been found very unequal and oppressive; that it would be more equitable and convenient if a moderate Assessment, or Conversion in Money, was paid in lieu thereof.

the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, of the 25th of April 1774, relative to Turnpike Bills, had not been complied with, but the Piece of Road intended to be added to the Trust is not above One hundred Yards in Length, and that it is not intended to erect any Gate, or take any Toll thereon j and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followed!; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, James Morell, Esquire, being examined, said. That Wheatley is a considerable Village, in which there are several Inns, with large Stables, and other Conveniences, erected for the Accommodation of Travellers — That the Turnpike Road from St to for-

merly went through the said Village, but has been since turned and carried on the North Side thereof, near to tnoft or all of the Yards belonging to the said Inns — That a Branch of the said Turnpike Road separates from the other Part thereof, near the Ealt End of the said Village, and goes to Enfiow Bridge.

That there is a Road not more than One hundred Yards in Length between the Two before-mentioned Branches of the said Turnpike Road, near the West End of the said Village, and which is narrow, incommodious, and out of Repair; and that if the said Piece of Road, which connects the Two Branches of the present Turnpike Road, were to be put under the Care and Management of the Trustees of the said Turnpike, and the present Turnpike, lying between such Piece of Road and the Junction of the Oxford and Enfiow Branches, were to remain Turnpike, instead of being discontinued, as intended by the said Bill, it would be beneficial to the said Village of Wheatley, and an Accommodation to the Public; and that after such Pieceofadditional Road shall be properly amended and widened, that Part of the said Enfiow Branch of Road which lies between such Road of Communication and a Public House near the East End of the said Village of Wheatley, where the said Two Branches of Road unite, may be discontinued if the 1 ruflees shall see fit to discontinue repairing the fame.

Mr. John Leigh being examined, said. That the Acts for the better Relief and Employment of the Poor, and amending the Highways* and for the better Regulation of the Nightly Watch and Beadles, within the said Parish, are found in some Respects defective and inconvenient, particularly with respect to the Clauses granting an Appeal against the Rate to the Quarter Sessions, for where a Rate has been quashed upon an Appeal, Persons have removed out of the Parish before a new Rate could be made and collected, and the Money charged on such Persons has on that Account been loll. And the Witness said. Doubts had arisen how far the Vestry, or Governors and Directors of the Poor, were authorized in paying Salaries, and making Allowances to their Clerks and other Officers.

Mr. JohnAuftin being examined, said, That there are several Defects in the Act ‘for paving, cleanfin?, and lighting the said Parish, particularly with respect to the Time and Manner of making and collecting the Rate and that the Mode directed ro be pursued in paying off the several Creditors who have advanced.

And the Witness further said. That no Meeting of the Vestry can be holden, unless the Rector of the Parish (or in his Absence his Curate) and the Churchwardens, are present, which has frequently been found inconvenient; and that the present Vestry Room is too small, and otherwise incommodious for transacting the Business of the Parish. And he added. That it would be a great Convenience to the Vestry Men, if they were nOt confined to hold all their Meetings in the present Vestry Room, and if they were authorized

Old Street Road Bill presentcdi

the Town of Paisley; that they are fully convinced of the Utility of good Roads through the County, and are much interested in them, Paisley being the chief Manufacturing Town, but they apprehend that, when Taws are to be made for such Purposes, they ought to affeCfc the Subjects in an equal Manner, and be as little liable to Partiality or Oppression as the Nature of the same will admit; and that the Petitioners have Reason to believe from the Bill, that there is a Difference intended to be made between Proprietors or Occupiers of Land keeping Horses, and those in Towns and Villages who have no Land, the first are to be charged for Statute Labour at the Rate of Twenty Shillings for each Hundred Pounds Valuation of their Grounds, which, in many Cafes, will not amount to more than Two Shillings for each Horse they keep, and the last ate to be charged with Five Shillings for each Horse, and the Petitioners presume that the Conversion of the Labour into Money, or requiring actual Labour in the Option of the Trustees, has a Tendency to oppress, the one not being equivalent to the other; that the Conversion is Five Shillings for a Man and Horse for Six Days, and the usual Hire for a Man and Horse is Three Shillings and Six Pence per Day, therefore the Man called out to Work must sustain a Loss of Sixteen Shillings Annually; and that the Town of Paisley is Three distinct Parishes, containing os many Inhabitants as any District in the Bill, yet they are classed with Two other Parishes of great Extent, through which Roads do pass that can be of no Use to the Petitioners, and in these Parishes there are from Twenty to Thirty Gentlemen qualified for Trustees in Terms of the proposed Bill, while the Magistrates and Council, being Superior of the Town’s Lands, renders it impossible for any Man therein (however much hU. Property or Respectability) to be a Trustee, and, by the proposed Billy the Two eldest Magistrates, only <are to be named Trustees in the Town, and joined to near Thirty others in the District, Five of, whom art declared a Quorum, so that the Trustees from the Town must in all Meetings be in a Minority, although they represent a People that will pay nearly One Half of the Money, that can be levied in the whole District; and that the said Bill, if pa!Ted into a Law, will put it in the Power of the Trustees to carry the Statute Labour of the Town, of Paisley into any other Parish they think fit, and prevent it being laid out in the Parishes in which the Conversion Money is collected; that it ought to be laid out upon Roads in the Parishes.where it is1 collected seems to have been the Intention of the Legislature at paQing Several Similar Acts, particularly those for the Shires of Lanark, Had* Berwick, Linlithgow, Kirkcudbright, Edinburgh, and Argyle: And therefore praying to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the Said Bill.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee to whom the said Bill is committed; and that the Petitioners be heard, by themselves or Counsel, before the said Committee, upon their Petition, if they think, fit.

whom the Petition of several Gentlemen, Clergy, Freeholders, Merchants, Tradesmen, Manufacturers, and others, redding or trading within the County of Southampton, was referred; That the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, of the 25th of April 1774, relative to Navigation Bills, had been complied with -, and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition j and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act, pasted in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Years of King Charles the Second, for making divers Rivers navigable, or otherwise paftable for Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, was read; whereby it appeared that the River Anton or Test,from the Borough of Andevor, through several Parishes, and through the Borough of Stockbridge, and through or near Romsey, to Redbridge, there to join the Southampton River, and so communicate with the Sea, was particularly mentioned in the said Act to be made navigable: And,

Mr. Ralph Etwall, Junior, being examined, said. That nothing has been done under the said Act to make the said River Anton or Test navigable.

Mr. Thomas King being also examined, said, That he knows the Borough of Andevor, and its Neighbourhood; that the Country through which the said River runs is become much more populous, and greatly increased in Trade and Manufactures since the Time of passing the said Act, and a Means of conveying by Water any Coals, Salt, Timber, and other heavy Goods, which it is presumed was then thought necessary, must now of course be more essentially so: Then,

Mr. Charles Roberts, an Engineer and Surveyor, was called in; and being shewn the Plan of the intended Navigation, said. That he had surveyed the Lands through which the Cut or Canal is intended to be made, and is of Opinion, that a Navigable Cut or Canal for the Passage of Boats and other Vessels, with heavy Burthens, may be made near the Course of the River Anton or Test, from the Borough of Andevor

aforesaid

aforesaid to the said Southampton River, and so to communicate with the Sea, which will be of much more general Use as a Navigation than the said River Anton or Test can possibly ever be made, and will be of great Convenience and Utility to the Trade, Commerce and Manufactures of the Country through which it is intended to be made.

Mr. King and Mr. Etwall being again examined, confirmed the Evidence of Mr. , respecting

the Utility of the proposed Canal; adding. That thereby the Price of heavy Goods from London will be much reduced, and the Town of and the neigh-

bouring Country, will be supplied with Coals and other Articles from Redbridgeat a much less Expence than they arc at present.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from or near the Borough of in the County of

F.ly Drainage Hill committed,

this Country, without the Assistance of Negroes, the Natives of a warm Climate, and accustomed from their Infancy to the scorching Rays of the Sun under the Torrid Zone, and thereby enabled to sustain, without Injury to their Health, that Labour which would soon prove destructive to an European Constitution; that all the Nations in who possess

Plantations in Countries subject to the same Degree of Heat, constantly make Use of the same Means of Cultivation, which may therefore be fairly deemed indispensibly necessary to their Success; and that to enforce the Use of every Means which Humanity can fugged, and Prudence dictate, for the Support and Comfort of those needful Assistants, and to secure to them the Protection of wife and satisfactory Laws (a BldTing unknown in their native Land) will be a Work truly deserving the Attention of the British Legislature, but to abolish the Slave Trade would effectually deprive the poor Africans of every Means of Civilization, and every Chance for Improvement: And therefore praying.

Northern Road, in the Parish of Enfield, and from the Place where the Watch House in Edmonton formerly stood, to the Market Place in Enfield, in the County of Middlesex, and for lighting, watching, and watering Part thereof, and for repealing certain Acts of Parliament relating to the said Roads, and for amending, widening, and keeping in Repair the Road from Newington Green to Bush Hill,in the Parish of Edmonton, in the said County j and Setting forth, That it is proposed by the said Bill to widen and amend the High Road, leading from Shoreditch to Enfield Town, which, in the Judgment of the Petitioners, is, at this Time, wholly unnecessary, the present Road being in very good Repair, and the repealing the Act of Parliament, under which the said Road has hitherto been kept in Repair, and carrying into Execution the Plan proposed by the said Bill, in the Manner thereby intended, will be attended with a very great Expence, and will be more an Object of private Convenience to some neighbouring Individuals, than of public Utility} and that the Petitioners are informed it is proposed, in case the said Bill Should pass into a Law, that the Parish of Edmonton shall Annually pay, towards making and altering the said Roads, the Sum of £. 120, out of the Rates to be raised in the said Parish for the Maintenance of the Poor, which is not only novel, but would be a very great Burthen upon the Parish; and that the Petitioners are already so burthened with Poor, as to have been obliged very lately to double the former Rate levied in the said Parish, and therefore they cannot but object to any further Charge being laid on the said Rate, and the more especially as they conceive the present Bill, so far as the same relates to the Roads in the said Parish, is unnecessary, the Acts now in Force being fully sufficient to carry into Execution all the Purposes comprized in the present Bill, as relative to the said last mentioned Roads: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves, their Counsel, and Agents, against such Parts of the said Bill as may affect them, and that the same may not pass as it now Hands, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Commtitee, to whom the said Bill is committed; and that the Petitioners be heard, by themselves, their Counsel, or Agents, before the said Committee, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That it be an Instruction to the said Committee, That they do admit Counsel to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition.

Report from

Committee app inted to er qMire into the State of Scaffuhls in the Strand, See,

Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

Your Committee have, pursuant to the Order of the House, enquired into the Matter to them referred, and called before them several Persons; whose Examination is as follows:

Mr. Edward Waters, Surveyor to the Committee For Paving, in the Parish of Saint Martin's in the Fields, being examined, was asked, Whether he knew of any Scaffolds, or Temporary Buildings, erected within his District ? to which he said. There are several in the Strand, which he deems very dangerous, from their being slenderly built, and from their being placed upon Shop Fronts and other unsafe Places — That many of them are made to contain Twenty or more Persons. — He has seen about Twelve of these that he thinks very dangerous; they are dangerous for the People they are intended to contain, as well as to those who may be walking in the Street. They are both dangerous from the Circumstance of their being too (lightly built, and from the Probability of Persons pressing forward from the Inflde of the Houses. That he can take upon him to say, as a Surveyor, that he thinks there is a considerable Danger of Accidents happening from them. — And he added. That he has seen several other Buildings, between Saint Martin's Parish and Catherine Street, which he believes to be dangerous.

Being asked. Whether he apprehended Danger arising from any Number of People (landing behind the Parapet Walls? he said, He does, both from the Looseness of the Coping Stones, and the Thinness of the Parapet Walls, and many of them being old and decayed. That a printed Notice was sent, todifcourage People, Within the Parish of Saint M, from making any such Buildings; but he thinks it has not produced any Effect, except in One Instance, where they have abated a Part. They are certainly such as would be presented, if there was Time sufficient. That he has also seen, in the Streets leading to the Strand, Two Scaffolds; One made to contain about Fifty People, in Durham Street, and another smaller in Saint Martin's Lane; the latter is now only making, so that he cannot speak to its Safety; but it certainly is a Nui-fance, and the other is positively dangerous.

Then your Committee examined Sir William Chambers, who said. That he has seen several Scaffolds that have been put upon Buildings that are scarcely sufficient to support themselves, so that, unless some Props are put under, he considers them as dangerous — he means principally,those near Exeter Change. — There is Danger in Persons (landing behind Parapet Walls, as they are very thin, and the Coping Stones generally loose — He thinks the Surveyors of the Parishes Should certainly examine the Scaffolds before they can be safe to be used: Then

Mr. Samuel Drake, Surveyor under the Building Act for the Parish of Saint Martin's, being examined, was asked, What he knows of any Scaffolds, or Temporary Buildings, erected within his District ? to which he said, He has seen several along the Strand, which he apprehends to be dangerous — They are built over the Shop Fronts, and with Rails round them, which, if pressed against, would fly immediately into the Street — That he believes many of them are insecure — He apprehends the Joists, to which some of them are fixed, may be decayed, and not able to bear the Weight that may possibly be on them — That many of them are too slenderly built; and he really takes upon N him, as a Surveyor, to say, that he thinks there is a considerable Danger of Accidents happening from them — He has also taken Notice of those at Exeter Change, but has not examined them — They seem unsafe; but he cannot speak to that, — He apprehends

Danger arising from Persons (landing behind the Parapet Walls, as some of them are very weak, and in many Cafes decayed, and are very likely to be pulhed into the Streets — That he has in some Iofbnces endeavoured to discourage the making these Buildings — And being asked, With what Fffeft ? lie said, One or Two have taken them down: Then

Mr. John Marquand, Surveyor to the Commissioners for paving Westminster, being examined, said. That he received an Order from the Commissioners to examine the Scaffolds in the Districts remaining under their Jurisdiction — That there is a Scaffold in the Savcy, which is placed over the Projection of the Window; there is another in Saint Mary-le-Strand, opposite the New Church, which is also placed upon the Projeftion of the Window and the Cornice, which are too small to be particularly dangerous; but there are many that he thinks extremely so; and they Should be all taken down — That he noticed the Scaffold over Exeter Change, which seems very (lightly built, and dangerous for the Number of Persons it is intended for — That he can take upon him to say, as a Surveyor, that he thinks there is considerable Danger of Accidents happening — That he himself saw a melancholy Instance upon Tower Hill, by a Scaffold falling, which had been built without sufficient Strength and Judgment. — And he further said, That he ought to add, that he has seen that near the New Church, which appears to be built with sufficient Strength to be safe for the Number of Persons it is proposed to contain — That he apprehends Danger arising from any considerable Number of Persons (landing behind Parapet Walls, both from the Weakness of the Parapet, and the Looseness of the Copings; and that he thinks this as dangerous as any of the Scaffolds that are built without Judgment.

IT appears to your Committee, by the Evidence of the several Surveyors whom they have examined. That several of the Scaffolds, and Temporary Buildings, in the Strand, and other Avenues to Saint Paul's, on the West Side of Temple Bar, are in such a State, as to oe likely to endanger the Lives of His Majesty’s Subjectsi Your Committee therefore beg Leave to submit to the Wisdom of the House their Opinion, that some Measures Should be taken, without Delay, to prevent the Mischiefs which may arile to the Public, if the Scaffolds and Temporary Buildings, describe’d in the Evidence now reported to the House, be suffered to continue in their present State.

Ordered, That the said Report be printed.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill to enable His Majesty to authorize, for a limited Time, in same of Necessity, the Importation of Bread, Flour, Indian Corn, and Live Stock, from any of the Territories belonging to the United States of America, into the Province of Quebec, and all the Countries bordering on the Gulph of Lawrence, and the islands within the said Gulph, and to the Coall of Labrador: And that Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Earl of Mornington, Mr. Attorney General, and Mr. Solicitor General, do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

Ordered, That such a Number of Copies of the several Papers, containing the Proceedings of His Majesty’s most Honourable Privy Council, and Information received, respecting an Infeft supposed to infeft the Wheat of the Territories of the United States of America, which were presented to the House by Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, upon the 7th Day of this Instant April, be printed, as shall be sufficient for the Use of the Members of the House.

A Petition of the Proprietors of Estates in the Pftiiion from India Islands, and Merchants trading to the West Indies, residing in the City of Glafg and its Neigh- Abolition of bourhood, thereunto subscribing, was presented to ^'J^* the House, and read 5 Setting forth, That the Peti- ” tioners are much alarmed at the Bill proposed to be brought into Parliament, this Session, for abolishing the African Slave Trade, and are clearly of Opinion, that if, in the present Situation of the West India Islands, the said Bill shall pass into a Law, it will not only be attended with the most ruinous Consequences to many of the Petitioners, but also be of the greatest Detriment to the Navigation, Revenue, and Commerce of Great Britain; and that many of the Petitioners, upon the Faith of the Permanency of British Laws, have, at a great Expence, erected large Works on their Property in the West India Islands, for the Purpose of manufacturing Sugar and Rum, which t will become of little Value, if they are not allowed to import Negro Labourers from Africa, and, others of the Petitioners, upon the same Faith, have advanced large Sums of Money upon Landed Estates in the West Indies, and if the Proprietors of these Estates are prevented from importing Negro Labourers to cultivate them, as heretofore, the Security thereon to the Petitioners must become very precarious, and indeed the Estates themselves will fopn be a Burthen rather than a Benefit to the Proprietors, as it appears impossible to carry on their Cultivation, if the accustomed Liberty of importing Labourers is denied; and that all the Petitioners are dejeply imprefied with a Sense of the melancholy Effedli which the passing of such a Bill into a Raw will prbduce, not only upon the West India Islands, xmt also upon the Manufactures and Shipping of this Kingdom,! while at the same Time they are convinced it will be productive of the greatest Advantage to the Commercial Rivals of this Country: And therefore praying. That the said Bill may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, at the Bar of the House, against it.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

That, in Consequence of the Restrictions imposed upon the Hawkers and Pedlars by the Ninth and Eleventh Sections of a late Act, that useful and industrious Body of Men have suffered very great Inconvenience, which has prevented them from carrying on their Business, as they did before the said Act, and great Quantities of the Manufactures of the Town

and Neighbourhood of Manchester before the said Act were disposed of by them, to the very great Ad van* tage of the Manufactures, and of His Majesty’s Revenue; and that the Restrictions complained of have been very prejudicial to the Trade of Great Britain, not only by the almost Abolition of the Hawkers and Pedlars, but by having encouraged the Introduction of much larger Quantities of Contraband India Goods than were ever before imported, to the great Detriment of His Majesty’s Revenue, as well as Injury to the British Manufacturers: And therefore praying.

read } Setting forth. That, in the Bill now depending for explaining the Act of the Twenty-first Year of His present Majesty, for regulating and ascertaining the Importation of Corn and Grain within the several Ports and Places therein mentioned, is inserted a Clause,prohibiting the Importation of Corn or Grain, ground into Meal or Flour, or made into Bread or Biscuit (except from Ireland) and, the Petitioners conceive, however politic it may be, in most Cafes, to give all due Encouragement and Employment to the Manufactures and Subjects of the Kingdom, yet that this Principle Should not be applied to any Article of Provision, as any Restrictions or Difficulty in procuring the fame, may be attended with the most fatal Consequences; and that, by the said Bill, the City of Bristol, and the adjoining Counties of Somerset, Gloucester, and Monmouth, are formed into a District, and the Average Prices of fuclv District (to be ascertained and returned as in the said Bill is mentioned) are to govern all the Ports therein, as well with respect to the Importation, as to the Drawback to be allowed on Exportation; and that the City of Bristol being very large and populous, the Corn raised in the said Counties is chiefly brought to that Market, and as the Prices there must be increased by the Charges of Freight, Carriage, and Commission, the Petitioners conceive, that those Prices Should be the Standard for that District, and that the Port of Bristol should not be annexed to or regulated by the Prices at the small Towns in the said Counties, where the Expences of Carriage, &c. have not been incurred, and this is the same with respect to the Port of London, which gives the Prices for the adjoining Counties of Kent and Essex; and that the*Prices at which the Ports are to be opened are, under the Provisions of the said Bill, to be fixed by the Returns of the Average Prices in each District to be made by the Receiver of Corn Returns previous to every General Quarter Sessions of the Peace, and, the Petitioners conceive, should the Bill pass into a Law, it would be found more convenient and beneficial, if more frequent Periods were fixed for the making of such Returns; and that the Importation of Com in the Port of Bristol has been governed, for a Century past, by the Returns made by the Grand Jury at the Quarter Sessions, which Regulation, the Petitioners submit, is more easy in Practice, and less complex and burthensome, than the Provisions of the said Bill: And therefore praying, That the said Bill may not pass into a Law, or, if the Bill should pass, that the Clauses prohibiting the Importation of Corn or Grain ground into Meal or Flour, or made into Bread or Biscuits, may not be adopted, and that the Prices of Corn and Grain in the Port of Bristol may be the Standard of the District wherein it is included, and that the Returns for regulating Importations may be more frequent, and for such further Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the Bill to explain and amend an Act, made in the Twenty-first Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, An Act for further regulating and ascertaining the “ Importation and Exportation of Corn and Grain “ within several Ports and Places therein mentioned,” is committed.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

A Petition of several of the Freemen of the Corporation of Cutlers in Hallamshire, in the County of York, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners being informed that the African Slave Trade is shortly expected to become a Subject of Consideration, and the Cutlery' Wares, made by them, being sent in considerable Quantities to the Coast of Africa, and disposed of in Part as the Price of Slaves, the Petitioners may be supposed to be prejudiced in their Interests if the said Trade in Slaves should be abolished: But the Petitioners having always understood that the Natives of Africa have the greatest Aversion to Foreign Slavery, and defend themselves to the utmost of their Power again!! being sent away from their native Country, and frequently perish in Numbers in their Attempts to escape, the Petitioners beg Leave to represent to the House, That the Obligations they are under to consider the same of the Natives of Africa as their own is so much greater than any Inducements of Interest they can have in a Trade so much the Aversion and Dread of the People who are carried away by it, that the Petitioners think themselves called upon to request, that, as far as their Interest may be deemed a Part of the National Policy of continuing the said Trade, the same may be laid out of the Question, unless it Should appear to the House that any other Trade may

Right honourable Manager, in like Manner as in the preceding Year, introducing many Allegations, foreign from the express Charge, did, in direct Terms, charge the Petitioner with the horrid Crime of Murder, using the following Words 5 “ He ” (meaning the Petitioner) murdered that Man ” (alluding to Nundcomar) “ by the Hands of Sir Elijah Impey That the said Right honourable Manager, and the other Members appointed by the House with him, to be joint Managers of the Prosecution, have, at various Times declared, that they spoke by Instructions from this House, whose Representatives they were, and that they Should alledge nothing which they were not # prepared, and willing, to prove: That it would not become the Petitioner to suppose that such Allegations, so made in the Name, and by the Representatives of this House, were not made by the Command of the House, although no Charge containing them has been yet preferred against him: The Petitioner therefore, declaring that the above-recited Accusations arc all un-

true, and utterly unfounded, most humbly appeals to the Justice of the House, and prays, That such of them as properly fall within the immediate Cognizance of the House may be brought forward, and prosecuted in specific Articles, and that, in respect of the rest of them, such other Mode of Prosecution may be directed, or Means adopted by the House, as may enable the Petitioner to make the Refutation of these several Matters of grievous Crimination as public as the Charges themselves have been, or that the House will afford him such other Redress in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

The other Order of the Day being read,

That he is a Banker; that if a public Office for granting, and for purchasing under due RestridUons, Annuities for Lives, was properly established, he is of

Opinion

ever, can absolve the Subjects of this Realm, or any of them, from their Allegiance to His Majesty King George the Third, who is by Authority of the Legifla-turc the lawful King of this Realm, and of all the Dominions thereunto belonging — adly. That the Petitioners have also been accused of holding, as a Principle of their Religion, that implicit Obedience is due from them to the Orders and Decrees of Popes and General Councils, and that therefore if the Pope, or any General Council, should, for the Good of the Church, command the Petitioners to take up Arms against Government, or by any Means to subvert the Laws and Liberties of this Country, or to exterminate Persons of a different Religion from the Petitioners, the Accusers of the Petitioners assert, that the Petitioners hold themselves bound to obey such Orders or Decrees, on Pain of eternal Fire,” whereas the Petitioners positively deny that they owe any such Obedience to the Pope and General Council, or to either of them, and the Petitioners believe, that no Act, that is in itself immoral or difhoned, can ever be justified by, or under Colour, that it is done either for the Good of the Church, or in Obedience to any Ecclesiastical Power whatever: The Petitioners acknowledge no Infallibility in the Pope, and they neither apprehend nor believe, that their Disobedience to any such Orders or Decrees (should any such be given or made) could subject the Petitioners to any Punishment whatsoever: That the Petitioners do solemnly declare, that no Church, nor any Prelate, nor any Pried, nor any Assembly of Prelates or Priests, nor any Ecclesiastical Power whatever, hath, have, or ought to have, any Jurisdiction or Authority whatsoever within this Realm, that can directly or indirectly affect or interfere with the Independence, Sovereignty, Laws, Conditution, or Government thereof, or the Rights, Liberties, Persons, or Properties of the People of the said Realm, or of any of them, save only and except by the Authority of Parliament, and that any such Assumption of Power would be an Usurpation — 3dly. That the Petitioners have likewise been accused of holding, as a Principle of their Religion, that the Pope, by virtue of his Spiritual Power, can dispense with the Obligations of any Compact or Oath taken or entered into by any Person of the Religion of the Petitioners, that therefore no Oath of Allegiance, or other Oath, can bind the Petitioners, and confe-ouently that the Petitioners can give no Security for their Allegiance to any Government: That the Petitioners admit that this Concludon would be just, if the original Propofltion upon which it is founded were true, but the Petitioners positively deny that they hold any such Principle, and they do solemnly declare, that neither the Pope, nor any Prelate, nor any Pried, nor any Assembly of Prelates or Priests, nor any Ecclesiastical Power whatever, can absolve the Petitioners, or any of them, from, or can previously or subsequently dispense with, the Obligations of any Compact or Oath whatsoever — 4thly. That the Petitioners have also been accused of holding, as a Principle of their Religion, that not only the Pope, but even a Pried, has Power, at his Will and Pleasure, to pardon the Sins of Persons of the Religion of the Petitioners, and therefore that no Person of the Religion of the Petitioners can pofiibly give any Security for his Allegiance to any Government, inasmuch as the Pope, or a Pried, can pardon Perjury, Rebellion, and High Treason: That the Petitioners acknowledge also the Judness of this Conclusion, if the 'Proposition upon which it is founded were not totally false but the Petitioners do solemnly declare that, on the contrary, they believe that no Sin whatever can be forgiven at the Will of any Pope, or of any Priest, or of any Person whomsoever, but that a sincere Sorrow for pad Sin, a firm Resolution to avoid future Guilt, and every pofliblf Atonement to God and the

injured Neighbour, are the previous and indispensable Requisites to establish a well-founded Expectation of Forgiveness — .$thly. That the Petitioners have also been accused of holding as a Principle of their Religion, That«« Faith is not to be kept with Heretics,” so that no Government, which does not profess the same Religion as the Petitioners, can have any Security from the Petitioners for their Allegiance and peaceable Behaviour — That; the Petitioners reject, reprobate, and abhor, the Doctrine, that Faith is “ not to be kept with Heretics,” as being contrary to Religion, Morality, and common Honesty, and the Petitioners do hold, and solemnly declare, that no Breach of Faith with, or Injury to, or Hostility against, any Person whomsoever, can ever be justified by Reason of, or under Pretence that, such Person is an Hesaaic or an Infidel; and the Petitioners further solemnly declare, that they do make this Declaration and Protcftation, and every Part thereof, in the plain and ordinary Sense of the Words of the fame, without any Evasion, Equivocation, or Mental Reserva-tien, whatsoever, and the Petitioners conceive that they who thus solemnly disclaim and from their Hearts abhor, the above-mentioned abominable and yn-. christianlike Principles, ought not to be put upon

Level with any other Men who may hold and profess those Principles: And therefore praying, That the House will grant such Relief to the Petitioners as the House shall deem to be j uft.

Moore,

332 8 0 Maii.A. 1789.

Moore, of Sheffield, in the County of York, a Hawker and Pedlar, was convicted in £. 10 for felling Goods at a Fair, held at Saint in the said County,

contrary to the said Order of Sessions, but some Doubts arising on the Clause in the said Act, a State of the same was agreed on, and laid before an eminent Counsel, who gave it as his Opinion, That the said Hugh Moore was not liable to pay any Penalty for felling his Goods in any public Mart, Market, or Fair, notwithstanding the Justices had made the said Order; and that, by the Tenth Clause in the said Act, it is enacted, " That nothing therein contained “ Should extend, or be construed to extend, to hinder any Person or Persons from felling, or exposing to Sale, any Sorts of Goods or Merchandizes, in “ any Public Mart, Market, or Fair, but that such “ Persons might do therein as they lawfully might have done before the making the said Act,” by virtue of which Clause, the Revenue is greatly injured, and not only the Duties payable by the before-mentioned Act, but also those payable by the Act of the Ninth and Tenth of King William, greatly evaded by those Itinerant Traders, as great Numbers of them now travel from one End of the Kingdom to the other, felling their Goods without taking out any Licence, alledging the y are not by Law obliged to take a Licence, as they fell in Fairs and Markets only, on which Account they escape from Conviction, as Fairs or Markets are held almost every Day in the Week, in different Towns throughout such Parts of this Kingdom as they think proper to travel; and that the permitting those Itinerant Traders on Market and Fair Days felling Goods, either defective, or made on Purpose for such Sale, is a very great Injury to the Resident Traders, who are thereby prevented from disposing of their Goods, in the Manner they other-wile would, to enable them to discharge the Burthens of the State, the heavy Relit of Houses, and the Duties and Offices they are obliged to undertake in the City or Town in which they reside (none of which these Itinerants are liable unto): And therefore praying the House to take their same into Consideration, and prevent Hawkers, Pedlars, and all Petty Chapmen, under such Description, from coming into any City or Market Town to fell their Goods on Market or Fair Days, or at any other Times, to the great Injury of the Resident Trader, and to grant the Petitioners such further and other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

their said Manufactories, and also the Coals consumed by the Petitioners at Bradford and Frejhford, unavoidably pass through and pay Toll at the Bath Turnpike Gates, but never enter the said City: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by their Counsel and Agents, against the said Bill, and that such Relief may be given to the Petitioners as to the House shall seem meet and proper.

Houses within the several other Streets comprized in the said Bill; and that, as all the Streets within the said Parish have been new paved, the Petitioners apprehend they ought no longer to be charged with any higher Rates than are charged on the Owners and Occupiers of Houses in other Streets within the said Parish, and that the Debts incurred, and now due, on Account of paving the several Streets comprized in the said Bill, should be consolidated and made chargeable upon the Rates for paving, repairing, cleansing, and lighting the said Streets: And therefore praying the House to take their same into Consideration, and that they may have such Relief as to the House shall appear just and reasonable.

A Petition of several of the Inhabitants of the Parish of Saint George, Hanover Square, and others, whoftr Names arc thereunto subscribed, being many of them the nearest Relations or Friends of Persons whose Bodies have lately been interred in the common Burial Ground belonging to the said Parish, situate in Mount Street, was likewise presented to the House, and read; also taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth. That the Petitioners feel the Impropriety of the present Application for discontinuing the Use of the said Burial Ground (which has for Time immemorial been consecrated Ground, and is situate in a Centrical Part of the said Parish) and are much affetted with Apprehensions on Account of the Bodies of their Relations or Friends, which have been deposited therein, being liable to be disturbed, and who were interred upon the Faith that such Ground would have continued to be used as the common Burial Ground of the said Parish, being, from its Situation, more convenient to the Inhabitants in general than the Place which is proposed to be appropriated for that Purpose i And therefore praying. That they may be heard, by themselves, their Counsel, or Agents, against such Parts of the said Bill as authorize the discontinuing the common Use of the said Burial Ground, and that the same may not pass into a Law.

Time, whereas, if a Bridge be erected with One or even Two Apertures, the Navigation will be greatly impeded, and rendered so extremely dangerous, aa in a great Measure, if not totally, to prevent Ships of so great Burthen navigating above Selby, and thereby oblige the Traders of the City of Turk to change Bottoms, or have their Goods lightered up for the Space of about 25 Miles, the Distance between the City of York and Selby by Water 5 and that, in August last, a Meeting was held* in pursuance of a

public Advertisement, at Selby, of about Fourteen Gentlemen only, being Owners of Estates, or resident in that Neighbourhood, respecting the building the said intended Bridge, and they appointed a Second Meeting on the 3d of October following; and that, on the id of that Month, a General Meeting of the Citizens of York, called by public Hand. Bills, was held at the Guildhall in the said City, at which many of the Petitioners attended, and several Persons were examined, and it was thereupon unanimoqfly resolved, that the building any Bridge cross the River

Ouse-, at or near Selby, would occassion much Trouble, great Delay, and imminent Danger to all Perions navigating Ships and Vessels through the fame, would be extremely prejudicial to the Navigation of the said River, and also be very injurious and detrimental to the said City and Neighbourhood, and to all Places having any Communication therewith, and that the same Should be opposed; and that a Copy of such Resolutions was delivered at the said Meeting, held at Selby on the Day following, to which Resolutions it was said due Attention should be paid, and that Meeting being adjourned to the 20th of November following, the Purport of such Answer was inferred in the Advertisement appointing the fame, and the same Meeting was further adjourned to the nth of December, which, the Petitioners believe, was the last Meeting held by Advertisement relative to the BuG-ness, but no Notice was ever given to any of the Petitioners, or their Solicitor, of what was intended to be done, nor have any Plans been Ihcwn or delivered; and it being afterwards reported (and understood by the Petitioners) that the Subscription for building the said intended Bridge was not filled, the Petitioners, for those Reasons, and from the Length of Time elapsed, apprehended the same would not be applied for during the present Session of Parliament: And therefore praying. That they may be heard, by them-(elves or their Counsel, against the said Bill, that a reasonable Time may be allowed them to produce their Witnesses to prove the Dangers to be apprer hended therefrom, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

That by virtue of Two Acts, passed in the Thirteenth Year of King George the First, and in the Fifth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, the said Trustees are empowered to make the River Ouse more navigable for Ships and other Vessels, and to remove all Gravel Beds, and other Impediments whatsoever, which may hinder the Navigation either in failing or haling Ships or Vessels upon the said River, and are entitled to receive divers Tolls and Duties for Goods and Merchandize Conveyed upon the said River above a Place called Wharfs Mouth; and that the said Navigation hath been improved at a very considerable Expence, and particularly by the Erection of a very expenflve Lock and Dam, at the Distance of about Five Miles by

Water from the said City, in order to raise the Water in that Part of the River above the said Lock and Darn, and the Tide flows up to the said Dam, so that Vessels of considerable Burthen can safely navigate from the Sea to the said City; and that many Parts of the said River, below . the said Lock and Dam, are so shallow that any Interruption to the free Course of the Tide would materially prejudice the said Navigation, and occasion great Expence in deepening the same; and that about 1,900 Vessels pass through the said Lock to York Annually, and return through the fame* and the Petitioners apprehend the Erection of any Bridge at or near Selby would not only materially interrupt and stop the free Course of the Tide, but would also be very dangerous, and occasion great Delay to all Ships and Vessels having Occasion to pass through the fame, and would materially affedb the Trade upon the said-River above Selby, and greatly decrease the Tolls and Duties which the Petitioners are.authorized by Parliament to take as Trustees of the said Navigation: And therefore praying. That the Rights and Interests of the Petitioners may be preserved, that they may be heard, by themselves, or their Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

for repairing and widtning the Road from the Brick Kilns on East Mailing Heath to the Turnpike Road on Pembury Green, and from Brand Bridges to the Four IVents near Matfield Green, in the County of Kent, was

committed; That the Committee had examined the Allegations of the Bill, and found the same to be true; and that the Committee had gone through the Bill, and made several Amendments thereunto, which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered the Bill, with the Amendments, in at the Clerk’s Tabic: Where the Amendments were Once read throughout; and then a Second Time, One by One j and, upon the Question severally put thereupon, were agreed to by the House.

A Petition of the Mayor, Burgesses, and Commonalty, of the City of Briftin Common Council assembled, under their Common Seal, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners observing, by the Votes of the House, that it is intended immediately to proceed to the Consideration of the several Petitions presented against the Slave Trade, and understanding it is the declared Purpose of the Introducers of such Petitions to move for Leave to bring in a Bill for the total Abolition thereof, cannot but feel themselves most seriously alarmed at the Consequences of so great an Innovation, which, should such a Bill pass into a Law, would be made in the System of Colonial Commerce and Cultivation: Under the Sanction which has hitherto been given to the African Slave Trade, it is that the Sugar Colonies have risen to such a State of Importance, as Sources both of Commerce and Revenue, and connected with this Trade, which was coeval with the first Settlement of the Colonies, have all their peculiar Customs, Laws, Modes of Living, and Cultivation, been gradually formed; the Petitioners therefore cannot but entertain the most serious Apprehensions of the Effects which mud follow a sudden and violent Check to the Means by which such Colonies have been hitherto supplied with the Labourers necessary to their Cultivation; and that, as Guardians of the general Interests of the Citizens of Bristol, the Petitioners consider it their indispensable Duty to represent to the House, that the West India Commerce, with its concomitant and dependant Manufactures, form by far the moll important Branches of the Trade, and from which the greatest Part of the Opulence of the said City of Bristol has been derived, and that on its Continuance the future Profperityof the Merchant, the Trader, and the Artificer, chiefly depend, the Petitioners arc fully convinced, by the bell Authorities from whence they could derive Information, that a total and sudden Stop to the Importation of Negroes from Africa into the Sugar Colonies would be fatal to those Colonies, destructive to the Interests of the City of Bristol, and highly injurious to the Prosperity of the Empire at large; yet they are well aware that Regulations may be adopted, as well in this Country as in the Colonies, for carrying on the said African Slave Trade, and for encouraging the native Population of the IFeft India Islands, as may gradually and effedu-

ally remove the Evils complained of, so that Time and progressive Experience may decide upon the Useful-

ness and Practicability of any new System, and that the Customs and Habits of Cultivation in the Sugar Colonies may, by Degrees, assimilate themselves thereto: And therefore praying, That after mature Deliberation, such Measures only may be adopted as the Interests of Humanity require, and as may not tend to hazard the great Commercial Concerns of the Kingdom.

A Petition of the Mailer, Wardens, and Common- Petition fnw alty of Merchant Venturers of the City of Bristol, was yeen^Iere, also presented to the House, and read} Setting forth, B'rftol^giinft That the Petitioners think it their Duty to represent the Abolition to the House the very great and serious Apprehensions ^def*' they cannot but feel for the Commercial Interests of the said City, and of the Kingdom in general, on learning that, on the proposed Consideration in this House of the Circumstances complained of in the Petitions against the Slave Trade, a Motion is intended to be made for its total Abolition; and that the Trade to Africa does, in itself, constitute a very considerable Part of the British Commerce, and, if it should be abolished, the West India Colonies cannot be cultivated to their present Extent, but mull inevitably decline, and give a decided Superiority, both in Commerce and Naval Strength, to Rival Nations j and that the Welfare and Prosperity of those Colonies, depending on the Continuance of the Trade, and the Encouragement given to it, it becomes a great National Object not to be hazarded in an Experiment which, without the Concurrence of other Powers, cannot be of any Service to those it is intended to relieve; and that the numerous Gaffes of Planters, Merchants, Creditors, and others, whose Property will be injured, will have a Claim on the Justice of the Public for a Compenfa-tien, increasing the Burthens of the State, and at the same Time diminishing the Resources for their Discharge; And therefore praying, That the intended Measure piay not be adopted, but that, should the Interests of Humanity be thought to require further Regulations, they may meet that cool and dispassionate Enquiry which a Question of so much National Importance demands.

A Petition of the African Merchants and Traders of Petition from the City of Bristol, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners, deeply Bristol agtinll impressed with the Anxiety they feel on being inform- 1)0 ed that, on the proposed Investigation of the Petitions against the Slave Trade, a Motion is intended to be made for its entire Abolition, beg Leave to represent, that both the Legality and the Importance of the Trade to the Commercial Interests of the Kingdom having been acknowledged by repeated Acts of the British Legislature during a long Series of Years, the Petitioners have embarked their Property in it to a very large Amount, and they conceive the public Faith Hands pledged to them by the Sandtion and Support which Government has hitherto given to this Branch of Commerce, and that if it be once admitted as a Principle, that the Property of Individuals may be lessened in its Value without a Compensation, it may be carried to the most alarming Extent, and they think it their Duty to Hate, that the Trade to Africa constitutes a very important Branch in the British Commerce, Annually employing at lead Two hundred Sail of Ships in the different Ports of this Kingdom, with valuable Cargoes, confilling in a great Measure of the Manufactures of this Country; and rhat the British Settlements in West Indies, those grand Supports of the Revenue, Navigation, and Commerce of the Kingdom, arc indebted to the African Trade for their present flourishing State, and are so closely connected with, and dependent on, the Importations from Africa, that they mull necessarily Hand or fall together; and that different European Nations have endeavoured to obtain a Share in this valuable Branch of Commerce, but particularly at this Time

Petition from the Manufac-tiners, Ship Builders, &c. of Bristol, against the Abolition of the Slave Trade.

Manner of carrying on the African Slave Trade j they are willing to believe that those already adopted have been /erviceable, not only to the Adventurers themselves, but to the Cause of Humanity; they may still, as the Petitioners think, be followed up by others, equally advantageous to the Interests of both:

It is with peculiar Satisfaction the Petitioners observe, that the principal Colonial Legislatures have anticipated the Wishes of the House, in passing such Laws for the internal Government of their Negro Slaves as they conceived to be consonant to their Situations, and fully to meet the Expectations of the People of this Country; and, the Petitioners doubt not the other Islands will soon follow this laudable Example, and the Petitioners trust, that the House will not hastily establish a System by which the most valuable Dependencies of the British Empire may be hazarded, and that in an Experiment only by no Means, in the Petitioners Opinion, likely to serve those it is intended to relieve: And therefore praying, That the Bill about to be brought in, for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, may not pass into a Law, and that the Petitioners may be heard, by their Counsel, against the same Bill, bur, should it be adopted, they hope the House will fee the Necessity of suspending its Operation to some remote and distant Period, previous to which a System may be devised that may, without Violence or the Operation of the intended Bill, pro-' duce the desired EffieCb; but if„ on the other Hand, the Bill Should pass, and it is deemed expedient, by the House, that its Operation should be immediate, the Petitioners look up to the Justice of the British Legislature for a suitable Compensation for the Losses they must inevitably sustain, and they trust that Commissioners will be authorized to enquire into the Amount, and Provision made for their immediate Relief.

A Petition of the principal Manufacturers, Ship Builders, Ship Holders, and Traders,' of the City of Bristol, was . also prefenced to the House, and read;

Setting forth. That the Petitioners are informed, that on the proposed Investigation, in the House, of the Petitions against the Slave Trade, a Motion is intended to be made for its total Abolition j and that the Petitioners have large Capitals, expensive Works,

Docks, Ships, Buildings, and Warehouses, together with a great Number of People, employed in their several Trades and Manufactures, and their chief Support and Dependance, for carrying on their different Occupations, are the Trade to Africa, and the of , and

Exports and Imports to and from the West India County of Islands, which have been found, by recent and very accurate Enquiries, to constitute full Three-fifths of the Trade of the Port of Bristol, both with respect to the Tonnage of the Shipping, and the Capitals employed; and that whatever Regulations lefien either of these Branches of Commerce, will tend, in a great Degree, to annihilate the Trade of Bristol, and materially injure the neighbouring Country Towns, whose Manufactures are principally supported by the Exports from the said City; and that the Abolition of the Slave Trade, with the Effects it will necessarily have Jonas Slaney,

That the said Motion, for the total Abolition of the Slave Trade, may not pass into a Law, but that such Regulations may, after mature Consideration, be adopted, as will not be destructive of the greater Parc of the Trade of the Petitioners, and of the Wealth, the Shipping, and the Manufactures, of the City of BrijloL

A Petition of the Merchants, Adventurers, and Traders, of the City of Bristol, to the Island of Newfoundland, was likewise presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners are much alarmed at a Motion, they hear is intended to be made in the House, for the total Abolition of the Slave Trade, and are thereby induced to represent, that, among the many other Injuries this Kingdom would fullain therefrom, that most valuable Brandi of Commerce, and great Nurlery of Seamen, the Fishery of Newfoundland, would be mote materially affected, as the Annual Export of dry Fish froru thence to the West India Islands is very considerable, and, if flopped, would prove fatal to the said Fishery:

And therefore praying, That the House will nut fu'Ter any Bill to be brought in for the total Abolition of the Slave Trade, but only for such Regulations us the House shall deem righr.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered ro be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider of the Circumstances of the Slave Trade, complained of in the several Petitions which were presented to the House in the last Session of Parliament, relative to the State of the African Slave Trade,

petition from A Petition of the Council and Assembly of the

‘^s:hly island of Nevis, was presented to the House, and aytinri the read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners have un-the's'ave doubted Reason to believe that a Bill is to be brought

Trade/ into Parliament this Session, for the Abolition of the

African Slave Trade, and if a Bill to that Effect Should paf> into a Law, the Petitioners cannot but regard its Consequences in the most serious Light, tending, as it inevitably mull, to a gradual Diminution of their Fortunes, and ultimately to the utter Ruin of these 1 Hands, for the Petitioners are, by Experience, convinced of the impoflibility of keeping up their Number of Negroes without the Aid of th Trade,

and the universal Practice of every Foreign Sugar Colony confirms this Idea, the Necessity therefore of Supplies from Africa to the British Islands cannot be urged again!!: them particularly, as the Consequence of improper Treatment of their Slaves, nor induce a Belief that a different Treatment of them could preclude the Want of such Supplies: Were it possible to effect! so desirable an End, it is to be presumed, that some one of the many Foreign or British Sugar Settlements would have been fortunate enough to have accomplished it, and that they have all failed therein is owing, not to any general Severity towards Slaves, but to their dilfolute Lives, to their licentious Connexions with each other, which check their Breeding, and to the Frequency of Epidemical Distempers in these Islands, such as prevailed a few Years ago in Antigua, last Year in Saint Kill’s, and this Year in Nevis , and that a Natural Decrease of our Slaves being thus unavoidable, and all adventitious Supplies withheld, the Petitioners must gradually decline to cultivate their Lands as their Slaves drop off, and must with Pain look forward to that melancholy Period, sure of befalling themselves, or their Posterity, when their Lands must become entirely useless for Want of Labourers: Sugar Estates cannot, like Farms in Europe, be worked by a few Hands, the multifarious Business of the former requires the constant Attention of many Labourers, and, if such are not in Existence here, in the Capacity of Slaves, in vain are they to be fought under the Tide of a or Free Negroes, the latter are but few in Number, and addicted to Laziness, and, as to a White Pea-fantry, there is none in those Islands, nor could such a People endure the Labour of the Field in that Climate} and that the Petitioners, in contemplating the precarious Situation of their Fortunes during the Pendency of the Bill in Question, are constrained to lament that Government ever gave its Sanddon to Settlers in these Colonies — Instigafed by such Encouragement, the Petitioners or their Ancestors have veiled their whole Fortunes in Property there, and have, further to support the heavy Charges incidental to their Sugar Settlements, contracted large Debts to the Merchants of Great Britain, never imagining that the Time could possibly happen when Government, viewing West India Property in a different Light, would withhold from them the only Source whence they could possibly procure Labourers to work their Soil, and enable themselves to support their Families, and pay their Debts: The Petitioners therefore, regarding it as their incumbent Duty, in Behalf o.f themselves, their Posterity, and even of the Empire at large, to deprecate the Evils inevitably consequent on an Abolition of the Slave Trade, earnestly beseech the House to take the Premises into their mature and

serious Consideratloh, and not suffer the said Bill to pass into a Law} and' that they may be heard, by their Agent or Counsel, against the fame, at the Bar of the Hoofer

A Petition of Charles Spooner, Agent for the Island Petition from of Saint Christopher, in Behalf of the Proprietors of s^n^ch^ito-Lands and Negroes in the said Island, was also pre- phe 1* agiinft fented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioner having observed, from the Votes of the Trad*. House, that it has resolved to form, itself into a Committee, to take into Consideration the Petitions which have been presented, in the last and the present Session, praying an Abolition of the Slave Trade, and complaining of the Manner in which the Natives are transported from Africa by the Subjects of Great Britain, begs Leave to represent, that a considerable Part of the Lands in the Island of Saint Christopher having been ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht, the House of Commons, on the at ft of 1717, came to the following Resolutiort, “ Resolved,

“ That the Lands in the Island of Saint “ yielded by France to Britain by the Treaty of “ Utrecht, Should be sold to the best Advantage, and “ the Produce of the same Should be applied to the " Use of the Public}” and, in Consequence of the said Resolution, his then Majesty, George the First, ort the 4th of June, 1726, caused a Commission to be ’issued to certain Persons therein-named, to contraCl and agree with any of his Subjects for the absolute Purchase of that Part of the said Island, formerly be-« longing to the French, which Commission was afterwards confirmed by King George the Second, on the ift Day of May, in the Fifth Year of his Reign } and, under the said Commission, Lands in the said Island were fold for a considerable Sum of Money to sundry Persons, under whom the Petitioner’s Constituents claim, and the Money arising from the Sales was actually applied to the Use of the Public} and that the Value of the Lands purchased did then, and ftrli does, depend o,n the Cultivation of them by Means of Negro Labourers, insomuch that arty Measure which tends to deprive the Planter of a necessary Supply of Negroes for that Purpose, must necessarily fink ?nd depreciate the Value of his Lands} and that it was then, and stili continues to be, the universal Practice of all the Nations of Europe who have Colonies in the West Indies, to employ Negroes only in the Cultivation of their Lands, founded on the Experience of a great Length of Time, that Europeans must soon fink under the Inclemency of the Climate, and the Petitioner conceives, that, in this Practice, the British Subject has been supported and encouraged by the Sanction of many Royal Charters, Royal Proclamations, and Acts of Parliament, which have passed, from Time to Time, for above a Century, for promoting and extending the Trade to with a

View chiefly to supplying the Sugar Colonies with 3 sufficient Importation of Slaves at reason able‘Rates, under the Faith of which the Petitioner’s Constituents were originally induced to purchase1 the said Lands, -and have since proceeded in the Settlement of thtm, being fully convinced, in their own' Minds, that' the Parent State would never-impede or check them in their Cultivation, by prohibiting the Importation of Negroes storn' Africa, and have, in Consequence,

erected very extensive Works, and inverted a great Capital in the Purchase of Negroes for carrying on the Manufacture of Sugar and Rum, insomuch that the said Island, which at the Time of the said Sales was of little Value, is now become, in Proportion to its Size and Extent, as valuable a Sugar Colony as any belonging to Great Britain, blit, should the Planters in fucure be prevented from receiving the necessary Supplies of Negroes, the Petitioner’s Constituents are firmly perfuaaed that the Cultivation must languish, and with it the Value of their Property

must decline, and, in Process of Time, be totally destroyed: Under the foregoing Considerations, the Petitioner submits to the House, whether it is confident with that Degree of substantial Justice and good Faith, which has ever distinguished the Conduct: of the British Government, that they, who have been

induced to become Purchasers under the San&ion of a Royal Commission, founded on a Parliamentary Resolution, and under a justifiable Confidence that Parliament would not break through an established System, to which it had, for a Length of Time, given its Sanction and Support, Should now be deprived of the Means of cultivating those Lands for which they have paid a valuable Consideration to the Public, and whether that System ought to be abandoned, under which the Sugar Colonies in general, and the said Island in particular, have thriven and prospered, to the great Emolument of the Mother Country, in order to substitute in its Stead a speculative untried Experiment, which, Should it fail in the Ends pro-poied, must: be attended with Consequences ruinous to them, and injurious to the Nation; but if however the House shall, notwithstanding, in Conjunction with the other Branches of the Legislature, fee Cause to abolish the said Trade, and shall consent to hazard all the Consequences to the Commerce, Navigation, Revenue, and Manufactures of this Kingdom, as well as to the private Property of the Subject, the Petitioner begs Leave to represent that it is efiential to the Justice of such a Measure, that those, whose whole Fortunes are to be exposed to Risques which fill them with the most alarming Apprehension, and who, on a very uncertain Theory, in a Matter of private Property, are to be deprived of the Liberty of judging for thern-selves, contrary to a fixed Principle of the Law of the Land, Should receive a previous Consideration, and consequently that the Petitioner’s Constituents will be deemed by the House to have a fair and equitable Right to receive a just Compensation from the State: And therefore praying. That he may be indulged with a sufficient Time to be heard, by his Counsel, in Behalf of his Constituents, and to produce such Evidence, and give such Reasons, at the Bar of the House, as he shall think necessary in Support of the Allegations in this his Petition.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider of the Circumstances of the Slave Trade, complained of in the several Petitions which were presented to the House in the last Session of Parliament, relative to the State of the African Slave Trade.

A Petition of Charles Spooner, Agent for the Island Petition from of Grenada and the Grenadines, in Behalf of the Pro- ^^^it for prietors of Lands and Negroes in the said I (lands, and oUheVriprL-also of the Proprietors of Lands and Negroes in the for» of Land. Islands of Saint Vincent and Dominica, whose Names and Domimca', are thereunto subscribed, in Behalf of themselves and against the other Proprietors of Lands and Negroes in the last- of

mentioned Islands, was presented to the House, and Trade, read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners having observed, from the Votes, that the House has resolved to take into Consideration the several Petitions which have been presented in the last and present Session of Parliament, dating the Circumstances under which the Trade to Africa for Negroes, the Transportation of the Natives to the British Plantations, is now carried on by the Subjects of Great Britain, and praying that the said Trade may be abolished, the Petitioner, in Behalf of his Constituents and the said Islands, begs Leave to represent, that the Islands of Grenada, the Grenadines, Saint Vincent's, and Dominica, having been ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles, His present Majesty, on the 10th of February 1763, and the 26th of 1764, issued

H is Royal Proclamations, whereby He invited all His Subjects to become Purchasers and Settlers of Lands in the said Islands, under an Assurance that they Should be protected in the Enjoyment of their Liberties and Properties under a Form of Government established by Letters Patent under the Great Seal, and which Should make, constitute, and ordain Laws for the Government of the said Islands, and the Inhabitants thereof, as near as might be to the Laws of England, and in as far as their Situation as Colonists would permit; and, under the Assurances contained in the said Proclamations, many of His Majesty’s Subjects have risqued their whole Fortunes in the said Island of Grenada and the Grenadines, and purchased, at very high Prices, Lands and Negroes from the former French Inhabitants, relying on the Wisdom and Justice of their Mother Country, that they Should not be impeded, but encouraged in the Cultivation and Improvement of them; and that His Majesty', soon after, issued a Commission, appointing certain Persons therein named, and authorized them to proceed to the Ceded Islands, and there to expose to Sale, by public Auction, all such Lands as were become vested in the Crown by the said Treaty of Versailles, for the best Prices that could be obtained for the fame, the Purchase Money arising from which they were directed to pay over unto the Lords of the Treasury, to be applied to the Use of the Public, and the said Commission was issued in Consequence of an Address of the House of Commons, founded on a Speech from the Throne, wherein His Majesty was pleased to declare, that, in order to alleviate the Burthens laid on His Subjects, in Consequence of the late War, He was willing to relinquish His Right to the Lands in the said Ceded Islands -, and that the Commissioners, under the Authority of the said Commission, did fell large Tracts of Land, and some of them at very high Prices, amounting in the Whole to a considerable Sum of Money, which was actually applied to public Purposes, and in the Grants to the 1 Purchasers

io Geo. Ill* iiQ MaiL 357

Purchasers aClause is inserted, whereby the Grantees were made liable to certain Penalties, unless the Lands conveyed were settled within a limited Time: That the Settlers in the said Islands of Grenada and the Grenadines, under the Assurances contained in the said Royal Proclamations, that they should not be molested or impeded in the legal Occupation and Enjoyment of their Property, and the Settlers in the other I Hands of Saint Vincent's and , under

the bona fide Purchases made under the aforesaid Commission, have proceeded and are Hill occupied in the clearing considerable Tracts of Lands in the said Islands, by Means of Negroes imported from and in settling and converting them into very valuable* Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa, and Cotton Plantations; and that by far the greatest Part of the Lands, comprised in the said Grants, remains still in Woods, which is very capable of being brought into. Cultivation, and rendered equally as valuable, but which it will be impracticable to clear and cultivate, in case the proposed Abolition takes Place, notwithstanding the y still remain liable to the Penalties under the Clause before stated; and that at the Time of the Settlement of the said Islands, it was a Practice uni-verfally established, not only among the Settlers in the Old Islands belonging to Great Britain, but also among the Subjects of Foreign States, who were possessed of any Sugar Colonies, to cultivate the Lands there by Means of Negroes imported from Africa, under a Conviction, founded on the Experience of a great Length of Time, that such Cultivation could not proceed, or be carried on to any Degree of Advantage, by Means of any other Species of Labourers, and had it- been then conceived or apprehended that any Prohibition or Check would be put to the Importation of them from Africa by the Mother Country, there is the strongest Reason to presume that the said Islands never would have been settled, and this Practice, as the Petitioner conceives, has been recognized and supported by the Sanction of many Royal Charters and Acts of Parliament, which have issued and passed from the First Settlement of the Sugar Colonies, down to the present Time, authorizing, encouraging, and supporting the Trade to Africa for Slaves, for the Use of the Sugar Colonies, and in particular by the Charters granted in 1662 and 1672 by Charles the Second, which established a Royal African Company, and which were granted in Consequence of an Address of Parliament, calling on his Majesty to support the Trade of Africa, and by the Ninth and Tenth of William the Third, passed at a Period when the Principles of Freedom were well understood, and as strenuously asserted, and by the Act of the Twenty-third of George the Second, which recites in, the Preamble that the Trade to Africa is advantageous to Great Britainand necessary for supplying the Plantations with Negroes; and that the Petitioners beg Leave further to represent, that in settling the said Plantations, the Proprietors have expended very considerable Sums of Money, amounts ing in the Whole to several Millions, insomuch that many of them have found themselves under the absolute Necesslty of borrowing large Sums, not only of the Merchants and other Subjects of this Realm, but also of the Subjects of Foreign States, on the 'Security of their Lands, Negroes, and other Property in the said Islands; and that their Creditors have been induced to make the said Advances under the Faith of an Act, passed in the Fifth Year of his late Majesty, for the more speedy Recovery of Debts due to British Subjects in the Plantations, whereby the

Lands and Slaves there are declared to be Assets for the Payment of Debts by Simple Contract, and the Money due to the SuDjects of Foreign States has been advanced under the Faith of an Act, passed in the Thirteenth Year of His present Majesty, for en-' Vol.XUV.

couraging the Subjects of Foreign States to lend Money, on the Security of Freehold or Leasehold Estates in any of His Majesty’s Colonies in the West Indies;. ‘and that notwithstanding the very heavy Expenses i«fready incurred, they beg Leave to- observe, the Quantity of Land fold and disposed of by the Commissioners in Dominica, exceeds 100,000 Acres, and the Number of Negro Labourers arc only 15,600, of course, allowing only One Labourer to an Acre, 85,000 are still wanting to fulfil the Engagement entered into by the Conditions of Sale; that Saint Vincent contains 89,000 Acres, and has only 11,800 Negro Labourers, of course a proportionate Number is wanted in that Island, to enable the Purchasers to clear the Land as required by Government; and that the Island of is noc

above Two-Thirds cleared, and not Half supplied with Negroes, and in all the said Islands the Work of clearing Lands has been necessarily carried on chiefly by Men, the Labour being too severe for Women and Children, and a great Proportion of the said Negroes were purchased upwards of Twenty Years ago, and consequently must be now declining,' and will in a few Years be past Labour, and yet they cannot" be replaced, should the proposed Abolition take Place; and that the said Islands were all Captured in the late War, and were thereby deprived of the Means of Supply for several Years; that they have suffered much from Hurricanes and other natural Calamities since the Peace, insomuch that they have not been able to provide themselves with a sufficient Stock of Negroes, even for supporting the present Cultivation, much less to extend it; and under all the foregoing Considerations, the Petitioners submit it to the House, whether it is confident with that Degree of substantial Justice and good Faith, which ought ever to distinguish and dignify the Councils and A£t$ of a Free Government, and which constitute the Principle on which Traders and Adventurers can only rely, and is that which gives Life and Energy-to the Spirit of Enterprize in a Commercial Nation, and whether it would not establish a dangerous Precedent, and tend to discourage the Subjects of this Country from engaging their Capitals in any future Projects of Trade, at once to overset and abandon a System which has been encouraged and suffered to sublist for above a Century, which has been the main Support of the Sugar Colonies, and under which they have prospered and throve, to the great Emolument of the Parent State, and without which there are the strongest Reasons for presuming that the recent Settlement of the Islands above mentioned would never have taken Place; and that inasmuch as the proposed Abolition may proceed upon an Assumption that the Treatment of the Negroes in the Colonies is cruel and inhuman, the Petitioners trust, if any Instances of such Treatment can be proved to have existed in the said Islands, they are not common, and ought to be considered as Deviations and Abuses not difficult to be checked and prevented by temperate Regulations made in the Colonies, and not as constituting a general Description of the Treatment Negroes receive from their Owners, nor furnishing a fair Argument against the Existence or Encouragement of that Species of Property in the West Indies, in Proof of which the Petitioners appeal to the Laws passed in Grenada and Dominica: But if, notwithstanding, the Wisdom of the House, in Concurrence with that of the other Branches of the Legislature, upon whatever new and speculative System of universal and undiftin* guishing Liberty, or upon whatever new and untried Theory for the Cultivation of the Colonies in the British West Indies, shall be pleased to determine that the Trade shall be abolished, though at the same Time it will continue open to all other States, and in particular to our great Commercial Rivals the French,

and Hi all consent to hazard all the Consequences to the Commerce, Revenue, and Navigation of the Empire, as well as to the private Properties of its Subjects, the Petitioners in that same beg Leave to represent, that it is eflfential to the Justice of such a Measur in the Outset, and perfectly confident with the Spirit with which it is promoted* that thofewhofe Properties are immediately to be affected, and the Means of discharging whose extensive Debts are to be diminished by it, Should receive a previous Consideration, and consequently the Proprietors and Mortgagees of Lands, who have embarked their Fortunes in the Settlement of Plantations in the said Islands, ujron the Faith that an anciently established and'long tried System would not be overturned, will be deemed to have a fair and equitable Title to receive a just Compensation from the State: And the Petitioners hope that they shall be indulged with a sufficientTime to be heard by Counsel, and to produce such Evidence, and give such Reasons, % at the Bar of the House, as they shall think necessary, in Support of the Allegations in this their Petition.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider of the Circumstances of the Slave Trade, complained of in the several Petirions which were presented to the House in the last Session of Parliament, relative to the State of the African Slave Trade.

That the Petitioners apprehend such Mode of raising Money for the Purposes aforesaid will not only prove very partial and oppressive, but materially injure and affeift the Petitioners, by raising the Price of Coals and Provisions brought to the Markets of the said City, which must unavoidably pass through and pay Toll at the Gates leading into the said City, which may difeou-rage the Resort of Strangers to Bath, and thereby lessen the Rents of Houses, and otherwise injure the Petitioners; and, the Petitioners conceive the said Plan of the Mayor and Corporation for the intended Improvements to be partial; and that Three several Plans for effecting the Improvement of the Lower Town, without any Expence to the Public, have been suggested at Two public Meetings, held at the Guildhall of the said City, and since proposed to the Mayor and Corporation of the said City (through the Medium of a Committee appointed at a General Meeting of the Commissioners of the Bath Turnpikes, Landholders of that and the neighbouring Counties, and the Inhabitants of the City of Bath) convened by public Advertisement for the Purpose of opposing the Means proposed by the Corporation for raising Money for the Purposes aforesaid, of which Plans or Pro-pofals the said Corporation have hitherto not taken any Notice, and the Petitioners conceive that some one of the said Plans, or some other Plan that may be suggested, ought to be adopted for the Purposes aforesaid, in Preference to the Means proposed by the Corporation, the Propriety of which Plans the Petitioners are ready to submit to the House; and thac the Petitioners, in the several Parishes of Lyncombe and Widcombe, Bathwick, Bat and Tiverton,

will all contribute to the additional Toll, by Means of their Coals passing through the Bath Turnpike Gates, though they do not enter into the said City, and the Petitioners cannot be in the least benefited by the proposed Improvement; and that the Petitioners conceive that the Intent of the Improvements proposed is with a View to increase the Number of Strangers who resort to Bath for the Benefit of the Waters, that an Increase of Resort of Strangers will improve the Revenue of the Corporation arising from the Bath Waters, which at present is very considerable, amounting to several Hundred Pounds per Annum, and it is unreasonable to charge the Public to defray the Expence of an/Improvement calculated to increase the Revenue of the said Corporation arising from the Waters, before the Revenue which they receive has been applied, as far as such Revenue will extend; and that the Plan of Improvement proposed by the said Corporation has for its Objedb the immediate Interest: of Estates held under and belonging to the Corporation, whereas Plans may be formed which will be an equal Benefit to the Town in general: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by their Counsel and Agents, against the said Bill being passed into a Law, and that such other Relief may be given to the Petitioners as to the House shall seem meet and proper.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the Bill for protecting and securing the Hot Baths and Springs, within the City of Bath, from Injury by Encroachments and Annoyances, for enlarging or-r^-2 building

then too late to apply to Parliament in this present Session: Under these Circumstances, and as the said Bill, if it passes into a Law, will, as the Petitioners apprehend, not only very materially affett and injure the Property of the Petitioners and other Owners and Occupiers of Water Mills situate on or near the said Rivers Soar, Wreak, and Eye, and deriving their Supplies of Water from the Streams and Currents which, in the Event of such Bill passing, will be taken to supply the said Navigation, but will also occasion great Injury and Inconvenience to the Inhabitants of the several Parishes and Places in and near which the said Mills are situate, for whose Use the same Mills are almost wholly employed in the grinding of Com,: therefore praying, That the House will permit them to be -heard, By. themselves or Counsel, - against the said Bill, and that the same may not pals into a Law.

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed, Inhabitants of the Town of Ashby de la Zouch, in the County of Leicester, on Behalf of themselves and the ocher Inhabitants of the said Town, was also presented to the House* and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth. That the Petitioners are appre-henlive, that, in case the said Bill should pass into a Law, the present Supply of Coals from the Collieries at Coleorton, Swannington, Stanton Harold, and other

brought out of Derbyshire, and carried on the said intended Navigation; and that, since the making: of thfc navigable Communication between the River and Loughborough, the Country in the Neighbourhood of Ashby de la Zouch hath been considerably depopulated and drained of Calli, and great Injury hath-accrued to the Markets and to the Trade of AJbby la Zouch, and the Petitioners have therefore great Reason to apprehend; that, in case the said Bill should pass into a Law, the Country.in the Neighbourhood of Ashby de la Zouch will be in a great Degree more depopulated and drained of Calli, and the Markets of

Ashby de la Zouch, and Trade and Commerce there, will be greatly and inevitably injured: And therefore praying the House, to take the manifest Hardship of their same into Consideration, that the Petitioners may be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not' pass into a Law, or that such other Relief may be given in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the several Noblemen, and the humble Petition of the several other Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed, being Owners and Occupiers of Lands in the County of Leicester, adjoining or lying near to the Rivers Soar, Wreak, and Eye, intended to be made navigable, was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth, That the First Meeting to consider of rendering the Rivers Wreak and Eye navigable was held at Melton Mowbray only on the 9th Day of February last, and the First Meeting to consider of making the River Soar navigable up to Leicester was only held at that Town on the 2d Day of March last, at which Time, and not before, the Promoters of the Two Schemes agreed to consolidate them, and make a joint Application to Parliament, although, at a Public Meeting held at Leicester, by Advertisement of the Mayor, on the 25th Day of October last, to consider of rendering the River Soar navigable, it was resolved, that it was then too late to apply to Parliament in this present Session: Under these Circumstances, and as the Bill will, as the Petitioners apprehend, materially aftVdt and injure their

Property, as well as. that of others interested in the Lands and Grounds adjoining to the said proposed Navigation, therefore praying. That the House Will permit them to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law.'

A Petition of the Right honourable Earl Ferrers, Petition frbir* and the humble Petition of Sir George Beaumont, Baronet, John Raper, of Abberford, in the County of Beaumoifi'and York, Thomas Fenton, of Rotbwel Haigb, in the same other*, against

County, Joseph Boultbee, of Coleorton, and Joseph v^aiionBUU* Boultbee, of Baxterley, Esquires, was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth, That the Petitioners Earl Ferrers and Sir George Beaumont, in their own Rights -respectively, and the Petitioners John Raper and Thomas Fenton, as Leflccs for Lives under the

Chaplains and Poor of the Charitable Foundation of Wigfton's Hospital in Leicester., and the Petitioners Joseph Boultbee and Joseph Boultbee, as Lessees respectively, are Owners of, and interested in, certain ancient, extensive, and very valuable Collieries and Beds of Coal, at or near Coleorton, Swannington, and Stanton Harold,in the County of Leicester, which Collie-

ries have been long established, and by considerable Purchases, and a large Expenditure of Money, the same arc completely capable of affording a certain and constant Supply of Coal, and might lb continue for Ages to come, as they have done for Centuries past, if not prejudiced by the Import of the same Article from.other Counties or distant Places; and that, in and long before the Year 1776, the Towns and Neighbourhood of Leicester, Loughborough, and Melton Mowbray, the Eastern Part of the County of Leicester, and Part, of Northamptonshire, were in a great Measure supplied with poal from the above Mines, exclu-five of all others, the same being the ancient and natural Sale for those Collieries, and in the Year 1776 an Act passed, by which the River So has been made navigable from the River Trent to or near Garrenton aforesaid, and a Canal is continued from thence to Loughborough, and, by Means thereof, the Towns and Neighbourhood of Loughborough and Melton Mowbray, and a great Portion of the Eastern Part of -

Shire, are almost wholly, and the Town and Neigh-' bourhood of Leicester are in a material Degree, now supplied with Coal by Water Carriage from the Banks of the Erewash Canal in Derbyshire, at a considerable Distance from Leicester and Melton Mowbray and that the Coal Mines at Coleorton and Swannington, being deep, require large Fire Engines to be worked for raising the Water therefrom, many Horses to draw the Coals, and are attended with a very considerable Annual Expence, and, in order to keep them open and at Work, to yield Profit, it is efiential that the Quantity of Coals fold should be considerable; and that, from the Nature and Extent of the above Collieries, the adjacent Counfry is populous, and many Persons employed in, and entirely dependant on, the Continuance thereof, have expended great Part of their Substance in building Dwelling Houses, and making necessary Conveniences for the comfortable Existence of themselves and their Families; and that a Competition, very beneficial to the Public, has already been created by the IrltrodufHon of the Derbyshire Coal, but which hath injured the Proprietors of the Coal Mines at Coleorton and Swannington to the Amount of many Hundred Pounds per Annum, and has so far reduced

the real Value and Yearly Profits thereof, that any further Diminution in the Sale of Coal from thence, which must take Place if the said Bill should pass into a Law, would certainly endanger their Continuance, and in a great Measure, if not entirely, put a Stop to the Supply of Coal from those Mines, because no Conveyance by Water Carriage (though heretofore attempted to be obtained) can at present be got for the fame;

fame 1 and that the Derbyshire Collieries have not hitherto afforded a constant Supply of Coals at rough., and if the Towns of Melton

ana other Parts of the County, should be reduced to the Necessity of depending wholly on Water Carriage for Coal, or of procuring it elsewhere, the present Competition would be destroyed, the Benefit arising to the Public from the reduced Price of Cool thereby would be loft, and ah Opportunity would be given to the Derbyshire Coal Owners to advance the Price of

their Coal considerably, if not to create a Monopoly, and had not the Town and Neighbourhood of and even the Town of Loughborough itself (the present Emporium of the Derbyshire Coal) been Daily supplied with Coals from Swannington and during a

con side table Part of the late severe Winter, the Inhabitants would have been reduced to the utmost Distress for Want of Fuel; and that the Navigation to Leicester and Melton Mowbray, intended by the said Bill, would extend the Conveyance of Derbyshire Coal by Water Carriage to the above Towns, and other Places, which were formerly wholly, and are now in Part, supplied from the Leicestershire Collieries, would give a decided Preference to the Derbyshire Coal Owners, and enable them to undersell those of the County of Leicester, particularly Coleorton and at

their natural, usual, and best Market in the Town and County of Leicester j and that such a Measure would render the Supply of Coal to the Town of and many other Parts, more precarious and uncertain than at present, would depopulate the Country in and about Coleorton, Swannington, and Stanton Harold, and

exceedingly decrease the Value of Estates there, and would prejudice and injure the private Property of the Petitioners in the most essential and material Degree, without the Prospect of any adequate Compensation being made to them by any Provision in the intended Ad, and would also greatly affect the Estate and Interest of the said Charitable Hospital t And therefore praying the House to take the manifest Hardship of their same into Consideration, that the Petitioners may be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that such other Relief may be given in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed, resident in the Parishes and Neighbourhoods of Coleorton, Swannington, Stanton Harold, and other Places, in the County of Leicester, where Coal Works are now established, and carrying on Trades in the said Parishes and Neighbourhoods, was likewise presented to the House, and read; also taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth. That the Petitioners are apprehensive, that, in case the said Bill Should pass into a Law, the Supply of Coals from the Coal Pits at Coleorton, Swannington, Stanton Harold, and other Places, will be flopped, either totally, or in a great Measure, and few or no Coals will be got thereat, and all, or very near all, the Coals, to supply the Town and County of Leicester, and the neighbouring Counties, now carried by Land from the said Coal Pits and Loughborough, by a great Number of Persons, keeping Horses and Carriages for that Purpose, and a great Part of them resident near to the Petitioners, will be brought out of Derbyshire, and carried on the said intended Navigation, by Means whereof the Persons working in the said Coal Pits, and the Persons employed as aforesaid, as Carriers of the said Coals got thereat, and who are Customers to the Petitioners for Wearing Apparel, Provisions, and other Necessaries of Life, will be thrown out of Employment, and either desert their present Habitations, and remove to Places dif-tant from the Petitioners, or become Paupers j and that, in order to exercise their Trades to the greater Convenience and Advantage of their Customers and of

themselves, the Petitioners have-expended several considerable Sums of Money in erecting Houses, Shops, Warehouses, and other Buildings, which in the Event of the said Bill passing will, in the Petitioners Apprehension, be rendered, in a great Measure, useless and invaluable, and will occasion great inconvenience and Injury to the Petitioners, and involve many of them in Ruin: And therefore praying the House to take the manifest Hardship of their same into Consideration, and that the Petitioners may be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that such other Relief may be given in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the said Bill be read a Second Time; and the Petitioners are to be then heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petitions, if they think fit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petitions.

The Order of the Day being read, for the further Hearing of Counsel upon the Bill for making and maintaining aNavigable Canal from or near in the County of Derby, to join and communicate with the Erewash Canal at or near Langley Bridge, in the Counties of Nottingham and Derby, or One of them, and also Two Collateral Cuts, One from the said intended Canal, at or near Codnor Park Mill, to or near ton Mill, in the County of Derby, and the other from the said intended Canal, at or near Codnor Park, in Two Branches, into the Parish of Selston, in the County of Nottingham,

A Petition of the Manufacturers of Goods, calculated for the Trade to /ifr'ua, in the Town and Neighbourhood of Birmingham, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners observe, by the Votes, a Resolution of the House to take into Consideration the Circumstances of the African Slave Trade, complained of in certain Petitions presented to the House for an Abolition of the said Trade; and that a very considerable Part of the various Manufactures in which the Petitioners are engaged, are adapted to and disposed of for the African Trade, and are not saleable at any other Market; and that several Thousands are employed in, and maintained by, such Manufactures, and, the Petitioners are fully persuaded, should the said Trade be abolished, the Petitioners will be injured in their Fortunes and Property, to a very alarming Extenr, and many Thousands, who depend on them for Employment and Subsistence, be brought into Poverty and Distress: And therefore praying the House to take the Premises into their most serious Consideration, and to adopt such Mea-fiires for the Preservation of the said Trade as to the House shall feern expedient.

A Petition of the Merchants, Ship Owners, Manufacturers, Tradelinen, and others, directly concerned or otherwise interested in the African Slave Trade, from the Port of London, was all'o presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Slave Trade to Africa is of very great Importance to the Commerce, Navigation, and Manufactures of this Country, and to the Revenues of the fame, and any Law for the Abolition thereof would be attended with infinite Injury, not only to Individuals, but to the Nation at large, and would tend greatly to the Aggrandizement of the French, Spaniards, Dutch,

Portuguese, Danes, and others, who are giving every Encouragement for the Promotion and Improvement of that Branch of Commerce; and that many of the Petitioners not only employ the Whole of their own Capital, but have adventured very considerable Sums upon their Credit in carrying on the Slave Trade, encouraged thereto by the several Acts in Force for that express Purpose, but more especially that of the Twenty-third of King George the Second, for extend-

ing and improving the Trade to j and that

many other of the Petitioners, though not immediate Adventurers to Africa, are Individually interested in the Welfare of that Trade, the principal Part of their Manufactures, and other Commodities, being solely calculated for the African Market, and such as would suit no other, and others of the Petitioners are employed in the Equipment of Shipping for the said Trade, and in making and manufacturing Materials for the fame, whereby they in a great Measure derive a Maintenance for themselves and Families: That the Petitioners, justly alarmed at a Bill proposed to be brought into Parliament to abolish the Slave Trade, beg Leave to represent to the House the fatal Consequences which mult inevitably attend such a Measure — ift, to the Nation at large, by lopping off a very large Portion of its Commerce, its Navigation, and its Revenues, and transferring the same to other Countries — 2dly, to the Merchants immediately adventuring to Africa, whose Fortunes are embarked therein, under the repeated Sanction and Encouragement of the Legislature, a.nd whose Shipping (which, from their peculiar Construction and Equipment, are very expensive) will in a great Measure be rendered useless, being almost wholly unfit for any other Trade; — and, 3dly, in the Ruin of many Thousands, who now live almost wholly by the Commerce, and various Other Branches of Employment, which the African Trade gives Rife to: And therefore praying the House to take the Premises into Consideration, to allow them to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against any Bill that may be brought into Parliament for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and to grant them such other Relief as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the Planters of the British Sugar Colo- petiHon from nies, whose Names are thereunto fubftribed, in Behalf of themselves and other Proprietors in the said Colonies, was also presented to the House, and read; Set- the

House in the last as well as the present Session of Parliament, and understand that the House resolved itself into a Committee on the 12th Instant, to conli-der of the Circumstances of the Slave Trade, complained of in the said Petitions, and that sundry Resolutions were then proposed, tending to the Abolition of the Slave Trade; and representing to the House, that the Continuance of the Slave Trade is absolutely necessary for keeping up and supporting the Plantations already established in the British Colonies in their present State and Condition, and that it is evident, without such Trade is continued, no new Settlements therein can or will be made; and that the Abolition of the Slave Trade will necessarily tend to lessen the Produce of the Sugar Blands, to decrease the Plantation Trade and Shipping, and consequently greatly to diminish the Revenues, and ro weaken the Maritime Force of Great; and

that the Petitioners trust to the Wisdom and Justice of the House, that a Measure of such Magnitude and Importance to the Petitioners, and the Kingdom in general, and which will immediately depreciate and ultimately annihilate the Property of the Petitioners, which, during 150 Years and upwards, has defeended to many of them from their Ancestors, has been purchased by the rest, and held by all under the Faith and Encouragement of Royal Grants, Proclamations, and successive Aits of Parliament, will meet with that deliberate Consideration which the Nature of the Subject requires: And therefore praying, That they may be at Liberty to be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, and to produce Evidence in Support of their Cafe, and that the House will not come to any Resolution injurious to the Rights and Property of the Petitioners.

A Petition of the Shipwrights of was also

’presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the building, repairing, and, when called upon, defending the Wooden Walls of England, has hitherto been the Occupation of the Petitioners, who for Numbers vie with all other Trades in the said populous Sea Port, and the numerous and valuable Vessels built and fitted out there, and calculated solely for the carrying Negro Labourers from Africa to the West Indies, has long constituted a principal Part of the Petitioners Employment, and enabled them to maintain themselves and Families; and that, for several Months last past, the Petitioners have experienced a considerable falling-off in their Trade, and no small Number amongst them have been much distressed, and are still out of Employ, caused, as the Petitioners believe, by fbme Restrictions laid upon the African Commerce in the Course of last Year, and the Petitioners have learnt with great Concern that the total Abolition of this long-established Branch will shortly come under the Confederation of the House; and that a principal Part of the Petitioners Employment at the said Port is in building and repairing the African Ships, and to abolish that Trade would therefore greatly add to their already distressed Situation, reduce still greater Numbers to Want of Employment in that Art they have been brought up to, and by which alone they know how to maintain themselves and all those who are dependant on them, and if deprived of this have no other Resource: And therefore praying, That they may be heard by their Counsel, and permitted to produce Evidence, against the Abolition of the African Slave Trade, or such other Relief granted them as the House shall think proper.

A Petition of the Ropemakers of Liverpool, was also presented to the House, and read 1 Setting forth. That the Petitioners compose a considerable Body in the Borough of Liverpool, and their Occupation gives Employment to Numbers, from Ten Years old and upwards, who are regularly trained to the said Manufacture, and, by the Importation of Foreign bulky Articles, such as Hemp and Tar, the Petitioners are enabled to encourage and increase a valuable Nursery for Seamen, and in Time of War are empowered to give additional Strength to the Royal Navy, by many useful Recruits from their own Body; and that the principal Dependance of the Petitioners is upon the Number of Ships fitted out at the said Port, and employed in supplying the West India Islands with Negro Labourers from the Coast of , and the Petitioners therefore cannot, without the most alarming Apprehensions, consider the Danger to which they are exposed by a Question shortly to be agitated in the House, with the avowed Design of totally abolishing the African Slave Trade; and that, Should such an impolitic Step be unhappily adopted, it would certainly be attended with alarming Effects in this important Branch of British Manufacture, and greatly add to the Distress of many amongst the Petitioners, who are already out of Employ from some Restrictions only, not long since imposed upon the African Commerce: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, against the

Abolition of the African Slave Trade, dr that such Compensation may be granted diem as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the Coopers of Liverpool, was also pre- Petition from fented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That ^*vCoop^r* °* the Coopers in the said Borough compose a numerous and considerable Body of People, brought up in, and Abolition of solely dependant on, that Branch of Business, for the x^?' Support of themselves and Families, and the Outset of Ships employed ih carrying Negro Labourers from Africa to the West Indies constitute so important a Part of the Petitioners Trade, that the Loss of it would deprive great Numbers of them of the only Means they are acquainted with of procuring Subsistence, and expose them to the utmost Distress, Beggary, and Ruin; and that the Number is not inconsiderable of those amongst the Petitioners who have hitherto supported a reputable Rank in Life, and cannot* without heartfelt Anxiety, behold the impending;

Danger, which threatens DestruCkion to all their fairest Hopes; and that the Abolition of the African Trade, which, the Petitioners are informed, will shortly be agitated in the House, would, if unhappily adopted, be productive of the many fatal Consequences above mentioned in their particular Trade, is to the Petitioners evident ana certain, and if so many will thereby be ruined in One Branch only, what Havock will it then make in the aggregate Body of Artificers throughout Britain, who depend thereon for their Daily Bread! And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by their Counsel, and permitted to produce Evidence in the House, against the Abolition of a Trade which gives Support to themselves and numerous Families, or that such adequate Compensation may be provided by the House as they shall deem meet.

A Petition of the Gunmakers in Liverpool, whose P«titions from Names are thereunto subscribed, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Supply Liverpool of the African Ships with Small Arms (an essential D». Article in their Cargoes) gives Employment to many Thousands of His Majesty’s Subjects, whose foie Dependance is now upon that Branch of Commerce, and, if the Petitioners had not this Resource in Time of Peace, a sufficient Number of Workmen, skilful in that Branch, could not be kept in Readiness to provide Arms when Necessity required them for National Defence, and the Petitioners are therefore much alarmed, and deeply concerned, to find that the African Slave Trade will shortly be taken into the Consideration of the House, with the avowed Intention of totally abolishing that important Branch of Commerce, which, for Centuries past, has been established, protected, and encouraged, by the Legislature; and that, Should so fatal a Measure as the Abolition of the said Trade be unhappily adopted.

A Petition of the Bakers in Liverpool, was allb presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners, who compose a very numerous Body in the said Borough, depend chiefly for Employment upon the great Number of Ships fitted out in that Port to supply the West India Islands with Negro Slaves from the Coast of Africa, and, from the great Number of People, Whites and Blacks, to be fed on board each of those Ships during a long Voyage, that Commerce is rendered the Petitioners principal Dependance, and to deprive them of that Source would take from the Petitioners the Means of providing for thein-selves and Families, and reduce them to the utmost Distress j and that the Petitioners are therefore much alarmed and deeply concerned to find, that the African Slave Trade will shortly be taken into Consideration by the House, with the avowed Intention of totally abolishing that important Branch of Commerce, which for Centuries part has been established, proteXed, and encouraged, by the Legislature, and, Should so fatal a Measure as the Abolition of the said Trade be unhappily adopted, Numbers amongst the Petitioners will be reduced to great and unavoidable Distress, if some adequate Compensation be not provided by Parliament: And therefore praying to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the Abolition of the African Slave Trade, or that such Relief may be granted them by the House as shall be judged proper and needful.

A Petition of the ManufaXurers of Goods calculated for the Trade to Africa, in the Town and Neighbourhood of Manchester, was also presented to the House,

That the Petitioners, observing by the Votes, that several Petitions have been presented to obtain a total Abolition of the African Slave Trade, beg Leave to represent that the said Trade is universally deemed expedienc by all the European Nations possessing any of the West India I Hands, and that it has hitherto had the SanXion and ProtcXion of the Legislature of this Country} and that, in Consequence of such SanXion, the Manu-laXurers of the Town and Neighbourhood of Man-chester have embarked their Property to a very large Amount in the Manufacture of Goods calculated for the African Trade, and many Thousand Workmen arc constantly employed in the making of those Articles, and, in calc an Abolition of the Trade was to take Place, the Petitioners beg Leave to represent to the House the great Loss which would be sustained by the Town and Neighbourhood of and the

certain Ruin of the great Number of Workmen employed in the Manufacture, who would consequently be deprived of the Means of supporting themselves and Families; and that the Petitioners cannot but be seriously alarmed left the Abolition of the Slave Trade would (so far from serving the Cause of Humanity) have no other Essex than to ruin a most beneficial and extensive Branch of Commerce, to the very great Advantage of our Rival Nations, who are using every Endeavour to cherish and support the Trade: And therefore praying to be heard in the House, by themselves and their Counsel, before a Measure so injurious to the Petitioners, and destruXive of so important a Branch of British) Commerce, be resolved upon.

A Petition of the Mayor, Aldermen, Bailiffs, and Common Council, of the Town of ,was also

presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners, as Trustee* of the Corporate Fund of the said Town, have always been ready, not only to give every Encouragement in their Power to the Commercial Interests of that Part of the Community more immediately under their Care, but as much as possible to strengthen the Reins of Government, and promote the public Welfare; and that the Trade of Liverpool having met with the Countenance of the House in many AXs of Parliament, which have been granted at different Times during the present Century, for the construXing of proper and convenient Wet Docks for its Shipping, and more especially for the African Ships, which from their Form require to be constantly afloat, the Petitioners have laid out considerable Sums of Money, and pledged their Corporate Seal for other Sums to a very large Amount, for effeXuating those Purposes; and, the Petitioners have also been happy to fee the great Increase and different Resources of Trade which has flowed in upon their Town, by the numerous Canals and other Communications from the interior Parts of this Kingdom, in which many Individuals, as well as public Bodies of Proprietors, are materially interested; and that from those Causes, particularly the Convenience of the Docks, and some other local Advantages, added to the enterprizing Spirit of the People, which has enabled them to carry on the African Slave Trade with Vigour, the Town of Liverpool has arrived at a Pitch of Mercantile Consequence which cannot but affex and improve tho Wealth and Prosperity of the Kingdom at large, and the Petitioners therefore contemplate, with real Concern, the Attempts now making, by the Petitions lately preferred to the House, to obtain a total Abolition of the African Slave Trade, which has hitherto received the Session of Parliament, and for a long Series of Years has constituted, and (till continues to form, a very extensive Branch of the Commerce of Liverpool, and in Essex gives Strength and Energy to the Whole: And therefore praying to be heard, by their Counsel, against the Abolition of this Source of Wealth, before the House shall proceed to determine upon a Point which so essentially concerns the Welfare of the Town and Port of Liverpool in particular, and the Landed Interest of the Kingdom in general, and which, in the Petitioners Judgment, must also tend to the Prejudice of the British ManufaXurers, must ruin the Property of the English Merchants in the lV$fl Indies, diminish the Public Revenue, and impair the Maritime Strength of Great Britain.

A Petition of the Merchants, Mortgagees, Annuitants, and other Creditors of the Sugar Colonies, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves and others, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners observe, by the Votes, that a Committee of the House have under their Consideration sundry Petitions relative to the Slave Trade, some of which, the Petitioners observe, pray an entire Abolition thereof, and the Petitioners apprehend, that, should the Prayer of such Petitions so far influence the Decisions of the House, as to occasion any Measures tending to an Abolition of the Slave Trade, immediate ill EffeXs, and eventual Ruin, must ensue to the Sugar Colonies, and consequently great and irreparable Injury to the Petitioners, who, under the Encouragement and Sanction of repeated Acts of the British Legislature, have advanced, from Time to Time, many Millions on the Security of the present Possessions and future Prof-peXs of the Proprietors in the said Colonies; and that the Petitioners beg Leave farther to suggest to the House, that on the Continuance and Increase of the Importation of the Produce of the Sugar Colonies,

depends that Branch of Commerce, so beneficial to the Revenue, wherein the Petitioners, for the most Part, are engaged, and any Measures, diminishing the Means of Cultivation in our Islands, must of Necessity also diminish that Importation, and at the same Time have a direct and fatal Tendency to encourage and promote the Wealth, Commerce, Navigation, and Revenue of Rival Nations, at the Expence of our own, as well as operate to the immediate Injury of the Petitioners, without being eventually of Service to the Cause of Humanity; and, the Petitioners therefore trust, that the House will reject all Measures tending to an Abolition of the Slave Trade, upon which the Existence and Welfare of the Sugar Colonies so much depend, and in which the Property and Credit of the Petitioners are so deeply interested and involved And therefore praying. That the House will adopt no Resolution injurious to their Interestq, and that they may be at Liberty to be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, and to adduce Evidence at the Bar of the House, in Support of their just Rights.:

That they may be at Liberty to be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, and to produce Evidence in Support of their Cafe, and that the House will not come to any Resolution injurious to the Rights and Property of the Petitioners Constituents.

Petitions presented to the House in the last and the present Session of Parliament, and, the Petitioner also observes, that the said Petitions have, together with several other Papers, been referred to the Confuicra-tien of the said Committee j and that, as many of the said Petitions pray for an Abolition of the said Trade, the Petitioner finds himself under the Necdfity of stating tq the House, that the Assembly of the I (land of Jamaica did, in the Course of last Year, appoint a Committee to examine into, and report to the House, the Allegations and Charges contained in the several Petitions which have been presented to the Britjb House of Commons on the Subject of the Slave Trade, and the Treatment of the Negroes, &c. &c.; and that the said Committee made Two Reports upon the said Subject, in the latter of which, presented to the Assembly on the 1 ath of November last, they take the Liberty to represent, That, “ if it shall be determined by the British Parliament to abolish the African Trade altogether (a Measure which must, “ in the Result, ruin the Sugar Islands) they trust in the Justice of th c British Nation, that they shall not

<r be made the Sacrifice upon this Occasion, but that “ the Legislature will give them such a Compensation as the consequent Diminution of the Value of their “ Properties, and their ultimate Destruction, shall en- title them to expedfc j and that they have the greater “ Reason to indulge this Expectation, from the Justice that has been done to the late Proprietors of “ Florida, and also to such of the African Merchants as “ would be Sufferers by the late Regulation j” and the Petitioner thinks it proper to apprize the House, that the Property of his Condiments in Jamaica, in Negroes, Lands, Buildings, Cattle, &c. &c. is estimated at Thirty-six Millions of Pounds Sterling, at the least; and that the Petitioner deemed it his indispensable Duty to state this Matter fully to the House, in Confidence that such are the Principles of Equity and Justice which have hitherto directed the Resolutions of the House, that no Plan whatever, for the Abolition of the Slave Trade will be by them adopted, until a sufficient Fund shall have been established, and such a Sum of Money actually raised, by the Legislature of Great Britain, as shall be adequate to the Compensation and Indemnification of all the Proprietors in the Island of Jamaica for all the Loss which they must inevitably sustain by such proposed Abolition of the Slave Trade; and that the Petitioner, in the present Stage of the Business, will not presume to anticipate the Sentiments of the House in respect to any Plan relative to the Slave Trade that may be offered to them, but he begs Leave to express his full and implicit Confidence in the Candour, Wisdom, and Impartiality of the House, that no Resolution will, in a Matter of such infinite Consequence to his Constituents, be adopted by the House, until full and complete Evidence shall first have been heard and duly considered by the House-: And therefore praying. That he may be heard, by himself or his Counsel, in such Stage of the Proceedings as he shall be advised will moil conduce to the Support and Establishment of the just Rights and lawful Claims of his Condiments.

Betirion from A Petition of the Society of Writers to His Ma-WrfterTlo "he jesty’s Signet in Scotland, was presented to the House, signeYinScot- and read} Taking Notice of an Act passed in the land. Twenty-fifth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign,

for granting certain Duties on Certificates to be taken out by Solicitors, Attornies, and others, praftiling in certain Courts of Justice in Great Britain, and certain other Duties, with respect to Warrants, Mandates, and Authorities, to be entered or filed of Record as therein mentioned; and Setting forth, That the Petitioners being adjudged liable to pay the Tax on Attornies, a Tax which they conceive to be highly ex-

ceptionable, they are compelled, in order to obtain Relief, to make an Appeal to the Legislature, and this they do upon Principles, some of which are peculiar to their Situation, knd which, had they been urged and fully explained in proper Time, would probably have procured an Exception in their Favour, but those Principles which they have to plead, in common with all the other Descriptions of Men fub>-jested to the Tax, ought, in their Apprehension, to produce a total Repeal of the Law by which it is imposed; and that the Petitioners have hitherto been taught to believe, that every Tax imposed upon any individual Person, or any particular Description of Persons, without extending in its Effects to the People at large, is, as being partial and personal, not only adverse to the Spirit and Maxims of our Constitution, but peculiarly dangerous to the Safety of private Property; and that, with regard to the Attorney Tax, its being both partial and personal, in the strictest Sense of the Words, is inconteftibly evident, for not only is it confined to a particular Class of Individuals, not only is a certain Description of opulent and respectable Persons, in the very Pro-session of the Law, totally free from its Operation, but there is also a special Provision in the Statute itself, declaring that those Individuals, to whom the Tax extends, shall not, directly or indirectly, under any Pretence whatever, claim, demand, or receive, from their Clients or Employers, any Sum of Mon tty whatever, for or in respect of the Payment of the Rates or Duties thereby imposed; and that the Statute of which the Petitioners complain, while it felefts them, and others in particular Circumstances, as Objects of a special Imposition, and their Profession as an Object of Legislative Discouragement, while it prohibits them from laying the Duty on their Clients or Employers, while it even confers a total Exemption on certain respectable and opulent Individuals, who likewise follow the Law as an Occupation, and while it has thus drawn a partial Line of Discriminatiort, not only between the Petitioners and His Majesty’s Subjects in general, but even between them and other Men praftiling the Law, cannot but operate forcibly in the Public Mind, as a Reproach on the very Cha-rafter of the Profession of which the Petitioners and others are Members, as well as on that of the Individuals who exercise that Profession; and that these Effects of the present Law the Petitioners feel perhaps the more strongly, because they had Reason to expect that their Education, both general and professional, prescribed by the Rules of their Society, as well as the Conduct of its individual Members in Time past, had placed them above every unjust and ill-grounded Prejudice, because they possess, by virtue of their Office, a considerable public Trust from the Crown in the Executive Department of Government, and because, by the Treaty of Union, the Members of their Society are eligible to fill the.important and honourable Station of Judges in the Supreme Civil Court of Scotland, the Petitioners therefore, the Members of an ancient and respectable Society enjoying an important Trust, and still more important Privileges, are compelled to complain of a Law, which in its Effects cannot but injure, in the Public Opinion, the Name and Character of their Society, as well as the personal Respect and Consideration of its individual Members: And that, for all these Reasons, and many others which might be urged, from the Inequality of the Tax, the Smallness of its Produce, the great Expence, Trouble, and Vexation, with which it is attended in the Collection, both to the Parties and to the Revenue Officers, therefore praying, That the House will take the Premises into Consideration, that the said Act may be repealed, or that-Rich Relief may be given to the Petitioners as to the House shall appear just and proper.

Petition from several Creditors of Estates in the West India Islands against the Abolition of the Slave Trade.

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed. Creditors, by Mortgage and otherwise, of Estates and Plantations in the West India Islands, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners having advanced divers Sums of Money, and some of them to a considerable Amount, to the Owners of Estates and Plantations in the West India Islands, upon Mortgage thereof, and in which Mortgages the Negroes belonging to the several Planters in those Islands are included, and considered as constituting a very material Part of their Security, are much alarmed by having observed, in the Votes, that the House has resolved to form itself into a Committee to take into Consideration certain Petitions which have been presented to the House for the Abolition of the Slave Trade; and the Petitioners beg Leave to observe, that it has been upon the Faith of the British Parliament they have been encouraged

to lend Money to those Planters, on the Security of their Lands, and the Labour of their Negroes; and that the Petitioners will not presume to obtrude their Sentiments and Opinions upon the House, respecting the Principle or Practice of the said Trade, which has long been fanCtioned, supported, and authorized by Law, but they must, however, beg Leave to observe, that, if the Abolition of that Trade should be declared to take Place immediately, and before the Planters can put themselves into a Situation to Cultivate their Lands by other Means than such as are at present used for that Purpose, the Petitioners Security for their Principal Money must be considerably diminished, and they can have no Hopes of receiving the interest thereof from the Produce of the Plantations, thus deprived of the Means for their Cultivation; and that the Petitioners, thus circumstanced, look upon their Situation with Despair, and as they believe it is a Maxim of the British Constitution, not to suffer any Wrong or Injury to be done to Individuals without causing an adequate Satisfaction to be made for the fame, therefore praying the House to take the peculiar Circumstances of their same into Consideration, and that, if the Abolition of the Trade complained

of Should pass into a Law, the Petitioners will be considered by the House to be entitled to receive a just and reasonable Compensation from the State, for the Injury which they shall thereby sustain.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider further of the Circumstances of the Slave Trade, complained of in the several Petitions which were presented to the House in the last Session of Parliament, relative to the State of the African Slave Trade.

45° n° Junii. A. 1789.

pursuant to the Provisions contained in the Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, unless such Corn or Grain be imported in British-bm\t Ships; and that the Permission to import Foreign Grain is founded on a Necessity for Supply, arising from the Scarcity of Grain at Home, that the Period of Three Months is too Short for the Dispatch of Vessels from England, to load Grain in the Ports of the Baltic, and perform the Voyage to the Western Ports of this Kingdom, and that the Period of Two Months is too foort to admit of Orders being sent for the Purchase of Grain in the Ports of the Baltic, the principal Granaries of Europe for loading the same in Vessels of the Country, to be chartered on the Spot, and for performing the Voyage to the Western Ports of England; and that to prohibit the entering or landing of Foreign Grain, under the Joint Locks of the King and the Importer, in any Case, is to expose Grain to Ruin, the Commodity being of a perishable Nature, and must expose the Importer to the unnecessary Hazard of a Loss, Short only of the actual Con-fifcation of his Property in the Pursuit of a Trade certainly not Contraband, but for the Supply of the Kingdom, in Times of Scarcity, with Corn from Abroad; and that the Time of Three Months having been found too long for properly ascertaining the Average Prices of Grain, for determining the Expediency of allowing the Importation thereof, Provision is made in the said Bill for regulating the Importation of all Foreign Grain, except Oats, at the Port of London, and in the Counties of Essex, Kent, and Sussex, by the Average Prices of the Aggregate Quantities of British Grain fold in the Six Weeks immediately preceding each Quarter Session for the City of London, but no Provision is made in the said Bill for regulating the Importation of Foreign Grain at the Out Ports of the Kingdom, in like Manner by the Average Prices for the Six Weeks immediately preceding the Time for making up the Quarterly Returns, it being directed by the Bill that the Importation of Grain, in the Districts of the Out Ports, shall be regulated by the Average Prices for the Periods of Three Months preceding the Times of making up the said Returns; and that it is intended to be enacted, by the said Bill, that in all Cafes where Wheat shall be sold by Weight, Fifty-seven Pounds Weight shall be deemed equal to One Bushel of Winchester Measure, which the Petitioners consider

an unfair Conversion of Wheat sold by Weight into Winchester Measure, as good heavy Wheat exceeds Sixty-one Pounds Weight the Winchester Bushel, and the true Weight of Middling British Wheat cannot, with any Justice, be taken so low as Fifty-seven Pounds Weight for the Winch Bushel: And therefore praying. That the Provisions in the Bill, which shorten the Time allowed for the Importation of Foreign Grain, and prohibit the landing such Foreign Grain at any Time under the Joint Locks of the King and the Importer, may not pass into a Law, that Provision may be made in the Bill to regulate the Importation of all Foreign Grain, Pulse, and Rape Seed, in the Districts of the Out Ports of the Kingdom, by the Average Prices of the Aggregate Quantities of British Grain, Pulse, and Rape Seed, in each respective District for the Six Weeks immediately preceding the Times of making up the Quarterly Returns, and that, in all Cafes where Wheat is sold by Weight, a Quantity of not less than Fifty-eight Pounds Weight shall be deemed equal to One Bushel of Winchester Measure.

A Petition of the Merchants and Manufacturers of Manchester, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners observe that, by a Bill now depending in Parliament, all Goods woven or fabricated in the Loom in this Kingdom, which shall be fold entire in the Piece, and in Lots of the Price therein to be mentioned, may be sold by public Sale, by Way of Auction, for or on Account of the Manufacturers, or first Purchasers thereof, free of the Excise Duty of Seven Pence, now chargeable for every Twenty Shillings of the Purchase Money arising upon Sales at Auction; and that the Petitioners are well satisfied, that Sales by Auction of Piece Goods, the Manufacture of this Kingdom, are highly injurious to Merchants, Manufacturers, and Trade in general, and, that if the Duty now chargeable upon Auctions be taken off the Sale of Piece Goods in particular, that Mode of Sale will be encouraged to the Injury of the fair Trader j and that the Petitioners have great Reason to believe, that the Sentiments Of other manufacturing Towns in this Kingdom would be entirely conformable to their own in this respect, if there was Time sufficient to collect them: And therefore praying, That the said Bill may not be permitted to pass into a Law, or that, at least, the further Consideration thereof may be deferred until the next Session of Parliament.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

A Petition of the Manufacturers of Cotton Yarns and Cotton Goods in Great Britain, was presented to the House, and read $ Setting forth, That the Petitioners have embarked large Sums of Money in the Erection of Cotton Mills, Hand Engines, and other ingenious Machinery, for the Purpose of Carding, Roving, and Spinning the Yarns, now used in the various Manufactures of Cotton Goods made in Great Britain; and that, in the Course of the last Twelve Months, the Petitioners have been compelled to discharge a great Number of the Men, Women, and Children, which they employed in that Business, the Mills in general have been reduced to Half Work, some have been totally abandoned in Consequence of the Stagnation of Trade, and the greatest Distress has prevailed among that Class of the Petitioners who spin upon the Hand Engines, who have been under the Necefllty of laying aside nearly One Half of the Machinery formerly used in that Branch of Spinning} and that the Consequences resulting from such Alternatives have been distressing in the Extreme, not only to the Petitioners, but also to a very numerous Body of industrious Members of the Community of the lower Class of Spinners, who had embarked their whole Property in those Machines, and who are now deditute of Employment, and have no Means of ob-

taining Bread for themselves and Families but by being enabled to resume their former Employments j and that the Petitioners conceive that, at the present Moment, there is a Crisis in the Cotton Manufactory in Great Britain, which, if properly improved, may tend in a great Measure to restore Vigour to that Trade, and extend the Consumption to such a Degree, as again to give Employment to the unoccupied Machinery, as well as to the numerous Bodies of Men, Women, and Children, formerly trained to that Business; that the Grounds upon which this Extent of Consumption may be expected are, the reduced Price of the Raw Material of Cotton Wool — the low Price of Labour, compared to former Years — the new Improvements and Facilities introduced into the whole Process of the Manufacture — all which combine in leading the Petitioners to aConclufion, that, from the great Reduction in the Price, and the improved Quality of the Goods, it is only necessary to open a fair and unfettered Transit of the British-ma.de Callicoes and Muslins into Foreign Countries, in order to obtain such an Increase of Consumption as would completely renovate the Trade, render the unoccupied Machinery again useful to the Petitioners and the Country, by giving Employment to a numerous Body of His Majesty’s Subjects of both Sexes and of all Ages, whose Labour may be exported to the great Benefit of the State, and thereby preserving to the Nation many valuable and ingenious Artists, who might orherways ' be compelled to transfer their Skill and Industry tQ Rival Countries} and that the Petitioners conceive that, if it were possible to convey the Callicoes

and Muffins, at their present reduced Prices, into the Hands of the great Continental Buyers, under the same Advantages, and at as small an Expence as prevails at the public Sales of the various Companies of Merchants in Europe, who import the same Articles from Foreign Countries, new Channels of Co'nfump-tien would instantly open, and by Means of a fair and general Exhibition, and a direct Transit at the least possible Expence, the British Callicoes and Muslins would enter fairly into Competition with the similar Fabrics of Foreign Manufacture, and acquire a Preeminence at tnoft of the Markets of the Continent; and that, in order to establish the same System of public Sale, which prevails all over Europe with every fair Advantage to the Manufacturer, which a Regard to the general Interest of the Country requires, it becomes necessary that the Duty upon Auctions, in so far as the same fnatl affect the real Manufacturer, Should be removed; and that the Petitioners solicit this Exemption, not only on the Grounds of National Expediency and Utility, but also on the Grounds of National Justice, because a similar Exemption is granted to the Manufacturers of Grain and Provender, as well as to the Importers of all Goods the Produce of the British Colonies and Plantations Abroad; That, in Addition to the Circumstance of no Revenue arising at present from the Sale of Cotton Goods, it would seem (independent of National Utility) that an Exemption in the present Instance in Favour of the actual Manufacturer would in no Respect tend either, to diminifti the Revenue, or to trench upon those Principles which were adopted by the Legislature when the Auction Duty passed into a Law, for surely it was not intended to burthen the British Manufacturer in the Sale of his own Goods in any Mode he thought belt, and at the same Time to exempt the Importation from the Colonies: And therefore praying the House to pass a Law in this present Session for the Purpose of extending the Exemptions contained in the Acts of the Seventeenth and Twenty-third Years of the Reign of His present Majesty, commonly called the Auction Duty Act, to all Goods exposed to public Sale, for Behoof of the bond fule Manufacturers and first Purchasers.

8 A Petition

Petition from the Manufacturers ot Cotton GomIs in Glasgow, for ex'.cr.ding the Exemptions in Favour of Goods sold by Auction.

A Petition of the Manufacturers of Muslins, Callicoes, and other Cotton Goods, in the City of Glasgow, and the Neighbourhood, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners have not only been among the first who by great Labour and Exertion have introduced the Manufacture of Muslins into Great Britain, but have, by Steadiness and Perseverance, been able so to improve the Fabric of this Article, and also to make such Progress in the Manufacture of Callicoes and other Cotton Goods, as to afford the best Prospects of the British Manufacture comparing with, and of being even superior to, the same Species of Goods imported from Foreign Countries of the Middling and Coarser Qualities j and that the Petitioners, by close Application and Frugality, aided by the low Price of the Raw Material of Cotton Wool, have also been able so to reduce the Price of British Muslins, as to afford the belt Grounds to conclude, that an extensive and advantageous Sale might be opened to the different Markets of Europe, if the Auction Duty was removed, and a fair and unfettered Transit opened to Foreign Countries, at the lead possible Expence, and under Circumstances where, by the Collection of a great Aggregate of our different Articles, and by periodical Public Sales, the great Buyers upon the Continent would be invited to purchase the British Goods, but this Object, however desirable to the Manufacturers and to the Country, cannot be attained, until the Auction Duty affecting Public Sales is removed, or at least until the Exemptions contained in the Statute imposing the said Duty shall extend to the Goods sold by the bond side Manufacturer, upon the same Principle that such Exemptions are extended to the Farmer in the Sale of the Produce of his Lands, and to the Merchant importing Goods from the Colonies Abroad, and also to the East India Company: That every Indulgence, which shall tend to increase the Exportation of the Labour of the People, must be advantageous to the State, and if such Facilities can be granted, without diminishing the actual Resources of the State, it is hoped that the House will fee at once the Expediency and Justice of the Exemption now solicited by the Manufacturers; and it is well known, that no Cotton Goods can be reputably fold, at present, by Public Sale, because of the Auction Duty, and thus it happens, that, while nothing can be acquired by Government towards the Improvement of the Revenue, this valuable Branch of National Industry remains fettered by an Excise which shuts out every Hope of opening, by a Public Sale, those new Channels of Consumption which are so necessary in the present depressed State of the Trade, and without which Foreign Purchasers, who attend at the various Public Auctions in different Parts of Europe, cannot be expected to become Purchasers of the British Manufactures, as the present Mode of Private Contract has never been found to excite the Attention of the great Buyers from the Continent, because of the enhanced Price which is the unavoidable Consequence of this circuitous Mode of Sale, and the great Difficulty of finding proper Aflortments in

any one Place; and that the Petitioners would state it to the House, as their unbiaffed Opinion, that there is no Mode of Sale likely to be so effectually calculated to increase the Vend arid Consumption of British Cotton Goods on the Continent, as a Public Vendue, or Auction, at ffated Periods of the Year, where great Aflortments are brought together, thus inviting Foreigners to attend, and enabling the Manufacturer at the same Time, by a more (Economical Mode of Sale, to afford their Manufactures at a lower Price, while they themselves receive the same Profit, and thereby creating (in the Abolition of the Burthens and Expences attending a circuitous Sale) a Bounty in Favour of the British Goods in a Foreign Market, to the great Benefit of the Nation at large: And therefore praying the House to pass a Law, in this Session, for extending the Exemptions, in Favour of Goods sold by Auction, to such Sales as shall be made for the Behoof of the actual Manufacturers and first Purchasers.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table.

Ordered, That the Order of the Day, for the House Committee on to resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, £^B°|jDu,y* upon the Bill to exempt all Piece Goods wove in this Kingdom, and which shall be sold by Auction, from the Duty imposed on such Sales; for exempting Persons licensed to retail Spirituous Liquors from the Payment of the Duties imposed on such Licences, who shall leave off retailing such Liquors before the Expiration of the Time for which such Licences shall be granted; and for obliging Persons who shall deal in Brandy, not being Retailers, Rectifiers, or Distillers, to take out Licences for that Purpose,' be now read.

Your Committee having taken into Consideration the Matter to them referred, did cause the Plans already made of the said Ground, and the prquent Buildings thereon, to be laid before them; and, upon Enquiry, finding that most of the said Buildings arc at present in 'a decayed and ruinous State, and that great Part of them, from their Situation, and the Occupancy thereof, are in great Danger from Fire;

Your Committee caused to be made and laid before them a Ground Plan, upon a Scale distinguishing the Dimensions, from the North East Corner of the Gate leading into Westminster Hall to Westminster Bridge, and from thence in a Line with the River to Parliament Stairs, and all the Buildings in Old Palace Yard, home to the New Passage leading to the House of Commons, which includes all the Buildings on the East and South Sides of Westminster Hall.

Upon Perusal of the said Plans, your Committee could not avoid being struck with the Magnitude thereof, and of the National Consequence of the Offices and other Places at present existing for the Transaction of public Business, and the Preservation of our most valuable Records. Your Committee cannot help thinking, thatfome great and noble Plan ought to be adopted , conformable to which, public Buildings Should be erected, not only substantial and convenient, but also of a Magnificence suitable to the Dignity of this Country. Your Committee therefore thought it expedient, as an additional Ground of their Proceeding, to apply to the most eminent Artists of this Kingdom for their Opinion upon the actual State of the present Buildings, previous to the Artists being desired to furnish your Committee with Plans and Estimates for the intended Alterations.

That the said Artists have accordingly attended your Committee; and, at their Request, having viewed the said Grounds and Buildings, have made the Report which is hereunto annexed.

Your Committee feel it a Duty incumbent upon them, to submit to the Consideration of this House, That, in making the said Plans and Estimates, a considerable Expence will be incurred by them, for which 4

your Committee think they ought to be indemnified; and therefore your Committee have come to the following Resolution:

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Sum of £. a,000 will be necessary towards the procuring Plans to enable your Committee to form their Opinion in what Manner the said Buildings -may be best secured from the Danger of Fire, and also what Improvements may be proper to make therein.

To the Honourable the Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to inspect the several Houses and other Buildings immediately adjoining to Westminster Hall, and the Two Houses of Parliament, and the Offices thereto belonging, &c. &c.

In Obedience to your Resolution of the 17th Instant. That we Should inspect all the Buildings of the House of Lords, the House of Commons, Office of Exchequer, Court of Exchequer, the different Offices belonging to the fame, and the other Buildings contiguous to Westminster Hall, and to report our Opinion of the present State of the fame, and their Security from Fire and other Accidentsj we beg Leave to make the following Report, in which we are unanimous, after having inspected the same with/Care and Attention.

The House of Lords, Princes Chamber, and Painted Chamber, are Buildings of great Antiquity, in many Parts defective, and have been altered and repaired so very much, from Time to Time, that, though they may stand many Years, are incapable of useful Repair and Improvement} and there are Cellars under the Whole, variously occupied, only One of which is secured by Arches from the Communication of Fire. All the Buildings East of the House of Lords are in so bad a State, that many of them are in immediate Danger of falling down, and are therefore unoccupied and (hut up} and the others would cost more to repair than re-build them. The Building West of the House of Lords, containing the Entrance thereto, and the Staircase and Committee Room, is a substantial modern Building; and the other Buildings adjoining, comprising the Passages, Black Rod and Privy Seal Rooms, are in Part built with Timber, liable to rapid Decay, and Accidents from Fire } and the Remainder extremely old and ruinous.

The House of Commons, though an ancient Building, has been so continually repaired, that it is in a State to remain a great many Years} but is so connected with the Auditor of the Exchequer’s House and Offices, and surrounded by a great Number of other Buildings, applied to various Purposes, and in various Occupations, as to expose the Whole to a general Conflagration, Should an accidental Fire happen in any One of them.

The Dwelling House in Cotton Garden, belonging to the Principal Clerk of the House of Commons, communicating the rewith, erected within Thirty Years past, is defective in several Places, from the Insecurity of the Foundations.

The Buildings East of Westminster Hall, between it and the River, are, the Pell Office and Chambers over it in the East Tower, and the Offices of the Exchequer, contiguous and connected with the Hall, and situate between New Palace Yard and St. Stephen's Court-, those of the Four Tellers are most inconveniently arranged, and liable to immediate Destruction in case of Fire, being placed in the upper Story, without any Walls of Division, of Arched Floors; are fe-parated only by Timber Partitions, surrounded by combustible Buildings, Stables, Coach Houses, Hay Lofts, Servants Lodging Rooms, and Kitchens; the Dutchy Court of Lancaster, a flight Building of One

Room,

Room, and over it the Dutchy Chamber, with Garrets above; the Kitchen of the Clerk to the Deputy Ulher of the Exchequer, a low Shed, between these Rooms and the Eastermost Tower, and immediately connected with them. The House inhabited by the Ulher of the Exchequer, in New Palace Yard, Eastward of the Dutchy Court of Lancaster, has a Brick Front, and its Rear is entirely of Timber, Lathed and Plaistered, forming Two Sides of a narrow Court, from which it receives Light, and which communicates with the Windows of the Tellers Offices, Cash Rooms, and of the Dutchy Court; and most of the Kitchen Offices belonging to the Deputy Ulher and his Clerk are immediately under those Offices, and the small Wood Staircase in the C.enter of them, and leading thereto.

The Buildings on the East Side of New Palace Yard, from the King's Bridge or Water Gate, to the House in Post'eftion of Mr. Roberts, Tenant to the Marquis of Buckingham, as a Teller of the Exchequer, contain the late Cofferer’s Office, the Office of the Auditor of the Land Revenue, the Lottery Office, the Examiner’s Office, the Tellers for the Payment of American Claims, the Pells American Office, the Exchequer Bill Bookbinder’s Office, the Office of the Auditor of the Principality of the Annuity

Pell Office, the First and Second Annuity Offices, and the 14 per Cent. Annuity Office, which are principally constructed with Timber, Lath and Plaistered, or Weather-boarded j in many Places prop’t up, and in others contiguous to low Sheds, equally combusti-ble. The adjoining Building Southward is Mr. Roberts’s House, which with the Garden occupies all the Space from St. Stephen’s Court to the River, and is immediately connected with the last mentioned Offices; it has been lately repaired, and some additional small Buildings erected thereto. The next House, adjoining Southward to the last mentioned, belongs to Lord Viscount Bayham, as Teller of the Exchequer; the Buildings and Garden likewise extend to the Thames, and are at present unoccupied, being in a very dilapidated State.

On the West Side of St. Stephen’s Court, against the East Wall of Westminster Hall, are the Coach Houses and Stables of the Auditor of the Exchequer, having Hay Lofts and Servants Lodging Rooms over them, which adjoin to and come close under the Windows of the Office and Calli Room of one of the Tellers. On the South of this Court is the Auditor of the Exchequer’s House, extending Southward to the House of Commons, and under Part of it; the Garden extends to the River. The Buildings are substantial, and extend under Two of the Committee Rooms of the House of Commons.

The Court of Exchequer, and Exchequer Chamber, contiguous to, and connected with, Westminster Hall, are very old, but not in a State of actual Ruin. On the Ground Floor, under the Court of Exchequer, is the Custos Brevium of the Court of Common Pleas, and Treasurer’s Office belonging; the Ceiling and Walls of them are lined with Deal, are insecure from Fire, and very damp. Adjoining Westward to these, and projecting into the Street, to the great Obstruc-tien and imminent Panger of Persons and Carriages passing to and from the Houses of Parliament, is situated an old Brick Building, occupied on the Ground Floor by the Deputy Ulher of the Court of Exchequer, most of his Roqms containing a Fire Place, and the Ceilings are flat and low; over these, on the One Pair of Stairs, is the King’s Remembrancer’s Office, and over that the Augmentation Office. We understand, that, so long ago as the passing of the Act of Parliament for building Westminster Bridge, a Clause was inserted, empowering the Commissioners under that Act to remove this Nuisance, the Roof of which is immediately connected with the Court of Exchequer. The Public Houses and Coffee Vol. XLIV,

Houses on the South Side of New Palace Yard immediately adjoin the Custos Brevium of the Court of Common Pleas, and are particularly dangerous, as they have several Chimnies and Coppers; the Roofs are under and close to the Windows of the Custos Brevium, and some of them covered with Sail Cloth pitched; the Smoke of One of the Chimnies is conveyed by a flight Tin Funnel, and, as well as the Flues, are near the Windows of Westminster Hall, of the Towers, and of the Court of Exchequer.

Next to Saint Margaret's Street, and adjoining Southward to the old Brick Building before-mentioned, is a Building of the same Kind, containing the Tally Office, being a Depository for the Tallies belonging to the Exchequer. Adjoining Southward thereto is the Coach House for the Judges, a flight Timber Building, covered with Tiles.

The Stone Building next Saint Margaret's Street, comprising Committee Rooms, and other Apartments occupied by Officers of the House of Commons, Custos Brevium of the Court of King’s Bench, and the Exchequer Bill Office, is of recent Date, and very substantial. Behind that Building, and contiguous to Westminster Hall, arc the Court of Common Pleas, Judges Chambers, and Record Office, which are in tolerable good Condition; to them are annexed sundry Excrescences, mostly of Timber, which should be removed, as they increase the Danger of Fire and its Communication.

The Court of ReqUefts is in itself a secure substantial Building, but communicates with, and is surrounded on the South and West by, a Variety of Houses, which are private Property, Part of them Timber; which must very much endanger the Whole, as long as they remain.

We beg Leave to submit to this Honourable Committee, That, from the very circumstantial Detail we have entered into of the State of the various Parts of the Buildings which the Committee requested we might examine, it is almost superfluous and unnecessary to declare our unanimous Opinion, That the Hazard they have been, and {bill are, exposed to from Fire is so great, that we cannot help being astonished at their having so long and so happily escaped (with but One late and fortunate Exception) from the most imminent Danger. Unprotected by Walls of either Brick or Stone, connected and joined together by Boarded or Lath and Plaistered Partitions; with Iron Bars to defend the Windows of the most consequentiai Offices, which serve to attract the Lightning, to the Destruction of their valuable Contents; with Funnels and Chimnies running up in old decayed Piers, in the very Bosom of these combustible Materials, in many of which Fire from a neglected Chimney might consume the Whole; without the Possibility of bringing sufficient Water to extinguish the Flames, such Aid being hitherto overlooked, or deemed unnecessary, and not more than One Engine kept near the most elfential Offices in this Kingdom.

All which is humbly submitted.

The House being informed that Mr. from the Board of Land Revenue, attended at the Door; he was called in; and, at the Bar, presented to the House, pursuant to the Directions of an Act of Parliament,

A Fifth Report of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the State and Condition of the Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, and to fell or alienate Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents: And also,

A Plan of the New Forest, referred to in the said Report.

And then he withdrew.

And the Titles of the said Report and Plan were read.

The said Plan is preserved amongst the other Papers of this Session j and the said Report is as followcthj viz.

To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgefies, in Parliament assembled.

The Fifth Report of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the State and Condition of the Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, and to fell or alienate Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents.

Having, in our Third Report, given a brief Account of the antient Government of the Forests in general, under the Forest Laws, and of the Changes which gradually took. Place on the Decline of that Establishment, terminating in the present System of Management; having shewn the Defects in that new System, and mentioned the Necessity we Should be under (from the various and dissimilar Rights of the Crown and of Individuals in the different Forests) to report the State of each Forest separately; — we propose now to lay before the Legislature the Result of our Enquiry into the State and Condition of the New Forest, and to suggest the best Means that occur

to us for its future Management and Improvement.

The New Forest is situated in that Part of Shire which is bounded on the East by Southampton River, and on the South by the British Channel. It possesses Advantages of Situation, with respect to the Convenience of Water Carriage, and nearness to the Dock Yards, superior to every other Forest, having in its Neighbourhood several Ports and Places for shipping Timber, among which is at the

Distance of only Two Miles, Bewley about Half a Mile, and Redbridge Three or Four Miles from the Forest, and the Navigation to the most

considerable Dock Yard in this Kingdom, is only about 30 Miles from the nearest of those Places.

This is the only Forest belonging to the Crown, of which the Origin is known: Domclday Book contains the most distinct Account of its Afforeftation by William the Conqueror: The Contents of every Field, Farm, or Estate afforested, in Hides, Carucates, or Virgates, by which the Extent of Land was then computed, together with the Names of the Hundreds and Villages, and of the former Proprietors (which are for the most Part Saxon) the Relit or Yearly Value of each Possession, and the Tax which had been paid for it to the Crown, during the Reign of Edward the Confeflor, before the Inhabitants were expelled, and that Part of the Country laid waste, are all to be found in that most curious and venerable Record.

Wishing to discover the original Extent of the Forest, we extracted, for our own Information, all that relates to it in that antient Survey. The Fx-tract is far too voluminous to be inferred in the Appendix to this Report; but we have given there a

Copy of Two or Three of the Articles, as a Specimen of what may be found in the Book itself, relative to the whole Forest.

The Names of many of the Places having been Changed since that Time, it is difficult to afeercain, with Precision, what were then the Limits of the Forest. The oldest Perambulation we have met with is among the Pleas of the Forest, in the 8th Year of King Edward I. preserved in the Chapter-House at Westntinster\ and a Copy of it is inserted in the Appendix. The Boundaries there described include all the Country from Southampton River on the East to the Avon on the West, following the Sea Coast as the Southern Boundary between those Rivers, and extending Northwards as far as North ,or North

Charford, on the West; and to Wade and Orebrugge, o Owerbridge, on the East; and the greatest Part, if not the Whole, of that extensive District, is mentioned in Domesday Book to be Forest, belonging to the Crown.

Another Perambulation was, however, made in the 29th of the same King, which leaves out a great Part of the Country contained within the former. This Perambulation, which is preserved in the Tower, and of which a Copy is also given in the Appendix, confines the Forest to Limits, which, as far as we can trace them, appear to have been followed in 22d Year of Charles II. when the Forest was again perambulated. By the Charta de Foresta, all Lands not belonging to the Crown which had been afforested by Henry II. Richard I. or King John, were to be dif-afforested; but as no Provision was made for the Reduction of the more antient Afforeftations, it is not easy to account for the great Diminution of this Forest in the Reign of Edward I. who was not a Prince likely to submit to any incroachment on his Rights.

The Perambulation of the 22d Charles II. also inserted in the Appendix, is the last which we find on Record; it contains the present legal Bounds of the Forest, and was given to our Surveyors as their Guide, in taking the Plan which they have made by our piredtion. From that Plan, with the Approbation of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, an Engraving has been made, a Copy of which will be delivered with this Report.

According to the last mentioned Perambulation, and the Plan, the Forest extends from Godjhill on the North West, to the Sea on the South East, about Twenty Miles; and from Hardley on the East, to Ring-wood on the West, about Fifteen Miles; and contains within those Limits about 92,365 Acres, Statute Measure. The whole of that Quantity, however, is not Forest Land, or now the Property of the Crown: There are several Manors and other considerable Freehold Estates within the Perambulation, belonging to Individuals, to the Amount of about 24,797 Acres: About 625 Acres are Copyhold, or Customary Lands, belonging to His Majesty’s Manor of Lyndhurst: About 1,004 Acres are Leasehold, under the Crown, granted for certain Terms of Years, and forming Part of the demised Land Revenue, under the Management of the Surveyor General of Crown Lands: About 901 Acres are Purpreftures, or Incroachments on the Forest: About 1,193 Acres more are inclosed Lands, held by the Master Keepers and Groom Keepers, with their respective Lodges; and the Remainder, being about 63,845 Acres, are the Woods and Waste Lands of the Forest.

In each Species of the Property abovementioned, the Crown has different Rights or Interests.

1 ft. In such of the Freeholds within the Perambulations as are subject to the Regard of the Forest, and which are of the Nature of Purlieus, the Crowr. preserves certain Rights relative to the Deer and Game; which Rights are now of little Value to the x Crown,

Crown, but if exercised to their full Extent, would be very prejudicial to the Owners of the Lands j and in most of the Townships and Villages which have Right of Common in the Forest, the Estates are subject to the Payment of small Rents to the Crown, in Corn, Fowls, and Eggs; and in Money under the different Denominations of Hocktide Money, Month Money, Leaze Fee Money, and Turf Delf Money, for Pasture and Fuel (all comprized under the general Denomination of Forest Rents); and to certain Rates payable for the Pannage of Swine.

2nd)y. The Copyhold Lands belonging to the Manor of Lyndburst, are the Soil and Inheritance of the Crown, and are granted to sundry Tenants by Copy of Court Roll, according to the Custom of that Manor: They are subject to the Payment of certain Quit Rents, which, according to an Account delivered to us by the Steward, amount to £. 10. 16j. 7 id.per Annum, and to a Fine on adding

or exchanging Lives. Henots are also due from some of these Estates, but have nor been taken for several Years past. The Fines, which are arbitrary, arc at present computed on an old Valuation, which appears by the same Account to amount to £.476. 7 1

per Annum. The Timber and Trees on these Estates arc likewise the Property of the Crown: Some of the T enants of the Manor, distinguished by the Name of the Homage Tenants, are entitled by Custom to Eftovers for Fuel and Repairs, with which they are supplied from the Forest.

3rdly. The Estates within the Forest granted by Lease are the entire Property of the Crown j they are only Two in Number , viz1. New Park near Lyndburst, containing 417 Acres Statute Measure, of which 143 Acres arc Pasture and Arable Land; the rest is Woodland and rough Ground, of a Soil very favourable for the Growth of Oak, with a considerable Quantity of fine Timber now growing thereon. This Park is used as the general Pound for the toreft, for putting in stray Cattle found trespafiing on the Common } and the Keeper of the Park is obliged, upon the Drifts of the Forest, to take the Custody of such stray Cattle till claimed by the Owners, or otherwise disposed of according to Law, and is paid for the keeping of them by the Owners on taking them out of the Pound. The Custody of this Park is held by the Duke of Bedford, under a Lease granted in the Year 1771, to the late Duke of Bedford, for a Term of 31 Years, under a Relit of 15 per Annum.

The other Leasehold Estate consists of a House called Cox Leaze, and about 113 Acres of Land, and another House and about 96 Acres called Pondbead Farm, both near Lyndburst, with Two inclosed Woods adjoining, called Lbe Park Grounds and Mine House Grounds, containing 240 Acres; and another Wood called Cox Leaze Wild Grounds, containing 45 Acres, all very favourable for the Growth of Timber, and well docked with Oak and Beech. There are also comprized in this Lease some rough Pasture Lands called Butts Lawn Grounds, containing 91 Acres, which appear to have been heretofore inclosed, but the Fences are not now kept up. All these are held by the Representatives of the late Sir Philip Jennings Clerke, Baronet, under a Lease granted in the Year 1760, to Pamela Debell, Widow, for 31 Years, under Two Rents of £.6.6s. id. and £.x per Annum. In both these Leases the Timber is excepted to the Crown, and the Lessees have covenanted to keep the Buildings in Repair.

4thly. The Incroachments or Purpreftures, containing 902 Acres, consist chiefly of Cottages built by poor People, and small Parcels of Land adjoining to them. Some of the Incroachments have however been made by the Proprietors of neighbouring Estates, and added to their own Property. The incroach-Vol. XLIV.

ments are held at present without paying any Relit or Acknowledgment to the Crown; but having generally, if not in every Instance, been presented at the Forest Courts, and ordered to be pulled down and laid open, and the Intruders fined, the Lands must still be considered to belong to the Crown.

5thly. The Lands held with the Lodges in the Forest, or the greatest Part of them, which have been inclosed for Time immemorial, are the entire Property of the Crown, not subject to Rights of Common, or any other Claims. v

6thly. The Forest Lands, containing 63,845 Acres, are also the Property of the Crown, subject to certain Rights of Common of Pasture, Pannage, and Fuel, belonging to the Proprietors of Estates withirt or adjacent to the Forest , which Rights, under certain Limitations, were particularly saved and reserved to the Proprietors, and those of the Crown were defined and ascertained, by the Act of Ninth and Tenth William III. for the Increase and Preservatron of Timber in this Forest, of which an Abstract is inserted in the Appendix.

By that Ad the Crown was empowered to inclose Two thousand Acres of the Waste Lands of the said Forest, viz*.One thousand Acres forthwith, and the

remaining One thousand Acres immediately after the First Session of Parliament after the Year 1699; and also Two hundred Acres more. Yearly, for Twenty Years following, making in all Six thousand Acres, “ to remain in Severalty in the actual PdlTdfion of the Crown for ever, freed and discharged from all “ Manner of Right, Title, and Pretence whatsoever, “ and to be called, made, and kept, a Nursery for “ Wood and Timber onlyAnd the Crown was likewise empowered, so soon as the Trees in all or any Part of such Inclosures should be past Danger of being hurt by Cattle or Deer, to throw open the fame, and in lieu thereof to inclose an equal Quantity in any other Part of the Forest j keeping, in this Way, Six thousand Acres constantly inclosed as a Nursery for '1 imber. The Crown has also a Right to keep Deer on the uninclosed Part of the Forest, at all Times, without any Limitation on the Number.

By the same Act it was provided, “ That all Per-<c fons having any Right of Pasture or Pannage, or “ any Privileges within the Forest, should hold and “ enjoy the fame; that is to say, their Right of Pan-<( nage between the 14th September and the nth of November, Yearly (Old Stile) and their Right of *« Common of Pasture in and through the Waste “ Grounds of the Forest, at such Time and Times a9 “ the same should not be iriclosed, the Time of the “ Fence Month, that is to say, 15 Days before and ‘*15 Days after Midsummer, Yearly, and the Time “ of Winter Haining, that is to say, from the nth of November to the 23d of April, Yearly (O. S.) excepted, under and subject to the Forest Laws; “ saving also to the several adjacent Inhabitants their antient Right of Fuel, provided that such Inhabitants should not fell or otherwise dispose of any Parc *« thereof, nor that any Person or Persons presume to *« receive or take the same in other Manner than they

ought, nor by Reason of any Claim or Pretence of “ any Right that was not allowed, according to the “ Laws of the Forest, before the 27th Year of Queen “ Elizabeth."

The Rights of all Parties being thus distinctly ascertained by this Act of Parliament, and there being no Claim of any Consequence, founded on antient Usage, prior to the Date of that Act, except that of Eftovers for Fuel, to the adjacent Inhabitants, which is not likely to become the Subject of any Litigation or Dispute, we do not find it necessary to swell this Report with numerous Extracts from the antient Papers and Documents relative to it, or from the Books of the Forest, which we had Occasion to perufc: We

shall therefore only briefly (late, that after a careful Examination of all the Forest Books, of prior Date to this Act of Parliament, in the Custody of the Deputy Steward of the Courts of the Forest, and after perusing the Proceedings in Parliament while the Bill was de-« pending, we are satisfied that no Hardship or Injuf-by tice was done to the neighbouring Inhabitants, or Proprietors of Estates, by any of the Clauses of that Act, but that the greatest Attention was bellowed on an Enquiry into their Rights, as well as those of the Crown, and into the Condition of the Forest, the Abuseswhich prevailed, and the Means of remedying them i with which View different Commissions of Enquiry were issued to Men of Knowledge and Consideration, to which full and distinct Answers were returned; and it was not until after the fulleft Invef-tigation had been made, Counsel heard, and Witnesses examined, on Behalf of those who had Claims on the Forest, and the Bill debated and amended by the Lords, and those Amendments difeuffed and agreed to by the Commons, that the Act was suffered to pass.

We have also perused with Attention the Forest Court Books since that Act was passed; and though the salutary Provisions which it contains have unfortunately not been regularly attended to, yet there is no Part of them which has not, at some Times, been carried into Effect § and there are many Examples

in the Proceedings of those Courts, of the Trial and Punishment, under that Law, of Transgressions or Offences of every Kind since committed, to the Injury of the Forest j so that no Person whatever can pretend along uninterrupted Enjoyment of any Right forbidden by that Act of Parliament.

The Right to Fuel Wood is limited and ascertained by a Decree of the Court of Exchequer, dated 19th June, a6th Elizabeth, by which it was ordered, “ That no Inhabitant of any House newly built, “ since the Beginning of the Queen’s Reign, Should be allowed any Wood in the said Forest, to be spent in any such new built House.” This hath ever since been held to be the Rule of judging whether the Inhabitant of any House claiming Fuel Wood is entitled to it or not; and the Claims for Fuel Wood, with every other Claim on the Forest, are to be found in the Records of thri Proceedings of the last Justice Seat for this Forest, begun at and adjourned from thence to the 29th of

September 1670, before the Earl of Oxford, Lord Chief Justice in Eyre; in which Claims arc also set forth the small Rents payable to the Crown by the Claimants for Pasture and Fuel, together with the Rates payable Annually for the Pannage of Swine.

Bcfides these there were formerly Agiftors for this Forest, whose Duty was to receive the Agistment or Profit arising from the Herbage and Pannage, for the King’s Use; but the Herbage and Pannage being granted to the Lord Warden, those Profits are collected by the Lord Warden’s Steward, and the Appointment of Agiftors has been discontinued for near a Century past.

There were likewise a Verminer and Sub-Verminer; but those Appointments also ceased about the same Time.

The Lord Warden is appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal, during His Majesty’s Pleasure. This Officer has a general Superintendance and Command over the Forest in all Matters relative to Vert and Venison; and appoints the Bowbearer, Rangers* Steward, and all the Master Keepers and Groom Keepers, to continue during his Pleasure; except in the Bailiwick of Burley, which is granted by Patent for a Term of Years. There are granted to the Lord Warden by his Patent the Manor of Lyndhurjt and Hundred of Redbridge (or New Forest Hundred) and the Office of Keeper of the Decoy Pond, with the Herbage and Pannage, the Turf, Fern, and Heath, and the Rents of the Free Tenants and Suitors of the Forest, reserving to the Crown Three small Rents, amounting to £. 6 per Annum; and the Lord Warden

has the Possession of the King’s House at,

with an Allowance of £.70 per Annum for keeping the House and Stables in Repair; but that Allowance has for many Years past been paid as a Salary to a Person appointed by the Lord Warden, as House Keeper of the King’s House, and called the Lord Warden’s Steward; and the Repairs are done at the Charge of the Crown.

In Two of the Bailiwicks, namely, Godfhill and Linwood, the Forest Rents have for many Years past

been let or farmed out to the Under Keepers of those Bailiwicks, paying a certain Sum Annually to the Use of the Lord Warden, and keeping the Residue for their own Use; and ill all the Bailiwicks that Part of the Rents which confiftS of Corn, or other Payments in Kind, is allowed to the Under Keepers for their own Benefit. From the NegleCl of those who have formerly held these Offices, in not keeping, or delivering to their Successors, proper Accounts of these Rents and Payments, we have not yet been able to obtain a satisfactory Account of this Part of the Forest Col-leftions; but wherever we have obtained any Knowledge of the Payments formerly made, we find them now much diminished. The Quit Rents of Lyndburst Manor, and a Part of the Forest Rents, are collected by the Lord Warden’s Steward; and the Remainder, which are payable in small Districts 'called Tythings, are collected by the Tything-men, and paid over to him* The Amount of the Rental is Ninety-six Pounds and Two Shillings per Annum, but some few of the Rents are in Arrear. The Sum accounted for to the Lord Warden’s Use is Eighty-six Pounds Seven Shillings and Five Pence per Annum, and the Steward is allowed to keep what he collects above that Sum. The same Person receives the Pannage Money for Swine turned into the Forest in Pannage Time, and takes Charge of Cattle and Swine unchallenged (or unclaimed) on driving the Forest, which, if not owned within a Year, become the Property of the Lord Warden; but the present Steward states that no Instance of that Sort has happened since his Appointment.

The Courts of the Manor and Hundred are held by Mr. Mansfield, the Under Steward of the Forest; and the Profits arising to the Lord Warden from the Whole are as follows:

The Profits of the Pannage, which have amounted, on an Average of the last Four Years, to Thirteen Pounds Twelve Shillings and One Penny per Annum, are allowed to be kept^ by the House Steward for his own Use; besides which he has the Salary or Allowance of Seventy Pounds per Annum before-mentioned, and the Use of some Lands belonging to the King’s House, and to Ironjhill Lodge, worth about Twenty-five Pounds per Annum; he is also One of the Re-garders of the Forest, and receives Fees in that Capacity to the Amount of about Sixteen Pounds per Annum.

The Riding Forester is likewise appointed by Letters Patent during His Majesty’s Pleasure. This Officer deferibes his Duty to be to ride before the King, when he goes into the Forest. His Salary is Five hundred Pounds per Annum, payable at the Exchequer; and he has One Fee Buck and Fee Doe Yearly from the Forest.

The Bowbearer is appointed by the Lord Warded during his Pleasure. His Duty is said to be to attend the King with a Bow and Arrows, when in the Forest. His Salary is Forty Shillings a Year, and he has likewise a Fee Buck and Doe Yearly.

The Rangers are appoinfed by the Lord Warden during his Pleasure. The Duty of that Office is to drive the Deer, which stray into the Purlieus, back again into the Forest. The Salary is Two Pounds Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence per Annum, besides Four Pounds per Annum in Lieu of a certain Quantity of Wood formerly allowed to them;, and One Fee Buck and Doe Yearly to each Ranger.

The Woodward is appointed by Letters Patent during His Majesty’s Pleasure. The Salary allowed by the Patent is One hundred and Fifty Pounds per Annum for hirrrfelf, and Fifty Pounds for his Deputy j which Salaries are mentioned to be in Lieu of all Fees and Allowances whatsoever: But since the Year 1769,

Deputy Woodward. This Office is wholly executed by the Deputy Woodward, and the only Duty performed is to attend on the aligning of Wood for Fuel, to direct the digging of the Moor Wood (or Roots of Trees) and to dispose of it, and take Charge Windfall Trees, and other Trees or Wood casually thrown down in the Forest. Such of those Trees as are fit for the Navy are delivered to the Purveyor, to be sent to the Dock Yard, and Navy Bills for the Value of them are issued to the High Woodward; the rest are valued by the Regarders, and sold by the Deputy Woodward, who accounts for the Produce to the High Woodward, and he is accountable for the Whole to the Crown.

Verderor*. The Verderors, who are the Judges of the Swani-

Steward and Under The Steward and Under Steward are appointed by Steward. the Lord Warden, during Pleasure. The Under

»nd\P£endl*’ *, J Steward deferibes it to be his Duty to attend at and enroll all the Proceedings of the Courts of Attachment and Swanimote, all Appointments of Officers by the Lord Warden, all Licences to sport in the Forest, and such Treasury Warrants for cutting Timber as are transmitted by the Deputy Surveyor for that Purpose; he likeWife holds the Court Leet for the Hundred of Redbridge (or New Forest Hundred) and Courts Baron for the Manor of Lyndhurst. The High Steward has no Salary or Perquisites, except an old Annual Fee of Five Guineas paid by the Lord Warden. The Under Steward has not any Salary; his Fees are stated by him to arise from the Business of the Courts, and the Entry of Appointments and Warrants, which he cal-« culates to amount on an Average to about Eighty Pounds per Annum.They are wholly paid by Individuals, except an antient Allowance of One Pound Five Shillings, for attending each Attachment Court, which is charged to the Account of the Lord Warden. The High Steward has Two Fee Bucks, and the Deputy Steward One, Annually from the Forest. KegarJ«r*. The Regarders are chosen, as the Verderors are, by the Freeholders of the County. The Business of the Regarders, as now executed, is to attend at the marking of all Trees to be felled for any Purpose whatever; to value the Tops of Navy Timber, and any other Timber or Wood to be sold in the Forest; and attend both at the Sales of Wood, Timber, and Bark, and at the Delivery thereof to the Purchasers, as well'as of the Naval Timber to the Officers of the Dock Yard. s»rFx-imination of Formerly the Regarders used to inspect all Works Mr. Cotrman. done in the Forest, the making and planting of In-' '5* closures, the Estimates for Buildings or Repairs, and the Execution of those Works, and to examine and attest the Accounts thereof; but of late Years this very useful Part of their Duty has been laid aside.

The Regarders have no Salary'or other Emoluments, except a Fee of Two Shillings and Six Pence a Day, paid to them when actually attending any Business relating to the Forest. Some of them live at a considerable Distance, and very rarely attend: Those who are most frequent in their Attendance, are Three or Four who reside at Lyndhurst and the neighbouring Villages, together with the Deputy Surveyor, Deputy Woodward, Purveyor of the Navy, and Lord Warden’s Steward, all of whom have been chosen Regarders, and receive Fees as such, when attending the Business of their other Offices, though the Duties of those Offices are incompatible with that of Regarder, which was instituted as a Check upon the other Officers in the Forest. The Fees of the Regarders are paid by the Deputy Surveyor, Deputy Woodward, and Lord Warden’s Steward, each for Attendance on the Business in his own Department; and it appears by the Examinations of those Officers, that the Deputy Append!*, 7, Woodward does not usually attend on the marking of *’ *nd *5‘ Timber to be felled in the Surveyor’s or Lord Warden’s Departments, nor the Deputy Surveyor on the assigning of Fuel Wood or Repair Timber in the Department of the Woodward, or of Navy Timber in that of the Lord Warden, unless they happen to be in the Forest on other Business; but that they nevertheless pay each other the Fees of Regarder, and receive the like from the Lord Warden’s Steward, in the same Manner as if they constantly attended. If it happens that Business is transacted in the Forest for the Lord Warden, the Surveyor General, and the Woodward, on the same Day, the Regarders present are paid^ separately by each, so that they receive Three Fees for such Day’s Attendance. The Amount of the Re-garder’s Fees paid to the Purveyor, is about Nineteen £. t>. — . — Pounds per Annum, and to the Three other Officers , abovenamed about Sixteen Pounds per Annum each: — —

To all the other Regarders the Fees are consideribly less, varying in Proportion to their Attendance; and out of what they receive they defray the Expences incurred for themselves and their Horses, so that very little remains to them for their own Time and Trouble.

The Duty of the Master Keepers and Groom Matter Keeper* and Keepers is to preserve the Vert and Venison in their GrogmKeePet»* respective Bailiwicks and Walks; to present, at the Forest Courts, the Destruction or Diminution of either, by Warrant or otherwise, and all Depredations or Incroachments on the Forest; and ufc their utmost Endeavours to prevent them: To admit no Cattle during the Fence Month and Winter Haining, or Swine, except in Pannage Time, and then only such as belong to those who have Right of Common:

To admit no uncommonable Cattle at any Time, or Horses deemed unservicenble, or under the Size mentioned in the Act of 33d IlenryVIII. for encouraging the Breed of Horses: To allow no Turf or Fern to be cut, but in Places to be appointed by themselves; nor any Coal Hearths for making Charcoal, except in the Waste Ground, in Places to be appointed by the Verderors and Regarders, nor within a Thousand Paces of any Inclosure for the Growth of Timber.

In all the Bailiwicks, except that of Burley, the Master Allappointedbythc Keepers and Groom Keepers are appointed by the Lord Warden, except Lord Warden, during Pleasure. The Master Keepers ,n AppeLix^N^to, of those Bailiwicks have no Salary, nor any Perqui- 16,17,18,19.

cers. made up of lundry Allowances, given to them at

different Periods, and originally payable out of different Funds. By a Decree of the Court of Ex-Appendix, N° 6. chequer, dated 19th , 26th Elizabeth (made on the Hearing of divers Suits brought by the General Surveyor of the Queen’s Woods against sundry Keepers, Rangers, and Foresters, for Spoils committed in this Forest) it appears that the only Salary allowed to the Keepers before that Time, was One Pound Six ' Shillings and Eight Pence per Annum for each Bailiwick, which was paid by the Lord Warden; the rest of their Emoluments then arose from Windfall and “ Rootfall ” Trees, and other Perquisites, arising chiefly from Wood. By the same Decree it was ordered, that they Should have a further Salary or Allowance of One Pound Six Shillings and Eight Pence per Annum for each Bailiwick, to be paid by the Woodward out of the Produce of Wood Sales j and this Part of their Allowances is still distinguished by the Name of the Lord Warden’s Nobles, and the Woodward’s Nobles. But the Windfalls and other Per-

quifites then taken by the Keepers, being attended with very destructive Effects on the Forest, Orders were afterwards given for abolishing them entirely} and the Keepers were allowed additional Wages in lieu of them, which were paid by the Woodward out of the Produce of Wood Sales.

The Salaries of the Rangers and Bowbearer were also paid by the Lord Warden j and it appears by some Memorandums subjoined to a Rental of the Forest Rents in 1747, received by us from Mr.

Thomas Bullock, who was Lord Warden’s Steward under the late Duke of Bedford, that the several other Charges undermentioned were then likewise defrayed by the Lord Warden out of the Forest Rents *.

The Salary of the Woodward, the Allowance to the Lord Warden’s Steward, and the Remainder of the Salaries or Allowances of the Under Keepers, were paid out of Wood Sales made under the Direction of the Woodward.

According to a Statement contained in a Letter Regulation! fug. from the Duke of Bedford to the Lords of the Trea- l^ford^' fury, dated 29th September 1768, the Annual Charges Warden!

so defrayed were then as follows:

But though these were the ostensible Charges, the Loss to the Forest, in Consequence of Perquisites, Lop, Topi, and Waste, was stated to be Double or Treble that Sum, without reckoning the Sums raised 'for repairing the Lodges of the Under Keepers, or the Fuel Wood with which they were supplied. All this the Duke represented to be such a Charge on the Forest, as in its declining State it was impossible it The Duke'i Propo- could long support; and, as an effectual Remedy, wving the officers,by he proposed, that instead of issuing an Annual War-a Fail of Timber for rant to the Woodward, to raise the Money, by cut-the Navy 5

ting and felling Wood or Timber in the wasteful Mode then practised, the Money should be raised by a Fall of Timber, to be made Yearly, for the Use of the Navy, in Addition to the usual Annual Fall under the Direction of the Surveyor General; and that the Ordering of that Fall, the Receipt of the Monies from the Navy Board, and the Payment of the Forest Officers, should from thenceforth be under the Direction of the Lord Warden. The Money so raised, the Duke proposed should be applied as follows:

This Proposal having been agreed to by the Treasury, Warrants were issued, dated 25th April 1769, to the Lord Warden and to the Commissioners of the Navy, to fell Annually, for Twenty Years, Three hundred and Seventy Loads of Oak, and fifty Beech Trees, in Addition to the usual Annual Fall, and which it was calculated would produce about Nine hundred Pounds. The Sums before mentioned were to be paid out of that Fund, and the Residue, if any, to go into the Exchequer, and to be Annually accounted for before the Auditor. The Business has accordingly ever since been carried on in that Manner. The Timber is marked for felling by the Purveyor, with the Lord Warden’s Steward, in the Presence of the Regarders j and on the Delivery of the Timber to the Officers of the Dock Yard, Navy Bills are issued for it, in the Name of the Lord Warden and the Tops, Bark, and Offal Wood, with any Trees that may be rejected as unfit for Naval Use, are sold by the Steward. During the first Two Years the Business was transacted by the Agents of the Duke of Bedford; but since his Death it has been executed by Nathaniel Heywood, Esquire, Matter Keeper of Battramfley Bailiwick, whom the present Lord Warden appointed his Deputy in the Year 1771, with the Aflittance of the Lord Warden’s Steward, but no Account of the Receipt and Expenditure of the Monies arising therefrom has yet been rendered to the Auditor.

We have inferred in the Appendix an Extract of the Duke of Bedford's Letter, upon which that Arrangement was founded, because it contains the best Explanation, both of his Reasons for proposing this Change, and of the good Effects which he expected from it: But the Result of this well-intended Measure, like that of every other Plan for improving the Forest under its present ill-arranged System of Management, has been very-different from what was looked for, and though the Watte and Abuses in the Sales formerly made by the Woodward have been avoided, yet new Charges have been brought on the Forest, to no inconsiderable Amounton perusing the Accounts of the Lord Warden’s Deputy, which we thought it necessary to call for, and of which an Ab-stradt is inserted in the Appendix, it appears that the Annual Charges stated by him in the Period of Sixteen Years, from Lady Day 1771 to Lady Day, 1787, amount, One Year with another, to One thousand One hundred and Sixty-five Pounds Eighteen Shillings and Four Pence per Annum, instead of Eight hundred and Thirty-three Pounds, as computed by the Duke of Bedford; and those Salaries and Expences which were formerly defrayed out of the Forest Rents, are become an additional Burthen on the Forest.

From the Time that this new Arrangement took place the Woodward became accountable only for such Monies as might arise from Moor Wood, Windfall Trees, or other casual Timber or Wood. Sir Paulet St. Johnwho was then Woodward, passed his Accounts to the Year 1771, inclusive, being Two Years after the new Plan commenced: He continued in that Office until the Year 1780, and on his Death the present Woodward, Mr. Stanley George was appointed his Successor. But no Account having been rendered by any Woodward of this Forest, since the Year 1771, we thought it necessary to call on the present Woodward for an Account of the Monies received by him since he has held that Office; and he has accordingly delivered an Account to us, of which an Abstratft is likewise given in the Appendix. The Act by which we are appointed having directed that all Persons who by virtue of their Offices have received Monies by Sale of any of His Majesty’s Woods or Timber, since His Majesty’s Accession, and whose Accounts Should not be passed before the

1 ft of Aug:Jl 1787, Should deliver such Accounts to us, in order to the closing, adjusting, and liquidating the same by or before the Auditor of the Land Revenue, we have transmitted the Accounts both of the Deputy Warden and Woodward to the Auditor, in order to their being finally examined and adjusted, and have written to the Representatives of the late Lord Warden and Woodward, to deliver a State oif their unsettled Accounts.

Besides the Officers above mentioned, who are properly called Forest Officers, there are Two others principally concerned in what relates to the Timber and Wood; these are the Purveyor of the NaVy acting for this Forest, and the Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests.

The Act of 9th and 10th William III. having directed that no Wood or Timber Should be cut or felled in the New Forest, without having been first viewed, and allowed to be felled, by a Commissioner or Officer of His Majesty’s Navy, that Business is executed by the Purveyor of Portsmouth Dock Yard for the Time being, whose Duty is to prevent any Timber fit, or likely to become fit, for Naval Use, from being cut for any other Purpose. The Purveyor is paid by the Navy Board as an Officer of the Dock Yard, and has no Salary or Emoluments from the Forest as Purveyor, except an Allowance of Eight Loads of Fuel Wood Yearly, worth about Four Pounds. But the present Purveyor having been chosen One of the Regarders of the Forest, as we have before observed, he receives the Regarder’s Fees of Two Shillings and Six Pence per Day, when attending the Business of the Forest as Purveyor, the Average Amount of which Fees he states to be about Nineteen Pounds per Annum.

The Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests appoints a Deputy under him in this Forest, whose Office is to execute all Warrants for felling Timber for the Navy, or for railing Money by Sale of Wood or Timber, erecting or repairing Lodges or other Buildings, repairing Bridges or Inclosures, or executing any other Works in the Forest. The Timber felled for the Navy is delivered into the Custody of the Purveyor, and Navy Bills are issued to the Surveyor General for such as is felled under his Charge. The Tops and Bark of that Timber, and any Trees that may be rejected as unfit for Naval Use, as also all Wood and Timber cut in the Forest for Sale, are valued by the Regarders, and publicly sold by thet Deputy Surveyor, and accounted for to the Surveyor General.

The Perquisites and Emoluments of the Surveyor General, arising from this Forest, are nearly the same as were stated in our Third Report to be derived from the Forest of Dean,being

10 s. per Day (Sundays excepted) for Attendance and travelling Expences, during the Execution of any Work in the Forest.

An Allowance for Two nominal Deputies, at per Day each (Sundays excepted) which is considered as a Perquisite or Addition to the Salary of the Surveyor General.

5 per Cent, or One Shilling in the Pound, charged by the Surveyor General on all Monies received by him: — Which several Payments are stated and allowed in his Accounts, on passing the same before the Auditor.

Besides which, the Surveyor General receives as Perquisites, by the Hands of his Deputy,

5 per Cent, on the Amount of all Estimates for Buildings, Repairs, or other Works, done in the Forest, the Estimates being professedly so calculated as to admit of that Deduction.

5 per Cent, on the Amount of the Sales of Timber,

Wood, and Bark, in the Forest, which is deduced from the Produce of such Sales.

And is. per Tree, as Chip Money, for all Naval Trees, which is paid by the Purchasers of the Lops and Tops of such Trees, to whom an Allowance is made for it in the Price of the Wood.

Deputy Surveyor’s And the Surveyor General’s Deputy in this Forest Perquisitei. has a Salary of Fifty Pounds per Annum paid by the

Treasury, and takes, as Perquisites for himself, the old Polls, Pales, or Rails, left on repairing any Fences belonging to the Forest; Five Shillings a Year from each of the Regxrders, on paying them for their Attendance on any Business in his Department; and One Shilling per Lot for every Lot of Timber, Wood, and Bark fold in the Forest, which is paid by the Purchasers of such Lots. The Amount of which Perquisites the Deputy fays, in his Examination, he is unable to (late, not having kept an Account thereof. The Deputy Sur- The present Deputy Surveyor, as we have before garder?.ne°ftheRe' observed, is also One of the Regarders, and receives Fees in that Capacity to the Amount of about Sixteen

Pounds a Year.

But an Emolument of more uncertain Amount

arises from the Execution of Repairs and other Works in the Forest, which is thus described by himself, in his Executes the Re- Examination inferred in the Appendix: “ When any pair*, ice.in the Fo- tt Lodges or Buildings in the Forest are to be re-lt built or repaired, after the Matter has been referred “ to the Surveyor General, this Examinant, by his *' Order, has usually employed a Workman to make “ an Estimate of the Expence, and returned it to the Surveyor General, who reported the same to the “ Treasury; and after Warrants have been issued for performing the ' Works, according to such Estimates, this Examinant has usually undertaken the 'Execution of the Business on the Terms of the ct Estimates, and employed Workmen to perform the *. same accordingly, accounting to the Surveyor General for his Poundage of Five per Cent, on the Amount of such Estimates. It has noHjeen usual, «« since he has held the Office, for the previous Efti-ct mates to be made or delivered upon Oath, nor for “ any of the Regarders, or any other Person, to be w employed to oversee, inspect, or examine the Exe-c< cution of the Works, or the Accounts of the Expences thereof; or for the Estimates or Accounts of such Works to bepresented or examined at the Fo-’* rest Courts. When Timber is wanted for performing such Works or Repairs, the Quantity, which is “ usually specified in the Warrant, is set out by the <( Purveyor of the Navy, in the Presence of the usual Number of Regarders. The Quantity is not delivered by Measure, but by Estimation; and if any *f Surplus remains, above what is actually used, this Examinant takes it for his own Use, as Part of the “ Allowance of the Estimate.”

Charge of repair- The Amount of the Sums expended in re-building ge*’&c,finec an<^ rePaifing Lodges, Bridges, and Pounds, and re-

laid out a very heavy Charge to be incurred so footl afterwards on the same Account. We therefore thought it necessary, before giving any Opinion on the Estimate referred to us, to have the Buildings viewed By a competent and experienced Surveyor; and the

Person whom we employed reported to us, that the 1

Appendix, N®»«. pairing old and making new Inclosures, since His present Majesty’s Accession, is £. 13,394. 19J. *'£*9*31* — that Sum no less than £.9,431* is for Lodges only,

besides 503 Loads of Timber allowed from the Forest. In what Manner the Estimates for these Expenditures were formed, or the Works executed, may be judged of from an Instance which came under our Appendix, N® *7. immediate Observation in the Year 1787; an Appli-Seeeifo Appendix, cation being then made to the Lords of the Treasury, *,19, jo. to orcjer some Repairs to be done at the M after Estimate for Re- Keeper’s Lodge, in Iron's , and an Estimate

As we found that the Sum of £. 1,788. 13*. 3</. had been granted for Work done at that Lodge in the Year 1769 and 1777, we could not avoid thinking the further Sum proposed to be Vol. XLIV.

whole Work might be done for £.541, being £.390 °’

less than the former Estimate; ana upon our Report to the Treasury the Works were ordered and executed for that Sum.

In our Report on the Forest of we were so Observation«on i

full in our Remarks on the evil Tendency of the pre*- Present »‘I

sent Mode of paying the efficient Officers; that it be- "*'nt comes unnecessary to say much on the same Subject in our Report on this Forest, in which the same Practices prevail. The only Object of great Consequence to the Public, in any of the Forests, is the increase and Preservation of the Timber. How far that Object is regarded in the present Management of this Forest, will appear on a flight Attention to the Nature of the Offices, and to the Manner in which they are now executed. The Matter Keepers considering their Appointments rather as Marks of Distinction, than as Offices of Business or Responsibility; the Surveyor giving his Attention chiefly to the Execution of Warrants from the' Treasury for raising and laying out Money, and having no Power over the Under Keepers; the Woodward confining himself to the inferior ObjeCls of Fuel Wood, Repair Timber, Windfall Trees, and Moor Wood; the Regarders being only called in occasionally, for particular Purposes, and several of them holding other Offices, incompatible with that of Regarder; and the Business of the Purveyor being chiefly to prevent Trees fit for the Navy from being applied to any other Use, it is obvious that the Protection of the Inclosures, and the Pre- Care of you fervation of the young Wood and Timber, must depend chiefly, if not altogether, on the Conduce of the the Under Keepen Under Keepers,

In this Situation the greatest Care should have been taken to allow no Perquisite to those Men that could make it for their Interest to do any Thing that might be prejudicial to the Forest, or lead them to counteract the great public Object of increasing and preserving the Wood and Timber: But if a Keeper should perform his Duty in every Particular necessary for promoting that Object, he would lose the greatest Present F.mo Part of his present Emoluments, which depend on the increase and Encouragement of what is destructive to Wood and Timbe the Wood and Timber; for it appears by the Statement before given that they are chiefly derived from Fees for Deer, Profits by Sale of Browse Wood, and by the Breed of Rabbits and Swine; and the Perqui- Surveyor Gen' sites of the Surveyor General and Woodward, and and Woodward, their Deputies, also hold out strong Inducements to promote the profuse felling of the Timber, but none for its increase and Preservation.

This Mode of paying those who have the Care of Eff«a* of pre this valuable Forest, is certainly such as no Man £^"^senient of would adopt in the Management of his own Property, and the Effects of it upon the Forest, which we thought it necessary ourselves to view, are,

ift. That the Forest is so much overstocked with The Forest o Deer, that many die Yearly of Want in the Winter; ft°s^eE«n!in?teio and not less than 300 died in One Walk only in the James Mamet, Winter of 1787. Appendix, N» „

have been converted into Warrens by the Under Keepers, infomoch that in Two of them, containing about 611 Acres, there is not One young Tree; and in the Third, containing 214 Acres, only a very small Number.

4thly. That some of the Keepers deal largely in Swine, which are suffered to remain in the Forest a* all Seasons. The Keeper of Walk only had

a Stock of between 70 and 80 Swine at the Time of his Examination in November last.

5thly, That the Fences of the Inclosures made for Nurseries of Timber are neglected; and for Want of repairing flight Defeats when they happen, often require large and expensive Repairs; but are, in general, in such bad Condition, as to keep out neither Deer, Horses, Cattle, or Swine.

6thly. That the Lodges are repaired often, and at great Charge, but never substantial, or in a Workman-like Manner.

7thly. That the salutary Provisions of the Act of 9th and 10th William III. are almost wholly difre-garded in many other Respects.

Swine and Cattle of all Kinds, commonable or not commonable, are suffered to go in the Forest at all Times, without Regard to the Fence Month and Winter Haining, and without any Restriction as to Number, or Proof that they belong to those who have Right of Common.

The Charcoal Hearths are all allowed to be within the Woods, because that is more convenient to the Makers, though attended with the Danger of burning the Woods, and affording Opportunities of dealing young Trees or Branches with less Probability of Detection.

Fern, Heath, and Furze are cut in every Part of the Forest, without having the Places assigned as the Law requires, though attended with the certain Effect of destroying whatever young Shoots are coming up among them; and those who make a Trade of cutting Turf and Peat for Sale are become so daring, as to threaten the burning of the Forest if they are interrupted; and wilful Fires have sometimes been kindled, by which, in Two late instances, great Part of the Fences and young Trees, in Two of the Inclosures in Castle Malwocd and Denny Walks, were consumed.

The felling, and otherwise disposing of Wood afflgn-ed for Fuel is now likewise openly and generally practised, and great Part of it converted into Rails, Truck Wheels, and other Articles for Sale; and being left to be cut down at the Convenience of the Claimants or Purchasers, without any Check or Controul, more Trees are frequently cut than have been assigned.

Numerous Incroachments are also made, and Cottages erected in the Forest, and great Depredations committed on the Timber and Wood, by the Inhabitants of those Cottages, and other disorderly Persons; and no effectual Means used for the Prevention or Remedy of such Abuses.

From the long Lift which we have given of Officers in this Forest, and the known Severity of the Forest Laws, which are there continued in Force, by the Act of 9th and 10th William III. it may at first Sight appear extraordinary, that the infefior Officers are not better kept to their Duty, and that those Offences which arc so numerous and so general in this Forest meet now wien little Check; but the Forest Courts, which have been gradually falling into Disuse for many Years, have been Hill less frequently held, and their Powers less exerted, since the passing of the Act of the 6th of His present Majesty, by which a speedicr and more effectual Punishment is provided for Offences relative to Woods and Timber than those Courts were invested with; but it unfortunately happens that the Fixpence of proi'ecuting under that Act is such as to discourage the Under Keepers from fulfilling this

Part of their Duty, and prevent the salutary Effects which might be expected from that Law, the Charge of bringing an Offender before a Justice of the Peace being from £. 1. is. to £ 11s. besides the Time and Trouble of the Keeper, for which he has no Return whatever, except on Conviction of the Offender, and then only, by Law, a Moiety of the Fine which the Magistrate may impose: And though the Lord Warden has, for the Encouragement of the Keepers, ordered that the Whole of such Fines shall be paid to the Informers, yet even that is not sufficiene to induce them to risk so considerable and certain an Expence, except in particular Cafes, where the Nature of the Offence gives Reason ro expect a large Fine to be imposed, and where the Conviction appears certain, from the Proof being supported by a greater Number of Witnesses than in so extensive a Waite are often to be found.

Another great Cause of the Unfitness of the Forest Officers to prevent the Abuses which we have enumerated, will be found on a Review of the strange Constitution of the general Government of the Forests, in which, as Manwood observes, there is Divifum perium," the Deer and other Beasts of Chace, the

Vert or Green Hue, and every Thing that relates to the Pleasure of the King in the Forests, being under the Authority of the Justices in Eyre, Lord Warden, and those properly called Forest Officers; and the Timber, with every Thing that relates to the Profit of the King, being under the Direction of the Exchequer; and each of these independent of the other: And the Keepers being within that Department which has the Care of whac relates to the Pleasure of the King, the Surveyor General, who is the Officer of the Exchequer, has no Power or Controul over those Keepers, to whose Care the Forest is left.

Having stated what we judged to be necessary, in order to shew the wasteful Tendency of the System of Government under which this and indeed all the Royal Forests arc placed, we think it in Justice due to the Officers in New Forest, and to the neighbouring Inhabitants, to say, that we do not find the Abuses prevailing the re carried farther, or even so far, as from such unwise Regulations and such Relaxation or Neg-le£l on the Part of Government, might naturally have been expefled; and we have had the Satisfaction to find among the Officers some whose ConduCl merits Approbation; the present Purveyor of the Navy, in particular, has corrected many Abuses which were very destructive to the Forest: Before his Appointment, in the Year 1782, it was not unusual to fell for the Use of the Navy the most thriving Oak Trees, leaving such as were past growing, to decay, or to be cut for Fuel; and former Purveyors were in the Habit of allowing such Oaks to be assigned for Fuel: But Mr.

Nichols, seeing the bad Effects of this Practice, has allowed no Oak to be assigned for Fuel, and has per-fifted in fending to the Dock Yards the oldest Trees, refusing to suffer any other to be felled till the Forest shall be cleared of such as are past growing; and though the Quantity of Timber is far inferior to what it has been, this Forest still remains of great Value to the Public, and well deserves that Attention should be paid to its future Protection and Improvement.

Among the Books and Papers which we have had Occasion to examine in the Course of our Enquiry concerning this Forest, we have been so fortunate as to meet with Four different Surveys of the Timber taken at Periods distant from each other, by Men of such Character and Situation as to admit of no Suspicion of Unfairness or Misrepresentation, the First in 1608, the Second in 1707, the Third in 1764, and the last in 1783; and these different Surveys not only serve to shew the Number of Timber Trees fit for felling that were growing in the Forest at the Times when they were taken, but afford the strongest Proof of the Justice of the

the Account given in our Third Report, of theoppo-site Effects of the Attention formerly bellowed on the Management of the Royal Forests, and of the Neglect and Relaxation which took Place at subsequent Periods.

In a Collection of Papers left by Sir Julius Chancellor of the Exchequer to James I. some Years since purchasedf'by the late Surveyor General, Mr. Jibn Pitt, and lent to us by his Son, Mr. Morton Pitt, we found the first-mentioned Survey of the Timber in Now Forest,taken in the Year , 1608, at which Time

there were growing in- the Forest ho less than 123,927 Timber Trees fit for felling, and such a Number of dotard and decayed Trees as contained 118,000 Loads of Timber.

The next Survey was taken in 1707, by Two of the Commissioners and the Surveyor of the Navy, and Mr. Edward Wilcox, then Surveyor General of the Woods, with the Assistance of the Forest Officers, under a Warrant from the Lord Treasurer dire fling them to report not only bow many T rees fit for the Navy then grew in the Forest, but what Quantity of Timber might be spared from thence yearly to the Dock Yards, with a due Regard to the Preserva-tien of the Forest; -and at that Time there were found growing in it only 12,476 Oak Trees, which those Officers reported might prove fit for her Majesty’s Service, “ all of which might: be felled within the Compass of 40 Years, by 300 each Year, without Prejudice to the Forest, there- being so many young Trees, not of sufficient Bigness to be useful to the Navy, which would be well grown up by the End of the Time proposed for felling the others, that the Forest would be then at lead as well stored with useful Timber as it was at the Time of this Survey. They reported also, that thiere was a considerable Number or large Beech Trees, of which !ioo might be Annually spared, and a great Number of old Oaks, from the Limbs of which might be picked very useful Parts, as Knees, Standards, &c. though the Bodies might be decayed; and they proposed, that 50 of these should be every Year cut down for Naval Use;” and we find that in consequence of this Report a Warrant was issued in 1707, directing that 300 Oak Timber Tree;, and 50 old Oaks, with 100 Beech Trees, Should be felled Annually for 40 Years from that Time.

The Third Survey was taken in 1764, by Order of ®y the :r*

the Treasury, when Sir Edmund Thomas was Surveyor *7*'

General; and the Number of Oak Trees fit for the pp*n ,x,‘ Navy was then found to be 19,836, containing 36,662 Loads, the Trees meting at (or containing on an Average) 92 Feet each, and 1743 dotard or defective Oaks, estimated at 3,835 Loads.

The last Survey was that taken in 1783, under the B the Survey in Direction of Mr. John Pitt, the late Surveyor General, ,7*1-by Order of the House of Commons; when it ap* ppen ,x’ 3+*

peared that there were in the Forest 13,043 Oak Trees of 50 Feet and upwards, containing in- the Whole 20,830 Loads, the Average Meting- of the Trees of that Description being 79 Feet each.

The Surveys in 1608 and 1707 give only the Num- Comparative Sute-ber of the Timber Trees, without stating the Quantity “'"toftheFourSur-contained in them; but as the Commission and Instructions for making the first-mentioned Survey directed that none but great Trees should be included in it, and an Observation subjoined to the Survey itself states that the Trees were old, and had flood too long, we think ourfelveS well warranted in supposing them to be, one with another, at lead as large as the Class of Trees of One Load and upwards, in the Survey of 1783, or about 79 Feet each on an Average*

In the Survey of 1707, which comprised not only the Trees then fit for felling, but also such as might be cut in the Course of the next 40 Years, it is probable that many were included of less Size than in that Class of the Survey of 1783: We shall however compute them at that Average Size in giving the following comparative Statement of the Four Surveys, in order to avdid any Appearance of drawing a more favourable Picture of the Forest at the Period of the oldest Survey, than we are authorized to do*

We have deemed it of more Consequence to insert many Objections, on Account of their Severity, and in this Report an Account of the Survey of 1608, Difficulties in the Management, no Doubt, arose from because it (hews, not from Plans of projected Im- the Division of Power between the Exchequer and the provement (to which, however solid, little Faith is Justice in Eyre, yet there were Circumstances in which given) but from Documents well authenticated, of the System then prevailing was far better calculated what great Value this Forest once was, when proper for the Protection of the Forests than that which has Care was taken of it, and to what Value it might succeeded it; for at that Time every Offence com-again be raised by similar Attention to its Manage- mitted in a Forest, every Injury done to the Timber or ment and Protection. other Property of the Crown, was presented at and

less, the Inducements to Depredation were consequently not io strong as at subsequent Periods, when Timber became more valuable.

Having given lb convincing a Proof of the Effect of the Attention bellowed on the Forests at the Time we have mentioned, we shall only briefly add, that the same Care appears to have been continued, until' the Cornells began between Charles the III. and his Parliament; during the Continuance of which, the Trees in almoll every one of the Royal Forests were, by the one Party or the other, disposed of or de-. stroyed.

Soon after the Restoration, the Attention of Government was again drawn to the Forests, by the Writings of Mr. Evelyn, published in 1664, and the zealous

Suggestions of Sir Charles H Surveyor General of the Crown Lands, under whose prudent Management, and that of his Son, Mr. , the

landed Property of the Crown was placed during the greatest Part of the Remainder of that Century. Various Reports of theirs, and Commissions to enquire into the State and Condition of this Forest, which are . preserved in the public Offices, evince the Attention then bellowed on it; but though, by Means of that Attention, the Abuses in the Forest received some Check, yet as the greatest Part of the Trees had been felled, the Fences of the ancient Coppices destroyed, and the Deer and Cattle every where admitted, it was found impossible to restore the Forest to its former Condition without the Aid of Parliament.

The Act of 9th and 10th William III. was accordingly obtained, and- if the Powers vested in the Crown for the Improvement of the Forest had been duly exercised, if the full Quantity of 6,000 Acres had been inclosed, and the inclosures successively thrown open when the Trees were at Twenty Years Growth, or pad Danger from Cattle, it is obvious, that as the Act passed Ninety Years ago, Four Times that Quantity would before this Time have been inclosed, and 24,060 Acres of Land, formerly bare, might now have been covered with Trees of all Ages, from Ninety Years downwards, in Addition to the former Woodlands in the Forest; but unfortunately, in a very few Years after passing that Act, the Care formerly bellowed on the Forests was discontinued, the Superintendance or Co-operation of the Surveyor General of the Crown Lands in the Management of the Forests, ceased, and the Whole fell by Degrees under the lole Direction of a Surveyor General of the Woods,- a single Officer under no effectual Check or Controul, receiving no Official Books or Records of Proceedings from his Predecessors, nor obliged to leave any to those whofucceed him, so that no regular System of Management can be expected or practised; but, as we observed in our Report on Dean each new Surveyor begins without Direction or Precedent, and adopts such new Plan as suits his Fancy or Convenience.

The Account therefore of what has been really done under that Act, may be given in a very few Words: As soon as it was passed, a Commission was issued for setting out the Inclosures first appointed to, be made, and 1,022 Acres were, in the Year following, inclosed and properly planted. For some Time afterwards those Inclosures were well taken Care of by Mr. IVilcox,who was at that Time Surveyor General

of the Forests, and continued in that Office till 171 3; and Care appears likewise to have been taken by him to promote the Growth of young Timber ir> other Parts of the Forest, by excluding the Swine, in Consequence of the very lalutary Provision in that Act, for lufpending the F.xcrcife of the Right of Pannage; and the good FjTeft of this is obvious in very-many Parts of the Forclt which were not inclosed, where Trees are now growing up in great Numbers, apparently of the same Age with those in the Grounds inclosed at that Time.

But this Attention soon ceased, and the farther Execution of the Plan of Inclosure laid down in the Act appears to have been loft Sight of altogether; so that during the Fifty Years which next succeeded, though we meet with some Enquiries into the State of the Forest, mutual Accusations between Surveyors General, Woodwards, and other Officers, Reports of Abuses, and very judicious Plans for preventing them, yet nothing whatever.appears to have been done for the Improvement or Protection of the Forest. The Suggestions of the Country Gentlemen-who held Offices v in the Forest, appear rather to- have been; dif-. couraged than approved of by the Ministers at the Time; the Trees in the Inclosures first made were suffered to grow up as close together as they were planted, and not one new Inclosure toa$ made or at- ' tempted till 1751, when Mr. Surveyor Ge-

neral of the Woods, in Consequence of a Memorial of his to the Treasury, was empowered to make a far-, ther Inclosure, to the Amount of 300 Acres. - -

But here began a Struggle between the Two Branches of the Forest Government, which shewed the bad E(lefts of the Divifum I before-mentioned.

The Duke of Bedford,who was then Lord Warden, and appears to have taken great Pains to check every Abuse in the Forest, having in that Year preferred a Complaint to the Treasury again!! the Deputy Surveyor and other Officers, and being informed, while that Matter was depending, of the Warrant issued by the Treasury for making the Inclosures proposed by Mr. Philipfon, wrote again to that Board, in 1752,

objecting to the entrusting the making of those Inclosures to the very Officers against whose Conduct he had complained; and by his Direction, as Lord Warden, the Steward of the Forest Courts postponed the enrolling of the Warrant in the Forest Books. For some Time the Officers were protested: The Lords of the Treasury confirmed their former Order, and the Inclosures were made. The Charges preferred by the Duke of Bedford were kowever fully proved, and the Deputy Surveyor was difmiflfcd. In 1756 Mr. Philipfon died; and' so entirely was the Cultivation of young Timber in those Inclosures afterwards neglected, that the Duke of ,in a Letter dated

29th September 1768, fays, “ that though they had “ been perfectly well and very expensively fenced off, cc for above 13 Years, there was not the lead Appearance of Timber coming up; nor could he “ fee One single Oak in the Compass of several “ Hundred Acres:” The Duke therefore proposed to plow the Ground, to take One Crop of Oats, and then to fow the Acorns; by Means of which Preparation he expected that the bed Effects might be produced. This Propolal was opposed by the next Surveyor General, who complained that the Duke was interfering in the Business of his Department. In this Instance, however, the Duke prevailed, and he was requested by the Lords of the Treasury to carry his Plan into Execution.

At the same Time the Surveyor General proposed the making a farther Inclosure of 1,000 Acres. This was objected to, in the strongest Terms, by the Duke of Bedford, who represented that such Works carried on

in the Department of the Surveyor General had always been the Source of Waste and Abuse, tending indeed to the Emolument of the Officers employed, but to the Destruction.of the Forest: Here, however, the Duke’s Opposition was ineffectual; — the Proposal of the Surveyor General was agreed to by the Treasury, and the Inclosures were made. Soon after this the Duke of Bedford died; and the Fate of the Plans which he had with so much Pains formed for the Improvement of the Forest, was very different from what he had

expected:

expected: The Ground within the Inclosures made by Mr. Pbiiipfon,which had been plowed and prepared for

planting under the Duke’s Direction, was afterwards entirely neglected; the Acorns which were provided for that Purpose were never sown; and Three Fourth Parts of those Inclosures now remain a Waste, without Timber or Wood of any Kind.

Jn the Year 1775, mother Warrant was issued by the Advice of Mr. Pitt/ late Surveyor General, for inclosing 1,000 Acres more, making in all about 3,300 Acres, and thele are all the Inclosures which have been made for the Growth of Timber in the Forest ftnee the Act of Parliament was passed.

Of those Inclosures, Three which were made in Wilverleyand RhinefieldWalks, containing 836 Acres,

are now, as we before observed, so over-run with Rabbits, that there are no young Trees whatever in Two of them, and only a very few in the Third j and the remaining Inclosures are very far from being in a proper Condition: The Account given of the State of each by our Surveyors, is inierted in the Appendix.

In examining into the Cause of the wafted Condition of the Three Inclosures above-mentioned, we discovered another very striking Example of the Effects of this divided Government of the Forests: The late Surveyor General, Mr. Pitt, finding the Rabbits very destructive, and the Breed encouraged by the Keepers, brought a Number of Men from DorJ'etshire to extirpate them, which they engaged to do for the Profit of the Rabbits only. But the Keepers, fearing the Loss of that Part of their Emoluments, gave all the Opposition they could to the Execution of the Measure, and at length formed7a Plan for defeating it: They complained to the Master Keepers that the Surveyor General was interfering in the Business of their Walks, and employing Strangers in a Work which they were willing to perform themselves, on the same Terms; and a Fawn having one Night been caught in a Trap, they accused the Rabbit Killers of that Offence, prevailed on the Master Keepers to interfere, and got the Men discharged; and after continuing the Plan of destroying the Rabbits as long as they found it profitable, they applied to the Surveyor General for a Compensation for the Advantages they Should lose if the Rabbits Should all be destroyed; and no such Compensation being given, they proceeded no farther in the Attempt to destroy them, but encouraged the Breed as before, and they are now as numerous and as destructive to the Forest as they ever were.

We have not interrupted the Account of what has been done in consequence of the Act of 9th and 10th William III. with any particular Remarks on the Surveys of 1707, 1764, and 1783; but it will be found that they tend to confirm the general Representation which we have given of the opposite Effects of the Attention, and the Neglect of those who had the Management of the Forest at different Periods. The small Number of Trees of a Size fit for the Navy in 1707, or that could be cut in 40 Years, containing not more than One Fifteenth Part of what was growing in 1608, proves the Account given of the Devaluation during the Civil Wars: The Survey in 1764, which contains Twice as much as that in 1707, lbews plainly the Effect of the Care which was taken of the Forest, at the Suggestion of Sir Charles Harbord and Mr. Evelyn, and during the Remainder of the last Century; and the Decrease in the Quantity found by the Survey in 1783 is chiefly to be attributed to the Addition to the Annual Fall proposed by the Duke of Bedford, the Practice of cutting the great Oak Trees for Fuel, and to that want of Care which took Place soon after passing the Act of William III. and which has prevailed aimofl: ever since.

We shall conclude this Part of bur Report with Vox.. XLIV.

stating briefly what has been the Income or Produce of this Forest, and the Expences of Management, since the Commencement of His Majesty’s Reign.

It appears by the Abstracts of the Accounts inserted in the Appendix, that she Quantity of Timber delivered for the Use of the Navy, frorri 1761 to 1786, both inclusive, is 23,000 Loads of Oak, and 7,003 Loads of Beech, the Average Yearly Quantity of the Oak being about 885 Loads, and of Beech about 270 Loads. The Price of that Timber, in Navy Bills issued to the Lord Warden, Surveyor General, and Woodward, together with the Produce of the Lops, TopsJ and Bark, and other Woodfales in the Forest (according to the best Account we have been able to make up from the Materials we have been furnished with) amount to the Sum of ,£.87,952. 13 s.id, or £.3,382. 15 $d. per Annum,

on an Average, during that Period, exclusive'of the ValOe of Tops, Bark, Cast Timber, and Offal Wood, fold under the Orders of the Duke of Bedford in 1769 and 1770, and by Sir Paiilet St. John from 1771 to 1780, of which we have no Account.

By the same Accounts it appears that £. 59,662.

10s.5 Id. Part of that Gross Produce, togecher with the Sum of £. 1,877. 2S-drawn from the demised Land Revenue, making together £.61,539. 12J. 5 has been expended in Payments relating solely to this Forest; and as the Sum.laid out on Inclosures for the Growth of Timber, being the only Article of that Expenditure that could contribute to the Improvement of the Forest, is no more than £.3,329. 17 7

the remaining Sum of £.58,209. 14J. 10 which appears to have been disposed of in building and repairing Lodges, paying Salaries, Fees, and Poundages to Officers, and other similar Charges, may all be placed to the Account of Ordinary Expences of Management of the Forest, being, one Year with another, £.2,238. 16 j. 8 d.per Annum, besides about £.1,164. 7*. per Annum of Perquisites to the Keepers, arising chiefly from Deer, Sale of Browse-wood. Rabbits, and keeping of Swine, all drawn from the Forest, and by Means more destructive to it than the felling of so much Timber as would be sufficient to raise that Sum; fb that the actual Expence of Management is, one Year with another, not less than £.3,400 per Annum.

The above-mentioned Sum of £.61,539. 12 5

(with the Discount and Brokerage on the Sale of the Navy Bills) being deducted from the Gross Produce of £.87,952. 13J. id. leaves a Sum of £.26,4x3. — 7 applicable to other Uses, or, one Year with another, about £. 1,015. l7s’ per as the clear Revenue arising from this Forest, on the Average of 26 Years: But that Sum is not to be considered as having been paid into the Exchequer; it appearing from the Documents given with our Third Report that the Repairs and Works in the several Forests and Parks, from 1761 to 1786, exhausted all that arofc from them in that Period, and £. 144,882 more, drawn from the demised Estates of the Crown.

The only Article of Produce from this Forest, besides that Average Yearly Income of £.1,015. 17 8

per Annum, is the Deer: From the Information of the Keepers it appears, that the Number killed Annually is about 76 Brace of Bucks, and about 17 Brace of Does; the greater Number of these are Fee Deer, supplied to the different Forest Officers, and Deer given to the Proprietors of neighbouring Estates by Way of Composition for the Damage sustained by them, and for abstaining from the Exercise of the Right of killing the Deer when trespalfing on their Property. -Eight Brace only of Bucks and One Brace of Does (by the Information of the Lord Warden’s Deputy) are Annually supplied to His Majesty’s Larder; and 15 Brace of Bucks are returned to the

Having now Hated every Thing that we deem necessary, relative to the History and Management of the New Forest, to enable the Legislature to judge of the Grounds on which the Alterations we shall venture to suggest are founded, we shall only here remark, that among the Papers and Documents which we have perused, relative to this Forest, we have found, in almost every Reign, very judicious Plans formed for its Improvement, and for correcting the Abuses in it; but they have all failed from One Cause — the Execution has been left to Officers whose Interest it was to counteract them; nor have we any Expectation that the Plan which we shall think it our Duty to propose will be attended with better Success, until that radical Error in the present System of Management shall be corrected.

We shall now proceed to suggest such Alterations as appear to us to be necessary, in order to remedy the Abuses we have described, and render this Forest a great Nursery and Magazine of Timber for the Navy. With this View we would humbly propose, that an Act of Parliament Should pass, for appointing Commissioners, or enabling His Majesty to appoint Commissioners, to treat and agree with the Freeholders who pay or ought to pay any Small Rents to the Crown, in Money, under the Names before mentioned, of Month Money, Hocktide Money, Leaze Fee Money, and Turf Delf Money; or in Corn, Fowls, Eggs, or other Payments in Kind, for the Sale of such Rents and Payments; and also to treat with those who have Lands within or subject to the Regard of the Forest, for the Disafforeftation thereof, and for the Sale to them of such small Parcels of Land, and such Lanes or Roads belonging to the Forest, as lie intermixed with or pass through their Estates, for a reasonable Price or Composition; empowering the Commissioners also to treat and agree with the Freeholders for the Price to be paid by the Public, as a Compensation for such Rights of Common of Pasture, Turbary, or Eftovers, as they have in the Forest, and are willing to fell, setting off the Rights. of the Crown over their Estates, as far as their Value will go, against the Rights which they enjoy in the Forest.

andly. That the same Commissioners should also be empowered to treat and agree with the Tenants of the Copyhold Estates for the Enfranchisement and Disafforeftation of those Possessions, on Condition that they Should fell to the Crown their Rights of Common of Pasture, Fuel Wood, or Repair Timber, and every Claim that they have on the Forest, or such Part or Proportion of them as may be equal in Value to what the Commissioners fell to them.

3rdly, That where any Incroachments appear to have been made on the Forest by the Proprietors of neighbouring Estates, the Commissioners Should be empowered to reclaim them, and to restore to the Forest such of them as may interfere with any Plan for the Increase of the Wood and Timber, and to fell any other of those Incroachments on reasonable Terms to the Persons in Possession, on Condition that they fell to the Crown such Claims as they may have on the Forest in Right of their Estates, or such Proportion thereof as may be equal in Value to what may be sold to them.

4thly, That where there is any Part of the Boundary of the Forest disputed or doubtful, the Commissioners Should be empowered to treat and agree with the Proprietors of the Lands adjoining to such disputed Part, and to settle and ascertain what shall ever after be held to be the Boundary of the Forest.

And in case the Commissioners, in treating with all or any of the Parties for the Sale, Purchase, or Settlement proposed, Should not agree with them, either as to the Price.or proper Boundary, they Should be empowered to refer such Difference to Arbitrators, to be chosen by the Commissioners and the Claimants, or to a Jury of Freeholders not interested in the Forest.

5thly, That the Commissioners shall be empowered to treat and agree with such Persons as may be appointed, by a Majority in Number and Value, of the Freeholders and others having Right of Common of Pasture and Pannage in the Poreft, as to the Proportion of the 57,845 Acres of Forest Land (being the whole Quantity of the open Forest, after deducting the 6,000 Acres which the Crown is entitled by the Act 9th and 10th William III. to have constantly inclosed) that Should be left open during the whole Year to their Cattle and Swine, as a competent Satisfaction for the Interest or Share that they have a Right to enjoy of the Pannage and Pasture of the said

57.845 Acres for a Part of the Year, in common with the King’s Deer, and what Proportion of the said 57,845 Acres Should be set apart as a competent Satisfaction to the Crown, or to the Public, for the Share which the Crown is entitled to of the said

57.845 Acres, in Consequence of the Right to keep any Number of Deer, without Limitation, in that Part of the Forest during the whole Year; and, those Proportions being ascertained, that the Deer Should be fold or removed to any other Forest or Park belonging to His Majesty, or disposed of as His Majesty may be pleased to direct.

6thly, And that the same Commissioners should be empowered to direct the Proportion so ascertained to be inclosed, in Addition to the 6,000 Acres before mentioned, and on the same Conditions of throwing open any Part of the Inclosures, when the Trees within the same are part Danger of being hurt by Cattle, and inclosing, in lieu thereof, an equal Quantity out of the open Part of the said 57,845 Acres; and those new Inclosures to be under the same Conditions, and to go on in constant Rotation, in the Manner directed by the Act of 9th and 10th William III. with respect to the Lands thereby authorized to be inclosed.

But as it is of great Importance to the Public that Measures should be speedily adopted for the Improvement of this valuable Forest, in order to provide against the Danger to this Country from the alarming Decrease of Naval Timber; and as the Division and Adjustment proposed could not materially affect or injure the Interest or Property of any Individual, we would humbly propose, that if those having Rights of Common of Pasture or Pannage shall neglect or decline to appoint Persons to treat with the Commissioners for the Purposes before mentioned, within Six Months after passing the proposed Act, the Commissioners shall in that same give Notice thereof to the Sheriff of the County of Southampton, who shall, upon receiving such Notice, call a General Meeting of the Freeholders of the County, who shall be empowered to appoint fit Persons to treat and agree with the Commissioners appointed by Parliament, and in Conjunction with them to settle and ascertain the Quantity of Land which should be set apart to be inclosed as a Nursery for Timber, in Consideration of giving up the Deer; and if the Commissioners and those Persons should not agree upon the Quantity which should be so set apart to be inclosed, that they should in that same be empowered to name as Arbitrators Men not interested in the Forest, to whom such Difference shall be referred, and whose Decision shall be final.

And in case the Freeholders of the County shall also neglect to meet, or decline at such Meeting to 9 appoint

appoint Persons to act for those having Rights of Common in the Manner proposed, the Commissioners shall, in that Cafe, be empowered themselves to proceed in the Business; and with that View shall have Power to call before them, and examine upon Oath, such Witnesses as they shall think necessary, in order to enable them to judge of and determine the Proportion of the said 57,845 Acres which, in Consequence of removing the Deer, His Majesty shall be empowered to inclose, in Addition to the 6,000 Acres mentioned in the Act of William III. and under the same Conditions.

Reason«Tor propos- In our Report on the Forest of Dean, we recoming a different Mode mended that a complete Division and Separation of whitRights should take Place; that those heving Right of suggested for Dean Fo- Common should have a competent Proportion of the ,eft* Forest allotted to them for Cultivation, as an Equiva-

lent for their Rights of Failure and Pannage, which are the only Common Rights in that Forest; and that the rest of the Forest should be the entire Property of the Crown: And such a complete Division and

Separation of Rights i9 undoubtedly desirable, in every Forest in which it can be effected with the Concurrence of those having Right of Common, and without forfeiting some great Advantage to the Public in order to obtain it.

But in the New Forest we do not think it would be adviseable to attempt so complete a Separation and Division: Besides the Right of Pasture and Pannage, the neighbouring Inhabitants have, by the Act of William III. their antient Right of Fuel preserved to them, which we have Reason to believe many of them would be unwilling to part with for any re^sonable Price; and from an attentive personal View of the Forest, we are of Opinion that it would be found difficult to make such a Division as would admit of convenient and satisfactory Allotments of Land to the Claimants, for the Purpose of Cultivation, in lieu of their Common Rights, and would not, at the same Time, be disadvantageous to the Public.

There is a great Variety of different Kinds of Soil in this Forest; some Parts of it are extremely valuable, and others are hardly fit for Cultivation: The Allotment naturally to be desired by any Claimant, would be of the Land adjacent to his own; but that may either be Woodland, which ought to be kept as a Nursery for Timber, or Ground not worth the Expence of Improvement; to give more distant Allotments could not be so convenient for the Claimants, and would mangle the Forest, and increase the Number of Roads, as well as the Expence of Inclosure. And if separate Allotments were given to the Claimants, and made' entire Property, Houses, and perhaps Villages, might be built upon them, depriving this Forest of its best Security, which has arisen from its being of great Extent and thinly inhabited.

We therefore give it as our- Opinion, that if the neighbouring Inhabitants will part with their Claims on the Forest at a fair Price, it is for the Interest of the Public to purchase them, so as to free the Forest from any Mixture of Rights whatever, without lessening the Extent of the' Forest Land; but if they will not part with those Claims, we think that no farther Separation of the Rights should be attempted than what we have now proposed.

be given: We have not loft Sight of this Principle in the Adjustment we have proposed; and we have “the Satisfaction to believe that without making any greater Change in the Property of the Parties interested, the Public Object would in a great Measure Advantages from be obtained, and every Claimant would find some the ProP°led Scuie-Accommodation or Advantage. me"

The adjacent Freeholders, who pay small Rents in tothcPrwhoUcni Money and in Kind to the Crown, will exonerate their Estates, and be freed from the troublesome Demands which they occasion, as well as from the Detriment to their Crops by the Trespass of the Deer, which no common Inclosure can prevent; and their Commonable Cattle will have a clear, full, unmixed, and uninterrupted Use of the Pasture in the Part kept open for them, during the whole Year, instead of their present Right to a Share of the Pasture for less than Six Months, in common with the Deer; a Right which, if the Officers of the Forest had been attentive to their Duty, would have been of little Value to the Proprietors, as all the Cattle would in that same have been driven out of the Forest during the Fence Month, and Time of Winter Haining.

The Copyhold Tenants, whole Lands are of any to the Copyholders; considerable Extent, will receive still more Advantage or Accommodation from the Settlement proposed. The Tenure by which they at present hold has many disagreeable Circumstances attending it; and though they have: hitherto been treated with great Moderation, they may not always find a superior Lord ‘ in every Way so indulgent, or' inclined to forego so considerable a Part of his just Advantages, as seems at present to be allowed to the Tenants in the Management of that Property. Besides computing the Fines at the full Value of the Lands on Renewals of their Estates, and taking Heriots ftriilly where they are due, the Trees on the Copyhold Lands are the Property of the Crown; and those which add the mo(t to the Beauty of an Estate are liable to be cue down, at the Will of the Forest Officers. These are Powers which mult be disagreeable to a Tenant, which tend to prevent the Property from being brought to its highest Value, and which, therefore, it is for the Public Interest that the Crown should part with at a fair Price.

Those who are entitled to Fuel Wood from the *0 those entitled to Forest willalfo derive a great Advantage from its Im- Fuel Wo<,dj provement. The Quantity at present assigned for Fuel is upwards of 800 Loads Annually. This is such a Demand as, according to the best Information we have obtained, the Forest cannot, under the present Managenhent, long supply, even if the best Beech Trees should be allowed for Fuel, and no more taken than is actually assigned. The Right to Fuel Wood must therefore soon become of little Value to the Claimants, unless an Improvement of the Forest shall . take Place.

And the Public, by this general Arrangement, and to the Pnbiicj would obtain an extensive and valuable Addition to the Nursery for Timber, which in this Forest is of far more Value than in any other belonging to the Crown, owing to its being situated so near to the Dock Yard at Portsmouth, that the whole Expence of Carriage by Land and Water, together with the Expence of felling and 'squaring, is no more than 15 s. 1 \d.per Load, being little more than One Fourth Append!*, N°4j.

Part of what those Expences amount to on the Timber of Dean Forest, and less than that Proportion of those Expences in other Forests, as we learn from the Information communicated to us by the Navy Board.

The Number of Acres which the Crown may be Land* set apart for empowered to inclose being thus ascertained, the ll0W to *"*

Situation of the Inclosures, and the Kind of Fence, should all be determined by the same Commissioners, who should also enter into- open Contrails for fencing and planting the First Inclosures, which will not only serve as Examples for others, but be a Check as to the Expence on the Office to which the Execution of such Works may afterwards be committed.

peculations Anted to the Management of private Property,

jnsufficient for that of the Public.

The Abuses in New Fo 1 til ot Three Kinds.

Those arising from it* divided Government:

from the mixed Rights of the Inhabitants)

from the Mode of taking Fuel Wood)

from Depredation* of Cattagcji, &c.

By the Arrangement we have proposed, the FordV would be put into a State in which it might, under proper Management, supply a very great Quantity of Timber for the Navy; but the greatest Difficulty remains; and we proceed with the utmost Diffidenct to that Part of our Duty which requires that we Should point out what Changes Should be made in the present System of executive Management, and what new Regulations Should be adopted, in order to put a Stop to and prevent the Return of those Abuses which at present waste the Forests, and render them of little Value to the Public.

The same Regulations which answer very well in private Property, where, under the watchful Management of the Owner, though casual Injuries cannot be prevented, yet no Habit of Depredation is suffered to prevail, will not be sufficient to secure the Forests; for though every Kind of Offence or Intrusion has, at different Times, been punished, yet there has been for many Years such Supineness in the general Management, and such Waste and Depredation committed by the resident Officers, that the neighbouring Inhabitants have been naturally led to partake in the Spoil, and hardly to think it a Crime to take what no one seemed anxious to protect: To counteract Habits which are so general, and to guard against Offences which Men have been accustomed to commit from their Infancy, is no easy Matter, and will require more Checks to be established, particularly where any Mixture of Rights whatever remains, than can be necessary in the Management of private Property.

On considering the Account we have given of the different Sources of Waste and Destruction in this Forest, it will be found that they consist of Three different Kinds: ,

1 ft. Those which arise from the Divijum,

which we have before described; from' the improper' Mode of paying the Officers, and the Advantages they are allowed to take, of a Kind destrudbive to the Forest; and from the keeping of Deer: All of these it is in the Power of the Crown to put an End to, by giving up the Deer, and substituting such a System of Management and Mode of Payment as we shall propose.

2ndly. The Second Class of Abuses are those which are a natural Consequence of the Rights possessed by the neighbouring Inhabitants, such as the Admission of more Cattle than Should be received into the Forest, and at prohibited Seasons; Horses of a Size under that mentioned in the Statute of 32d VIII.; Swine after Pannage Time, and Sheep belonging to Persons who have no Right to fend them; and the cutting of Heath, Fern, Furze, Turf, and Peat in improper' Places: All these will be avoided in the Inclosures which we have proposed, and any material Injury to the rest of the Forest may be checked by the Laws now in being.

Another Abuse of this Class arises from the present Mode of taking and disposing of Fuel Wood, described in the former Part of this Report; to remedy which it appears to us to be absolutely necessary to prevent the cutting of any Tree or Branch in the Forest by any Person whatever, except under the immediate Direction and in the Presence of the Forest Officers, or the loading of any Cart or Carriage with Wood of any Kind, without the View of the Keeper, and a written Order of such other Officer as may be entrusted with the issuing of such Orders, of which he should keep a regular Account: And we also think it necessary, that the Wood for Fuel Should be cut down and corded under the Direction of the Forest Officers, so as that it may not be used for any other Purpose than Fuel.

rclly. The Abuses of the Third Class are, the Offences and Depredations committed by the Inhabitants, chiefly of the adjacent Villages, and of the

Cottages built on the Forest, in the Sealing or lopping of Trees, setting Fire to the Heath, Fern, or Furze, and delbroying the Fences.

That the Officers may be encouraged to discover and prosecute such Offenders, and not, as at present, deterred by the Expence attending it, we would humbly propose that they Should be re-paid all reasonable Charges of Prosecution, and be allowed, in all Cafes, the Whole of the Fine imposed on the Offenders; and the setting Fire to the Heath, Fern, and Furze of the Forest, which may be attended with the most destructive Consequences, Should be made Felony.

In regard to the Cottages built on the Forest, and the small Incroachments made by the Cottagers, which appear by the Plan to be very numerous, the Commissioners Should have discretionary Powers, fi-milar to what we proposed in our Report on the Forest of Dean, for re-claiming those Incroachments, or for shewing Indulgence to Possessors under particular Circumstances. So long as the Cottagers remain in the Forest without committing Depredations, their Cottages do little Harm; but it would tend much to the Preservation of the Forest, if the cutting, Healing, or lopping any Tree, by Day or Night, Should, if committed by the Possessor of any such Incroachment be punished by turning the Offender out of Possession of the Cottage or Land so held by the Indulgence of the Crown; and it cannot be thought hard, that such Persons Should be removed for the Commission of new Offences, after the Indulgence of allowing them to live on their usurped Possessions.

We shall now suggest such Alterations in the Management of this Forest, as appear to us to be necess fary, for preventing the destructive Effects arising from its divided Government, and from the improper Mode of paying the Officers.

The resident Officers, who have the Wood, Timber, and Inclosures, under their Care, and over whom the Surveyor General has at present no Authority or Controul, Should be put under the Direction of that Officer, or of whatever Office shall have the general Management of the Forests.

No Officer Should be permitted to receive any Fee, Perquisite, or Gratuity of any Kind, nor to have any Advantage whatever from the Execution of any Work to be done in the Forest, nor to keep Cattle or Swine, except, for the Use of his Family, under particular Limitation, and none whatever in any Inclosure for the Growth of Timber. The Rabbits should be extirpated; and as it is proposed to remove the Deer, no Pretence will remain for the cutting of Browse-wood, which is a Source of the greatest Mischief to the Forest: And in lieu of all the Fees, Perquifices, and Emoluments at present received, each Officer Should have an adequate Salary, with a House, and an Inclosure not exceeding 8 or 10 Acres of Land.

There are 15 Walks in the Forest, in every one of which we think there Should be One Wood Bailiff: Some of the Walks will be much more difficult to protect than others; and as the Duty will, on that Account, be more laborious, the Salaries Should vary proportionably. Besides the Wood Bailiffs, Assistants will be required, as Watchmen to guard the Woods and Inclosures, in those Walks which have the greatest Extent of Woodlands in them, and are situated nearest to the Villages and Cottages round the Forest. Of these Watchmen, we conceive about Eighteen or Twenty maybe found necessary: They Should be chosen from among the most honest, active, and industrious of the Labourers, who will be employed in the various Works to be done in the Fofeft; and all that we think it necessary to allow them, in Addition to what they will earn by their Labour, is a Cottage, and a Garden of about Half an Acre, in the Neighbourhood of the Woods they are to guard; and a small Salary, perhaps not exceeding Live Pounds a

taken from the General Register; and such Alterations as it may have been found necessary to make in the Establishment of Officers, Should be fully Rated, and the Reasons explained.

The Alterations we have proposed will have the Effed of bringing the executive resident Officers, whose Bufinel's will be confined to the Care of the Woods and Inclosures, wholly under the Authority of the Office of Forests. The Deer being removed, there will remain nothing under the Charge of the antient Establishment of Forest Officers, whose Duty extended only to the Preservation of the Vert and Venison; and the public Exigencies requiring that the Forests Should be hereafter kept as Nurseries for Timber, it cannot be expended that those Perquisites or Advantages Should be continued which are incon-fiftenc with that public Object.

No Fuel Wood Should be allowed to any Officer in the Forest, in Right of his Office, except where granted for a Term of Years; by which the Annual Demands on the Forest for Fuel will be very considerably reduced.

The Grants of the Lodges of Irouftjill, Bolderwood, and Rhinefield,to the Mailer Keepers, if this Plan Diall be adopted, can be considered only as Matter of Favour; and not being of any farther Use in the Management of the Forest, they Should certainly be put on that Kind of Footing that will prevent them from remaining longer the Source of shameful Waste of the Timber, and of improper concealed Advantage on the Part of the resident Officers entrusted with the Execution of the Repairs: But that this may be effected without any Inconvenience or Lol's to the present Poffefiors, we would humbly propose that, instead of granting those Lodges to the Mailer Keepers during Pleasure only, they Should be granted to them for Life, or for a Term of Years, with a proper Quantity of the inclosed Ground annexed to them, but reserving the Timber, on Condition of keeping the Lodges and Fences in complete Repair; an Expence which it cannot be expelled the Mailer Keepers would take upon themselves on their present precarious Tenure. After the Expiration of the Leafes1 first granted, if it shall be found expedient to continue them in Lease, other Conditions may be inserted, either for the Payment of Relit, or for lclTening the Quantity of the Ground to go with them, adding the rest to the Nurfcry for Timber; but no Repair Should ever be done on any of them at the Expence of the Forest.

A small Allowance Should be made to the Wood Bailiffs and Watchmen, for keeping their Houses and Cottages in Repair, under the Inspection of the superior resident Officers; and no Building Should be repaired with the Timber or at the Expence of the Forest, except the King’s House and Stables at LynJburJl; and whenever any considerable Repair shall be required for those Buildings, a Surveyor Should be lent from the Office of Forests, to examine and report, on Oath, what is necessary to be done, and what the Expence will amount to; and when the Work is finished, it Should be again surveyed by Ikilful Workmen, to fee that it has been faithfully and fub-standnlly executed.

We have not thought it proper for us to point out the Quantum of the Salary which we think would be adequate to the Duty of the different Offices required by the Plan we have proposed; but it may perhaps be expected that we Should mention what, in our Opinion, would be nearly the Amount of the Whole, in order that it may be compared with the Expence of the present E.llabliflimcnr, and for that Reason ive take the Liberty of Hating that, according to our Computation, the whole Expence of die Plan which we have luggelled would not exceed £.1,500 or £. 1,6co perJauar, including jn that Sum every

Salary, and a i‘easonable Allowance for the Support of the Lodges and Cottages of the Under Keepers and Watchmen; whereas the Expence of the present Iiftab-lishment, which has a Tendency to the Destruction of the Forest, appears by the Statement before given to be not less than £. 3,400.

The Act by which we are appointed requires that we Should fuggell Plans and Regulations for the future Improvement and Management of the Landed Estate of the Crown, for the Protection, Increase, and-Supply of Timber on the Royal Forests, and for re-dressing any Abuses in the Management; and we have, in compliance with that Part of our Duty, and according to our bell Judgment, suggested such a Plan of Management, and proposed such Offices, as we conceive will be necessary, and at the same Time sufficient, to answer those Purposes in the Forest.

Many of the antient Offices will, if that Plan shall be adopted, become unnecessary: Such of their Perquisites and Advantages as are deflrudive to the Timber, we have thought it our Duty to represent as Abuses which ought to be put an End to; but Reasons and Motives may exist for continuing such of them as" are not of a Kind prejudicial to the Forest, for a Term of Years, or during the Lives of the present Officers, which we conceive it not to be within the Limits of our Duty to take under Consideration.

The Difference in the Expence €>f those Plans of Management is, however, but a very small Part of the Benefit which the Public would derive from the proposed Alterations: We have in the former Part of this Report ffiewn, from the most unquestionable Authority, that there was at One Time growing on this Forest: no less than 315,000 Loads of Timber of a Size fit for the Navy: The Quantity of that Size, by the Survey in 1783, was only 20,830 Loads, or about One Fifteenth Part of the Quantity in 1608. By the Estimate of the Purveyor of the Navy, the Forest will, at present, afford an Annual Supply of 1,000 Loads, which, including the Top and Bark, is worth about £. 4,000. Supposing the Quantity growing in [608 to have afforded a proportional Supply, it would be no less than 15,000 Loads Yearly, worth at the same Rate £. 60,000, which is more than One Half of the Quantity used in all the Royal Dock Yards, and near One Third Part of the whole Consumption for the Navy, including the Ships of War built in Merchants Yards, and no less than Seven Times as much as, under the present System of Management, has been Annually furnished to the Navy from all the Forests belonging to the Crown during His Majesty’s Reign; and there is certainly every Reason to expect that, under a Plan of Management in which the Increase and Preservation of the Timber are made the foie Objects of Attention, and when the Deer are removed, the Forest may be brought to produce at lead as much as it did formerly, when the Forest v/as flocked with Deer, and the Tres were a Ob-

jed, preserved chiefly because they yielded Browle and Covert.

The Objects we have had in View in forming the Plan which we have thought it our Duty to suggest, are to exonerate the Estates conceded with the Forest from every Thing that is or might be made disagreeable or burthensome to the Proprietors, or prevent the Property from being brought to its highest State of Improvement; — to free the Forest Land from those Claims and Rights of Common, or that joint Occupancy, which obstruct the Growth of Timber, as far as we think that may be done without Injury to the Property of any Person interested in the Forest; — to put an End to that confused Interference of different Offices which has hitherto impeded every Attempt to check Abuses, or to execute any Plan for 1 the

compared with the present.

We shall only add, that the farther we have proceeded in our Enquiry, the more we have become satisfied that it is efientially necessary for Government to provide, by Means of l'uch Improvements, a Supply in future for the Support of our Navy, without milling to its being obtained either from other Countries, or from private Estates in our own: — That though the Annual Demand for rough Timber for the King’s Dock Yards is, One Year with another, only 25,000 Loads, as dated in our Third Report, on the Authority of the Navy Board, vet that many of our Ships of War being built in private Dock Yards, by Contract with that Board, the whole Quantity consumed in the Support of our Navy, from October 1760 to the End of the Year 1788, was 1,285,306 Loads, or 45,904 Loads Yearly on an Average, as appears by the Statements in the Appendix, furnished to us by the Commissioners of the Navy: — And that the Demand for great Timber for the Shipping of the East India Company is much increased, from the PraClice of building Ships of a larger Size than formerly; while on the other Hand, in Answer to all our Enquiries, we receive new Assurances of a rapid Decrease in the general Quantity of Oak Timber growing in this Kingdom.

Wiffiing to discover some Means of ascertaining whether there really is that Decrease in the Quantity of Timber, and to remove, if possible, any Doubt in a Question of so much Importance, we have endeavoured to collect such Information as might enable us to form a Judgment of the Quantity which was growing in this Country at a former Period, that we might compare it with the Accounts we have received, as to the present Stock; and finding that the Progress of Cultivation, and the peculiar Firness of that Land for Tillage which is also the bed for the Growth of Oak, are the most prevailing Causes assign^d for the Decrease of the Quantity of Woodland, and particularly of Hedgerow Timber, which is deemed the bed for Naval Uses, we have endeavoured to discover whether there is any other Kind of Tree which may be expected to grow, on the wade and mountainous Parts of this Country, to a sufficient Size to be used in Ship Building, and which, though inferior in Quality to the Oak, may in some Degree

serve as a Subdiulte in case of a Scarcity of that valuable Timber; and from all the Information we have hithfcrto received, the Larix or Larch Tree is by far the most likely to answer the Purposes wanted: — It is known to thrive extremely well in the mod. Northern and mountainous Parts of this Island; it is a Native Of the Alps, and is found there on higher Ground than 'almod any other Tree; it is also the natural Produce of the Northern Parts of Russia , and the Ships of War built at Archangel, which are all of that Timber, we are well informed are as durable as those built at Peterjlmrgh of Rujjian Oak. The Oak of that Country is doubtless much inferior to the Britfi, and we do not mean to date the Larch Timber as fic to be used in building Ships of War in this Country while Oak can be had; but it may perhaps prove useful in building Trading Ships, and leave a greater Proportion of our Oak for the Navy; and no Tree is more likely to grow well in those Parts of the Forest which are unfit for the Growth of Oak.

We have endeavoured also, by an Enquiry into the Modes of building Ships in other Countries, as well as by consulting such Persons at Home as are reputed to have most Experience and Skill in that Profession, to enable ourselves to point out some Means of leffening the Wade of the Timber used, and of increasing its Duration; wishing in that Manner, as well as by Plans for the Improvement of the Foreds, to fugged whatever may tend to render the Supply to be expected in future from this Kingdom adequate to the Demand, and prevent the Evils to be apprehended from a Dependance on Foreign Countries, for our Naval Timber. — But these important Subjects have opened so wide a Field of Invedigation,- and One in which it is so difficult to avoid being mified, that we have thought it right to continue our Enquiries some Time longer, and to podpone our Report upon them until our Information shall be dill more complete.

We have reserved also for the Subject of a future Report, the Regulations which appear to us to be essentially necessary in the Office entruded with the general Care of the Timber in the Royal Foreds; and have confined ourselves on the present Occasion to a Statement of the Abuses, and a Plan for the Improvement and particular Management of the New

Forest, a Property from its Situation and Extent of so much Importance to the Public, as to be well deserving of the immediate Attention of the Legis-

lature.

The Examination of Richard , House-

keeper of the King’s House ai (but

commonly called Lord Warden’s Stewa/d) and also One of the Regarders of the Forest; taken on Oath, the 22d Day of November 1788.

This Examinant is Housekeeper of the King’s House at Lyndhurst, or Steward to the Lord Warden;

his Salary is Seventy Pounds per Annum, and in the , Absence of the Lord Warden he hath the Use of Two small Fields containing about Five Acres, and

a Garden, worth together about Ten Pounds Annum, and of about Thirty Acres of Land at Hill Lodge in the Absence of Prince William Henry the Master: Keeper, and during his Pleasure, worth about Fifteen Pounds per Annum clear. He attends the assigning and delivering of the Navy Timbef under the Lord Warden’s Contract, and the Sales oT the Lops, Tops, and Bark, and the Cast Timber refused by the Purveyor, which are previously valued by the Regarders, and he accounts for the same to Colonel Hey wood. Deputy to the Lord Warden. Hie also collects the Quit Rents and Forest Rents due to the Lord Warden, and takes Charge of Cattle and Swine unchallenged at the general Drifts of the Forest; which, if not owned within Three Days after driving, are eftrayed in the Presence of Two Tenants of the Manor of Lyndhurst, and turned into New Park. If they are afterwards owned he receives One Shilling and Six Pence a Head on releasing them, but if they remain there a Year unowned, they become the Property of the Lord Warden; but no ln-stance of that Sort has happened since he has been Steward. He also receives the Pannage Money for Swine turned into the Forest in Pannage Time. The Quit Rents in forne Bailiwicks of the Forest are collected by the Keepers, who pay a stipulated Sum Annually out of what they collect for the Use of the Lord Warden, and are allowed to retain the Remainder for their own Use. The Amount of the Rents which should be received for the Lord Warden is £. 96. a; but this Examinant has never been able to collect the Whole of that Sum. The Sum Yearly paid by him for the Use of the Lord Warden, purfuaot to an Agreement with a former Steward, is £.86. 7. 5, and what he collects above that Sum he, is allowed to retain for the Trouble of collecting the m. The Profits of the Pannage belong to the Lord Warden, but this Examinant is allowed to retain them for his own Use. The Amount is very uncertain, depending entirely on the Sealon. In the Year 1785 he received £.2. 15. 6; in 1786, £-33* — ,n U87J £ i- 10. 31; and in 1788, £.17. 2. 3; the Average on those Four Years being £. )3* 12. 1. AH Warrants for killing Deer in the Forest are also sent to this Examinant, who direCls them to, the several Keepers, and he also pays all incidental Disbursements at the King’s House, on the Lord Warden’s Account.

This Examinant was chosen One of the Regarders of the New Forest in the Year 1779. There are in all Twelve Regarders, a certain Number of whom (generally Five or Six) attend the marking of all -Trees to be felled in the Forest for any Purpose whatever, and none can be felled but such as are marked by the Purveyor of the Navy, which Should be done in the Presence of Three Regarders at the lead. The Regarders also attend on the Delivery of the Naval Timber to the Dock Officer, and the Sales of Lop$ and Tops of Navy Trees, and other Wood and Timber in the Forest; and this Examinant very frequently attends on such Occafioos. The Regarders are not obliged to attend. They have no Salary, nor any other Emoluments, as Regarders, besides ah antient Allowance of Two Shillings and Six Pen Day, for every Day on which they actually attend on any Business of the Forest; which Allowance is at any Time barely sufficient, and often inefficient to pay the Expence attending it, as the Regarders frequently ride Ten Miles from Home, and are out Seven or Eight Hours at a Time on Forest Business. The Purveyor of the Navy, the Deputy Surveyor General, and Deputy Woodward, are also Regarders of the Forest. There have been generally Two dated Falls of Navy Timber Yearly, one under the Charge of the Lord Warden, the other under the Charge of the Surveyor General. All Extra Falls of Timber

for

A. 1789

for the Navy, or for Sale, or Repairs of Lodges or Fences belonging to the Forest, are likewise under the Charge of the Surveyor General. The Deputy Surveyor usually attends on the marking of Timber in the Surveyor General’s Charge, and the Deputy Woodward on assigning Fuel and Repair Timber for the Copyhold Tenants i and neither of them attend but very rarely on any other Occasions. The Navy Timber for the Lord Warden is marked by the Purveyor and this Examinant, in the Presence of the Regarded. The Regarders, who attend on Forest Business with the Deputy Surveyor or Deputy Woodward, are paid by them respectively, and those who attend the Marking or Delivery of the Lord Warden’s Timber are paid by this Examinant. If it happens that Timber is marked for the Lord Warden, the Surveyor General, and the Woodward, on the same Day, the Regarders are paid separately by each for such Day’s Attendance; and it has been customary for the Deputy Surveyor and Deputy Woodward to pay each other, as Regarders, for Business in their respective Departments, and for this Examinant to pay them both as such, whether they attend or not. The Fuel Wood is assigned by the Purveyor and Deputy Woodward, a certain Number of Loads Yearly to each Claimant, according to the Fuel Lift, of which the Purveyor, Deputy Woodward, and most of the attending Regarders, have Copies. The Quantity is nearly the same every Year, never increased, but sometimes diminished, when a House falls and is not re-built. The Kind of Wood usually assigned is ferubbed Beech, unfit for the Navy. Many Persons use their Fuel Wood as Fuel; but a Custom prevails very generally of felling it, and converting it to other Uses. The bell Parts are usually cut into Rails and Truck Wheels for the Use of the Coal Works at and

Card Boards for dressing Wool, and are generally prepared for those Uses in the Forest, and the Lops and Tops made into Charcoal. Each Person either fells his own Fuel Wood or fells it (landing. No Time is limited for taking it away, and much Mif-chief is frequently done in felling the Fuel Trees, and he believes wilfully, in throwing down young Timber Trees, and Branches of Trees near them. He has Twice convicted Persons of cutting Trees which had not been assigned to them, and he believes that great Quantities are taken more than are assigned; but it is not easy to dete£l them. When Timber is wanted for Repairs by the Copyhold Tenants, an Estimate of the Quantity required is made on the Oath of a Workman, and by the View of Two Tenants, and presented at the Court of the Manor, and the Steward then issues a Warrant to the Woodward for assigning the same: It is always assigned by the Purveyor and Deputy Woodward in the Presence of the Regarders, and after the Timber is felled, the Quantity is measured and delivered to the Tenants. The High Woodward has the Bark, and the Deputy Woodward the Lops and Tops, for their own Use. He cannot say with Certainty how such Timber is disposed of, but believes that some Persons fell or exchange Part of it, and others fell the Whole, and afterwards apply for more, there being no proper Check against Abuses of this Nature. When any Buildings or Fences belonging to the Forest are directed to be repaired, the Work is done under the Direction of the Deputy Surveyor, without the Interference of any Forest Officer, other than for assigning Timber for that Purpose. It has not been usual, within his Remembrance, for the Regarders or other Officers to inspect the Works after they were executed, though he has heard it was done formerly, and that the Accounts were examined and attested by the Regarders before they were passed.

The Answer of Sir Harry Baronet, Rid-

ing Forester, and one of the Rangers of the New Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated ill June 1787.

As Riding Forester, I conceive it to be my Duty ro attend and ride before His Majesty when He goes into the Forest, and to fend all Warrants directed to me, for His Majesty’s Use, to such Keepers as I think bell able to serve them well; as Ranger, to drive the Purlieus.

As Riding Forester, I am appointed by the King’s Letters Patent, durante bene; as Ranger, by the Lord Warden’s Warrant, during his Pleasure.

1 receive no Rents, nor make any Disbursements By virtue of either of my Offices.

My Annual Salary as Riding Forester is £.500, and amounts, net, to £.424. 1 paid at the Exchequer by Warrant from the Treasury. As Ranger under the Lord Warden, my Annual Salary is £.4, paid by the Woodward, and a. 13*. 4 paid by the Lord Warden for what is called the Apportionment.

I have no certain or casual Fees or Emoluments, except One Fee Buck Annually for each Office.

I do not occupy any Messuages or Tenements in the Forest.

To the Questions concerning the Timber and Wood, and the Deer, it is impossible for me to give any Information, as I never have had any Occasion or Opportunity to enquire into them, and never conceived it any Part of my Duty to do so.

1 have Reason to believe that many Intrusions and Incroachments have been made, and do now exist in the Forest, but it is not in my Power to give a particular Account of them.

No Waste of any Timber has come to my Knowledge, and, I believe, does not often happen; but the Keepers of the several Walks usually present such Abuses at the Swanimote Courts.

The A nfwer of Sir Philip Jennings , Baronet, Bowbearer, and One of the Verderors of the New Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue ;dated the ill Day of June 1787.

The said Sir Philip Jennings Clerke holds the Offices of Verderor and Bowbearer. The Duty of the First is bed expressed in Manwcod's Laws; that of Bowbearer is to attend the King when in the Forest, with a Bow and Arrow. He was elected Verderor by the Freeholders of the County for Life, as he believes, and he was appointed Bowbearer by the Lord Warden during Pleasure. The Verderors have no Salary; the Bowbearer’s Salary is 40J. a Year. As Verderor he is entitled to One Fee Buck and One Fee Doe Annually; but out of Compliment to the Lord Warden, the Verderors have taken the Euck only: As Bowbearer, he has also a Buck and a Doe. Formerly, it is said, the Verderors used to attend the Sales or Falls of Timber in the Forest; but they have not done so for many Years; he cannot, therefore, give a satisfactory Answer to the Enquiry concerning the Timber. The Incroachments are inconsiderable; but Reference may be had to the Records of the Verderors Court, in which all Presentments are entered that are made by the Under Keepers of the respective 3 Walks.

The Answer of Charles Lord , One of the

Rangers of the New Forest, and Master Keeper of Jftjley Walk, in the said Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated ift June 1787.

The Duty of Master Keeper, from long Usage, has been little or none, the Groom Keeper being always on the Spot, and answerable for what may happen, to the present, as well as succeeding Lord Wardens. The Office of Ranger is an entire Sinecure. — Lord Cadogan was appointed by His Royal Highness the Duke of Glouceft during Pleasure — No Rents or Collections are received by any Master Keeper. — The Ranger’s Salary is 13. 4. per

Annum, paid by the Lord Warden’s Deputy, which is the Whole of his Profit — There are no Fees or Emoluments, except One Fee Buck as Ranger, and another as Master Keeper, Annually — There is a House for the Groom Keeper, which he inhabits — Neither Master Keeper or Ranger have any Cognizance of the Articles relative to Timber or Wood — It is impossible to ascertain the Number of Bucks and Does in any particular Walk, as they are at full Liberty t6 range all over the Forest — The Disposition of the Venison has been at all Times in the Lord Warden, whose Deputy can give the best Account thereof — There never has been any Allowance for Hay, Corn, or other Food for the Deer — Lord Cadogan refers to Mr. Mansfield, the Law Steward of the Forest, for Answer to the Enquiries concerning In-trufions, Incroachments, Waste, Spoil, or other Abuses.

The Answer of Stanley George Heywood, Esquire, High Woodward of the New Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue, dated ift June 1787.

I understand the Office of Woodward and his Deputy is to inspect and attend all Business in the Forest, and to be present at the Assignments of Timber. I am appointed by Patent under Seal; I am accountable for the Money raised by taking up the old Moores in the Forest, and which is applied to the Payment of the Regarders, Sales, &c. the Surplus to be accounted for, which, with the Vouchers, are ready when called for; there is also Money from call Timber not fit for the Navy, which is also employed for the Payment of Regarders and Expences, the Moor Wood not producing near enough for the Disbursement. The Salary is £. Year, paid by the Lord Warden’s Contract. I have no"casual Fees; the only Emolument arises from the small Quantity of Bark taken from the Oak cut for the Tenants Repairs or Fuel, which barely pays the Expence of attending that Duty. The Timber usually cut for the Surveyor’s Contract amounts to 500 Loads of Oak, and 50 Beech Trees; for the Lord Warden’s Contract, Vol. XLIV.

miL 58

370 Loads of Oak, and 50 Beech Trees, with 800 Load for Fuel; much the greatest Part of which of bad Beech; but there have been, within about Four Years, Two extraordinary Orders for Timber. The Bucks are disposed of by Order of the Lord Warden; whose Deputy will probably account for them. No Hay or other Feed is allowed for the Deer — All Offenders for Intrusions, &c. are brought before the Verderors Courts — Mr. Mansfield, the Law Steward, holds these Courts, and can give the most certain Information. I have not lately had atiy Spoil or Waste reported to me; no Doubt such Things happen; but all the Power we have is exerted to the utmost to prevent it.

The Examination of Thomas Jeans, Deputy Woodward, and One of the Regarders of the New Forest; taken on Oath, the Twenty-first Day of November 1788.

This Examinant faith. That he was appointed Deputy Woodward of the New Forest in the Year 1772. His Salary is Fifty Pounds per ,paid by the High Woodward. He takes as Perquisites for the High Woodward the Bark of all Timber allowed to the Tenants of the-Forest for Repairs, which amounts to about Eight or Ten Pounds a Year; and for his own Use the Lops and Tops of such Timber, which produce, on an Average, about Twelve Pounds per Annum; and also, Two Shillings for every Ticket issued to the Moorwood Diggers, of which Sixteen are issued Yearly: The Use of those Tickets is to authorize them to dig the Moors or Roots of Trees in the Forest. He has also an Assignment of Four Loads of Fuel Wood for his owta Use,-as Deputy Woodward. He attends at aligning all Fuel Wood cut in the Forest, and Timber allowed to the Tenants for Repairs; he authorizes the digging of Moor Wood, and disposes of it, and takes Charge of all Windfall Timber and Wood in the Forest; but he has never attended the marking of Timber for the Navy or for Sale, Of for any other Purpose, except in the Year 1772, when he’ attended the assigning of Trees for fencing the Inclosures then ordered to be made, being requested by the then Purveyor and Deputy Surveyor to assist them on that Occasion, for the Sake of Dispatch, and except when he has been in the Forest on other Occasions. The Fuel Wood is assigned by him, in Conjundlion with the Purveyor of the Navy, and in the Presence of Five or Six Regarders, and sometimes more. The Deputy Surveyor does not attend the assigning of Fuel Wood or Tenants Repair Timber. The Kinds of Wood now assigned for Fuel are inferior Beech and some Birch, of which there is very little in the Forest; a great deal of Oak was formerly assigned for Fuel, but none since the Appointment of the present Purveyor, excepting a small Quantity during the First Year after his Appointment. Most of the Fuel Wood is fold, and applied to various Uses; the principal Part of it for Trucks and Rails for the Newcastle Coal Trade, and for Card Boards for dressing of Wool. The Wood is felled by the Parties, and commonly worked up for those Uses in the Forest: No Time is limited for taking it away, and Instances have happened of more Trees being taken than were assigned. The Kinds of Wood assigned for Repairs is small ferubbed Oak, unfit for the Navy, which is also marked by the Purveyor in the Presence of the Regarders. It is assigned in purfu-

7 I ance

A. 1789

ance of Warrants issued by the Steward of the Manor, and after it is felled it is measured by the Purveyor, and delivered to the Tenants, and the Tops and Bark are fold for the Use of the High and Under Woodward. That the Moor Wood dug in the Forest is commonly fold for making Charcoal, and delivered by the Rcgarders; the Beech Moor Wood is sold at about Twelve Shillings, and the Oak at about Fifteen Shillings, the Coal Fire (which is a Pile of Six Fathom long, Three Feet high, and Two Feet wide) out of which the Diggers are paid Eight Shillings, or Eight and Six Pence per Coal Fire for raising it. When Windfall Trees are found in the Forest, if fit for the Use of the Navy, they are delivered to the Purveyor, and the Lops and Tops, or the whole Tree, if unfit for Naval Use, are valued by the Rcgarders, and fold generally to those who buy the Moor Wood. The Sales of Cast Timber and Moor Wood are by private Contract; the Money arising from them is received by this Examinant, and accounted for to the High Woodward. The Windfall Timber taken for the Navy is paid for by Navy Bills issued to the High Woodward.

This Examinant is also one of the Regarders of the New Forest; he was chosen about the Year 1775, or

1776, by the Freeholders of the County.

A certain Number of the Regarders are always present at the marking of ail Trees cut for the Navy, for Sale, for Repairs, or for any other Purpose, and none can be marked for felling but in the Presence of 'Three Regarders at the least; that they are allowed Two Shillings and Six Pence fer Day for every Day they aftiially attend on any Business of the Forest; that such of the Regarders as attend the marking of Fuel Wood and Repair Timber are paid by the Woodward, and such as attend the marking of Timber for the Navy, or for Sale, or few any Purpose in the Department of the Surveyor General, are paid by the Deputy Surveyor. That the present Deputy Surveyor is also a Regarder, and it has been custdmary for the Deputy Surveyor and Deputy Woodward to pay each other the Regarder's Fee for the whole Number of Days on which any Business is done in the Forest by eithef of them, although the Deputy Surveyor does not actually attend the aligning of Fuel or Repair Timber, nor the Deputy Woodward on the marking Timber for the Navy or for Sale. That the Fees received by this Examinant as Regarder have amounted to about Sixteen Pounds per Annum: That there have been several Inclosures made in the Forest since his Appointment, particularly the large Inclosure in Wilverley Walk, made about the Year 1772;

That before that IndofuroJKas made, the Ground was covered with Thorns, Furze, and Hollies, which were all cut up and fold before the inclosure was planted; and that there was at that Time a great Stock of Rabbits in that Part of the Walk: That this Inclosure has not produced any young Timber, but is now a Waste, owing, as he believes, to the cutting of the Cover, which, he thinks, would have nursed up the young Trees, and protected them against the Rabbits: And he observed at that Time to the Deputy Surveyor, that it was not likely that any young Timber would grow there after the Cover was setroyed.

The Under Steward issues no Warrant for Timber, except a very few for the Repair of certain Copyholds in the Manor of Lyndburjl, presented at the General Michaelmas Court Baron to be out of Repair, or wanting Ploughboot or Cartboot, by the Homage of the Manor of Lyndburjl, and for these he receives only the old Fee of is. 6d. each. The Profits arising from Forest Prosecutions, and other casual Business, are of course uncertain, being in Proportion to the Trouble attending such Business.

To the 8th, 9th, and 10th. For the Quantity of Timber, Number of Deer, Incroachments, and In-trufions, coming under these Enquiries, it is submitted that the necessary Information may belt be had by Reference to the Returns made to the same Enquiries by the Surveyor, Deputy Surveyor, Woodward, Under Woodward, Regarders, Keepers, Under Keepers, and others under whose immediate Care and Inspection these Matters respectively come.

To the nth. The Timber is much protested by the Act of 6th Geo. III. before which Time Prosecutions were so flow and expensive, that Capital Offenders often escaped Punishment, and the Practice of ctiOting and dealing Timber was then much greater than it is at present. However, notwithstanding ua-der that Act it is Felony to cut or steal Timber in the

Night,

Night, many have ventured to do it, and but One Prosecution has taken Place in the New in consequence of the Act, though some Offenders have left the Country upon the Report of Informations. It is here submitted, that if Informers and Accomplices were to be well rewarded for the Discovery of such Offences committed in the Night, it would in great Measure be the Means of preventing the m; but at present no Provision is made for such Rewards. The like Offences are now but seldom committed in the Day Time, because the Penalties are heavy, an'd Informers are encouraged by being entitled to a Moiety of the Penalty. It would be the further Means of detesting such Offences committed either in the Day or Night, if some Provision was made for paying to Keepers and others all reasonable Charges for their Trouble and Expence in prosecuting, before Justices of the Peace or otherwise; for at present, when an Offender is convicted before a Justice of Peace for any Offence against the Timber or Deer, and unable to pay the Penalty, there is no Fund to answer the Expence of Prosecution (except that of the Peace Officers in carrying Offenders to Gaol, which the Justices at their Quarter Sessions have sometimes refused to allow) and when Conviction does not take Place, the Charges are also unpaid, which is a Discouragement to Officers of the Forest in the Execution of their Duty. All Allowances of this Kind might be fixed by a Justice of Peace, in Proportion to the Trouble and Expence of Parties with Reference to some Fund.

It occurs further, in Answer to this Enquiry, to suggest that the Permission of Under Keepers for poor People to enter their Walks with Carts, for picking up dead Wood, is a great Detriment to the Timber. Under Pretence of buying and taking dead Wood, such Persons often lop large Trees, and destroy young Trees, concealing the green Wood under the dead Wood. The Owners of these Carts supply the Bakers and others in the neighbouring Towns with Wood j and it would be for the Benefit of the Forest to put them under such Restrictions as to prevent their Depredations. Within late Years it has been the Practice of mischievous Persons to burn the Heath, Fern, and Furze of the Forest, whereby young Trees are often destroyed; ar.>d some Law is wanting to punish severely this Offence, and to give Encouragement for Detection.

The many Cottages which have been unlawfully erected in the Forest are great Nuisancesj they harbour Persons who live by plundering xhe Forest. If it was determined by Act of Parliament that all such Erections built since some fixed Period Should be deemed unlawful, and an Order made for taking them down after proper Not ice, both the Timber and Deer would be better preserved. It is true that such Intruders are now liable to Prosecutions in the Exchequer, but a summary and less expensive Mode of Proceeding against Cottagers in Possession is wanted to prevent Litigation and Difficulty. These Buildings are now less frequently erected than they used to be, because the Keepers have been lately enjoined not to connive at them. Regular Returns of the Number of Cottages in each Walk would serve to prevent their Increase.

The Warrants above mentioned, in Answer to the 6th Enquiry, issued by the Under Steward for Repair Timber, agreeable to the Presentment of the Court, are executed with the Privity of the Deputy Surveyor of the Forest, and Purveyor, and other Officers, so that there can be no Excess in the Quantity or Quality of the Timber assigned; but it is suspected that more Timber is often presented than is necessary, and that when such Timber is assigned it is not always converted to the proper Uses. If therefore some Forest Officer was appointed to sign his Allowance of every

Presentment of Timber, before it was given in to the Under Steward holding the Court, and after the Assignment, to fee that it was properly converted, it might be the Means of preventing Abuses with respect to Repair Timber.

Ringwood, 29th June 1787. Under Steward.

In Addition to the above Answers and Observa-tiens, it appears to me, that Care in the Choice of proper Parts of the Forest for Inclosures, and great Attention to the Cultivation of Timber in such Inclosures, and preserving the Fences of the fame, are ef-' fencially necessary towards continuing a durable Supply of Timber from New j the Necessity of

which seems to be the greater, on Account of the Decrease of Timber belonging to private People, and of the Decline of private Nurseries for Timber.

Extracts of Two Letters from Richard Fezard Mansfield, Esquire, Under Steward of the New Forest-, dated Ringwood, 24th June and I2t|i July 1789. '

“ With respect to the Annual Amount of my Fees,

I have made as good a Calculation as lays in m-y Power, without having kept any particular Account of them for Ten Years past, and think that I may, on a moderate Computation, set the Annual Average Amount at £.80, which includes Official Business only, but no Kind of Crown Prosecutions, either fuel) as are paid by the Treasury, or summary Proceedings before Justices, nor any other Contingent Matters relative to the Forest, wherein I am consulted or concerned as an Attorney or Solicitor, though such Bu-finess of course arises from my Connection with the Forest. The Fee of £. 1. 5. is only paid for attending such Forest Courts; vSwanimote or Attachment, as are held or summoned, and does not extend to any particular Number which might be held according to the Laws of the Forest. It often happens that a Court is summoned, and an Attendance at Lyndhurst takes Place in Consequence, though no Court is held for Want of Two Verderors.”

24th June 1789.

ft The High Steward of New Forest has no Salary or Perquisites, except an old Annual Fee of 5 Guineas, which is paid by the Lord Warden, and a Fee Buck and Doe. It may be considered as a Sinecure Place, except that, when this Officer chuses it, he gives a Charge at the Swanimote Court. The Office is usually filled by a Barrister, and was formerly ah Office of great Honour.”

father having been Steward to the Duke of , as Lord Warden, coming with his Grace to reside in the Forest, about the Year One thousand and Seven hundred, and his Father having held the Office of Deputy Surveyor for many Years, and this Examinant being possessed of many of the Books and Papers belonging to each of these Offices, while they were executed by them, he has been thereby enabled to discover in what Manner the Business of the Forest was transacted in their Time, and to judge of the Changes which have taken Place since} that amongst other Books he has in his Possession an antient One, intituled, “ New Forest Fuel Book, 1725,” a Copy of which Book he has now delivered to the Commissioners of the Land Revenue, with a Column added to it, containing a List of the Fuel Wood now delivered, copied from the Accounts which he himself keeps as a Regarder; that he has also delivered to them a Survey of the growing Trees in this Forest fit for the Navy, taken in the Year 1707; and also Relit Rolls of th several Bailiwicks, Hundreds, and Tythings, for the Year 1705; and also a Rental Book, intituled, New Forest Rolls, Mich’ 1728 ;” also a List of the Keepers Nobles for the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Sixteen; and an Account between Francis Whitworth, Surveyor General, and his Deputy, for the Year 1738 and 1739, settled by Me Whitworth on the Seventeenth Day of July One thousand Seven hundred and Forty: That this Examinant did himself live in the Forest in the early Part of his Life, and was frequently employed in the Bu-finess of the Forest, and in copying Papers relative thereto, both by his Father, then Deputy Surveyor, and Mr. tiinxman,the High Woodward; and that in those

Times no Regarder held any other Office in the Forest, and that every Account of every other Officer of the Forest was submitted to their Examination, and am sted by Two or more of them, before it was admitted or passed; that when any Repairs were required for the Lodges or Outhouses of the Master or Linder Keepers, the Premisses were viewed by the Regarders hnd Deputy Surveyor, who signed a Representation of the Defects, and Necessity of Repairs; and that when the Order came from the Treasury for the Reparation, they attended to the Execution; and when the Work was Bnished it was again viewed by the Regarders, and the Undertaker was not discharged until they had signified their Approbation of the Execution of the Work: That it appears also to this Examinant, that all Sales in every Department within the Forest, whether of Wood, Lop, Top, or Bark, were at that Time public Sales by Auction; that the Regarders also attended the laying out of Inclosures, the making of Fences, and the planting of Acorns; that in general Four or more Regarders attended the marking of all Trees, cither for the Navy, Fuel, Repairs, or Sale; that in the Execution of these various Branches of their Duty they were then much more employed in going through the different Parts of the Forest than they now are, and had much better Opportunity of discovering or preventing Offences than they now have; that it was their Cullom, when they found any Trees or Wood improperly cut, to have it carried immediately to the

Keeper in whose Walk it was found; and when they discovered any Person guilty of a Trespass, to seize them immediately, and present them at the next Attachment Court, and that their Expences incurred in so doing were re-paid to them by the Deputy Surveyor} that the Business in this Forest is not now carried on in the same Manner; that the Four mod: executive Officers, being the Deputy Surveyor, Purveyor of the Navy, the Deputy Woodward, and the Lord Warden’s Steward, are all Regarders; and that though each of these Officers attends to the felling of Timber within his own Department, yet it is not the Custom of the Deputy Woodward to attend as a Regarder when Timber is felled for the Navy, either in the Deputy Surveyor’s or Lord Warden’s Departments; nor does the Deputy Surveyor usually attend when Trees are felled for Fuel or Repairs, under the Direction of the Deputy Woodward, or when the Navy Timber is felled, under the Direction of the Lord Warden’s Steward, although they pay to eafch other the common Allowance of Two Shillings and Six Pence per Day, in the same Manner as if due Attendance was given; and that more than One Day’s previous Notice is seldom given to other Regarders to attend, either by the Deputy Surveyor, Deputy Woodward, or Lord Warden’s Steward, when any Trees are to be felled; that the Regarders are not now called out on any other Duty than that of marking or felling of Trees; that no Account whatever of any Officer has been submitted to their Examination since his Appointment, except the Accounts of the Sales of the Tops of Naval Timber, and the Accounts of the Allowances or Wages to the Regarders; that they have not been called upon to view Lodges for which Repairs are demanded, nor to inspect the Execution of the Work after they have been repaired; that they have not for the last Twenty Years, as he has heard and believes, been desired to attend the laying out Inclosures, making Fences, or planting Acorns; and that no Regarder has any Superintendance on those who are now employed in planting the vacant Places in the Inclosures, or in the Reparation of the Fences; and that this Examinant has been informed by the Deputy Surveyor, that any Prosecution against those who have made small Incroachments on the Forest, or who have been guilty of Trespasses on the Vert or Venison, must be laid out by the Regarders themselves, as he has no Authority to re-pay them; that the Regarders are by these Means deprived of the Opportunity and the Power of preventing Offences, or of bringing Offenders to Punishment; and that both the great Officers in the Forest, and the Inhabitants of lower Rank, now take Liberties in making Incroachments, in cutting of F’ern, Furze, and Turf, in improper Places, which he is of Opinion they would not venture upon if the Regarders were permitted and encouraged to act as formerly. And this Examinant further faith. That the Fuel Wood, which is assigned as formerly, is not now consumed as Fuel, but that great Part of it is fold for Trucks, Rails, Card"Boards, and other Purposes; that when Trees are assigned for Fuel, no Time is positively fixed for cutting them down, or carrying them away, and that being left to the Discretion of the Persons to whom they are assigned, no Officer of the Forest has Notice so as to guard against the cutting down other Trees besides those allotted, and that he knows such Offences have oftentimes been committed; that since the Appointment of the present Deputy Surveyor the Bark of Naval Trees has generally been fold privately, and that the Lop and Top have been sold by public Auction, but that the cutting oft' the Tops has beeh left to be done by the Purchaser, which he thinks leaves Room for Abides, which are not sufficiently guarded against by the Tree having been previously rased by the Purveyor, more especially as the Persons employed tQ rafe them off by the Purveyor are generally concerned in the Purchase; and this Examinant has Reason to believe that Knees of Timber have frequently been carried away by the Purchasers of the Tops: That the Bark of the Three hundred and Seventy Loads of NavalTimber, under the Direction of the Lord Warden’s Deputy, is not sold by public Auction, but that the Lops and Tops are fold publicly; that the Tops and Lops are cut and disposed of in the same Manner as those under the Direction of the Surveyor; that the Bark, Lops, and Tops of the Repair Timber are fold privately; that from the Want of a proper Check upon the Application of the Repair Timber to the Purpose for which it was assigned, this Examinant has Reason to believe that a great deal is otherwise disposed of, and that the Repairs not being effectually made, fresh Application is in a few Years made for an additional Quantity, and the Request has too often been granted; that the Keepers, as well as the Regarders, are prevented from presenting Offences, no Courts of Attachment or Swanimote being now held, and they are discouraged from prosecuting Offenders before a Justice of the Peace, by Means of the great Expence of such Prosecutions, and the Uncertainty of Re-payment in case the Offenders Should not be convicted, the Expence thereof for the most trivial Offence being at least Thirty Shillings; and that they are less rigid in preventing small Incroachments, Intrusions, and Trespasses, from an Apprehension that the People, if irritated, might set fire to the Cover, and endanger the Forest; that this has frequently been done, and as the Detedion is difficult, the Punishment Should be made more severe, and some Reward given for the Discovery of the Offenders; that the cutting of Fern, Furze, and Browse Wood, the Deer themselves, and the Admission of Colts at all Seasons, are extremely detrimental to the Growth of young Trees ;and that considerable Injury is often done by the Colliers, who have ah Opportunity of cutting or lopping Trees near their Coal Hearths, without Risk of Detection; that the Forest Should be cleared of Colts, Cattle, and Swine, during the Fence Month and Winter Haining; and that the Marksmen Should, at their Drifts, be obliged to give up the Names of the Proprietors of Cattle under their Care, on Oath, so as the Intrusion of Cattle belonging to People who have no Right to Common might be prevented; and that this Examinant is of Opinion that the Pounds, and the different Bridges in the Forest, Should be repaired.

The Answer of John Richard Earl De Matter Keeper of Bolderwood and Walks, in New Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated the ift Day of June 1787.

Lord De Lawarr was appointed Matter Keeper of Bolderwood and Eyeworth Walks, in the New Forest, by the Lord Warden, during Pleasure. The Duty of his Office is to preserve the Vert and Venison; he receives no Salary by virtue of his Office, nor any Emoluments, save Two Bucks from each Walk; he occupies Bolderwood Lodge, which is in very'good Repair, and about Twenty-seven Acres of Meadow Ground thereto adjoining; there is also a Keeper’s Lodge in each Walk, and about Nine Acres of Land, occupied by the Groom Keeper of Bolderwood, and afymt Three or Four Acres by the other Groom Keeper; he receives 15 Loads of Fuel Wood for the Consumption of Bolderwood Lodge, and there is also Vot. XLIV.

an Allowance for the Keepers Lodges: There may be 6 or 700 Deer of all Kinds in Bolderwood , and perhaps aoo or 450 in Eyeworth Walk. He executes no Warrants but for the l Bucks for each Walk before-mentioned. The Keepers report Annually what Number of Bucks they can afford to kill in each Walk to the Steward of the Forest, and the Warden issues his Warrant accordingly. No Food is bought for the Deer. He knows not of any Intrusions or Incroachments in the Walks of Bolderwood and Eyeworth: There are many Abuses in the Forest; and the Increase of Timber would undoubtedly be promoted if it was not thought necessary to cut the Thorns for the Use of the Deer, and if the Hogs could be kept out of the Forest, or if they were all ringed, but must leave it to others to point out the proper Remedy for the various Abuses that exist there*

The Answer of Peter Batburst, Esquire, Master Keeper of Broomey Walk, in the New Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated the ift of June 1787.

As Matter Keeper he is sworn to take Care of the Vert and Venison; he is appointed by Warrant from the Duke of Gloucester, during Pleasure; has no Salary, Fees, or Emoluments, but the Privilege of killing small Game'in the Walk, and a Brace of Bucks Annually, for which he pays the usual Fees to the Keeper, being a Guinea and a Crown each Buck; a Brace of Does are also the Right of the Matter Keeper, but, by Delire of the Duke o are not taken.

There is a Lodge called Broomy Lodge, in which there-is an Apartgipnt of Kitchen, Parlour, and Two Bedchambers, for th^ Matter Keeper; the Building is said to have cost 6 or 700 Yen Years ago, but ought not to have cost above £.100, with the old Materials. He does not know what Timber or Wood, is cut in the Forest, and he receives none for any Purpose whatever. He supposes there are about or 500 Deer in his Walk. The Under Keeper reports Annually what Number may be killed, and on that Report the Duke of Gloucester's Steward makes out the Venison Warrants. No Hay, Corn, or other Food is purchased for the Deer; they are fed with Browse from the Holly, Thorn, or Alh. He does not think that any material Incroachments have been made in his Walk lince he was appointed Matter Keeper; when he has been informed that any has been begun, he has always directed the Groom Keeper to report the same to the Verderors, and the Fence has been taken down. He refitted a Claim made under the Name of Ogden's Purlieu, and the Claim was given up. He believes a great deal of Watte has been committed, but cannot point out how it is to be guarded against. .

The Answer of Nathaniel , Esquire, Master

Keeper of Rhinefield and Wilverley , and Deputy to the Lord Warden of New , to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated ift June 1787.

I consider myself as holding Two Offices, One as Master Keeper, the other as Deputy to the Lord Warden. The Duty of Master Keeper is to be a Check upon the Proceedings of the Groom Keeper, who is charged with the Preservation (as far as in his Power) of the Timber, Venison, and Game, and to prevent Incroachments.

The Duty of the Deputy to the Lord Warden is to superintend the Whole, to be careful to make the Groom Keepers do their Duty, who report their Proceedings to him, and to attend to all Transactions in the Forest.

I am appointed by the Lord Warden, during Pleasure.

I have no Salary whatever, either as Master Keeper or Deputy to the Lord Warden.

As Master Keeper of RhinefieI occupy the Lodge, with a small Inclosure round the House, of very little Value.

Of the Timber cut on Account of the Lord Warden’s Contract, I am, as Deputy to the Lord Warden, to give an Account. That Contract was made for Twenty Years, and ends in April 1789; it was made for the Payment of the Keepers Salaries, as well as that of the Woodward and his Deputy, and all other incidental Charges in executing the Business of the Forest. The Quantity for that Contract amounts to 370 Loads of Oak Timber, and 50 Beech Trees, for the Dock Yard; which in general produces about £. 900; and there is also a small Sum raised from the Tops and Bark of the said Timber, all which Tops, &c. arc sold by public Auction, and brought to Account for the Payment of Taxes and other Charges at the King’s House at Lyndburst. The Accounts for the above Sums are dated Annually, which, together with the Vouchers, are ready when called for.

The Quantity of Timber usually cut by the Surveyor General is 500 Loads of Oak, and Fifty Beech Trees; the Quantity for Fuel is about 800 Loads; the Timber for Repairs uncertain.

The Disposition of the Venison has at alL Times been made by the Order of the Lord Warden.

The exatt Number of Deer cannot be ascertained, as they range at full Liberty all over the Forest; the Increase however is certainly very great, which is owing to a strict Observance of the Lord Warden’s Orders to preserve the Does; for when he was first appointed, we found very few Bucks fit to kill, so much so, that the preceding Lord Warden obtained an Order from the Lords of the Treasury, that no Does Should be killed for Five Years; at the Expiration of which Time the Increase was not found iuffi-cient, and the present Warden continued Orders to the Keepers not to kill any, except Four Brace for His Majesty’s Use, and they are in general not fat or fit to kill, owing to having no Allowance for Hay or other Feed in the Winter.

The Return of Bucks this Year amounts to Seventy-nine Brace and a Half, which greatly exceeds any Return for the last Forty Years; they are difpqfed as follows:

For His Majesty’s and the Cofferer’s Office 23 Brace; for Compositions to Gentlemen: who have Woods and Estates upon the Borders, for Leave to the Keepers to range their Woods, Eleven Brace; the Annual Warrants to the Verderors, the Master' Keepers, and other Warrants, for Justices of the Peace who act for the Forest, and other Gentlemen, which have been at all Times given by old Custom,’ amount in the Whole to 64'Brace: It may be proper to observe, that: Eight or Ten Brace is generally kept back, as we have often found the Keepers return more than they can kill, without hurting their Walks; the rest are reserved as usual, for the Presents from the Lord Warden, if he chuses to make ahy.

All Offenders for Intrusions, &c. are brought before the Verderors Courts, and are upon Record. - The Law Steward (Mr. Mansfield, of,) can give

the Particulars, as he holds those Courts. '

No Abuses, or Spoil, or Waste have lately been reported to me; no Doubt such Things happen, but what Power we have is exerted as much as possible to prevent them.

There may, without Doubt, be many Regulations made which would be of great Advantage to His Majesty’s Timber and Estate; such. as Inclosures for the Growth, made in good Soil, and nqt too large for the InspedHop of the Keepers in whose Walks they are made. The last Inclosures are vastly too large, and placed in very improper Soil, which is the Reason many of them did not succeed.

The cutting the Fern must certainly destroy many young Trees.

To prevent strange Cattle being driven upon the Commonage.

An Allowance for Hay in the Winter for the Deer wotild make the browsing unnecessary, which would preserve the Brush and Underwood, and of course raise a great many young Trees.

The Browse is taken from Boughs and Branches of different Kind of Underwood; from long Observation I am convinced this last Measure would be of the greatest Utility.

The repairing the Bridges and Passages over the Bogs would facilitate the Keepers Duty; by keeping open the Communication from one Part to another, they could more easily prevent Smugglers and Stragglers from committing Outrages in their Walks; formerly that was much attended to, and it is not for Want of representing that they are not properly reoaired at present.

endeavoured to the utmost of his Power to prevent all Injuries to the Forest, but has never presented any Offences at the F'oreft Counts, the Keepers under the Duke of Bolton not having attended the Courts within his Remembrance: That there are no Rabbit Warrens within his Walk, but many Rabbits in the open Parts; that no Orders were ever given to him to destroy them: That all Kinds of Cattle are admitted into his Walks; and that the Tenants of Burley claim a Right to a Sheep Walk in that Part of the- Forest, and turn in Sheep accordingly': That he is unable to distinguish between the Cattle of Commoners and Strangers: That each Person’s Cattle are marked with a particular

lar Ear Mark, but that there are Men called Marks-men, who take Charge of any Cattle sent to them, and attend them in the Forest, and put a general Tail Mark on all that are under their Care, and own them when the Forest is driven; and he is of Opinion that Cattle belonging to Persons who have no Right of Common are brought into the Forest: That in other Pam of the Forest the Keepers receive One Penny per Mark for the Cattle of each Owner j but neither of his Walks have been driven for Horned Cattle lince his Appointment, the Pound being so much out of Repair as not to confine them: That Horned Cattle are generally put into the Forest about Old and taken out about Michaelmas, as the Owners think fit, but Forest Horses and Asses remain in all the Year, and do great Mischief to the young Timber and Cover: That the Forest has not been cleared during the Fence Month since his Appointment, or within his Remembrance: That Swine are admitted into the Forest from the Fourteenth of othe Eleventh

of November, Old Stile; and those taken into Burley

Walk are admitted by this Examinant, who gives a Ticket to the Owner, expressing the Number admitted, which is called Ovafling, on paying him Four Pence for every Hog, and Two Pence for every Pig, for the Pannage, for the Use of the Matter Keeper. That he drives his own Walks as often as he thinks proper for Swine, to fee that they are properly ringed, and demands Four Pence each for all that are unringed. That the Profits arising to him from the Pannage and all the Drivings are seldom sufficient to defray the Expence attending it.

That he has presented every Incroachment made within his Walk since his Appointment, and Orders have sometimes been issued for throwing them open; but that all or most of] the Incroachments have been continued, for Want of the Courts being regularly held, and their Orders being strictly executed.

That there is One Inclo sure within his Walk, callee Sloderr Inclosure, containing about 250 Acres, made in the Year 1772, in which are a great Number of young Oak and Alh Trees, well protestec with Thorns, which Trees require thinning; and also some bare Places of considerable Extent, very wet and boggy which should be drained anc planted — That the Fences o the said Inclosure are so much out of Repair as to admit the Deer and Cattle — That the said Inclosure is under the Care of Flower Archurch.

That there are 3 or small Incroachments within his Walk, made before he was appointed Keeper, but not one has been made since his Appointment.

That there is One Inclosure within his Walk, called Pitt's Inclosure, containing about lao Acres, made in the Year

1772, in which arc a great Number of youngOaks which require thinning, and some bare Places which should be planted; but the Fences are io much out of Repair that he cannot keep out the Deer and Cattle, which he has repeatedly represented to the Deputy Surveyor, but without Effedfc. — -That at the Time his Lodge was re-built, in

1773, the old Pales of the Lodge Garden were taken down and sold by Mr. -bert, then Deputy Surveyor, who told him that he should have another Garden inclosed; and that he had set down in the Estimate the C harge of putting up 18 Lugs (or Perches) of new Paling for the Garden, but that not One Pale has yet been put up.

That he has presented at the Forest Courts every Incroachment made within his Walk since his Appointment, and Orders have sometimes been issued for throwing them open j but that all or most of the Incroachments have been continued, for Want of the Courts being regularly held, and their Orders being ftri£Uy executed.

That the Inclosure called Wiherley was completed in the Spring of the Year in which he was appointed Keeper; that he was inforimed that, before planting the Acorns, the Underwood was entirely cut down and fold j that the Acorns had been kept too long, and were grown before they were planted, and were planted in Rows, as he thinks, a Lug or Perch distant from each other, a Man going along each Row with a Hoe, with which, at every Second Step, he raised a Sod and put in an Acorn, prelfing the Sod down upon it with his Foot — That no young Tree ever got up in the Inclosure.

Browfewood.

William Cooper.

That the cutting of Fejrn is much practised, and is very de-stru&ive to the young Timber. Th3t he never presented any Person for cutting Furze, having very little in his Walk, nor for cutting Fern, as he observed that the Verderors, Mailer Keepers, and other Officers of the Forelt, cut Fern themselves, though he believes no Person has a Right to cut it.

Thomas Toomcf, Sebior.

That the cutting of Furze and Fern is very much praflifed, and is very destructive to the young Timber, but he has not presented any Person for cutting the fame, having never received any Orders from the Verderors or other Officers, or from the Court, for that Purpose, but he has always been informed and believes that no Person has a Right to cut either Fern or Furze in the Forest.

That he Annually cuts as rpuch Browfewood for the Deer as he thinks necessary, and in such Places as he thinks proper, chiefly from the Tops of Hollies and Thorns. That if the Browse be cut from the Tops of Hollies only, and in a proper Manner, he does not think it prejudicial to the Fo rest, but the cutting of Thorns and the lower Branches of Hollies he thinks detrimental to the Growth of Timber, by destroying the Cover which protects the young Trees and Shoots; but that he thinks Browling necessary for the Sufte-nance of the Deer in Winter j and that if a Stop was put to the cutting of Browfewood, it would require about Loads of Hay Yearly (worth about £. 12) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk. — That he also thinks that the Deer do some Damage to the young Timber and , Cover, by cropping the Shoots.

Anthony Bumpjlead.

That the cutting of Fern and Furze is much practised, and is very de-(Irudlive to the young Timber. — That he has frequently presented Perrons for. cutting Furze, and that the Offenders h^ve been sometimes.fln-ed, but that he has not made any Preferments for cutting Fern, as he observed that the Verderors and leading Men in the Forest had Fern cut for their own Use, though he believes no Person has a Right to cut it.

To the same Effect — and that if a Stop was put to the cutting of Browfewood,there would be required about 18 Loads of Hay Yearly (worth about jT. 54) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk.

The like — and that if a Stop was put to the cutting of Browfewood, there would be. required about Loads and f of Hay Yearly( worth about 13. 1 or.) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk.

Thomas Toomer, Junior.

That the cutting of Fern and Furze is much praflifed, and is very de-struftive to the young Timber. — That he has frequently seized the Hooks of the Cutters, has often applied to Mr. Mansfield for Advice how to proceed against them, and would have presented them, if there had been Courts.

Edward Toomer.

That the cutting of Fern and Furze is much practised, and is very destrudliye to the young Timber. That he has often seized the Hooks of the Cutters, and has sometimes presented those Offences at the Courts of Attachment, but the Offenders were not punished, and are now, on that Account, become bolder, and cannot be restrained by him.

The like — -and that if a Stop was put to the cutting of Browfewood, it . would require about 3 Tons of Hay Yearly for each 100 Deer (worth about^.45) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk.

That he Annually cuts as much Browfewood for the Deer as he thinks necessary, and in such Places as he thinks proper, chiefly from the Tops of Hollies anc Thorns. — Admits that the cutting of Browse does Harm to the Growth of Timber, by destroying the Cover which protects the young Trees and Shoots j but he thinks browsing necessary for the Suite nance of the Deer in Winter; anc that if a Stop was put to the cut ting of Browfewood, it would require about 3 Tons of Hay Yearly for each 100 Deer (worth about £. 90) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk.

James Mantell.

That the cutting of Thorns, urze, and Fern is very mucbprac-tifed in his Walk, both in the Covers and open Parts, which is very destructive to the young Timber. — That he has forbid and presented many Persons at the Forest Courts for cutting Thorns and urze, but that no effectual Means have been used to prevent the lame; and that the Courts not having been regularly held for 2 or 3 Years past, the Practice continues with Impunity, and is much increased. — That he has not presented any Person for cutting Fern, as le observed that the Verderors, Matter Keepers, and other Officers of the Forest, cut Fern themselves, though he has always heard and aelieves that no Person has a Right to cut it.

UT»

sO

4*

To the like Effect — and that if a Stop was put to the cutting of Browfewood, it would require about 8 Loads of Hay Yearly (worth about 24) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk. — And he thinks that the feeding with Hay would be better for the young Deer than Browsing. — That there is, in his Opinion, a greater Stock of Deer than the Forest can well maintain, many die Yearly in the Winter, and in his Walk only not less than 300 died last Year of the Young and Female Deer which do not come to browse.

Fuel Wood. ' That there has been no Fuel Wood cut in his Walk for 6 or 7 Years past. — That when Fuel Wood was cut there, he always attended both the marking smd felling of such Wood, to take Care fhat no more was cut than was assigned. i j i 1 1 \ i i , 1 j < 1 . That there has not been any Fuel Wood cut in his Walk since his Appointment. \ That there has been no Fuel Wood cut in his Walk since his Appointment, except what was assigned to him (to the Value of about £. to a Year) before he received an Allowance for it in Money. That there has been no Fuel Wood cut in his Walk for above 7 Years past. That there has been Fuel Wood cut in his Walk for every Year since his Appointment, and that he has always taken all the Care in his Power to prevent any from being cut that was not assigned; £ut that those to whom Fuel Trees are assigned have great Opportunity of cutting other Trees besides those allotted for them, from their being fixed to no Time, either for cutting their Fuel Trees, or for carrying them away after being cut, and by having it in their Power to cut and remove them in the Absence of the Keeper or Fo-rest Officers. That he did discover One who had cut 3 Trees not assigned to him, and that he carried him before Mr. Compton, a Justice of Peace, by whom the Person'was fined, this Examinant receiving £. 10 out of the Fine imposed, for himself and Servant. That the Fuel Wood cut In his Walk is from 40 to 50 Loads Yearly, by Assignment of the Pur- W. veyor, Woodward, and Regarders.

Rabbits.

William Cooper.

Thomas Toomer, Senior.

That there are no Rabbit Warrens in his Walk, but a great Number of Rabbits in the open Parts where no Timber is growing. — That Orders were given to him to destroy them, about Two Years ago, by General Bathurst his Matter Keeper, and by Colonel I ley wood, Deputy to the Lord Warden, in consequence of which he continued to destroy them as long as the Value of the Rabbits caught would defray the Expence of taking them j but that no Allowance being made to him for that Expence, he was obliged to desist.

Anthony Bu

That there are no Rabbit Warrens in his Walk, but a Number of Rabbits chiefly in the Inclosure called closure, and some in the open Parts. That they do at least as much Damage to his Garden and his Com, when he sows any, as the Value of the Profit he derives from them. That he never received any Orders for destroying them, but believes they might be destroyed by killing them in the Breeding Season } and he is ready to execute any Orders for that Purpose, on being paid the Expence attending it.

Thomas Toomer, Junior.

That there were many Rabbits in Wilverley before and at the Time of planting the Acorns; that he never heard of any Attempt having been made at that Time to destroy them, but thinks they are since increased in Number. That about 2 Years ago some People, employed he believes by the late Surveyor General, came into his Walk, and j>e-gan to destroy the Rabbits. That he thought it extremely, hard, if they were to be destroyed, that he Should be deprived of the Benefit of destroying the m. That he understood from the Undertakers themselves, that they were to be allowed the Rabbits for their Payment, as long as they could earn sufficient Wages thereby; and that, when the Numbers Should be much reduced, they were to be paid for destroying the Remainder by Mr. Pitt, and had engaged to destroy the Whole in 3 Years; that he thereupon went to the Deputy Surveyor, and offered to destroy the Rabbits in less Time and for the same Allowance, but was told by the Deputy Surveyor, that the Men must proceed according to Mr. Pitt’s Directions. That soon after this, he found a Fawn caught in One of the Traps

That there were many Rabbits in the Inclosures within j his Walk, before and at the' Time of planting the Acorns. That he never heard of any Attempt having been made at that Time to destroy them, and does not believe they are more numerous now than they then were. That about Michaelmas 1786 he wak dc-fired by the late Surveyor General, Mr. Pitt, to destroy the Rabbits in his Walk; Mr. Pitt promising at the fame; Time to get an Equivalent! for him from the Treasuryj for the Profit of the Rabbits of which he would be deprived. — That the Examinant did accordingly destroy great Numbers, and brought the Number lower than he believes they ever had before been within the Memory of Man. That finding the Expence great, he went to London, in order to state the Circumstances to Mr. Pitt, but found that he died just before his Arrival; that from that Time he desisted, no Person having engaged to repay the Expence he must have incurred by proceeding. That they are since considerably increased, but not yet so numerous as before he began to destroy them. The Examinant admits that the Rabbits do Harm to young

Thar there are no Rabbit Warrens in his Walk, but that when he was appointed Keeper, there was a great Number of Rabbits in the open Parts near his Lodge, but he has used his best Endeavours to destroy them in consequence of Orders -from Lord Delawahis Matter Keeper, and the Deputy Surveyor, and has succeeded so well, that there arc very few now remaining, and he believes he shall destroy them entirely in the Course of this Winter and the ensuing Spring. 4*

That he admits all Kinds of Cattle (except Geese, Goats, and SheeT.) That he is unable to distinguish between the Cattle of Commoners and Strangers. — That each Person’s Cattle are distinguished by a particular Ear Mark; but that there are Men, called Marksmen, who take Charge of any Cattle sent to them, and attend them in the Forest, and put a general Tail Mark on all that are under their Care, and own them when the Forest is driven} that the Marksmen pay him Mark for all the Cattle of each separate Owner, and he receives i j. each for all Cattle that are not Ear-marked, if belonging to Commoners: and after driving, the Cattle are generally turned again into the Forest.

That he Annually cuts as much Browfewood for the Deer as he thinks necessary, according to the Mildness or Severity of the Season, and in such Places as he thinks proper, chiefly from the Tops of Hollies and Thorns. — (And speaks further to the like Effect as the other Examinants.)

1 And that if a Stop was put to the cutting of Browse-wood, it would require about 7 or 8 Loads of Hay Yearly (worth about £ 44) to feed the Deer with, in his Walk.

That the cutting of Fern, both in the Woods and open Parts, is very much practised, and is very destructive to the young Timber, but he has not presented any Person for cutting the fame, having never received any Orders from the Verderors, or other Officers, or from the Court, for that Purpose, and having also observed that some of the principal Forest Officers cut Fern themselves; but he believes that no Person has a Right to cut Fern in the Forest.

Extra# of a Letter from John late Duke of

ford’,late Lord Warden of the New Forest, to the Lords of the Treasury; dated September 29th 1768.

I must now state to your Lordships the radical Evil I have long complained of, and which, if not dera-

cinated, must finally put an End to this great and noble Forest, the properest by the Aptness of its Soil for the Growth of Timber, and by its Vicinity to mouth, to supply the Royal Navy with fine and valuable Timber. The Annual Charges which have hitherto been borne by Sales of Timber Yearly made in the Forest, to raise Money for the following Purposes, are these viz.

The Woodward’s Salary, per Annum — —

The Groomkeepers, Rangers, &c. — —

My Salary, as Housekeeper at Lyndbttrft — —

The Keepers, Nobles, and Incidentals —

Repairs of the Bridges, Forest Pounds, &c. amounting, coibus amis, to

£. aoo -

300 ——

.70 — —

57 ——

60 ——

£. 687 - -

The Sum of £. 687 is Annually defrayed by Sales of Timber made for that Purpose; and, though to raise no larger a Sum, yet, on Account of Perquisites of Bark, Lop and Top, &c. occasions a Loss to His Majesty of at least Double (if not Treble) the Sum intended to be raised, and consequently occasions much Waste of Timber. The Forest likewise bears in the same Way the Expence of new building and repairing all the Lodges of the Master and Under Keepers, the Repairs of the King’s House and Stables at Lyndburst,supporting the Rails round the Lodges,

which at this Time will amount, as appears by an Estimate I have caused to be made by a (kilful Workman, to at least the Sum of 1,800: The Fuel allowed to the Master and Under Keepers, which allotted to them Yearly would amount, if fold, to the Value of about £. 130, and is likewise taken Yearly out of the Forest, under the like Disadvantage of Perquisites, as the aforegoing Sums. All this makes so great a Charge upon the Forest that it is impossible it mould, in its declining State, be long able to support it. To remedy which, I mal/e this Propofai, for your Lordships’ Consideration.

The Board of Treasury has at present (as I am informed) a Contract with the Navy Beard, to fumilh out of New Forest 500 Loads of Oak Timber Annually, at £. 1. 18 per Load, to be approved as fit for His Majesty’s Navy by the Purveyor. The Price that must be given to the Merchant for Timber of like Goodness (could it be found) would be from

£. 3. 10 to £.3. 15 per Load} the Bonus given to the Navy is consequently from /. 1. 12 to i. 17 per Load5 the Money arising from this Sale being £. 950, is paid into the King’s Exchequer. It is not proposed by me to touch this Sum, or jmy Part of it, but to make for the Service of the Forest another Contract with the Navy Board for 350 Loads more of Oak Timber Annually, at £. per Load, which will give a Bonus to the Navy of at least 1. 10 per Load, which will produce £. 700 a Year, as all Charges of Purveyorship and Perquisites may justly be taken off, as no Person’s Place will be diminished, this being an Overplus of Timber of what has been hitherto furnished for the Navy. 1 take upon me to allure your Lordships, that there is a Sufficiency in the Forest, of the Sort of Timber which is full ripe, to afford cutting this Quantity for 80 or 100 Years, before which Time other Timber will come in Succession. Fifty Beeches at £. 1. 11 are likewise by the present Contract furnished to the Navy, the Amount of which is likewise paid into the Exchequer, and I propose that 50 more Beech may be furnished at the same Price (which may very well be spared) and will amount at least to £. 200; this Sum, with the £. 700 proposed to be raised by the Contract for the additional Oak Timber, will amount to £. 900 Annually; which I propose should be applied for the Use of the Forest, in lieu of those Sums now raised by Sales of Timber, in the following Manner:

The Housekeeper at Lyndburst’s Salary The Woodward’s Salary —

His Deputy, in lieu of Perquisites

The Groomkeepers, See. — -

Keepers Nobles, and Incidentals Addition of £. 10 per Annum to each Under Keeper, in lieu of Fuel — £. 2 per Annum to each Keeper to keep his Premilfes in Repair, under In speftion of the Lord Warden ——

70 ——

200 ——

50 ——

300 ——

57 ——

130 ——

26 ——

£ 833 -

This Sum of £. 833 is ptoposed to be defrayed out of the £. 900 to be raised upon the new Contract with the Navy Board, and the Residue (if any) to be paid into the Exchequer. I have proposed the Addition of £.10 per Annum to each of the Under or Groomkeepers (as they are called in the Forest) in lieu of Fuel, as I know that what is allowed them for Fuel amounts to as great a Sum, and costs the Forest much more. The £. 2 per Annum for keeping the Premisses in Repair is likewise proposed on an ceconomical Principle, and will be sufficient, when their Lodges are once put in Repair, to keep them Wind and Water tight.

When your Lordships are pleased to make any Assignments for raising Money for His Majesty’s Service uut of the Forest, I must refer to my former Letter 4

for the Measures I have there proposed for the preventing, as much as may be, those Abuses which have hitherto been practised.

I did in that Letter propose the making some new Inclosures for the raising up young Oak; but this has been so Ihamefully executed by those who were employed in, the doing it, without any Intervention of mine, that, though the Inclosures have been perfe#ly well, and very expensively fenced off for above Thirteen Years past, there is not the least Appearance of Timber coming up, nor could I fee even One single Oak in the Compass of several Hundred Acres } the Acorns having been ftrowed only upon the Ling and other Trumpery which covered the Ground, without plowing it} by which Means it remains now a good Covert for Pheasants, for which Purpose I believe it

was

6i2 24° JA. 1780.

was intended by those who had the Management in the setting it out, and no other, except it might be for a Pretence of cutting a large Quantity of Timber for the fencing it. There are, I think. Three of the Inclosures which I propole to your Lordships Should be re-foWn with Acorns, after having been prepared for it by taking off One Crop of Oats.

The Examination of Thomas Nichols, Gentleman, Purveyor of Portsmouth Dock Yard, and One of the Regarders of the New; taken on Oath, the 25th Day of November 1788.

This Examinant was appointed -Purveyor of Portsmouth Dock Yard in the Month of December 1782. — -By the Act of 9th and 10th 111. for the In-

crease and Preservation of Timber in the New it is Enacted, That whensoever any Wood or Timber shall at any Time or Times be directed to be felled in any Part of the said Forest, Two or more of the Ver-derors, and Four or more of the Regarders of the said Forest, shall have Notice thereof, and the same shall be first viewed and allowed to be felled by a Commissioner or Officer of His Majesty’s Navy, and shall not' be cut or felled until such View and Allowance. This Duty is performed by the Purveyor of Portsmouth Yard for the Time being, who, in pursuance of the Directions of the Act, marks all Timber and Trees to be felled in the Forest for any Purpose whatever, in the Presence of the Deputy Surveyor or Woodward, and Three or more of the Regarders: The Timber to be felled for the Use of the Navy is first marked by him, with an Assistant Builder from Portsmouth Yard; and after the Felling, he rases off the Tops in the Presence of the Regarders, and reserves all Parts that may be fit for the Navy. He directs and attends the hewing of the Trees; and when hewn, gives Notice to the Commissioner at Portsmouth Yard, who again fends an Assistant Builder to survey and take up the Timber; and if upon such Survey any Trees are found unfit for Naval Use, they are rejected; the Timber which is approved is then delivered to the Purveyor by Indenture, expressing the Number and Quantity of the Trees. The Timber is conveyed from the Forest to the Dock Yard by Contraft, at the Charge of the Navy Board, and the Purveyor superintends and directs the Carriage of it to the Wharfs, and the loading of the Vessels; makes out Bills of Lading for the Direction of the Master of the Vessels in delivering, and the Storekeeper in receiving the Timber at the Yard; and when the whole Quantity taken up is delivered, he certifies the same to the Commissioner at the Yard, in order that Navy Bills for the Value of the Timber may be issued to the Lord Warden, the Surveyor General, or the Woodward.

When the Tops are rased (which is^marking the Trees where the Tops are to be cut off, reserving what is fit for the Navy) they are valued by the Regarders present, and afterwards sold by the Deputy Surveyor, and left to be cut oft' by the Purchasers. The cast Timber rejected on the Survey is also valued by the Regarders, and left for Sale under the Charge of the Deputy Surveyor. This is the Mode in which the Business has hitherto been carried on; but this Examinant begs Leave to lugged that there appears to him to be an Impropriety in leaving the Tops to be cut oft* by the Purchasers, and would recommend that they Should be cut off at the Expence of the Crown, it being almost impossible to prevent the Hewers from being secretly connected with the Purchasers; and he believes that Advantages have sometimes been taken of the Opportunities thereby

afforded of cutting off more than was intended to be sold.

He also marks all Timber or Trees to be felled for Repairs, or for'raising Money by Sale; views all Windfall Trees, and felefts such Parts thereof as are fit for Naval Use. These are also surveyed by the Assistant Builder, and afterwards sent to the Dock Yard, and Bills are issued for the same to the Surveyor General or the Woodward, under the Name off Casual Surveyor General’s, or Casual Woodward’s Timber: He likewise marks all Trees to be felled for Fuel, for which Purpose he felefts such ferubbed or defective Beech Trees only as are unfit or unlikely to become fit for the Navy, or such as impede the Growth of the Oak.: j;

He receives no Salary, Fee, Reward, Perquisite, or Emolument whatever, for the Business executed by him in the Forest as Purveyor, other than his ordinary Pay as. an Officer of Dock Yard,

except Eight Loads of Fuel Wood Yearly, of the Value of Four Pounds, or thereabouts, which his Predeceffols have usually received. ' .

This Examinant is also One of the Regarders of the New Forest, choseri in the Year 1784, by the Freeholders of the County. There are in all Twelve Regarders, whose Office is to view and value all Wood and Timber fold in the Forest, and attend the Sales; to attend the marking of all Trees to be felted for any Purpose whatever; to examine into and take Cognizance of all Trespasses and Offences committed in the Forest, and present them at the Forest Courts; ,to examine the Accounts of the Officers, and sign them, if they appear to be just. The Regarders have no Yearly Salary, but are paid Two Shillings and Six Pence per Day for every Day on which they attend any Business in the Forest, by the Officer to whose Department the Business belongs. There has uftially been one Fall of Naval Timber Yearly, under a Contraft: with the Lord Warden. All other Falls of Timber for the Navy, Repairs of Lodges or Fences, or for Sale, are under the Charge of the Surveyor General. The Timber felled under the Lord Warden’s Contraft is usually marked by this Examinant, with the Lord Warden’s Steward, who is one of the Regarders, in the Presence of others. The Deputy Surveyor attends the marking of the Naval and other Timber under his Charge; and the Deputy Woodward attends the assigning of Fuel Wood and Timber for Repairs of Copyhold Tenements; but though the Deputy Surveyor and Deputy Woodward are both Regarders, it has not been customary for the Deputy Surveyor to attend the marking of the Navy Timber for the Lord Warden, or the Fuel W'ood or Te- -nants Repair Timber, nor for the Deputy Woodward to attend the marking of any Naval Timber, unless they happened to be then in the Forest on other Occasions.

The Sorts of Timber (landing in the Forest are Oak and Beech. The Oak is of very different Qualities and Textures, owing to the Variety of Soils on which it grows, and to its being of several Species, and felled at different Ages; that which (lands too long, and is abused by lopping, is frequently fhaky, or otherwise considerably defective. Though the Oak flourishes bed in a rich, deep, loamy Soil, yet there are few Soils in the Forest where it does not grow, and to a large Size; and if felled in proper Time, and not abused, proves to be useful, good Timber; and no Timber that he has ever seen is in better Forms for Ship-building, or produces a greater Number of Knees of the bed Kind. The Causes which contribute to the Injury, and prevent the Growth and Propagation of Timber in the Forest, are, First, the de-struftive Practice of the Cottagers and others lopping and dealing the Trees in a most (hameful Manner, particularly about Cadnam, in Walk,

29 Geo. III. 240 Julii. 613

and Lyvdburjl, in Ironjhill Walk; the Tenants and of any Kind done in the Eoreft, the Estimates being

employed Workmen to perform the same accordingly, accounting to the Surveyor General for his Poundage of Five per Cent, on the Amount of such Estimates. It

has not been usual, since he has held the Office, for the previous Estimates to be made or delivered upon Oath, or for any of the Regarders or any other Person to be employed to overfec, inspect, or examine the Execution of the Works, or the Accounts of the Expences thereof, or for the Estimates or Accounts of such Works to be presented or examined at the Forest Courts. When Timber is wanted for performing such Works or Repairs, the Quantity which is usually specified in the Warrant is set out by the Purveyor of the Navy, in the Presence of the usual Number of Regarders. The Quantity is not delivered by Measure but by Estimation, and if any Surplus remains above what is actually used, this Examinant takes it for his own Use, as Part of the Allowance of the Estimate.

This Examinant sometimes attends on the assigning of Fuel Wood, but not often, as he lives at a great Distance from the Places where it is usually cut. The Sort of Wood cut for Fuel is Beech, such as is not likely to be fit for the Navy, but robs and damages the Oak. After it is assigned, the Parties make what Use of it they think fit} great Part of it is converted into Rails and Trucks, for the Use of the Coal Works at Newcastle, and is generally prepared for that Purpose in the Forest j no Time is limited for taking it aiyay, and no Officer of the Forest attends the felling of it, and he has seen Stools of Trees cut without having been marked, supposed to have been stolen by those employed in cutting the Fuel Wood} and he once seized a Tree so stolen, and the Offender was afterwards prosecuted, and fined for it.

There have been no new Inclosures made in the Forest since the Time of his Appointment, but he remembers that at that Time the Inclosures at

Wifoerley, and Aldridge Hill, were much infefted with Rabbits. He has been informed, that there were Rabbits in those Places at the Time of making the Inclosures, and that the Bullies which grew there were grubbed up at that Time; whatever young Trees have come up there, except-a few-in Rhinefield

Inclosure, have all been destroyed by the Rabbits, and the making the Inclosures in those Places seems to have answered no other Purpose than converting the Ground into fenced Warrens, and making Inclosures for the Keepers Cattle.

About the Year 1785, this Examinant, by the Direction of the late Surveyor General, brought Four Persons from Dorsetshire to destroy the Rabbits in the Forest. Those Persons destroyed a great Number during the Time they stayed there, and would have engaged to destroy the Whole, for the Profit of the Rabbits only 5 but the Keepers, who make considerable Profits from the Rabbits, fearing the y should lose that Advantage, gave every Opposition they could to the Men employed in destroying them, who were at length obliged to desist.

This Examinant is now employed in executing a Warrant from the Treasury, for repairing the Fences of an Inclosure, called Linwood Coppice, which was made about the Year 1772, but was wilfully set on Fire about Two Years ago, when above Eighty Acres of it were totally consumed. The Method followed by him in planting is to dig Pits or Beds about Two Feet broad, at the Distance of a Perch from each other, and to set Three or Four Acorns in each Bed, but without sowing Hawes, or planting Bullies, or any other Thing with them. The digging and planting is done by Contract, at per Acre, itie

cluding Acorns j and the new Fencing, which con-, fills of Polls, double Rails, and Pales, is done at 6s. 6d. per Rod, under the Inspection of this Exami-

nant. The Inclosures called Long Beech Hill, Raven’s Nejl, Sloden and Ashley Inclosures, are also included in the said Estimate and Warrant, and are to be repaired and re-planted in the same Manner; as are likewise the Inclosures called Rhinefield, and Aldridge

Hill Inclosures,but the latter is now so infefted with

Rabbits, that it can answer no useful Purpose to replant them till they are destroyed. The new fencing and planting of the Inclosures now under Repair }s done by Con trad, by one Isaac Sign, at the Prices above expressed; and this Examinant has no Profit from executing these Works, nor is any Poundage taken or to be taken thereon for the Use of the present Surveyor General; but for fupfcrintending the Execution of the Works comprized in the said Estimate this Examinant has an Allowance amounting to ^bout One hundred Pounds, exclusive of his ordinary Salary.

This Examinant has also received Orders to make Estimates of the Expence of repairing and re-planting all the other Inclosures in the Forest, the Fences of which have been for a considerable Time pall so much out of Repair as to admit the Deer and Cattle; this Examinant pot having been provided with Pales for making small Repairs, and having no Authority for making any Repairs without a Warrant from the Treasury, and thinking these small Repairs too trifling for an Application to the Surveyor General to procure a Warrant from the Treasury for that Purpose alone.

This Examinant is also One of the Regarders of the said Forest, chosen in or about the Year 1781, by the Freeholders of the County. The Duty of the Regarders he conceives to be to attend on the marking of all Trees to be felled in the Forest for any Purpose whatever, and to take Cognizance of any Offences or Trespasses committed in the Forest, and present the same at the Forest Courts. The Regarders have not any Yearly Salary; but are allowed is. 6d. per Day for every Day on which they actually attend any Business in the Forest, which is paid by the Officer in whose Department the Business is executed. It has not been usual for the Deputy Woodward to attend on the marking of Timber to be felled in the Surveyor General’s Department, nor for the Deputy Surveyor General to attend the marking of Fuel Wood or Tenants Repair Timber, which is in the Woodward’s Department, unless they happened to be in the Forest on other Business; but the Deputy1 Woodward being also a Regarder, it has been customary for this Examinant to pay him the Re-garder's Allowance, and to receive the like Allowance from him, in the same Manner as if they actually attended the whole Business in both Departments. The Fees or Allowances received by this Examinant as Regarder have amounted, one Year with another, to about £. 16 a Year. He admits that the Duty of the Office of Regarder is incompatible with that of any other Office of the Forest, the Regarders being intended as a Check on the Conduct of the other Forest Officers; but he doubts whether a sufficient Number of Regarders could be got to attend the Business of the Forest, if none of the Forest Officers were chosen Regarders, the Allowance of is. 6d. per Day being inadequate to the Trouble and Loss of Time, and often insufficient to defray the Charge of Horse Hire, and other Expences which the Regarders are put to in attending the Business of the Forest.

My Lords,

We, at the last Attachment Court held at Lynd-burjl the 3d Instant, received by the Surveyor Gene-7 S ral’s

A. 1789.

618 2 40

ral’s Deputy a Warrant from your Lordfnips for the raising jf. 1,372. 5 by decayed Stubbs, and for cut-

ting down 1,082 Loads of Timber for the Repair of several Lodges therein mentioned. We have respited entering the said Warrant in our Book, until we have acquainted your Lord ships, that at our lad Swani-mote Court, held the 14th Day of September last, the Regard did then present upon Oath, that the Drawing of the Inclosures, made by of Parliament, after the Manner lately done in the Inclosure in Rhinefield Walk, by taking away the Underwood and Covert, to be very prejudicial to the Growth of the young Timber.

We further pray Leave to observe, That in or about the Year 1704 several considerable Sums of Money were raised, and a large Quantity of Timber felled in the New Forest, for the like Reasons as set forth in the annexed Report; and all the Lodges and Rails said (by the then Surveyors) to be put in complete Repair for 20 Years; ever since which has been continual Supplies of Money and Timber in great Quantities, for the same Purpose, sufficient at lead to prevent all Manner of Delapidations, so that it is a Surprize to us to hear of so great a Demand all at Once.

Upon these and several like Reasons we think it a Duty incumbent upon us, to signify to your Lordships, we are doubtful that the Account of all the Wood Sales made in the Ne Forest do not come before your Lordships, as well those which are made by Order as those which are made by Officers ex Officio; and we are more than barely apprehensive that there is no fixed Method to the Auditor for the fame, nor any Counter Check upon such Officers, either for the duly charging them with the respective Value of such Wood Sales, or the due Performance of Work in Workmanlike Manner, but chiefly it is left to the good Will of the Officers.

The which as it has hitherto been very prejudicial to the New Forest, so it is demonstrably true, that if not remedied it mud tend to the Dedruftion thereof.

We are, with all Respect,

Verderors Memorial to the Lords of the Treasury, relative to Repairs ordered to be done at Burley and Ilolmejley Lodges, in New Forest.

To the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury.

The Memorial of Richard Mile, Esquire,' Sir Francis Seymour Pile, Baronet, and Jeremiah Cray, Esquire, Verderors of His Majesty’s Fored called New Forest, in the County of Southampton.

Setting forth,

That your Lordship’s Warrant of 28th May 1755, ordering Ilolmejley and Burle little Lodges to be repaired, and for that Purpose 309. 16. 10. to be raised by Sale of dotard and decayed Trees (exclusive of 197 Loads and 40 Feet of rough Timber) is now executing by the Deputy Surveyor in a most fraudulent, illegal, and dedruftive Manner, by cutting down Timber fit for His Majesty’s Navy, and by removing and disposing other Timber privately, before the same is measured or valued by the Regarders, contrary to the Statute of the 9th and 10th King William III. for the Increase and Preservation of Timber in the said Fored.

That the said Lodges in or about the Year 1734 were thoroughly repaired, and for that Purpose a large Sum of Money raised by Sale of dotard and decayed Trees; but since that Period the late and present Lessees of Burleigh Bailiwick, in and by their respective Grants thereof, undertook and expressly covenanted with His Majesty, at their own Costs and Charges, well and sufficiently to repair and uphold all the Lodges, Houses, Fences, and Inclosures, of and belonging to the said Bailiwick; and your Memoria-lids have now caused the said little Lodges to be carefully surveyed, and the Repairs there now wanting to be edimated by experienced Workmen of Probity and Judgment; and find that less than One Half as well of the said Sum of £.309. 16. 10. as also of the said 197 Loads and 40 Feet of rough Timber, will diffidently repair the said Lodges, and put them into proper and good Condition: Therefore your Memo-rialids are apprehensive that some Fraud and Imposition may have been practised in obtaining this Warrant from your Lordships.

That by the abusive Manner of executing such Warrants of late Years, and the great Wade and De-druftion lately made of the Timber in most Parts of the Fored, and especially in Burleigh Walk, by Deputies and Under Officers, and by their Connivances, and for their private Lucre, the said Fored is reduced to a ruinous Condition, is greatly impaired in its Timber, and hath been so drained of dotard and decayed Trees, that it is become the Practice in lieu thereof to cut down thriving and good Timber for all the Sales to raise Money in the said Fored; and in cutting down Timber to be employed in Works, greater Regard is had to the Lops, Tops, and Offal Wood, which the Under Officers, though by what Law or Right is unknown, call Perquisites, than to the Fitness of the Timber for the Purposes it is ordered; which, together with the Abuses above mentioned, if not forthwith remedied and prevented by proper Regulations, will soon inevitably destroy the Timber of the said Fored, to the great Prejudice of His Majesty’s Navy, and to the Diffionour of the Nation.

All which is humbly submitted.

Lyndburjl,

5th August, 1755.

To the Right honourable Sydney, Earl of Godolphin, Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain.

May it please your Lordship,

In Obedience to your Lordship’s Commands of the 19th June, we have taken a Survey of the Timber in the

New Forest, and do find therein about 12,000 Trees, which may prove fit for her Majesty’s Naval Service, all

of which, in our humble Opinions, may be felled within the Compass of Forty Years, by Three hundred each Year, without Prejudice to the Forest; there being so many young Trees which are not of sufficient Bigness to be useful in her Majesty’s Navy now, but will be grown up to proper Dimensions by the End of the Time propolcd for felling the before-mentioned Number, that the Forest will be then at least as well flocked with useful Timber as it is now, and by continuing the same Course may not only be always preserved, but improved.

There is in this Forest a considerable Number of large Beech Trees, some of which prove injurious to the young Oaks by growing too near them; of which, if One hundred were Annually spared to the Navy, they woukl be of very good Use therein, as well as an Advantage to the Growth of the young Timber.

We find also in the Forest a great Number of old Oaks, from the Limbs of which may be picked very useful Parts, as Knees, Standards, &c. (though the Bodies may be decayed) and therefore we propole, that

Fifty of the said old Trees Should be Annually cut down, and that such Parts as shall be found proper be applied

ap Geo. III. 140 Julii. 621

applied to Naval Service, which will also give more Room for young Timber to come up, and be no Disad- , vantage to her Majesty in the Disposal of the Offal-wood.

AH which is most humbly submitted to your Lordship's ConCderation.

EXTRACT from the Report of a Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to consider how His Majesty’s Navy may be better supplied with Timber.

6th May 1771. -As to a Survey of the Timber in the New Forest, taken in 1764.

Your Committee then proceeded to enquire into the State of the King’s Forests; and thereupon examined John Pitt, Esquire, Surveyor General of His Majesty’s Woods; who said, with, respect to the New Forest, That upon a very accurate Survey taken a few . Years ago, it appears, that there were upon that Forest *9,836 Oak Trees fit for the Navy, containing 36,66a Loads, about One-Third of which arc very prosperous, and none of them contain less than Feet of Timber; that there are also 7,104 Beech Trees, containing 13,114 Loads; and 1,743 defeflive Oaks for Sales, Fuel, or Building, rontaining 3,836 Loads; and that he reckons that the Trees fit for Naval Uses are between a Fourth and a Fifth Part of the Timber on the whole Forest.

From considering the present timbered State of the Forest, without any Regard to hoi* it may be.improved, I conceive that about aThoufand Loads of Oak Timber may be felled Annually for Naval Uses; which I judge would produce about 900 Loads of found, useful Timber, without being prejudicial or injurious to the Forest, as by this Stipulation it will take more than Fifty Year# to exhaoft the present Stock} at the Expire- tien of which Time, with any tolerable Degree of Care and Attention, I presume there would be a Succession of an equal, if not a greater Quantity, of Naval'Timbef than at present, arising from the young growing Timber, as there appears by the Survey to be 72,990 Trees from 10 Feet to 30 of this Kind.

This Inclosure has been made many Years; not-

withstanding which there is no Timber at all in it, only a few young Oaks and Beech In the Corner adjoining Denny Wood, and a few ferubby Oaks and Birch dispersed about; but in the Middle there is not a single Tree (though supposed to have been plantedjf notwithstanding it is exceeding fine Land for Timber; but being nearly a dead Flat, the Whole of which, generally Two-thirds of the Year, is under Water, no Cut or Outlet having ever been made to carry it off} the L*md itself naturally cold; and this stagnated. Water entirely destroys the young Plants, as there is no Possibility of training up young Oaks without first taking off the Water, as it is to be observed in all the Woods in this Walk, that the finest Trees grow upon the Hills, tall, strait, and clean, and fine Navy Timber; and in the Bottoms, though the Land in fast may be better, the Trees are much shorter, with large bulhy Heads, and very knotty.

The Land of this Inclosure is a remarkable strong and deep Clay, very cold and wet; the Oaks thin and very ferubby, and several Acres together not a Angle Tree. As it is to be presumed the Whole was regularly planted with Acorns, these very wet Parts have entirely failed, no Attention having been paid to make any Drains or Outlets for the Water, which might easily have been done, as the Situation of the Wood lies favourable for it, there being a sufficient Fall both towards the North and South.

The Soil in this Inclosure is in general of a loamy Nature, except towards the Hill, which is more gravelly, with a strong Clay underneath. The Hill at Pricket's Berry is in general sandy.

Great Part of this Inclosure is full of young Oaks, which are in a very thriving State, but so close together, that unless very soon properly thinned, must deft roy each other. There arc other Parts quite vacant, which should be re-planted.

Slodon Inclosure has been inclosed about 15 Years; the outward Fence in some Parts is weak, and wants some small repairing.

The upper Part of this Inclosure is well covered with Thorns, Yews, and Hollys, and in some Spots a good Sprinkling of Oaks and Ash, which require thinning. The Bottoms in general are wet, and would be much improved by draining.

Land Revenue Office, January 13th 1789.

Gentlemen,

In your Answer to our Letter dated 12th 1788, in which we desired to be informed.

What Quantity of Oak Timber is Annually consumed by the Navy on an Average:

How much of that Timber is imported from Foreign Parts:

How much of it purchased from Individuals in this Kingdom:

How much on an Average supplied from the King’s Forests:

Qf what Nature is the Timber imported, and in what State; whether any great Timber or crooked Timber, and whether in the rough State, or converted: —

You acquainted us, on the 15th of the same Month,

That the Quantity Annually consumed by the Navy is 25,000 Loads in its rough State;

That none but Danlzick Plank is imported, and of that only about 800 or 1,000 Loads:

Vol. XLIV-

That about 23,000 Loads were purchased Annually from Individuals in this Kingdom:

About 2,000 Loads, on an Average of Fifteen or Twenty Years part, supplied from the King’s Forests:

And, that no straight or crooked Timber is imported.

But having since been favoured with the Perusal of sundry Minutes and Letters, both of the Admiralty and Navy Board, respecting the Consumption of Oak Timber for the Supply of His Majesty’s Navy, the Decrease of that Article, and the Quantity of Oak Timber growing in this Kingdom fit for the Use of the Navy — we observe in One of those Minutes of your Board, that the Quantity consumed by the Navy, in the Twelve Years preceding 1787, is stated to be about 500,000 Loads, which is more than 41,600 Loads Annually, on an Average.

From the great Difference between the Quantities stated in the Minute above-mentioned, and in your Answer to our Enquiries, we are led to suppose that the Average of 25,000 Loads, stated in your Letter to us, contains only the Quantity of rough Timber bought by the Navy Board from private Individuals, or from those who have the Disposal of what grows in the Royal Forests, and does not include the Timber

used in building such Ships as have been purchased by the Navy Board for the Use of the Navy, but which were not constructed in any of His Majesty’s Dock Yards.

And as the Object of our Enquiry is to learn what Quantity of Oak Timber is neccirary for the Supply of the whole Naval Force of this Country, whenever the Ships may be built, in order that we may state the Matter fully and accurately in our Reports, so as that the Legislature may be enabled to judge how far the Measures which we shall suggest are necessary, and how far they are likely to have the Effect of obtaining in future Times an adequate Supply: — We must request that you will direct the proper Officers under you to furnish us with the following Particulars:

An Account of the Stock of rough Timber in the several Dock Yards at the Time of His Majesty’s Accession, in ORober 1760.

An Account of the Tonnage of all the Ships or Vessels belonging to the Navy at the Time of His Majesty’s Accession, in ORobe 1760.

An Account of the Quantity of rough Timber received into each of His Majesty’s Yards, from His Majesty’s Accession to the present Time.

An Account of the Tonnage of the Ships built or purchased within the same Period for the Use of the Navy, and not constructed in any of His Majesty’s Dock Yards; and an Estimate of the Quantity of Oak Timber supposed to be required for construtting the m.

An Account of the Stock of rough Timber in the several Dock Yards on the 31st December last: And,

An Account of the Torfnage of the Ships or Vessels belonging to the Navy on 31 December last.

If the Information which we wish to obtain can be supplied in any other Mode than that which we have suggested, we beg that it may be done in that Mode which will be attended with the least Trouble or Inconvenience to yourselves or your Officers.

We are.

My Lords, and Gentlemen,

After the uniform Experience which I have had of your zealous Regard for the Interests of My People, it is a great Satisfaction to Me to recur to your Advice and Assistance, at a Period which calls for the full Exertion of your Energy and Wisdom.

notwithstanding the Disappointments and Reverses which We have experienced in the Course of the last Campaign, I retain a firm Conviction of the Necef. fity of persisting in the vigorous Prosecution of the just and neceftkry War in which We are engaged.

' You will, I am confident, agree with Me, that it is only from Firmncfs and Perseverance that We can hope for the Restoration of Peace on safe and honourable Grounds, and for the Preservation and permanent Security of our dearest Interests.

In considering the Situation of our Enemies, you will not fail to observe, that the Efforts which have led to their Succefifes, and the unexampled Means by which alone those Efforts could have been Supported, have produced, amongst themselves, the pernicious EffcCfs which were to be expeCted; and that every Thing which has passed in the Interior of the Country, has shewn the progressive and rapid Decay of their Resources, and the Instability of every Part of that violent and unnatural System, which is equally ruinous to France, and incompatible with the Tranquillity of other Nations.

The States General of the United Provinces have nevertheless been led, by a Sense of present Difficulties, to enter into Negociations for Peace with the Party now prevailing in that unhappy Country. — Noestabliftied Government or independent State, can under the present Circumstances, derive real Security from Such Negociations: On Our Part, they could not be attempted without ftcrificing both Our Honour and Safety to an F.nemy whose chief Animosity is avowedly directed against these Kingdoms.

I have therefore continued to life the most effectual Means for the further Augmentation of My Forces; and I shall omic no Opportunity of concerting the Operations of the next Campaign with such of the Powers of Europe as are impressed with the same Sense of the Necessity of Vigour and Exertion. I place the fulleft Reliance on the Valour of My Forces, and on the AffeCtion and Public Spirit of My People, in whose Behalf I am contending, and whole Safety and Happiness are the Objects of My constant Solicitude.

The local Importance of and the Spirited

Efforts of its Inhabitants to deliver themselves from the Yoke of France, determined Me not to withhold the Protection which they foughc for; and 1 have Since accepted of the Crown and Sovereignty of that Country, according to an Instrument, a Copy of which 1 have directed to be laid before you.

I am happy to inform you, that I have concluded a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, with the United States of , in which it has been

My Object to remove, as far as possible, all Grounds of Jealously and Mifundcrstanding, and to improve

an Intercourse beneficial to both Countries. — As soon as the Ratifications {Hall have been exchanged, I will direct a Copy of this Treaty to be laid before you, in order that you may consider of the Propriety of making such Provision? as may appear necessary for carrying it into Effect.

I have the greatest Satisfaction in announcing to you the happy Event of the Conclusion of a Treaty for the Marriage of My Son the Prince of Wales with the Princess Caroline, Daughter of the Duke of Brunswick: The constant Proofs of your Affection for My Person and Family persuade Me, that you will participate in the Sentiments I feel on an Occasion so interesting to My Domestic Happiness, and that you will enable Me to make Provision for such an F.fta-blishment, as you may think suitable to the Rank and Dignity of the Heir Apparent to the Crown of these Kingdoms.

Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

The Considerations which prove the Necessity of a vigorous Prosecution of the War will, I doubt nor, induce you to make a timely and ample Provision for -the several Branches of the Public Service, the Estimates for which I have directed to be laid before you.

While I regret the Necessity of large additional Burthens on My Subjects, it is a just Consolation and '

Satisfaction to Me to observe the State of our Credit,

Commerce, and Resources, which is the natural Result of the continued Exertions of Industry under the Protection of a free and well regulated Government.

My Lords, and Gentlemen,

A just Sense of the Blessings now so long enjoyed by this Country will, I am perluaded, encourage you to make every Effort, which can enable you to transmit those Blessings unimpaired to your Posterity.

I entertain a confideot Hope that, under the Protection of Providence, and with Constancy and Perseverance on Our Part, the Principles of social Order,

Morality, and Religion, will ultimately be successful; and that My faithful People will find their present Exertions and Sacrifices rewarded by the secure and permanent Enjoyment of Tranquillity at Home, and by the Deliverance of Europe from the greatest Danger with which it has been threatened since the Eltabliih-ment of civilized Society.

A Motion was made, and the Question being pro- Motion for posed, That an humble Address be prcfcnteci to His £d r?‘s on . Majesty, to return His Majesty the Thanks of this ins S3Peec House, for His most Gracious Speech from the Throne:

To assure His Majesty, that it is equally cur Duty and our anxious Desire to second His Majesty's Views for the Welfare of His People at this important Crisis by our best Advice and Assistance: That, much as we mull desire the Restoration of Peace on safe and honourable Grounds, we join with His Majesty in thinking that it is only from Firmnefs and Perseverance that we can hope for the Attainment of that End, and for the Preservation and permanent Security of our dearest Interests; and thac, notwithstanding the Disappointments and Reverses which have been experienced in the Course of the last Campaign, we retain a firm Conviction of the Necetiity of persisting in the vigorous Prosecution of the just and necessary War in which we are engaged:

Thar, from considering the Situation of our Ene-' mies, we are persuaded that the Efforts which have led to their Successes, and the unexampled Means by which those Efforts have been supporced, have produced, amongst themselves, the pernicious EffcCts which were to be expected from them; and that the

9 Circumstances

35 Geo. III. 30° Decem. 5

Circumstances which have taken place in the Interior of the Country, afford strong Marks of the progressive and rapid Decay of their Resources, and of thelnftability of every Part of that violent and unnatural System, which is equally ruinous to and incompatible

with the Tranquillity of other Nations:

That although a Sense of present Difficulties have led the States General of the United Provinces to enter into Negociations for Peace with the Party now prevailing in France,we are fully sensible how little real Security any established Government or independent State can derive, under the present Circumstances, from the Result of such Negociations; and we are convinced that they could not be attempted, on our Part, without sacrificing both our Honour and Safety to an Enemy whose chief Animofuy is avowedly directed against these Kingdoms:

That we cannot but applaud His Majesty's Determination to use the most effectual Means for the further Augmentation of His Forces, and to omit no Opportunity of concerting the Operations of the next Campaign with such of the Powers of Europe as are impressed with the same Sense of the Necessity of Vigour and Exertion:

That we are persuaded His Majesty may, at all Times, justly rely on the Valour of His Forces by Sea and Land, and on the Affection and Public Spirit of His People, contending for their essential Interests, and deeply sensible of His Majesty's parental Solicitude for their Happiness and Welfare: That we acknowledge His Majesty's Goodness in having directed the Instrument, by which He has accepted the Crown and Sovereignty of to be

laid before us* and we are sensible that the local Importance of that Island, and the spirited Efforts of its Inhabitants, naturally recommended them to His Majesty's Protection:

That we learn, with great Pleasure, that His Majesty has concluded a Treaty with the United States of America, with#the View of removing, as far as possible, all Grounds of Jcalously and Misunderstanding, and of improving-an Intercourse beneficial to both Countries; and that we shall be ready, as soon as the Treaty is laid before us, to consider of the necessary Provisions for carrying it into Effect:

That we cannot sufficiently express the Satisfaction which all His 'Majesty's Subjects must derive from the auspicious Event of the Conclusion of a Treaty for the Marriage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales with the Princess Caroline, Daughter of the Duke of Brunswick-, and that, participating warmly

in the Sentiments which His Majesty must feel on an Occasion at once so interesting to His domestic Hap-pirtffs, and so important to the Interests of His People, we shall cheerfully proceed to enable His Majesty to make Provision for an Establishment suitable to the Rank and Dignity of the Heir Apparent to the Crown of these Kingdoms:

That the Considerations which prove the Necessity of a vigorous Prosecution of the War, cannot fail to induce us to make a timely and ample Provision for the several Branches of the Public Service; and that, while we feel the painful Necessity of im-pofihg additional Burthens on our Constituents, it is a just Consolation and Satisfaction to us to learn, that the State of our Credit, Commerce, and Resources, is such as might naturally be expeCted to result from the continued Exertions of Industry under the Protection of a free and well regulated Government:

That, entertaining a just Sense of the BlefTings now so long enjoyed by this Country, we feel it incumbent upon us to make every Effort whjjh can enable us to transmit those Bit (Tings unimpaired to our Posterity; and that we cordially join with His Majesty in a confident Hope, thar, under the Protection of Providence, and with Constancy and Perseverance on our Vop. L.

Part, the Principles of social Order, Morality, dnd Religion, will ultimately be successful; and that His Majesty's faithful Subjects will find their present Exertions and Sacrifices rewarded by the secure and permanent Enjoyment of Tranquillity at Hb'me, and by the Deliverance of Europe from the greatest Danger with which it has been threatened since the Establishment of civilized Society ;

And an Amendment being proposed to be made to-the Question, by inferring after the Word “ Assistance,'*. in the Second Paragraph, these Words “ To assure His.

“ Majesty that we are determined to grant the most “ liberal Supplies for the Purpose of enabling His “ Majesty to act with Vigour and Effect in support- ing the Dignity of His Crown, the internal Security of His Dominions, and the good Faith towards His Majesty's Allies, for which this Country has been so eminently distinguishedj and that, notwithstanding the Disappointments and Reveries of the last Campaign, we are firmly convinced that,

“ from the unremitting Exertions of His Majesty,

“ and the Spirit and Zeal which have been so gene-: “ rally manifested, throughout the Kingdom, by a “ People sensible of the Advantages they enjoy under " His Majesty's Government, we may promise our(elves (by the Blessing of Divine Providence) complcte Security from the Attempts of Foreign or Domestic Enemies: That, at the same Time, we beg Leave most humbly to represent to His Majesty that, upon full Consideration of all the Events “ and Circumstances of the present War, andoffome “ Transaftions which have lately passed in ,

“ and also of the Negociation entered into by the “ States General, we think it adviseable and expedient “ to endeavour to restore the Blessings of Peace to “ His Majesty's Subjects, and to His Allies, upon just and reasonable Terms: But that if, contrary to the ardent Wifbes of His faithful Commons, “ such Endeavours on the Part of His Majesty should “ be rendered ineffectual, by the Violence or Ambition of the Enemy, we arc persuaded that the Burthens and Evils of a just and necessary War will “ be borne with Chearfulncfs by a loyal, affcftionatfc, “ and united People;”

An Amendment was proposed to be made to the said proposed Amendment, by leaving out the Words, “ and of some Transaftions which have lately passed in France

And the Question being put, That those Words stand Part of the said proposed Amendment;

It was resolved in the Affirmative.

Then the Question being pur. That after the Wofd *r Assistance,” in the original Question, the Words, “ To assure His Majesty that we are determined to “ grant the most liberal Supplies for the Purpose of “ enabling His Majesty to act with Vigour and Effect “ in supporting the Dignity of His Crown, the in- tcrnal Security of His Dominions, and the good “ Faith towards His Majesty's Allies, for which this Country has been so eminently distinguished; and that, notwithstanding the Disappointments and Rc-verses of the last Campaign, we are firmly convinced that, from the unremitting Exertions of His “ Majesty, and the Spirit and Zeal which have been (( so generally manifested, throughout the Kingdom, “ by a People sensible of the Advantages they enjoy “ under His Majesty's Government, we may promise ourselves (by the Blessing of Divine Providence) complete Security from the Attempts of Foreign or Domestic Enemies: That, at the same Time, we beg Leave most humbly to represent to His “ Majesty, that, upon full Consideration of all the “ Events and Circumstances of the present War* and u of some Transaftions which have lately passed in “ France, and also of the Negociation entered into by “ the States General, we think it adviseable and ex-

AnfWer of ‘ *m XR. Speaker acquainted the House, That he had K>°Vot^ofd lVl received, from Admiral Lord Hood, the follow-

Thankt. ing Letter, in Return to the Thanks of this House,

signified to him by Mr. Speaker, in Obedience to their Commands of the 20th Day of June, in the last Session of Parliament:

ViSory, off July 30th, 1794.

Sir,

I have this Day received the very obliging Letter you did me the Honour to write me on the 21ft. of last Month, with Two Resolutions of the House of Commons.

I am most truly sensible. Sir, of the very high and distinguished Honour the House has done me in thinking me deserving of its Thanks; and shall not fail to make known to the several Officers, Seamen, Marines, and Soldiers, the Second Resolution of the House, expressive of Acknowledgment and Approbation of their spirited and meritorious Exertions.

In doing my utmost upon all Occasions against the Common Enemy, I did no more than I ought*, all I have to boast is being fortunate in the Opportunities I have had of proving my Inclination to discharge my Duty, as a faithful Servant to my King and Country; and that, whenever I have been at the Head of a Squadron of His Majesty's Fleet, I never experienced any other Contention amongst the Admirals, Captains, Officers, and Men, than who should be most forward in fulfilling my Wilhes: This, Sir, I am, and ever shall be proud of; but whilst the Representatives of Great Britain m Parliament are so ready, not only to accept, but distinguilhingly reward, honest Endeavours, as substantial Services, the Nation will never Want able and zealous Officers'.

To you, Sir, I feel infinitely indebted for the very polite and obliging Manner in which yot^have conveyed to me a Vote of the House of Commons so highly honourable to me, for which, to the House as

well as to you. Sir,' my Gratitude can ccafe only with my Life.

I have the Honour to be.

With the purest Sentiments of Respect and Esteem,

Sir,

Your most faithful

and obliged humble Servant,

Hood.

appointed Ycfterday to draw up an Address to be presented to His Majesty, That the Committee had drawn tip an Address accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House j and he read the same in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk's Table: Where the same was read j and is as followeth; viz.

Most Gracious Sovereign,

We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Commons of Great , in Parliament af-

sembled, beg Leave to return Your Majesty the Thanks of this House, for Your most Gracious Speech from the Throne; To assure Your Majesty, that it is equally our Duty and our anxious Desire to second Your Majesty's Views for the Welfare of Your People, at this important Crisis, by our best Advice and Assistance; that, much as we must desire the Refto-fation of Peace, 6n safe and honourable Grounds, we join with Your Majesty in thinking that it is only from Firmnefs and Perseverance that we can hope for the Attainment of that End, and for the Preservation and

permanent Security of our dearest Interests; and that, notwithstanding the Disappointments and Reverses which have been experienced in the Course of the last Campaign, we retain ^ firm Conviction of the Necessity of persisting in the vigorous Prosecution of the just and necessary War in which we are engaged; from considering the Situation of our Enemies, we arc persuaded that the Efforts which have led to their Succelfes, and the unexampled Means by which those Efforts have been supported, have produced, among, themselves, the pernicious Effe/ts which were to be expeCted from them and that the Circumstances which have taken place in the Interior of the Country, afford strong Marks of the progressive and rapid Decay of their Resources, and of the Instability of every Part of that violent and unnatural System, which is equally ruinous to France, and incompatible with the Tranquillity of other Nations.

Although a Sense of present Difficulties has led the Stares General of the United Provinces to enter into Negociations for Peace with the Party now prevailing in France, we are fully sensible how little real Security

any established Government or independent State can derive, under the present Circumstances, from the Re-fult of such Negociations; and we arc convinced thac they could not be attempted, on our Part, without facrtficing both our Honour and Safety to an Ertcmy whose' chief Animosity is avowedly directed against these Kingdoms.

We cannot but applaud Your Majestyks Determination to use the most effectual Means for the further Augmentation of Your Forces, and to omit no Opportunity of concerting the Operations of the next Campaign, with such of the Powers of Europe as are imprelfed with the same Sense of the Necessity of Vigour and Exertion.

We are persuaded Your Majesty may, at all Times, justly rely on the Valour of Your Forces by Sea and Land, and on the AffeCtion and Public Spirit of Your People, contending for their elfential Interests, and deeply sensible of Your Majesty's parental Solicitude for their Happiness and Welfare.

We acknowledge Your Majesty's Goodness in having directed the Instrument by 'which You have accepted the Crown and Sovereignty of Corjica, to be laid before us; and we are sensible that the local Importance of that Island, and the spirited Efforts of its Inhabitants, naturally recommended them to Your Majesty's Protection.

It gives us great Pleasure to learn that Your Majesty has concluded a Treaty with the United States of America, with the View of removing, as far as possible, all Grounds of Jealously and Misunderstanding, and of improving an Intercourse beneficial to both Countries; and we shall be ready, as soon as the Treaty is laid before us, to consider of the necessary Provisions for carrying it into Effect.

We cannot sufficiently express the Satisfaction which all Your Majesty's Subjects must derive from the auf-picious Event of the Condufion of a Treaty for the Marriage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales with the Princess Caroline, Daughter of the Duke of Brunswick; and that, participating warmly in the Sentiments which Your Majesty must feel on an Occasion not less connected with the Interests of Your People than with the Domestic Happiness of Your Majesty, we shall cheerfully proceed to enable Your Majesty to make Provision for an Establishment fuicable to the Rank and Dignity of the Heir Apparent to the Crown of these Kingdoms.

The Considerations which prove the Necessity of a vigorous Prosecution of the War, cannot fail to induce us to make a timely and ample Provision for the several Branches of the Public Service; and, while we feel the painful Necessity of imposing additional Burthens on our Constituents, it is a just Confolation and

A Petition of the several Persons, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves, and others, being legal Electors of Members to serve in Parliament for the Town and Port of ,in the

County of Sussex, was delivered in at the Table, and read; Setting forth. That, upon the 19th Day of March 1792, the Select Committee, who were appointed to try and determine the Merits of a Petition of Sir Godfrey IVebfter, Baronet, and John ,

Esquire, against the Return of Members to serve in Parliament for the said Town and Port of Seafordi reported to the House, that they had determined, “ That the Right of Election is in the Inhabitants,

“ Housekeepers of the said Town and Port, paying Scot and Lot, and in such Inhabitants House- keepers only and that the Petitioners are advised, that the said Right of Election, so determined by the said Select Committee, is not the Right of Election for the said Town and Port: And therefore, to prevent the said Judgment of the said Select Committee from becoming final and conclusive, praying. That they may be admitted as Parties, according to the Form of the Statute in that same lately made and provided, to oppose the said Right of Election, in Favour of which the said Select Committee have reported as aforesaid, and that they may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet, and the Nature of the same may require.

Ordered, That the said Petition be taken into Consideration upon Tuesday, the 10th Day of February next, at Three of the Clock in the Afternoon.

Ordered, That Mr. Speaker do issue his Warrant, or Warrants, for such Persons, Papers, and Records, as shall be thought necessary, by the Parties, on the Hearing of the Matter of the said Petition.

Memorandum:

That Notice of the said Petition, and of the Time appointed for taking the same into Consideration, was inferred, by the Order of Mr. Speaker, in The London Gazette, and also sent to the Returning Officer of the Town and Port of Seaford, according to the Directions of an Act, palfed in the Twenty-eighth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for the further Regulation of the Trials of controverted Elections, or Returns of Members to serve in Parliament.

River Thames at or near Brin the County of Middlesex, and they have made a considerable Progress in that Work, bur, if the Canal is made in the Line directed by the said Act, the Petitioners will be obliged to make a Tunnel, of a considerable Length, through certain High Grounds in the County of Hertford; and that, by a Survey lately made, it appears that, if the Line of that Part of the Canal was varied, and made through the Lands, Grounds, and Parks, of Thomas Earl of Clarendon, and Anne Earl

of Effext, and certain other Lands and Grounds in the

Parishes of Abbot's Langley, King's Langley, IVat ford, and Riekmansworth,those High Grounds would be

avoided, and the Tunnel become unnecessary, which would render to the Public a more constanr, speedy, and safe Communication than if the Canal was made

in the Line directed by the said Act:; and fotre other Amendments and Alterations are necessary to be made in the said Act: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill to authorize the Petitioners to make such Variation in the Line of the said Canal as aforesaid, and to make such other Amendments in the said Act, as to the House shall appear necessary and proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as ic-shall appear to them, to the House:

tioners fdr Diet for His Majesty's Troops and their Hbries per Diem, are now nearly the same as they were in the Time of King the Third, and

for upwards of Sixty Years have continued the same without any Variation whatever, which amply demonstrate the heavy Lofies the Petitioners must unavoidably sustain, House-rent, Taxes, Provisions, and all other NeceflarieS of Life, having been increased, during the Period 1 aft-mentioned, to double their former Amount, and the Articles of Hay and Straw having increased in an equal Proportion; and the Petitioners beg Leave to offer, as Instances of the Lofies they suffer, that the Thirty-seventh Clauseof the Mutiny Act, compelling them to find Troop Horses with Hay and Straw for Twenty-four Hours at Six Pence per Horse, subjects them, on a most moderate Calculation* to an actual Loss of Six Pence per Diem for each Horse quartered on them; and they are also, by the same Act, obliged to find to each Man Five Pints of Small Beer per Diem, Vinegar, Salt, Candles, the Ule of Fire, and of Utensils for dressing their Provisions, Bedding, Plates, Knives and Forks, &c. without any Allowance whatever being made to them by Government, which subjects them to a Loss of Three Pence Daily, at least, for each Man; and that, for Soldiers on a March, they are compellable to provide Three Meals each Man, for which Three Meals they receive only Six Pence in the same of a Trooper, and Four Pence only in the same of a Foot Soldier, which subjects them to a further Loss of, at least. Ten Pence in the former Cafe* and of One Shilling in the latter Instance, per Diem, upon the Meals so provided; and that the Petitioners are prompted to urge again to the House their constant Readiness to participate in the necessary Burthens of the State, and to aflufe them, they have a firm Reliance that the Representatives of the People, upon examining the unparalleled Hardships of their present Situation, will afford them that Relief which the Justice of their same requires; and th^y therefore leave their same with the House, trusting in its Liberality and Justice for Relief, and request Leave to be heard, by themselves, or their Counsel, in Support of the several Allegations of their Petition.

A Motion was made, and the Question was pro-pol'ed. That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it. shall appear to them, to the House.

And the said Motion was, with Leave of the House, withdrawn.

That by Three Acts passed, in the Sixth Year of the Reign of King George the First, the Seventh Year of King George the Second, and the Ninth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, a Duty of Two Pennies Scots, or One Sixth Part of a Penny Sterling, was laid upon every Pint of Ale or Beer, vended or sold within the Town of Montrose, and Privileges thereof, for l'upplying the said Town with fresh Water, and for other Purposes therein mentioned; and that the Mo-. nies arising from the said Duty, since the Commence-

Mr. Charles Dundas reported from the Committee, Potion for to whom the Petition of the Persons thereunto fob-feribing. Owners of Land in the Islands of Zetland, theiflandsof within the Stewartry of Orkney and Zetland, holden 'Zetland, &c. by them, severally, immediately under the Crown, was c‘ rel'<*te referred: That the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House j ' and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk's Table: Where the same was read j and is as followeth j viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition,

An Act of the Parliament of Scotland, passed in the , First Session of the Second Parliament of King Charles the Second, for Annexation of Orkney and Zetland to the Crown, was read j whereby the Isles of Orkney and the Isles of Zetland, were united or erected into One Stewartry, to be called The Stewartry of Orkney and Zetland; since which Time the said Isles have formed One Jurisdiction under the same Sheriff or Steward.

And ic appeared by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland, passed in the Third Parliament of King Charles the Second, concerning the Election of the Commissioners for Shires, and by other Laws in Force, that no Person is entitled to be inrolled in the Roll of Freeholders of any Shire or Stewartry, or to be admitted to vote in the Election of the Commissioner to Parliament for such Shire or Stewartry, unless such Person is publicly infeft in Property or Superiority, and in Possession of a Forty Shilling Land of old Extent, holden of the King or Prince, distinct from the Feuduties in Fewlands, or in Lands liable in public Burdens for His Majesty's Supplies for Four hundred Pounds Scots of valued Rent, whether Kirklands holden of the King or other Lands holding 2 Feu

Feu or Blench of His Majesty or of the Prince. — Then,

James Chalmer, Esquire, being examined, informed

your Committee, That it is not known at what precise Time the ancient Valuation of Lands in ,cal-

led The old Extenr, was made; but all the Writers on the Law of Scotland are agreed, and the Evidence they refer to proves, that it was at a Period long before the I Hands of Orkney and Zetland were a Part of that Kingdom.

It further appeared, from an exemplified Copy of the Valuation Roll of the County of which

was produced to your Committee, and proved by the Testimony of Mr. James Lethat the valued Rent of the Isles of Orkney, was ascertained in the Year 1653, the Total or Cumulo Value being £. 56,551.

9 s~

And Mr. Leijk further informed your Committee, That he <was a Native of and had resided

there for Fifty Years: — That he knows the said Valuation has ever been the Rule for railing and apportioning the Public Supplies, and ascertaining the Qualification of the Freeholders of the said Stewartry in respectcof Lands situated within that Part of the fame, called Orkney, but the Lands and Heritages in the I (lands of Zetland never were valued, so as to form the valued Rent recognized by Law.

Extracts from the Books of the Receiver General of the Land Tax for Scotland, were then produced; from which, and from the Evidence of Mr. Leijk, it appeared, that the Lands in the IQands of Zetland, have nevertheless been subjeded to, and constantly in use to pay One-third Part of the Eels or Land Tax imposed generally upon the said Stewartry: — And the Witness further said, That this was understood to be in Consequence of some Agreement or Understanding between the Owners of Lands in Orkney, and the Owners of Land in Zetland, or some Law or Ordinance of which the Memory is loft; and as that Apportionment has been long acquiesced in, he said, it would be inexpedient now to disturb the settled Valuation of Orkney, but that the Owners of Land in Zetland, he apprehended, would be put in a Situation to enable then: (when otherwise legally entitled) to be inrolled ' Freeholders, and Justice done to all concerned, by fixing the Half of the Cumulo Valuation of Orkney, or the Sum off. 28,275. 14J. 61 to be the Total or

Cumulo Valuation of Zetland, and then apportioning that Sum upon the Owners of Land in Zetland, according to their several and respective Properties.

The Witness further informed your Committee, That the Lands in the Isles of Zetland are divided by some ancient Rule or Custom into Parcels, called Marks of Land, the Boundaries of which are well known, and the Cess or Land Tax, and other Public Supplies, have been in use to be raised by apportioning the Third Part of the Total Sum laid upon the whole Stewartry (paid according to the said Custom by or from Zetland) upon the several Mark Lands in Zetland, each Mark Land being liable to pay an equal Share; and it might be inexpedient, and would create great Confusion and Expence, to alter that established Usage. — Then,

Mr. Chalmer being further examined, said. That by Law and Custom in Scotland, the Sheriff or Steward has the Right of fixing the Day of the Election of the Commissioner for the Shire or Stewartry, being obliged to give Notice of the Day fixed, at the Head Burgh of the Shire, upon a Market Day, and at each Parish Church within his Jurisdiction, upon the Sunday immediately thereafter, at least Three Days before the Diet of Ele&ion, and Twelve Days before the Meeting of ParliamentAnd,

Mr. Leijk further said. That these Regulations are not suited to the Stewartry of Orkney and Zetland, in

respect of the great Distance of the Isles of Zetland from Kirkwall, the Head Burgh, situated in Orkney, and that the Two Districts are divided by a tempestuous Sea, and the Inhabitants have little Intercourse, and also in respect that the Isles of Zetland, abstracted from Orkney are numerous, distant from each other, and difficult of Access, and that there are in the said Ifies Twenty-six Parish Churches (as he thinks); so that it is scarcely possible to publish the Writ according to the strict Terms of the Regulations, and to have Evidence thereof in Fuch Time as to hold the Elections within the Period, when the Writ is usually made returnable, and accordingly the Regulation concerning the Notice at the Parish Churches has never been observed in Zetland

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for establishing and apportioning the valued Rent of the lllands of Zetland, Part of the Stewartry of Orkney 2nd Zetland', and for regulating the Mode of giving Notice when a Commissioner to serve in Parliament for the said Stewartry is to be elected: And that Mr.

Charles Dundas and Mr. Lawrence Dundas do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

A Petition of Henry O'Brien, Esquire, Patron of the petl-t;cn w Redtory of the Parish of Blatherwick, in the County of confirm an Northampton, and of John 'Skynnsr, Clerk, Rector of ^fTnclosure* the said Parish, was presented to the House, and read; of Binherwick Setting forth.

the said Arthur Stafford, and he, and also the Petitioner, the said John Skynner, are desirous.of having the Inclosure of the said Lands, and the Extinguishment of the said respective Rights of Common, and of the said Tythes, confirmed and established, and for that Purpose have agreed, that certain Pieces of Land of the Petitioner, the said Henry O'Brien, more conve-. niently situated ‘for the Redtory House of the said Parish, should be set out to the Rector in Lieu of the Land heretofore set out as aforesaid, and also that such Annual Sum of Money should be paid by the Petitioner, the said Henry O'Brien, to the said Rector, as shall be the full Value of the said Tythes; and that the rendering the said Agreement effectual will be a Convenience to the Petitioner, the said Henry O'Brien, and of great Benefit to the Petitioner, the said John Skynner, and the future Redtors of the said Parish: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for confirming and establishing the Agreement made between the Petitioners as aforesaid, and

His Majesty thinks it proper to acquaint the House of Commons, that He has received from the Emperor strong Assurances of a Disposition to make the greatest Exertions for the common Cause, in the Course of the next Campaign; but it is represented, on the Part of his Imperii] Majesty, that these Efforts cannot be made withouc the Assistance of a Loan, which his Imperial Majesty is desirous of railing, on the Credit of the Revenues of his Hereditary Dominions, under the Guaranty of His Majesty, with the 9 Concurrence

His Majesty is of Opinion that, on these Grounds, such an Arrangement would be beneficial to the common Cause; but His Majesty thinks that it would be still more advantageous, if, by the Means of a similar Loan, to a larger Extent, the Emperor should be -enabled to employ a Force still more considerable j and His Majesty has directed His Minister at Vienna to express His Majesty's Readiness to recommend to His Parliament an Arrangement founded on that Principle.

Some temporary Advances, which His Majesty was induced to make, for the immediate Supply of the Aujlrian Army, under the Prefiure of unforeseen Circumstances, in the latter Part of the last Campaign, will be included in any Arrangement of this Nature.

As soon as the Negotiation is concluded, His Majesty will not fail to communicate the Result to Parliament } but, as any Measure of this Sort is necessarily connected with the Consideration of the Provision to be made for the current Service of the Year, His Majesty has thought it right not to delay making this Communication j and He relies on the Zeal and Public Spirit of His faithful Commons, for taking such Measures as, on a full Consideration of all the Circumstances, they may think most.conducive to the immediate Interests of this Country, at the present Conjuncture, and to the great Object of Re-establishing, on secure and honourable Grounds, the Peace and Tranquillity of these Kingdoms, and of Europe.

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer (by His Majesty's Command) acquainted the House, that His Majesty, having been informed of the Contents of the said Petition, recommends it to the Confederation of the House.

Then the said Petition was brought up, and read; Setting forth. That a Number of Gentlemen, a few Years fine'e, having observed, with great Concern, the various Calamities arising from the extreme Ignorance of a set of Men, generally called Farriers, Cowleeches, &c. to whose Management and Direction the Medical and Chirurgical Treatment of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, and other Beads, have been entirely intrusted, and being convinced that the judicious Treatment of Dif-tempers, Lameness, and other Accidents incident to Horses, and all other Cattle falling within the Denomination of the Farmers Stock, was of the highest Commercial as well as Domestic Importance, formed the Design of ihftituting a Veterinary School, in which the Anatomical Confirmation, Animal CEconomy of, and the Diseases incident to Horses, and all other useful Animals of the Brute Creation, are subject, and the Operations and Remedies proper to be applied might be investigated and taught by learned and fkil-ful Professors, hoping that, by such a System of Education, the Nation might gradually derive and enjoy the Advantage of possessing enlightened Practitioners in the Veterinary Science, on whose attentive Care and Skill the Proprietors of Horses, Cattle, and all Animal Stock, might securely rely; and that, in pursuance of the said Plan, a Piece of Ground was agreed to be taken upon a long Lease, on which Stables, a Forge, and other convenient Offices, and also a Theatre for delivering Lectures to Pupils and Subscribers, were, by a private Subscription, soon erected, and an Institution formed under the Name of The Veterinary College, in which a Number of Young Men have been already educated, and instruded in every Species of Veterinary Science, Seven of those, viz. Mr. Bond, Mr.

Lawrence, Mr. Mills, Mr. B. Clarke, Mr. Field, Mr. Stockley, and Mr. Thompson, having passed a regular Examination before the Medical Committee of the College, consisting of Mr. John Hunter, Sir George Baker, Dr. Fordyce, Dr. Crawford, Dr. Baillie, Dr. Sandcman, Dr . Relpb, Mr. Cline, Mr. Cruikjbanks, Mr.

Home, Mr. Houljion, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Abernethy, and Mr. Babington, Vith the fulleft Approbation, have been sent into different Parts of the Kingdom, where they are practising with Credir and Profit to themselves, Honour to the Veterinary School, and to the great Benefit and Advantage of the Neighbourhood where they reside, and there are now Fifteen Pupils pursuing their Studies with commendable Diligence; and, as it is the Opinion of many General and Cavalry Officers, that such a System of Education will be of great Utility to the British Cavalry, and will ensure a considerable Diminution in the Expence thereof, by An Improvement in the Mode of treating Gun Shot

Wounds, and other Disorders of Cavalry Horses, which at present so often fall a Sacrifice to the Ignorance of those to whose Care they are intrusted, for the Convenience and Advantage of which Service the Petitioners offer a free Admission for One Pupil, from each Regimenc of Cavalry.in Great Britain, to attend at all Times, in future, the Leisures and Dif-sections of the Veterinary School; and that the College is now under the Direction of a Professor (Mr. Coleman) a Man of Science and Skill, and who, to the Advantage of a liberal Education, has added a fuc-cefsful Course of Study in the first Schools of Anatomy and Medicine, from his Abilities and Assiduity the most flattering Expedations are formed of diffuf. ing Veterinary Science throughout the Kingdom; but, in bringing the Institution to its present State, the Subscribers have had to combat and struggle with many Difficulties and Disadvantages, and experienced every Oppofuion that 'the infatuated Ignorance of Farriers, Grooms, &c. and the Caprice of Individuals, could raise or suggest; and, upon a Review of the actual State of the Finances of the College, it appears that the Expenditure has very considerably exceeded the Receipts, whereby the Establishment is encumbered with so considerable a Debt, that the Petitioners fear it will be impossible to bring the riling Institution to that State of Perfection which the National Welfare requires, or even to support the Establishment already formed without the Aid of Parliament; and that, to elucidate all these Matters more fully to the House, a correct State of the Establishment, Finances, Debt, and every Circumstance relating to the Institution, and necessary for Information, is prepared, and ready to be produced: And therefore praying, That such Relief may be granted, as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

vertisement of the Bailiff of the said Borough, was t-cfpe&in* tfc* presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, T hat War* the Petitioners, sincerely and awfully affected by a due Sense of the trying and momentous Circumstances tinder which they now appeal to the Wisdom, and to the Feelings, of their Constitutional Representatives the Commons of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled, find it their bounden Duty to give their Opinion upon the present alarming State of Public Affairs, with all the Franknefs and Explicitnefs which the Cr fis demands — and, First, the Petitioners freely and zealously declare their true and unlhaken Attachment to the Monarch on the Throne and to His Royal Family, and their firm Determination to support the genuine Principles of this most excellent Constirution, should any Attempt, from whatever Quarter, whether Foreign or Domestic, be made to subvert it: In revolving, however, the Events of the present War with France, the Petitioners, with the deepest Concern, have observed, that the uniform Bravery manifested by the Fleets and Armies has, in no Respect, advanced the presumed Object of the War, and now less than ever appears likely to attain it: The Consideration of the Disasters and Defeats which have lately attended the unsupported Efforts of the British Arms on the Continent is, in the Minds of the Petitioners, bitterly aggravated by the Reflection, that those Allies, whose Councils and Resentments first engaged us in the Contest, have wrung from the Creduficy and Confidence of the generous and industrious People of Great Britain large Sums of Money, for which, in Violation of all Faith, no adequate Service appears to have been performed or attempted: In the Events of a Campaign so unparalleled in Calamity, the Petitioners, among other fatal Consequences, perceive a large Addition to the existing National Debt, the speedy Dimir.ution of which has been long held forth to the Petitioners ' and to the Country as a Measure indispensably necessary to the Maintenance of the Constitution, as weil as to the Credit, of Great Britain: Under the increasing Pressure of such Burthens, the Petitioners are convinced, however highly they are disposed to estimate the Fortitude and Loyalty of all Descriptions of their Countrymen, and however readily they admit the temporary Advantages which both the General Commerce and the Public Funds of this Country may have derived from the Terrors or Calamities of other Nations, that the Consequences of persevering in the present destructive War mult tend rapidly to depress and ruin the Occupations of useful Labour and profitableTn-duftry, and ultimately to destroy the only true Sources of the Nation's Power, our Trade, our Commerce, and our Manufactures: Under this impression, the 7 Petitioners

35 Geo. Ill,

Petitioners are compelled to turn their Thoughts, most seriously and eagerly to the only real Remedy for the Evils they apprehend. Peace; for, in the Tranquillity, the civilized Intercourse, and the Commercial Prof-perity of the surrounding Nations of Europe, the Petitioners conceive, the Commercial Interests of Great Britain can alone find their Interest and Support; in the Purfuitsof Vengeance or Ambition, in Wars and Camps, in Desolation and Bloodlhed, evert were the Conted attended with temporary Success, the Result-to a Country, circumstanced as this is, mutt be National Bankruptcy and ultimate Ruin: On these Grounds, the Petitioners humbly but didinftly pray, That the House, disclaiming every Pretence of Right on< the Part of Great Britain to create, or correct a Government for France, and disregarding whatever is, or may be, the Title or Condruftion of the ruling Power; which either does or may exist in that Country, will earnestly adopt the most effectual Means for recommending an immediate Negociation for Peace, on Terms confident with the Honour and Security of the British Empire: And the Petitioners further allure the House, that if, contrary to the Hopes of the Petitioners, Motives of inordinate Ambition or of implacable Re-fentment, however ralhly and improvidently excited in the Mind of the Enemy, should render it impodible to obtain a Termination of Hodilities upon safe and honourable Terms, the Petitioners will be found among the readied of His Majesty's loyal Subjects, to Hand forward to the lad Means of Exertion in Defence of their Country, or to perish with its Fall.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the

Table.

Qtieftioa pit- A Motion was made, and the Quedion being pro-

respe&n|*a posed. That this House, considering that, in the Sup-

Negociation port which it has given to His Majesty in the Prose-

for Peace. cution of the present War, it has, at no Time, had any

other Object but to redore to these Kingdoms the Blessings of an equitable Peace: That, with a view to accomplish this humane and delirable End, every formal Difficulty which may dand in the Way of a Pacific Negociation with the Power with which we are at War, ought in the fird Indance, to be removed; and that, without some Acknowledgement of the Ex-idence of a competent Power in France, with which His Majesty may negociate and conclude a Treaty of Peace on jud and reasonable Terms for both Parties, there can be no Termination of the present War but in the Destruction of One of them; considering further, that the Exidence of such a competent Power in France has been directly acknowledged by several of the Powers of Europe, as well as by the United States of America, with all of whom, during the present War, France has maintained the accudomed Relations of Peace and Amity; and considering also, that the Exidence of such a competent Power in France has been, in various Indances, virtually admitted, even by the Belligerent Powers themselves, some of whom have entered into Public Resolutions to make Overtures for Peace, is of Opinion, that the Government now exiding in France, is competent to entertain and conclude a Negociation for Peace with Great Britain;

And the previous Quediop being put. That that Quedion be now put;

The House divided.

James Ogbourn being examined, said, That he did keep the White Hart at Gni in the County of Surrey, for Three Years, and left it jn May on Account of the great Lodes he sustained by the Soldiers — That he has frequently had billetted upon him 400 Soldiers in a Week on their March — exclqfive of that he has had in settled Quarters for 12 Months oat of 15, Fifty Foot Soldiers — also has had 30 Horses and 20 Men for Six Months together — That his Family lived in the House 16 Years before he took it — That in the last Year he loft £. 500 by the Soldiers, owing to the high Price of Hay and Provisions — That he has been quite ruined by the Soldiers, and is now out of Employment; and that he has given up every Thing to jiis Creditors — That Mr. Peter Harvey took the House after he left it, upon Application of the Creditors, and that the House is now open by Subscription. — Then,

Peter Harvey being again examined, said. That he went into the House at Guildford after Mr. left it upon the Application of the Creditors, and continued in it abouc Three Months, but found the Military pressed so heavy on him, that if was impossible for him to go on with ir, he therefore gave Notice to the Creditors to quit, which he did accordingly — That during the Time he was at Guildford he had billetted upon him 37 Horses for a Month together, and at the same Time 38 Men belonging to one Regiment, and 16 Men belonging to another.

In pursuance of the Orders of the House of the 9th Day of February Instant, that the said Report should be rc-committed to this Committee, and that they

fhoukl reoort their Observations thereupon to the H oufc, the Com.nictee have proceeded to take the same Report into Confederation, and have made f-vend Obfer various thereupon, which they submit to the Consideration of the House.

In the First Place, your Committee beg Leave to mention, thac many other Inn keepers attended from different Pans of the Country; but, as it appeared that their Evidence only went in Confirmation of the Accounts before dated, your Committee h is not thought it necessary to detail any further Particulars on the Subject.

Your Committee also beg Leave to observe, that from what has been dated by the several Persons examined, it appears that great Losses mult be sustained by the Inn-keepers, and others, receiving anti quartering His Majesty's Troops upon the Allowance ftipu-lated by the Mutiny Act.

That in Cafes where Soldiers are upon a March, or Recruiting, the Inn-keepers are obliged to furnish them for Seven Days with Three Meals a Day, and Small Beer, at an Allowance from Government of only Four Pence a Day for a Foot Soldier, and Six Pence a Day for a Horse Soldier, which appears to your Committee to subject them to a Loss, according to the present Price of Provisions, of One Shilling Day for a Foot Soldier, and Ten Pence per Day for a Horse Soldier. — In Cafes where Soldiers are in settled Quarters, the Inn-keepers to avoid the greater Expence of providing them with Three Meals a Day and Small Beer on the Allowance above dated, are obliged to furnish them with Candles, Vinegar, Salt, Five Pints of Small Beer or Cyder, besides the Ul'e of Fire, and the necessary Otenfils for drefTing and eating their Meals, without any Allowance whatever from Government, by which it appears they fuilain a Loss of Three Pence per Day, at the least, by each Man so

furnished by them.

It further appears to your Committee, that very confulerable Losses muff be sustained by the Inn-keepers, and others, receiving and providing for Troop Horses, for which they are allowed only Six Pence for each Horse, for Hay and Straw for Twenty-four Hours — As no Stint or Ratio is settled as to the Weight of Hay and Straw to be delivered for each Horle when in Quarters, and the Soldiers claim the same without Restriction, it is difficult to ascertain to whac Extent the Loss may go; but from examining Accounts accurately kept by some of the Inn-keepers of Hay and Straw consumed by Troop Horses in dated Tiroes, and the Evidence of all of them of the great Quantity of Hay consumed by the Horses, and taking into Consideratitm the different Prices of Hay and Straw in different Counties, and making a Deduction for the Value of the Dung which the Innkeeper retains — It appears to your Committee, thac there mud, upon an Average, be a Loss of about Six Pence on each Horse for every Twenty-four Hours, over and above the Allowance made by Government.

Ordered, That the said Report do lie upon the Table.

The Counsel and Agents before-mentioned, being returned to the Bar, the Clerk appointed to attend the said Committee delivered in to the House One of the said Lifts, which had' been (truck by the said Counsel, in his Presence, together with a new Lift of the Names of the Fourteen Members then remaining' unftruck;. to which lait-mentioned Lift the Name of Charles Dundas, Esquire, being added, the same was called over; and is as follows:

Town of Newcastle under Lyme, in the said County, for the Navigation of Boats and other Vefiels with heavy Burthens, which will facilitate the Carriage and Conveyance of Lime, Limestone, Iron, and other Minerals,

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Two Acts passed in the Sixth and Twenty-seventh Years of the Reign of Mis present Majesty, for repairing and widening the Road from High Briin the County of Stafford, to Uttoxeler, and from Spaih to Hanging

Petition from A Petition of the several Persons, whole Names are '^inst'the Bill thereunto subscribed, being a Committee chosen by for requiring the Merchants, Owners, and Commanders of Vessels, Owner* of belonging to the Town and Port of Whitehaven, at a foroilhMen Public Meeting called for the Purpose of taking fortheNaTy. into Consideration the Bill, now depending in Parliament, concerning the Manning of His Majesty's Navy, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That there are 486 Vessels belonging to the Port of Whitbaven, including the Out Ports and Creeks within its Survey, which amount altogether to 57,081 Tons -Register Measure, Averaging 117 Tons for each Vessel; and that a Vessel of 117 Tons is usually Navigated from the said Port in the Coal Trade to Ireland with a Captain, One Mate, One Seaman, Averaged for the Navy One good Seaman and Three Apprentices, amounting to Seven Persons, which Number being multiplied by the Number of Vessels amounts to 3,402 Persons, which is only 152 Persons short of the Number of Persons reported at the Custom House to belong to the Shipping of those Ports, and if to this Number is added the additional Number of Men required for the Vessels employed in the Foreign Trade out of the said Port, and which are always better manned, it will be found. to amount to the full Number of Persons so reported at the Custom House; and that it appears from this Statement that there are not above 486 able Seamen belonging to the said Port and the Out Ports and Creeks aforesaid, exclusive of Mates fit for the Service of His Majesty's Navy, which the Petitioners conceive to be little more than One Half of the Number that would be required to be raised according to the Terms of the said Act, but, from Experience, the Petitioners are convinced that the Number of good Seamen is not so large as may appear from the above Statement, because many of their Ships after being laden are frequently detained in Port for Want of Seamen, and it is very usual for Seamen to belong to more Vessels than One in the Coal Trade, and to fail with each alternately j and that the Petitioners conceive, for the Reasons above-stated, that the Provisions of the Bill, now depending, for Manning the Navy, ought not, as it regards the Coal Trade of the said Port, and the Out Ports and Creeks belonging to it, to be carried into Effect, and that if the same pafics into a Law the Number of Seamen required by the Act cannot be furnished, and Landmen, from the Petitioners peculiar local Situation, cannot be procured but in a very great Length of Time, and those at such a Bounty as would nearly annihilate the Petitioners Coal Trade, and they are afraid that the offering of Bounties would be ineffectual, as very large Bounties have frequently been subscribed by the Town for procuring Seamen and Landmen upon many Occasions, but to little Effect; and that, if the said Bill shall pass into a Law, a great Part of the Petitioners Ships in the Coal Trade mult inevitably lay by the Walls unemployed, and a great Number of Persons employed in the Collieries will be thrown into immediate Distress: And therefore, on Behalf of therr.selves, and the Merchants, Ship Owners, and Inhabitants of Whitehaven, praying. That such Relief may be extended to them, in regard to their Inability , to comply with the Provisions of the said intended Act, as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for requiring the Owners and Mailers of Ships belonging to Great Britain to furnish a cer-Vol. L.

tain Number of Men, in Proportion to the Tonnage thereof, for the Service of His Majesty's Navy, previous to their being cleared out on their respectivC Voyages, is re-committed.

A Petition of the Merchants, principal Inhabitants, P«tM«n from Adventurers, Fish Curers, and others, interested and jwToflpw-concerned in the Pilchard Fishery in Mount's Bay, re- zance again* siding in, and belonging to, the Town of Penzance, in the County of Cornwall, was presented to the House, iy„ piM g»n* and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are informed a Petition has been presented to the House, for Leave to bring in a Bill to erect a Pier at the Village of Newlyn, in Mount's. Bay aforesaid, and that the Expence thereof be paid by a Duty to be imposed on.

Pilchards, and other Fish cured at the said Village, and a Tonnage or Duty imposed on all Vessels entering such Pier, alledging that such Pier is necessary for the Protection and Safety of the Boats and Craft used in the Pilchard Fishery carried on there: That the Petitioners, most seriously alarmed at such an Attempt, big with Mischief and Ruin to all Persons interested and concerned in such Pilchard Fishery, beg Leave to state to the House their Objections to the said Bill being passed into a Law; that several of the Petitioners are largely concerned in such Fishery, and have, for a Number of Years lad past, laid out, expended, and loft, very considerable Sums of Money, in carrying the same on, and, in case such Pier be built by a Duty on the Pilchard Fishery, it will in future amount nearly, if not entirely, to a Prohibition, for the Petitioners are well informed, that such Pifcr will require upwards of £. 6,000 to erect*it, and there are only, on an Average, between Five and Six thousand Hogsheads of Pilchards Annually cured at the said Village of Newlyn, and the Petitioners are fully convinced that, without the Assistance of the Merchants, and Persons of Property, in the said Town of Penzance, the Sean Pilchard Fishery cannot be carried on to any Extent at the Village of Newlyn, a Number of poor Men will be thrown out of Employ, and a Nurfcry of Seamen loft; and, the Petitioners beg further to add, that there is already at the said Village of Newlyn, a safe and convenient Pier for the Protection of the Boats and Craft used in the Fishery there, and such Petitioners Assertions are groundless when they state they are much hindered and obstructed in carrying on the Fishery, and the Boats and Crafc not properly protested at present, for a great Number of Boats are lodged during the Winter at various Places in Mount's Bay, particularly in the Parish of Madron, the Towns of Penzance and Marazion, not for want of Room or Protection in the Pier (there being sufficient Space for all Boats that have, for a Number of Years, been usually wintered there) but for the Purpose of easing the Adventurers in the Payment of Tythes for Fish caught by such Boats, and the Fast is, that very few Boats are now wintered at Newlyn, therefore the Petitioners believe that such Pier is not so much intended for the Protection of the Pilchard Fishery as for the Emolument of some few interested Individuals who have Property near the Spot such intended Pier is to be erected on; and that, should such Pier be builr, and Quay Dues imposed on Vessels putting in there, it will most materially injure the Petitioners, and the Inhabitants of the Town of Penzance at large, who have laid out great Sums of Money in erecting 'Warehouses, and other necessary Convcniencies forluch Vessels, as shall, from Stress of Weather or otherwise, take Shelter at the said Pier of Penzance, exclusive of the Loss that will be sustained by the Corporation of the said Town, who have expended, from Time to Time, many Thousand Pounds in building and repairing the said Pier at Penzance: And therefore praying the House to take the Petitioners Objections into Consideration,

Happiness of the People, especially all those numerous Gaffes concerned in, or dependant on, Trade and Manufactures, by the Distress which may be occasioned from a Stagnation in Commerce; therefore praying, That the House will take the Premises into their most fi-rious Consideration, and enaCt fonie more equitable Mode, as shall seem most proper to the House, of railing such a Supply of Men for the Navy of Great Britain as the Exigencies of the State may require, to which good and necessary Purpose the Petitioners will gladly contribute in common with the rest of His Majesty's Subjects.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for requiring the Owners and Masters of Ships Belonging to Great Britain to furnish a certain Number of Men, in Proportion to the Tonnage thereof, for the Service of His Majesty's Navy, previous to their being cleared out on their respective Voyages, is re-committed.

A Petition of the several Persons, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, being severally Owners and Part Owners of Ships or Vessels, registered at the Port of Sunderland, near the Sea, in the County of Durham, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are informed, a Bill is now before the House for requiring the Owners and Mailers of Ships belonging to Great Britain, to furnish a certain Number of Men, in Proportion to the Tonnage thereof for the Service of His Majesty's Navy; and Repre-fenting to the House, that, if the said Bill should pass into a Law, the Intention thereof would be defeated, as far as it would affect the Coal Trade carried on from the Port of Sunderland, inasmuch as it will be utterly impossible to procure the Seamen and Land-men in the Proportion required by the Bill: That the Decrease of Seamen in Time of War is always very great, but at this Juncture it is particularly so, the Dread and Fear entertained of the Impress Service by young Men, in the interior Parts of the Country, prevents Numbers becoming Apprentices to the Sea Service, and several Instances have occurred, during the present War, where Apprentices, contrary to Law, have been imprefied into His Majesty's Service, the Consequence is, that the Petitioners arc put to great Expence and inconvenience in procuring the necessary Number of Hands to navigate their Ships, and, noc being able altogether to raise able bodied Seamen, they are obliged to accept old and infirm Men, to whom they pay from Eight to Ten Guineas a Piece per Voyage Coastwise, who, before the Commencement of the War, were not able to support themselves, and, with respctft to Landmen, the large Bounties offered by those employed in the Recruiting Service renders it out of the Power of the Petitioners to procure them;

and that, supposing it were posa'ole for the Petitioners to furnish Seamen and Landmen in a more limited Degree than what is required by the Bill* they are convinced, even in that Cafe, the Price that would be demanded by each Seaman and Landman to be pro- cured would be such as could not be borne by the Owners of Ships employed in the Coal Trade, and the Petitioners are of Opinion, it would on an Average, require One-fifth Part of the Value of their Ships to furnish the Men required by the Bill for the first Six Months; and that the Petitioners beg Leave to allure the Houfr, that they are ready at all Times to aid and assist His Majesty, as far as they are able, in every reasonable Measure calculated for the Protection and Preservation of His Majesty's Dominions, but they cannot conceive why the Ship Owners are to bear the Whole of the Burthen, and that others of His Majesty's Subjects are to be exempt, who would derive equally as much Benefit from the Measure as those who are now called on solely to contribute and they fiib-mit to the House, whether in any Plan, which has for its Objett the Protection and Preservation of His Majesty's Dominions, and the Properties of His Majesty's Subjects, all Persons in every Situation in Life, whether in Church, Estate, Places under Government, and the Trading Interests of the Country in general, should hot contribute according to their several Circum-llances and Abilities; and the Petitioners cannot help Hating their decided Conviction, that, if the present Bill should pass into a Law, it will operate as a complete Embargo on the Ships and Vefiels of the Petitioners and others employed in the Coal Trade, which mult of Necessity be laid by, and in that same the Ruin of the Petitioners, and all others dependant on the

Trade, must be inevitable i That, if the fcoai Trade carried on from the Port of Sunderland aforesaid, should be (topped or impeded for any Length of Time, the Petitioners are afraid it would be productive.of the most serious Consequences; they have at various Periods experienced disastrous Circumstances from the tumultuous and riotous Proceedings of the labouring People, whose foie Dependence is on the said Trade; and who would by this Means be deprived of Support; to obtain which, it is to be dreaded they would, as on former Occasions, have Recourse to very dangerous Expedients; And therefore the Petitioners, under these Circumstances, beseech the House, That the said Bill may not pass into a Law, and they rely on the Wifdorn and Justice of the House to devise other Means more equal, and better calculated to obtain Men for fupT plying His Majesty's Navy than those pointed out by the Bill.

Orderedi That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for requiring the Owners and Masters of Ships, belonging to Great Britain, to furnish a certain Number of Men, in Proportion to the Tonnage thereof, for the Service of His Majesty's Navy, previous to their being cleared out on their rclpective Voyages, is re-committed.

Petition from certain Inhabitant* of Durham against the above-mentioned Petition*

228 17 0 Februarii.A. 1795.

Ordered, That the said Account do lie upon the Table, to be perused by the Members of the House.

A Petition of the Mayor, Aldermen, Freemen, Clergy, and other Inhabitants of the City of Durham and its Neighbourhood, was presented to the House, and read i Setting forth* That the War in which these Kingdoms are now unfortunately involved, has already proved highly injurious to their Trade and Commerce, and, if persevered in, may, by interrupting their established Intercourse with Foreign Nations, and loading the Manufactures of this Country with additional Burthens, finally effect their DeftruClion: That, although the Commercial Interest has more essentially suffered from the War, yet every other Part of the Community has feyerely felt its Pressure: That, while the Petitioners are Personally sensible of these Evils, Humanity leads them to deplore the Lives of their brave Countrymen sacrificed in this unavailing Contest: That they fee, with Regret, the present Urge Expenditure of Public Money, which, if long continued) may produce such a Derangement in the Finances as must endanger the Constitution of any Country: That, sincerely attached as the Petitioners are to the Constitution of these Realms, they should think it their Duty to repel, to the utmost of their Power, the Attempts of any Nation whatsoever to interfere in their Internal Legislation, they must therefore consider the Continuation of the War, for the Purpose of changing the present Government of France, as totally repugnant to that grand Principle of Morality “ of doing to others “ as we would they should do unto us/' as pregnant with the greatest Calamities to this Country, and altogether impracticable, as melancholy Experience has fully demonstrated: That the Petitioners, deeply impressed with these important Truths, do therefore, in Justice to themselves and their Posterity, humbly Address their Representatives in Parliament assembled to interpose, by the Wisdom of their Councils, that the much wanted and invaluable Blessings of Peace may be speedily restored; and that if, after a Declaration on the Part of this Country of their willingness to enter into a Treaty upon fair, open, and reasonable Terms, the Enemy should persevere in Hostilities, the Petitioners* however desirous of Peace, will be found as forward in defending the just Claims, the Honour, and the Independence of these Kingdoms, as any Body of His Majesty's Subjects whatever.

A Petition of the Inhabitants of the City and Neighbourhood of Durham, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was also presented t6 the House, and read Setting forth. That the Petitioners, strongly disapproving of all Attempts to interrupt the Deliberations of Parliament (especially in this momentous Crisis) by the Obtrusion of the Sentiments of Individuals, on important Subjects, concerning which private Individuals can, in general, have no authentic or complete Information, beg Leave to express their deep Concern at finding themselves under a Necessity of troubling the House with their Disavowal of a Petition which they understand is presented, or intended to be presented to the House, by fomc Persons of the said City and Neighbourhood, relative to the Time or Mode of making Peace: That the Petitioners firmly rely on the Wisdom of His Majesty, and of the Great Council of the Nation, and on that Paternal Goodness which strongly inclines His Majesty (ever con-fulting the Happinels and Welfare of His People) to terminate the Calamities of War as speedily as a safe and honourable Opportunity shall present itself: That in this firm and Constitutional Confidence they humbly pray that the greac Resources of this powerful Nation may continue to be exerted in such Manner as shall be moll conducive to the secure and permanent Establishment of a Peace, confident with the true Interest, Dignity, and Glory of the British Empire.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table.

A Petition of the Ship Owners of the Port of New- Petition from castle, residing in North and South Shields, was pre- fhh*^j, Ia^r,nft fented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That requiring the Petitioners are much alarmed at the present Bill Owner* of pending in Parliament, requiring Owners and Mailers nifhMen for of Ships to furnish Men for the Navy, and they cannot the Navy, but observe, that the Necessity oF a Measure, at once so new and unprecedented, can- have its Origin only in the Impolicy of the Admiralty at the Beginning of ' the present War in impressing Apprentices, and thereby deterring young Men from entering the Sea Service} so discouraging has the ConduCt of the Admiralty been to the Sea Service, that the Petitioners can say, with Truth, the Nursery for Seamen is nearly annihilated:

That the Bill appears to the Petitioners to be extremely partial and oppressive, inasmuch as, contrary to any former Mode of Taxation, it levies a very unequal and heavy Burthen upon a small Portion of the Inhabitants, the Petitioners, in Defence of the whole Nation: That, should the present Bill pass into a Law, many of the Petitioners must be ruined, as it. is with the utmost Difficulty they can carry on their Trade, by Reason of the high Wages now paid, and it will not be in their Power to procure Men, Seamen cannot be had, and the Recruiting Service has raised the Bounties of Landmen beyond the Ability of the Petitioners and the Profits of their Trade j That the Petitioners cannot but lament the Situation of this Country, which requires such strong Measures, and think it their Duty to observe, that the Impolicy of the present Bill will, in their Opinion, operate still further to de-press the Kingdom and cramp its Commerce, and they are persuaded many of the Vessels of this Nation must be laid by, while the Ports will be crowded with Foreign Vessels importing the Cargoes our own Ships would be otherwise employed in bringing, and that the . Petitioners are as willing as any other of His Majesty's Subjects to contribute their Quota to the Necessities of the State: And therefore praying, That the House will not pass the present Bill into a Law, but adopt some Mode- more equal and impartial, as they shall fee l

fit.

A'Petition of all the Merchants and Ship Owners Petition from of the Port of (Veils, in the County of Norfolk, assembled at a General Meeting, and whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was also presented to the House, and read j Setting forth. That the Petitioners, having ' maturely taken into their Consideration the Bill, now depending in the House* for the more effectually Manning His Majesty's Navy, find that they (agreeably to the proposed Mode) will be obliged to furnish a no less Number of Landmen than Sixty-seven, or Thirty-three Seamen and One Landman; and that the Petitioners know it to be wholly impossible for theip to provide Seamen, as they are unable even to have their own Vessels properly manned, and, from the Enquiries they have made, they find the Country so much drained by Recruiting Parties, that it will also be out of their Power to furnish their Quota of Landmen; and the Petitioners therefore foresee a total Stagnation of the Trade of the said Port (except in the Angle Article of Corn) as the certain Consequence of the Bill, in its present Shape, passing into a Law, and the numerous Poor, who thence derive their Subsistence, must of course become unemployed: I mprefled with the Truth -of these Premises, the Petitioners intreat the House to take the same into Consideration, and adopt some other Mode of procuring Men in the present Emergency, that may be unattended with the Hardships that must inevitably result from the One now proposed.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill 3 for

Mr.Frospitt'n A Petition of Thomas Mort , Esquire, Lord

Wo^^fnd* l^C Manor of Jljlley, and Owner and Occupier of

Piinin^on' considerable Estates and Lands through which the

Can*J Bill. Line of the intended Canal hereinafter mentioned is laid down, upon the Plan thereof, was prefen ted to the House, and read; Taking Notice of the Bill to Enable the Most Noble Francis Duke of ,

to make a Navigable Cut from his present Navigation, in the Townshipof Wo, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, to the Township of near the

Town of Leigh, in the said County; and Setting .5 forth. That a Petition in Favour of the said Bill has been presented. to the House by the said Duke of Bridgewater, in which, amongst other Things, it is alledged, that the making and maintaining such Navigable Cut as aforesaid would be of great Benefit to all Persons residing, or having Estates, near the Line thereof; and, by reason of the said Allegation, and of the great Privileges and Advantages that wer« held out by the Agents of the said Duke of Bridgewater to t?.ife to the Petitioner, and his Estates, by reason of his having and using the said Navigable Cut, he was prevailed upon to give his Assent to the making of the fame; and that the Petitioner is advised that the said Bill recites the Two following Acts of Parliament, the One made and passed in the Thirty-second Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, *« An Act to enable the Most Noble “ Francis Duke of Bridgewater to make a Navigable M Cut or Canal from a certain Place in the Township of Salford, to or near Mill and Middlewood,

“ in the Manor of Worjley, and to or near a Place “ called Hollin Ferry, in the County Palatine of Lan-" caster,” and the other in the Thirty-third Year of

the same Reign, intituled, “ An Act to enable the Most Noble Francis Duke of Bridgewater to make a Navigable Cut or Canal from or near Worjley Mill,over the River Irwell, to the Town of

“ chester, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, and to or near Longford Bridge, in the Township of u Stretford, in the said County,” and by a Reference to the said recited Acts gives generally to the said Duke of Bridgewater all the Powers and Authorities therein contained subject to the like Restrictions, and to the Controul of Commissioners named in the said First recited Act, but without affording to the Petitioner, as Owner and Occupier of Lands on the Line of the said proposed Canal, the Advantages held out> to him by the Agents of the said Duke, who solicited the Assent of the Petitioner, and which the Petition of the said Duke to the House most obviously and particularly offered as an Inducement to the House to grant an Act to enable him to make the said Cut; and that the Petitioner submits to the House that, agreeably to the Rules thereof, he ought to have had the said recited Acts, so referred to by the said Bill, presented to him as well as the said Bill, for his Perusal and Inspection, that he might have been apprized of the Contents and Operations thereof, whereas nothing more than the said Bill, in Blanks, has hitherto been shewn to him; and that, at the Time the said Bill was presented to the Petitioner, from his Inexperience in Schemes of this Nature, and from its Brevity, it appeared to him, and so he understood it to be, nothing more than the Outlines of an intended Bill, and conceiving that, by the Rules of the House, he was intitled to, and should have had, a perfect Copy of a Bill comprizing the Powers and Restrictions under which the said Cut was to be made, and proper Clauses for the Protection of Land Owners and Occupiers of Lands presented to him, previously to its being read a Second Time, the Petitioner declined perusing what he deemed to be a mete Sketch, under the Persuasion that a full Bill to enable the said Duke to cut the said Canal would, in due Time, be laid before him; and that, at the Time of the passing of the said recited Acts, Inland Navigations were in their Infancy, and their Effects on Landed Property little known, and the Petitioner submits, that, on referring to the said recited Acts, the same will be found very inadequate to the Protection of private Property, or to secure the Benefit held out to the Petitioner, and other Owners of Land, by the Petition of the said Duke, and the Petitioner is advised that, if the said Bill be suffered to pass into a Law, it will only afford certain Advantages and Privileges to the said Duke of Bridgewater, but not to the Public or to the Petitioner, and will be very injurious to the Petitioner and to his Estates: And therefore praying. That he may be heard, by his Counsel and Agents, against the said Bill, so far as the same affects his Interests, and that the same may not pass into a Law in the Manner and Form proposed, or that he may have such other Relief in the Prc,mises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the said Bill is committed: And that the Petitioner be heard, by his Counsel, or Agents, before the said Committee, upon his Petition, if he thinks fit.

Ordered, That it bean Instruction to the said Committee, That they do admit Counsel to be heard, ac the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill against the said Petition.

Ordered, That all have Voices who come to the Committee to whom the said Bill is committed.

A Petition of the thereunder-signed Electors of the Petition from ancient Town and Borough of Southwark, was pre- 'TsoufhwwT fen ted to the House, and read; Setting forth, That resetting the a Petition was lately presented to the House, signed War* by the Bailiff of the said Borough, or his Deputy, purporting to be, “ a Petition of the Electors of the “ Borough of Southwark:"That, at the Meeting in

which the said Petition was resolved, a great Number of dilbrderly People (not Eleftorr.) drawn together by inflammatory Hand Bills from divers Parts of the Metropolis, forced their Way into the Town Hall,

where they voted Refolutioris, to which (as the Petitioners believe) very few of the Eledtofs of the said Borough affirmed; That the Petitioners, always holding it to be the Right of the Subjects of this Realm to petition the several Branches of the Legislature (a Right which themselves have frequently exercised) would have thought it inexpedient, at this Time, to have laid their Sentiments before the House, if they had not deemed it necessary to vindicate the Character of the Electors of the said Borough from that Appearance of distrust of the Wisdom of Parliament,. which they apprehend might be imputed to them, if the Language of the Petition before alluded to were not thus publicly disavowed: That the Petitioners beheld with the greatest Satisfaction, the Dignity; and the Justice of His Majesty's Conduit, in preserving the most perfeit Neutrality during the first Years of the Disorders of the French Nation, and saw, with equal Regret, the Necessity arise of repelling, by Force, the unprovoked Hostility of a People, who, having themselves abandoned every Moral and Social Principle, endeavoured to plunge the Nations around them in equal Misery, and, under the Mask of Fraternity, to l'eize on their Possessions, and subject them to their Dominion: That the Petitioners have observed with Concern (but not with Dismay) the unchecked Usurpations of that People during the last Campaign, but the Glorious Successes of the Navy

(which in no former War maintained a more decided Superiority over the Naval Power of our Enemies) the Bravery of our Fleets and Armies, the Rel'ources of our Country, and, above all, the undaunted Spirit of its Inhabitants, induce the Petitioners to rely with Confidence that, under the Blessing of Divine Providence, the Independence of these Kingdoms will be preserved , and the Petitioners fully depend that the Principles which guided His Majesty's Conduct in abstaining from Hostilities as long as the Interests of H is People would allow, will prevent this unhappy "War from being protradted One Hour longer than is necessary to the permanent Security of that great End, and that whatever Form of Government the French Nation may aflTume will not prove any Obstacle to

that desirable Fufpofe: Finally, the Petitioners be-fcech the House that they will receive this Declaration as a Testimony of the Attachment of the Klc-rtors of Southwark to His Majesty's Person and Government, and of their Reliance on the Wisdom of Parliament.

Office for Auditing the Public Accounts,

Somerset London 19th August 1791.

My Lords,

We duly received Mr. Steele's Letter of the 7th of August 1789, communicating to us your Lordships Determinations on several Accounts, which had been stated to the Board of Treasury, by the late Auditors of the Imprefts, in which Letter your Lordships signify your Allowance of some Parts of the said States, and refer other Parts for our R^-examination.

We immediately took into our Consideration the said Letter and Accounts, and gave Directions for such Examinations to be made, as were necessary to enable us to report co your Lordships on all the Accounts referred; but it appearing to us that those of Richard Oswald, Esquire, were of the greatest Importance, they were, from the First, the'principal Object of our Attention, and will be now the only Subject of this Report.

We are sorry it has been delayed so long; but notwithstanding our unremitted Application to these Accounts ' at all Times when the other Business of the Office would permit, yet an Investigation of Transactions at a Period so remote from the Time when the Service was performed, and after the Accountant was dead, was attended with Circumstances which rendered the Delay unavoidable. "*

A considerable portion of Time was taken up in searching amongst the unarranged Heaps of examined Vouchers remaining in this Office at the Time of pur Establishment, in order to discover those upon which the Commifiary Account, and the referred Articles of the Contract Accounts, were allowed by the late Auditor; and ailb, in attending for the Return to our Precept issued to the Rcpresentatives of the Accountant, requiring them to deliver all such original Vouchers, or other Documents respecting those Accounts, as were its their Custody, Power, or Possession.

The Search in this Office discovered Mr. OJwald\ Books of Account for both Services, and sundry other Books, which we at first apprehended were the only Vouchers upon which the Articles of the Contract Ac-Vou L. 3 S count

i$o io° Februarii. *195-

count in Question were allowed by the late Auditors, no other Description of Vouchers being, as we conceived, exprefifed in the Receipt given to the Accountant by the Deputy Auditor, for the said Account and Vouchers; but although none other than the before-mentioned have been found in this Office, The Board, upon Examination of Mr. Bray and Mr, Harris, late Deputy Auditors, and who were Clerks in the Office of

Mr. Aiflalie,at the Time Mr. Oswald's Accounts and Vouchers were delivered, have been informed by these

Gentlemen, that they verily believe the particular Vouchers belonging to Mr. Oswald' % Accounts were delivered into Auditor Aijlabie'sOffice, during the Time Mr. and Mr. were Deputy Auditors,

with several Vouchers, which they believe were Vouchers belonging to the Commifiary Account.

From the Representatives of the Accountant, we obtained some Duplicates of Vouchers, and fundrv Copies and Translations of Receipts and Certificates, respecting the Contract Service, but nothing on the Subject of the Commissary Account.

These Documents being the only Proofs of the aCtual Delivery of Supplies and Performance of Services by Mr. Oswald, in his Character of Contractor, which we have been able to procure, ana being, in many Rcfpects, deficient and exceptionable in their Nature, we shall take Leave to trouble your Lordships with a particular Description of them before we report our Opinion on the several Articles of his ContraCt Account, which have been referred to us; in order that your Lordships may be, at the same Time, informed of the Nature of the Vouchers upon which we have been obliged to form that Opinion.

The only Vouchers found in this Office, relative to Mr. s ContraCt Account, consists of 21 Books,

respectively bearing Titles correspondent to the several referred Articles of the late Auditor's State of that Account, and contain Extracts of original Vouchers for Deliveries made, for Services performed, and for Lofies sustained. To 19 of these Books, Certificates are annexed under the Hand and Seal of Notary Public, attesting that he had compared and examined the original Vouchers in the German and French Languages, with the ExrraCts of the Translation thereof, and that he found the same to agree, as far as related to Sums, Quantities, Numbers, &c. To One Book a Note is added, that there is no Notarial Certificate, the Voucher being in the English Language; and another Book is accompanied by the original Certificate, of which it contains the Extract. — The Words of the original Vouchers are in no same translated in these Books, and in some Instances neither the Names, nor Descriptions of the Persons, whqfe Signatures mult have been subscribed, are given; so that for those Articles where we have been obliged to adopt these Books as Vouchers without other Evidence, all Examination how far the Claim for Allowance is warranted under the Contract has been precluded, except from what appears in the general Title of each Book, and from the Nature of the Supplies and Services, such Circumstances as might have appeared on the Face of the Receipts themselves, deltruCtive of the Accountant's Claim for Allowance, do not appear by this Mode of extrading the Particulars from the Vouchers, instead of translating them at Length.

The Papers produced by the Representative of the Accountant, are few and of little Importance, excepc Six Parcels, containing upwards of 400'Copies of Receipts and Certificates, the Extrads of which compose the particular Items of such of the Books before-mentioned, as have served to vouch that Part of Article N° X. in the late Auditor's State, which relates to Wheat, Meal, Bread, &c. spoiled, loft, or taken by the Enemy.

As this Head of Charge appeared to us the moll doubtful of any of those referred, it being probable that the Accountant would endeavour to obtain from the Public as great a Part as possible of his Lolfes, although a Proportion of them might, on a Scrutiny, be found to be incidental to the Execution of the Service he had engaged in, we regarded these Papers, though Copies only, as material; and have accordingly investigated and examined them at extra Hours, with great Labour and particular Attention, comparing the Articles of Loss, and the Circumstances as exprefifed in the Copies, with the Conditions of the ContraCt; — The Result of this Examination has been a considerable Defalcation in this Article.

The Documents before described, have been the only Proofs before us of the aCtual Delivery of Supplies and Performance of Services by the Contractor. For his Authorities, the Rates, and Prices, and the requifttc Forms of Receipts and Certificates, we resorted to the Contracts and the Copies of Minutes, which, upon our Application, were transmitted by your Lordships Orders from the Treasury.

Some Doubts having arisen in the Course of our Examination, respecting the Deliveries of Bread to the Troops, and the Allowance to the Contractor of such Part as was frequently rejected by the Regiments, we thought it proper to request the Information of such Gentlemen as were in the Exercise of Polls, Civil and Military, in the Army in Germany during the Period of the Account, and have accordingly been attended by the following Gentlemen; viz1.General Craig, Sir William Fawcett, Sir Cockburn then Commissary of Controul, William Fra/er, Esquire, another Commissary, Gibbs Crawfurd, Esquire, Secretary to Thomas Orby Hunter, Superintendant General, and Mr. Harman, a Quarter Matter Serjeant of the Brigade of Guards, who, being Witoeflcs of the several TransaCtions, have described to us the Manner of executing the Deliveries of Bread, &c. and of furnishing the Waggons; and front them we were informed of several Circumstances which give us Reason to believe, that in many Cafes, it was not possible for the Contractor to comply literally with the Terms of his Agreement: We ought also, in Justice to Mr. Oswald, to state to your Lordships, that all those Gentlemen who spoke to his Character, concurred in their Testimony of his Diligence and Integrity in the Execution of the Services he had engaged in.

In regard to the Observations of Mr. Martin and Mr. Cornwall on this Account, we have attentively perused the fame, together with Mr. Oswald's Replies, and although we think the latter has almnft in every Instanee satisf.tClorily ar.fwered the Objections urged by the former Gentlemen, yet we have never loft Sight of these Objections, retorting to them constantly, as Cautions in the Investigation of the Vouchers before us.

We now proceed to report to your Lordships our Opinion of the several Articles of the late Auditor's State of Mr. Oswald's Contract Account, which have been referred for our Re-examination, being the Result of an attentive Investigation of the several Materials above described; referring your Lordships to the State itself herewith returned, wherein the several Articles are marked with Numbers, corresponding with the following:

Article

35 Geo. III. 4o° Februarii.

*5*

Article ift.- — Charges of transporting Wheat and Meal — —

The Board, upon examining and perusing the Notary's Book, produced as a Voucher for this Article, and having read so much of Mr. Oswald's Answer to Mr. Martin's Observations as relate thereto, is of Opinion, upon full Consideration of those Papers, that the Whole appears to us to be so satisfactorily vouched, as to be entitled to Allowance.

Article ad. — For Wheat Bread delivered to Guards, Servants, and other Persons attending General and Staff Officers, and British Commissaries; as also to Hospitals, Boors, French Prisoners, and Re-

The Board, on considering the Information given by Sir William Faiocett touching this Article, is of Opinion, that, although the Charge is not within the Contract, yet, as the Persons victualled appear to be the usual Attendants of the Army, and the Contractor could not refuse to supply such Persons occasionally with Bread, the same should be allowed.

Article 3d. — For Horses killed or ruined by hard Service, and Horses, Waggons, and Harness taken by the Enemy, or destroyed by unavoidable Accidents ——

The Board, upon perusing the Book produced as a Voucher for this Article, is of Opinion the same should be allowed.

Article 4th. — For Horses, Waggons, Harnesses, and Drivers Cloaths, to complete the Deficiencies in the Trains transferred to His Majesty ift June 1761 ——

The Board, on considering a Minute of the Treasury Board' of . the 8th May 176a, do recommend this Article to your Lordships for Allowance, although not within the Contract.

Article 5th. — Money paid by Order of Michael Hatton, Commissary General, to lundry of His Majesty's Hanoverian Magazine Keepers — This Article consists of Six Payments to the King's Magazine Keepers at Hoxter, Hamcln, and in Support of which the

Bo ard have not only the Notarial Book, but also Duplicates of the original Receipts, in the German Language, with the Transiations which have been produced by the Representative of the Accountant, to One of which Receipts is added an Engagement for Payment, signed by Michael Hatton.

As this Money was advanced for the Service of Foreign, and not of British Troops, the Board submita the above Statement of the Particulars of this Article, and the Nature of the Vouchers, for your Lordships Consideration, in what Manner the Accountant should be re-imburf<to the fame, the Service not being within the Terms of the Contract.

Article 6th. — For Wheat Bread delivered to Draughts of different Regiments, and Invalids, &c. in the Garrison of — —

The Board is of Opinion, this-Article should be admitted and allowed.

Article 7th. — Extraordinary Charges on the Supply of Bread to the British Troops, for Duties, Eftafettes, &c. — —

This Article appearing to be Money advanced for the Public Service, the Board recommend to your Lordships, that the same be allowed.

Article 8th. — For Hire of Boors, Waggons, for Transports from the Landing Places on the Rivers to the Magazines — —

The Board is of Opinion^ that this Article is warranted by the Contract; the Allowance thereof is therefore recommended to yOUr Lordships.

t . '

Article 9th. — For W'hear, Wheat Meialr Rye* and Sacks, delivered'over into His Majesty's Magazines at the Expiration of the Contract — It being conformable to the Contract, that the Contractor should be indemnified in Value for such Quantities of Bread and Wheat

as should remain in the Magazines and Storehouses at the Determination of the Contract, and the original Certificate of Daniel IVeir, Esquire, of the Quantities received into the King's Magazines, being before the Board, the Commissioners recommend the Allowance of this Article.

Article ioth.Part ift. — Wheat, Meal, Bread, &c. spoiled, loft, or taken by the Enemy ——

The Board, having had before them, in Addition to the Notarial Books exhibited to the late Auditor in Support of this Article, Copies of the several Vouchers, as described in the former Part of - this Report, upon which the said Books were formed; and having examined the Copy of each Voucher separately, with particular Attention, is of Opinion, that the Accountant, under the Terms of his Contract, can claim Indemnification for a Part only of the Loffcs dated in this Article, amounting, in the Whole, to the Sum of£. 26,035. jjs.$d. j the Remainder of the said Losses, amounting to £.9,537. 6 s. 1 d. are such as the Board is of Opinion were incidental to the Execution of the Service, for which there is no Provision of Indemnification in the Contract, and therefore ought to fall on the Contra#or, and not be allowed in this Account — <

Article toth. Part zd. — Wheat, Meal, Bread, &c. supplied to the German Troops, to sundry German Garrisons, and to the Dire#ors of the King's Bakery, for the Use of German Troops, &c. —

The Board is of Opinion, that this Article is unconne#ed with the Contract, the Supplies having been advanced for the Service of Foreign and not of British Troops, and no. Order being produced ' or alledged, under the Authority of which these Supplies were

furnished; but, in order to favc the Trouble of a separate Reference, the Board takes this Opportunity of stating to your Lordships the following Extra#s of so much of Mr. Answer to Mr.

Martin's Observations as relates to this Article; at the same Time submitting to your Lordships Consideration, in what Manner the Accountant should be re-imbursed the Amount thereof.

“ With respe# to the above Article, I appeal to the Vouchers, " by which it will appear, that the Transa#ions were real, and “ existed in Germany, though they were not satisfied there, being a Species of Disbursement on the King's Account, to His Troops in Difirefs, unconne#ed with my Contract, running on in a progressive Detail at all the different Stations where 1 had Bakeries and Magazines, of which I could not have a perfe# Knowledge, nor could procure proper Attestations until the Service was over; at which Period only I could venture to withdraw the People or Agents under whose inspe#ion these Disbursements were made; and that I received no Satisfa#ion in Germany for any Part thereof, I can, with equal Assurance, appeal to all the Accounts that were settled for me in that Country.”

<c

Article toth. Part 3d. — Loss of 374 Bags of Wheat, by the Loss of a

Vessel on the WeJer ——

The Board is of Opinion, that this Loss, although not within the

Letter of the Contract, is within the Spirit of it; and such a Loss as it was not in the Power of the Accountant to avoid: The Commissioners, therefore, recommend to your Lordships, that the same be allowed.

Article 1 ith. — Difference in the Purchase of sundry Quantities of Wheat, Meal? and Rye, bought in different Parts of the Country for the immediate Supply of the Army, when, by reason of the Failure of Transports, the necessary Provision imported by him could not be brought up from his Magazines — —

The Board is of Opinion, this Article does not come within the Letter of the Contract; but as the said Charge appears to have been unavoidable, and the Difference of Prices well vouched, the Board fubinits to your Lordships the reasonablenefs of a Re-imbursement.

If your Lordships shall approve of* the aforegoing Report, the Accountant will be in Surplusage upon his Contract Account, including Article 5th and Article 10th Part ad, the Sum of £.32,671. ar. a§5. in (lead of the Sum of £.45,195. 7 J. 4 d.as Itated by the late Auditor.

In regard to the Account of Mr. OJwaldas Commissary, we have already informed your Lordships, that the Accountant's Book of Accounts has been the only Document discovered in this Office} none of the Vouchers upon which the Articles were allowed by the late Auditor can now be found, nor have any Papers relative thereto been obtained from the Representatives of the Accountant. We have therefore no Materials before us to enable us to obey your Lordships Command in the Re-examination of this Account, but the said Book of Accounts} the late Auditors State of it after Examination, as referred by your Lordships; the Observa^ tions of Mr Martinand Mr. Cornwall, with Mr. Oswald'sAnswers thereto} and some Minutes of the Treasury

Board, the Copies of which we received by your Lordships Orders.

From the Papers it appears, that Mr. Oswald was in November 1758, by Direction of the Lords of the Treasury, called to England from Germany, where he then was in the Execution of his Contracts, and by their Lotdships requested to give every Assistance in his Power to Mr. who had been recently appointed

Commissary General of the* Army in Germany , that after Mr. Oswald had returned to Germany with Mr. Hunter, he undertook, at that Gentleman's Request, and under his Direction, Firff, The Poll; of Commissary attending an Army of Twelve Thousand Men, sent into HeJJe,which Service continued from the 19th of February to the 1 ith of December 1759: Secondly, The same Port attending an Army of the like Force detached into Saxony, under the Command of his Serene Highness the Hereditary Prince of from the 13th of December

Vol. L. 3 T 1759.

2-54 2o° A. 1795.

17 59» to *^e 20th of February 1760: Thirdly, He acted as Commissary in of the Army under Duke Ferdinand ot Brutjwiek, after Mr. Hunter'i return to , and until Colonel s Arrival, the said Ser-

vice succeeding that upon the Expedition into Saxony, which ended in February 1760: And, Fourthly, Having relinquished his Waggon Contraft, and agreed with the Lords of the Treasury for the Transfer of all the Waggons and Horses, &c. to Government, which took Place the ift of June 1762, he undertook the Office of Commissary for conducting the Business of the said Waggon Trains, on the Part of the Public, in which Poll he continued to act till the Waggons, &c. were delivered over to Mr. Paumier, by Order of Mr. PowHall, the rft of January 1763; and the Account of the Monies received and expended in the Execution of these several Services is the Account in Question.

It does not appear that Mr. Oswald had any Commission appointing him to either of the before-mentioned Offices, or any Instructions for his Guidance in the Execution of them; from which, if any such had existed,

the Nature of his Duty and Extent of his Powers might have been collected: — The only Trace of Authority

from your Lordships Board which we can find, relates to the latter Service, and appears upon a Treasury Minute of the 8th of May 1762, wherein it is stated, “ that Mr. attends and relinquishes his Waggon

“ Contraft;” and an Agreement is made for transferring the Waggons and Horses to the Public; and Mr. Oswald offers to give the Public his Personal Attention to, and Inspection of, the Management of this Train, if it was thought his Superintendance wasufeful; and this Offer seems to be tacitly accepted by the Treasury Board as One of the Conditions of the Transfer.

After an attentive Examination of the several Papers before-mentioned, we are of Opinion, that the Articles of Disbursement are such as must have arisen upon Services in which the Accountant was engaged; that the late Auditor reports them to have been well vouched to him, when he made his Statement of the Ac-jC-a,173. it. oi<t. count; and Mr. Oswald having voluntarily charged himself with a large Sum, stamps feme Degree of Credit upon the whole of these Transaftions.

The Charge of £.2,283 for the Accountant's Pay at the Rate of £.3 a Day, wants the Support of a Commission or Warrant from His Majesty, or from the Board of Treasury; but as no Doubt can be entertained of the Execution of the Services by the Accountant, and as the Rate of Pay is no more, as we apprehend, than has been usually allowed for such Services, it does not appear to us that any reasonable Objection can be urged to this Article, except so far as relates to the Superintendance of the Waggon Trains after they were transferred to the Public; for which Service Mr. s Offer to give the Public his Personal Attention,

may possibly be deemed so far a Part of the Agreement between the Board of Treasury and him, as to preclude him from any Claim of Pay for it.

In respect to the Observations of Mr. Martin and Mr. Cornwall, we must in this Cafe, as in that of the Contraft Account, represent to your Lordships, that Mr. Oswald has answered them in so satisfactory a Manner, as to have removed, in our Opinion, any Objection to this Account arising from those Observations.

Upon the whole we are therefore of Opinion, that no good Ground appears from the Materials-which have been before us, respecting this Accoynt, to have so long delayed the passing of the Account, or to make any Defalcation from the Balance of £. 9,017. 12 s.4 stated by the late Auditor to be due to the Accountant, except of the Sum of £. 735, being the Amount of his Pay as Commissary for superintending the Waggon Trains after they were transferred to the Public; which if your Lordships think proper to disallow, will reduce the said Balance to the Sum of £. 8,282. 12 4

We have the Honour to be, with great Respect,

and most humble Servants,

Brought forward — ^ By the Treaty a Corps of 14,000 Men is to be employed in His Britannick Majesty's Service, and a Subsidy of 450,000 Crowns Banco is to be paid to H. S. H. for the said Corps. This Corps, including Staff Servants, &c. confided, according to a Schedule annexed to the Treaty, to 12,699 > and the Object of the present Claim is to obtain a proportional Subddy for the Surplus of 699 Men. The Comptrollers are of Opinion, this Claim should not be allowed, for the following Rcafoos; 5*191. n 9 62,912 14 III 163.926 5 6

viz*.

ift. Because the Treaty grants a specific Subsidy for a specific Body of Men; which Subsidy was ,

regularly, granted by Parliament, and received by the Landgrave's Agent throughout the whole War, without any Claim being made for a further Sum until the present Application, ad. That if it be contended that the Subsidy is to be in Proportion to the actual Number of Effedtives, a Deduction should be made whenever this Body of Men did not amount to 12,000 Effectives j and it will be admitted, that this Corps, while employed in never amounted to that Number. Article N* 21. *

Widows Fund — — — The Widows fund in the Establishment is Part of Extraordinary Grants, at 4J. a Day per Company. The Purposes for which these 41. are allowed are as follows $ viz*. To the Colonel, for Clothing loft by Desertion. To the Captains, for Expences in Recruiting. 31,235 II 2

To the Regimental Agents, for their Trouble, &c. To the Fund established for the Support of Officers Widows. The Colonel of a Foreign Regiment does not clothe it, neither do the Captains recruit, both these Services being performed by their respective Sovereigns, for which the Levy Money, Pay, and Subsidy, is the Compensation. The Regimental Agent is an Officer not known in Foreign Service, nor is there any Widows Fund established. Were this Claim for Widows Pensions therefore to he acceded to, the Landgrave would have an Allowance for an Expence which he i,s notsubjedt to Similar Claims have been also uniformly disallowed to the other Foreign Troops in British Pay.

A Petition of Rogers P, Esquire, 'Elizabeth Day, and Amy Day, Spinfters, Neate, Richard

Capper, William Smith, Esquires, and Thomas Noyes, Esquire (Committee of the Estate of Robert Hucks, Esquire) and Job Woodman, Gentleman, Owners and Proprietors of Lands and other Hereditaments in the Line of the intended Canal from to

Saint Alban's, was presented to the House, and redd; Setting forth. That an Act was passed in the Thirty-third Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for enabling a certain Company, called The Grand -fhn Company, to make and maintain a Navigable Canal from the Oxford Canal Navigation at in the

County of Northampton, to join the River Thames at New Brentford, in the County of Middlesex, and also

to make Collateral Cuts from the said Canal, but the Petitioners have been informed, and believe, that a Very intonfiderablePart of the Works, proposed to be done by the said Act, hath yet been completed, and that, by the said Act, the Company are enabled to raise the Sum of 600,000 for the Purposes therein Hated, and to expend any Part thereof in procuring other Acts of Parliament for making such further Extension of their Works as they may think proper: Thar, accordingly, in the last Session of Parliament, a Bill was brought into the House for making a Navigable Cut from the Town of Saint Alban's, to communicate with the Grand Junffion Navigation at Watford, in the

Cottnty of Hertford, which Bill, after a long Discussion of its Merits, was rejected by the House, but, notwithstanding such Decision, the Business is again resumed, and a Bill has been brought into the House this present Session for enabling the said Grand Junction Company to make a Navigation from the said Town of Watford to the said Town of Saint Alban's, which the Petitioners cannot but consider as subjecting them to a Repetition of Hardship, inasmuch as a few Individuals are thereby forced to contend with a wealthy and powerful Body, whillt the Merits have previously been decided; and that the Town of Saint Alban's is situated Eastward of the Grand JunBion Canal only Four Miles Five Furlongs and Thirty-seven Poles, and Westward of Hertford, where the River Lea becomes Navigable, about Twelve Miles, and the Direction of the intended Cut from Saint Alban's to Watford is nearly parallel with the said Grand Junc-

tion Canal, from which its mean Distance is about Four Miles, and therefore the Market of Saint Alban's, already provided with an excellent Road to Watford (Distance about Nine Miles) is intended to be principally benefited by the proposed Cut, but, if any such Benefit could be obtained (which the Petitioners deny) the same would be obtained at the Expence of the Market Towns in the Neighbourhood, by drawing a Part of their customary Supply to Alban's, and it is therefore obvious that a Partial, and not a National, Object is in View; and that the Petitioners are Owners and Occupiers of a considerable Part of the Land on the Line of the said intended Cut, and apprehend that such intended Cut would be' injurious to their Property, Quiet, and Convenience, and would be attended with material Damage to the Valley through which the Navigation is intended to pass, and to the Stream, Mills, and Fishery, with which it is intended to interfere, without any adequate Public Advantage: That the Petitioner, Rogers Parker, who is Lord of the Manor of Munden, lately made Choice of a Situation on the Bank of the River at Munden, and built a House there, for his own Residence, and made Gardens adjoining to the said River, in which House he now lives, and, if the present Bill should pass into a Law, his House and Gardens will be materially affected, and rendered of little oif no Value in his Estimation, and such Bill will also affect the Garden of the Petitioner, Job Woodman, and be, in other Respects, highly injurious to the Property of the Peti-

tioners i And therefore praying. That they may be heard, by themselves, their Coiinfel, or Agents, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law.

Ordered, That the said Petition' do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for making and Extending a Navigable' Cut from' the Town of in the

County of Hertford, to the Town bf Saint Alban, in the same County,r be read a Second Time; and that the Petiiibhers be then1 heard, by themselves, thei* Counsel, or Agents, against the said Bill; upon their Petition, if they think fit. '

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heafd, at the same Time, in Favbur of the said Bill, against the said Petition. <

Mr. Attorney General presented to the rtoufe, according to Order, a Bill to repeal an Act, made id the last Session of Parliament, intituled, «« An Act to M enable Flis Majesty to Establish a Court of Criminal tc Judicature in Norfolk Island and for better enabling His Majesty to establish such Court in the said I ft and: And the same was received; tad read the First Time. - '

Ordered, That the said Bill be read a Second Time upon Monday Morning rrejet.

Ordered, That 'Leave be given to bring in a Bill to enable His Majesty's Postmaster General to open and return certain Letters contained in the Mails, made up at the General Post Office in London, for the United Provinces, on the 13th, t6th, and 20th Days of January 1795, and now remaining in the said General Post Office: And that Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Hobart, do prepare, and bring in, tile fame.

A Petition of the several Persons, whose Names are thereunder-signed, being Trustees, and Proprietors of Bonds, on the Turnpike Road leading from Hatfield, in the County of Herts, through Chepping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks, to Reading, in the County of Berks, as well as the Mayor, Aldermen, and principal Inhabitants of Chepping Wycombe aforesaid, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That a Bill is depending for the Purpose of opening a Turnpike Road from Aylesbury, in the County of Bucks, through Rijborough and West Wycombe, to Great -low, in the said County, and, if the Branch leading from West Wycombe to Great Marlow aforesaid be permitted to remain a Part of the Act, it will manifestly injure the Security of the Petitioners Bonds, whose Money has been advanced upon the Public Faith, and, for the Public Benefit, as likewise the Market of CheppingWy combe, which has been. Time out of Mind, a great Public Market, and the Benefit to be derived to the Public cannot be, in any Proportion, to the Injury sustained, inasmuch as the Distance laved is very little more than Half a Mile: And therefore praying to be heard, by Counsel, when they will hav$ an Opportunity of stating more fully their Objections.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the Bill for amending, widening, altering, improving, and keeping in Repair, the Road from Aylesbury, through Princes Rijborough, to West Wycombe, and from thence jo Red Barn, in the Parish of Great Marlow, all in the County of Buckingham, and also the Road from Princes Rijborough aforesaid to Thame, in the County of Oxford, is committed) and that the Petitioners be heard, by their Counsel, before the said Committee, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Mr. Thomas Lewis, an Engineer, being examined, said.

John Groves, Esquire, an Architect and Builder, being examined, informed your Committee, That Marshal Conway had, under his (the Witness's) Direction, expended very considerable Sums of Money, in bringing the said Invention to Perfection 5 and he is of Opinion, that the present reftriCted Terms of the said Letters Patent will not enable the Marshal to re-im-burse himself the great Expence he has incurred in the Undertaking; as it will require several Years before the Use of the said Invention can become so general as to produce any considerable Profit j and the Expiration of the said Letters Patent will entirely prevent him from being re-imbursed his said Expences.

That the Petitioners

observe by the Votes, that a Bill is depending for a Navigation from the Town of Watford, to the Town of Saint Alban's, in the said County of Hertford, which, if carried into, Effect, will be attended with very injurious Consequences to the said Town of Hertford, and particularly to the Navigation of the River Lea, on which very considerable Sums have been expended under the Authority of various Acts of Parliament, which said River is of great Benefit and Advantage to the said Town and County by the safe and cheap Carriage of various Goods, whereby the surrounding Country is supplied with Coals, and other Necessaries at a very easy Rate, and that the Competition of the said Cut to Saint Alban's will enhance the Prices of all Commodities consumed within the Influence of the said Navigation: And therefore praying, That no Bill may pass to the Prejudice of the said Petitioners, and so materially to the Detriment of the said Navigation.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for making and extending a Navigable Cut from the Town of Watford, in the County of Hertford,to the Town of Alban, in the same County, be read a Second Time.

That the said Canal, if made in the proposed Line, as described in the Plan deposited in the Office of the Clerk of the Peace for the said County, would cross the River Trent below Stoke aforesaid, whereby the Petitioners apprehend the Water in the said River would, in Times of Flood, be impounded, and many of the Houses and Buildings, and the Church and Church Yard of Stoke, be Overflowed; and that it appears, by Surveys lately taken, that a Deviation may be made in the proposed Line of the said Canal, by making the same from a Field belonging to the Trustees of the late George Bougbey, Esquire, deceased, in the Occupation of Thomas Badkin, through Stoke aforesaid, to join the said Navigation from the Trent to the Mersey, in a Piece of Land called Quinton's Wood, in Stoke, which Deviation will be equally commodious for the Purposes of Navigation, and will pass through the Lands of Persons who are consenting thereto, and lying within the Parish of Stoke, which was mentioned in the Notices given of the Intention to apply to Parliament for the said Bill; And therefore praying,

That Provision may be made in the said Bill for making the said Deviation in the Line of the said Canal, in such Manner, and under such Regulations and Re-ftriCtions as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the thereunder Subscribers, Mer- Petitionfrow chants. Manufacturers, and Inhabitants, of Dundee, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, respecting the That the Petitioners find themselves impelled, by War. every Principle of Religion, Humanity, and Interest, to implore the Interposition of the House in restoring Peace to their suffering Country i That the Reasons, assigned by His Majesty's Councillors for engaging in the present War, never seemed to them proportioned to its Evils and the Risque of its Disasters, nor sufficient to produce a general Conviction of its Ne-

ceflity;

Petition froitt Gentlemen, ice. of White-haven respecting the War,

treflity j and the Design of Interference in the Internal Government of a Foreign State the Petitioners could not forbear considering as unjust: That the Progress of the War has been bloody and disastrous beyond all Examples in the British History, and, after an enormous Expenditure of Money, and Waste of the Lives of Men, its avowed Turposes have been in general defeated, and are now evidently unattainable: that the Prolongation of it can hardly fail to be attended with the Loss of Commerce, the Destruction of Manii-fastures, and the Depreciation of Property, and, by diminiftiing the Funds and Means of Defence, may endanger the Existence of this Country as a free and

w *

independent Nation: That when Treaties are Daily made by all Nations, in every State of their Parties, with Governments of every Form, and Governors of all Varieties of Character, and when His Majesty's Reign affords many such Example^, the Petitioners cannot suppose any Circumstances of this Kind in France, or any Considerations of the State of Parties in Britain, to be sufficienc Reasons for preventing

Negociations of Peace at present, and continuing to deprive the Inhabitants of this Country of its invaluable Blessings: That it seems to the Petitioners impossible that fair and candid Endeavours after Peace should prove derogatory to the National Character, or depreflive of the Public Spirit} on the contrary, should the French Government, irritated b.y alleged Injuries, or rendered insolent by Victory, reject all Measures of Accommodation, the general Knowledge of their having J>een employed would have the happiest Effects to rouse and call forth the Public Zeal, and unite all Ranks and Parties of People in Britain in the virtuous Refoltition of devoting themselves, and all that they poflets, to the Defence and Salvation of their Country: And therefore praying the House to take this Petition into their serious Consideration, and to adopc such Measures for the speedy Restoration of Peace to this Country as may, in their Wisdom, be deemed adequate to the Purpose.

A Petition of the Gentlemen, Merchants, and principal Inhabitants of Whitehaven, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners deem it very improper to interfere in the Deliberations of the great Council of the Nation at a Crisis so important as the present, and nothing should have induced them to obtrude themselves upon the House, but a Desire to Ihew their Attachment to the King, and their Approval of the Measures of His Majesty's Ministers, and, when they consider their Characters as Englishmen, the Resources of this great

Nation and their Interest, as contesting with an Enemy flushed with present Success, and at all Titnes disposed to assume greatly to themselves, they hold it unworthy of this Country to sue for a Peace: The Enemy is not more the Enemy of the Persons than of the limited Monarchy which is admired, and of the Religion which is profefted and venerated by all good Subjects of these Realms: The Petitioners feel it to be the Duty of this Nation to persevere, until it shall please Providence to inspire into our Enemies such Sentiments of Moderation as may render it safe and honourable to their Opponents to listen to Terms of mutual Accommodation, until that happy Time the Petitioners pray, that the House will support His Majesty's just Endeavours to destroy the Abilities, and restrain the Ambition, of this presuming Enemy: The Petitioners are happy to observe, that His Majesty's Ministers efteCm a Foreign War as the Icaft of Two Evils, and Domestic Peace as the First of National Blessings; and chat they may derive an effectual Support from the Councils of the House is the Prayer of the Petitioners.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Tablet

said Petition, and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk's Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition,

Mr. William Hichens being examined, said. That he is a Fish Curer, and lives in Newlyn, a Town in Mount's Bay, in the County of Cornwall; and that Mackerel usually come on the Coast about the beginning of March, and are fold fresh in all the Eastern

Markets from the Mount's Bay to London, but that their Sale is liable to great Uncertainty, as the Easterly Winds which generally prevail at that Season, prevent the Vtflcls which carry them from reaching the Ports where they are consumed, in which' same they must be all fold fresh in the Country within Thirty Miles of The Lands End, a very small Proportion of them taken at this Season being cured for Sale.

That when the Price is fedoced from a Want of Access to the Eastern Markets, the Fishermen cannot go to Sea, as it will not pay them for their Labour; and the Expences attending the Use of their Boats and Nets; and that he and many others have declined fending their Boats to Sea in this Season from having felt this Inconvenience. On being asked. Whether these Difficulties would be removed if proper Encouragement were given to this Fishery, and a Bounty on Mackerel cured for Home Consumption, with an additonal Sum on exporting the m? he answered. Certainly; that the Home Consumption would be first provided for, and that an additional Bounty on exporting the Surplus would be necessary. — That the whole Markets of the West Indies would be open to them, but that none could be sent to the Mediterranean, as no pickled Fish will fell there, all Fish sent to those Markets being dry-prefTed — That this Season for Fishery, under its present Circumstances, continues to about the End of May, but that it would, with due Encouragement, be followed till the End of July, or till the Pilchard Fishery begins — That if proper Encouragement and Bounties were given by Parliament, the Fishery would immediately increase in respect of Boats, Craft, and Men employed, and in Time would be carried to a very great Extent, he ind many others would fend Craft to Sea immediately- — That under its present Circumstances the Fishery is incapable of being increased, that in Fact it has decreased at Ilfracombe and Torbay in Devonshire, and in many Parts of Cornwall.

Autumn Fishery.

On being examined respecting the State of this Fishery, he said, that it begins about the latter End of September, and generally ends about the beginning of December — That all the Mackerel which are fold fresh at this Season, are consumed in the Western Part of Cornwall, to the Amount of nearly One Fourth of the whole taken; the Remainder are cured for Home Consumption — That this Fishery, under due Encouragement, and Bounties on Mackerel cured for Home Consumption, and with an additional Bounty on exporting the Surplus, is capable of an immediate Increase, and may be hereafter carried to a very considerable Extent; and that, according to his Information, the Foreign Markets in the West Indies will take the whole Surplus.

On being asked, What Encouragement and Bounties

would

would be necessary for the Mackerel Fishery? he de- pany with those belonging to Mount's Bay j that he livered a Paper, of which the following is a Copy: has seen Twenty-four Boats come a Shore there at a

missioner to serve in Parliament for the Stewart'ry of Kirkcudbright, which Order of the House has since been enlarged till the 25th Instant: That the Petitioner, having been appointed by His Majesty Sheriff, or

Stewart Principal, of the said Stewartry of Kirkcudbright conceived, and was advised, that he was entitled as such to take, and to execute, the Writ so issued, and be accordingly received the said Writ from the Mef-fengerof the Great Seal on the 16th of January last, meaning forthwith to repair to Kirkcudbright to execute *

it; and that within a few Days after receiving the Wr\t the Petitioner set out for Kirand went by the Way of Edinburgh, in order to take the Oaths required by Law to qualify him for the Office of Stewart Principal, which could be done only before the Barons of the Exchequer in Scotland, fitting at Edinburgh, but, by the unusual Severity of the Weather, and Badnpfs of the Roads, the Petitioner's Journey to Edinburgh was rendered very tedious, and when he arrived there, and wifhedto proceed to Kirkcudbright, he found that, from the great Fall of Snow and intense Froft, the Road to Kirkcudbright was impafiable, except by Foot Passengers, and even to them it was attended with RUk, and the Roads ,cqntin,ued in that Condition for Fpur Weeks; and that the Petitiqner, most anxious that no Blame should attach on him as delaying the Execution of the Writ, took the Opinion of a Counsel of great Eminence at the Bar of the Court of Session, and by him, as well as by other Gentlemen of that Profession, with whom he conversed at Edinburgh on the Subject, he was advised, first. That, as Sheriff, or 6cewart Principal, he had a Right to execute the Writ; and, secondly, That he had a difere- ' tionary Power of fixing the Day of Election, taking Care that the Discretion was properly exercised; and as the Sheriff's Right to name the Day of Election was considered to beunquestionable, so he found it universally underftopd that he might delay the Publication of the Writ till he had determined as to the Day, o because

because the Publication or Notices mult name the Day of Election, and the Day once named cannot be altered or enlarged; that the Petitioner then took into his Consideration the State of the Country at the Time, and the general Convenience of the Electors, many of whom were at a Distance from and who probably would have been prevented from attending, if an earlier Time had been fixed, and he then delivered the Writ to the Stewart Depute, in order that he might give the Notices, and fix the Day of Election at a Time which the Petitioner, from the Enquiries he made, thought would be convenient to the Electors in general; the Petitioner's Reason for devolving the Duty on the Stewart Depute, instead of executing it himself, which was his first Intention, being, that he found Doubts suggested as to his own Power, and, though he himself had none, he thought it best to proceed in a Way by which it appeared most probable that all Difficulties would be obviated; and although the Petitioner trusts it will appear to the House, from the foregoing State of the Cafe, that, if there has been an Error in hii Conduct, it was wholly unintentional, he is nevertheless ready and desirous to give any farther Explanation which the House may be pleased to require; but, he allures the House, that nothing could be more remote from his Thoughts than any Degree of Disrespect for the Privileges of the House, and that he is extremely concerned at the Inconvenience and Trouble which the House has had on this Occasion.

That the Petitioners are deeply affected at the very alarming and growing Evil of robbing the several Church Yards, Burying Grounds, and other Places of Interment, within this Kingdom, and the existing Laws do not (as the Petitioners have been advised) justify a Magistrate in committing Persons, charged with the said Offence, until an Indictment has been found against them, and that after such Indictment has been found, such Laws have not been adequate to the Prevention of the Evil; that the above Practice has become so frequent as to diffuse a general Uneasiness, especially in the Breasts of the middling and lower Orders of the Community, whose Feelings cannot by any Argument be reconciled to it, and, in particular, the great Number of Bodies, itolen from the Burying Ground belonging to the Petitioners, caused a great Assemblage of People there, who were so much enraged, and shewed such Signs of Desperation, that the Churchwardens, and others, who assisted to restore and preserve the Peace, found themselves necessitated, in order to prevent a general Riot, to institute an immediate Enquiry, and offer a large Reward for the Discovery of the Depredators, and to promise their utmost Endeavours to obtain a Parliamentary Remedy against the Practice in future; and it is apprehended that, if a similar Discovery should again be made, not only the like Scene of Distress will be renewed, but the Public Peace be endangered: And therefore praying the House, in order more effectually to deter Persons from committing such Offences in future, to take the same into their most serious Consideration, and permit the Bill to pass into a Law.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act, paired in the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for enlarging the Terms and Powers of Two Acts, passed in the Fourteenth and Twenty-sixth Years of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for repairing the Road leading from Ealand to the Town of , in the West Riding of the County of York, was read. — And,

Mr. Janus Hebdeit, being examined, said. That the Trustres have proceeded in the Execution of the said Act, and have borrowed several Sums of Mon^y, which (lill remain due, and cannot be repaid, and the said Roads kept in Repair, unless the Term granted by the said Act is further continued, some further Powers granted, and the Tolls increased.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for enlarging the Term and Powers of Three several-Afts, passed in the Fourteenth and Twenty-sixth Years of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, and in the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repairing the Road leading from Ealand to the Town of Leeds, in the West Riding of the County of York: And that Mr. Wilberforce and Mr, Hobart do prepare, and bring in, the fame,

It also appeared to your Committee, That the Sum of £.466. os. 6 d. was paid by the Barons of the Exchequer in Scotlandon the 23d of February 1764, to Mr. William Frajer a Creditor upon the Estate of Cluny, being the Amount of a Debt due to the Petitioner's Father, recovered out of the Estate of Simon late Lord Lovat — That in the Year 1770, when the Creditors on the Estate of Cluny were paid their respective Demands out of a Sum voted by Parliament, the said WilliamFrajer only received Payment of the Balance of his Debt, after deducting the said Sum of £.466. os. 6d. which he had received as aforesaid j by which Means the Public were benefited to the Amount of the said Sum, which had been recovered out of the Estate of the late Lord And, by the said recited Act, it appears that the full Amount of William Frajer's Debt is charged against the Estate of Cluny, without making any Deduction for the £.466. os. 6d. received by William Frajer, as before-mentioned.

It also appeared to your Committee, That William Frajer is (fated as being a Creditor on the Estate of Cluny, on the 25th of December 1752, in the Sum of £. 108. $s. id. (being the Balance of his Debt after deducting the said Sum of £.466. oj. and that Margaret Macpherson is also (fated as a Creditor on the said Estate in the Sum of £.129. 6s. oj^d. which Two Debts amounted, on the 25th of June 1746, only to the Sum of £. 179. 3 and instead

of the Estate of Cluny being charged with only the last-mentioned Sum for those Two Debts, it was debited with the whole of William Frajer'& Debt, amounting, with Principal and Interest, on the 25th of , 1746 to £. 402. 16 /. 7 d.without any Deduction being made for the before-mentioned Sum of £.466. os. 6d. although such Deduction is made in a Report from the Court of Session, and William Frajer (lands only ranked as Creditor on the Real Estate for the Balance due to him. But as the Debt due to Margaret Macpherson is not charged against the Estate of Cluny by the dilannexing Act, it ought therefore to be added to the Balance of the Debt due and paid to William Frajer-, which Two Debts, amounting together in June 1746 to £.179. js. yd. being deducted from the Amount of William Frajer's Debt, charged on the Estate of Cluny, in June 1746, amounting to £. 402. 1 6 s.7 d.makes the Sum overcharged against

the Estate of Cluny by the disannexing Act to be £.223. 12 s.tod. for which the Petitioner ought to have had Credit given him on Payment of the Sum of £ 5>,38- *7 * 11 -A d.

them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it i.n at the Clerk's Table: Where the same was read; and is as folio w-eth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition* Mr. Granville Penn, being examined, said, That the Institution of the said College first took place in February 1791 — That Mr. St. Bel was the First Proa feffor; and on his Death" Mr. Coleman, Member of the Corporation of Surgeons, was recommended by the First Characters of the Faculty, and appointed to succeed to the Professor's Chair. — And being further examined, he said, That a Piece of Ground, near Pancras, was agreed to be taken for the Purpose of erecting Buildings for the Use of the College — Thar an Infirmary for the Reception of 50 Horses, and A Theatre for Lectures and the Diffeftions of Horses and other Animals, together with a Forge and other Offices, have been erected, at a very considerable Expence. — Then,

Mr. JJlley Cooper, a Member of the Medical Com-

mittee of the College, and Professor of Anatomy to the Corporation of Surgeons, being examined, said. That the Education of about Fifteen Pupils has been successfully conducted in each Year since the Establishment of the College — That he was present ar the Examination of Eleven Pupils by the Medical Committee, named in the Petition — That they were carefully examined on the Anatomy, Physiology, and Diseases of Horses — That their Answers were ready, andihewed that they had paid great Attention to the Objects of their Education — That their Acquirements were such, as were calculated to preserve many Horses, and other Animals, which now fall a Sacrifice to the Ignorance of common Practitioners, particularly in the Instances of Wounds to which Horses of the Army are subject; and, that by the improved Mode of Treatment of Wounds in the Joints, Nine Horses in Ten, which would be loft by the Old Method, would be thereby saved. ----- -Then,

The Right honourable Lord Heathfiebeing exa-

mined, said. That experienced Farriers are very much wanted in the Cavalry — That One Half of the Horses which die or are cast, would probably be saved by Persons regularly educated in the Veterinary Science, and that nearly the whole of the Horses receiving Gun Shot Wounds, under the Care of the present Army Farriers, are loft — That in the Campaign of 1793, he saved, by the Afliftaace of the Surgeon of the Regiment which he commanded, nearly the whole Number of the Horses which had received Gun Shot Wounds, and which the Troop Farriers had failed to treat with Success — That at that Time there was only One Regiment, viz. the 2d Dragoon Guards, that had a skilful Farrier attached to it- — That in all Foreign Services there are One or Two skilful Farriers* educated in the Veterinary Science, attached to each Regiment. — And being further examined, his Lordship said. That he is of Opinion it would be of great Advantage to the Army to have a Pupil from each Regiment admitted to the Course of Studies of the College. — Then,

The Right honourable the Earl of Pembroke being examined, said. That he commanded the Second Regiment of Dragoon Guards in the Campaign of 1793-4 — That a greater Number of Horses received Gun Shot Woupds in that Regiment, than in any other, and that a very great Proportion of them were saved, which he can only attribute to the Skill and Science of a Farrier Major, who had attended Courses of Anatomical Lectures — That, that Regiment is the only Regiment in the Service that has a Farrier Major attached to it, and that the Proportion of Horses saved from Gun Shot Wounds, and other Diseases, was infinitely greater in that, than in any other Regiment in the Service. — And being further examined, his Lord-

Day appo*n:cd for Second Kfading of

ship said, That it is his Opinion it would be of the greatest Advantage to the Army, to have a Pupil from each Regiment admitted to the Studies of the Veterinary College. ----- -Then,

General Gwyn,being examined, said. That he has

been in Seven different Regiments of Cavalry, and always found the greatest Inconvenience in not having Farriers properly educated in the Veterinary Science attached to the Service, particularly so in the 16th Light Dragoons, which he commanded Part of the Time it was in America,wherein the Loss of Horses was veryf conf:derable, and which he can only attribute to the Want of a proper Person of the above Description j for, that in the 15th Light Dragoons, which he commanded for Three or Four Years, the Advantage of a Person of Science was clearly evinced, in the Troop under the Care of a Mr. Leijhman for Two Years, losing no Horses during that Time, although Numbers had what is styled “ The Diltemper,” and other Dil-eases: And he added, That it is his Opinion, that Half of the Horses that have been loft during the last Six Months in his Regiment, would have been saved under the Care of a Person of Science; and that it would be of considerable Benefit to the Service, if a Pupil from each Regiment was admitted to the Course of Studies taught in the Veterinary College. — Then,

Mr. William Houlston, a Member of the'Medical

Committee of the Veterinary College, and One of the Corporation of Surgeons, being examined, said, That the Establishment of a Plan of Education in the Veterinary Science, considered in a general View, as applying to Horses and other Cattle, will be of infinite Service to the Agriculture of the Country, and to the Army in particular, by the Treatment of Gun Shot Wounds, and other Diseases incident to the Cavalry, — -That he is of Opinion the Country have already reaped great Advantage from the Establishment of the Veterinary College by the Education of Eleven Pupils - — That he adifted in their Examination, and that, in his Opinion, they were completely qualified to practice the Veterinary Science with Honour to themselves and infinite Benefit to the Community. — And the Witness added. That the College derives very particular Advantages in being under the Direction of a Profcfibr, whose regular Course of Study in the Schools of Anatomy and Medicine, highly qualified him todiffufe the Veterinary Science, and even to improve it beyond any Thing that has been known in the Practice of Foreign Schools. — Then,

Mr. llil.lamAlcunjher, Secretary to the Veterinary

College, being examined, said, That the Sum of £. 4,200 has been advanced by sundry Noblemen and Gentlemen, on Lean, bearing Interest, towards defraying the Expence of the nccefiary Buildings of the C<.Urge; and that a fublVquent Debt has been incurred of near £. 4,800, over and above the several Sums received from Annual and Perpetual Subscribers, and that nearly the Sum of £. 7,000 has been expended in the Erection of the said Buildings. — And being further examined, he said, That a Committee had been appointed in the Month of last, by a General

Meeting of the Subscribers, to examine into the Receipts and Expenditure of the College, and state the probable futuie Expence of conducting its Affairs, and had reported their Opinion to be, that less than £. 16,000 per Annum would be insufficient to carry all

the Objects f the Institution into full Effect.

Ordered, That the said Report do lie upon the Table.

Ordered, Tint the Bill to apportion the Relief, by the several Statutes now in Force, directed to be given to the* Wives and Families of Non-commissioned Officers* Drummers, Fibers, and Privates, serving in the Militia, between the County at large and the peculiar

GEORGE R.

His Majesty relies on the Liberality and Affection of His faithful Commons, and on the cordial Interest which they have manifested in the happy Event of the Nuptials of the Ptince and Princess of Wales, that they will be ready to concur in fuel; Provision as they

may judge necessary to enable His Majesty to settle an Establishment for the Prince and Princess, fuitCd to their Rank and Dignity. „ >

On an Occasion, in all other Respects so satisfattory. His Majesty feels the deepest Regret in being under the Necessity of communicating to the House, that the Benefit of any Settlement, to be now made, cannot be effectually secured to the Prince of Wales without providing the Means of freeing Him from Incumbrances to a- large Amount, to which He is now subject.

Anxious as His Majesty must necessarily be, particularly under the present Circumstances, to relieve the Prince of Wales from these Difficulties, His Majesty entertains no Idea of proposing to His Parliament to make any Provision for this Object otherwise than by the Application of a Part of the Income which may be settled on the Prince; but He earnestly recommends it to the House, to consider of the Propriety of thus providing for the gradual Discharge of these Incumbrances, by appropriating and securing, for a given Term, the Revenues arising from the Dutchy of Cornwall, together with a Proportion of the Prince's other Annual Income: And His Majesty will be ready and desirous to concur in any Provisions, which the Wisdom of Parliament may suggest, for the Purpose of establishing a regular and punctual Order of Payment in the Prince's future Expenditure, and of guarding against the Possibility of the Prince being again involved in so painful and embarrassing a Situation.

A Petition of divers Owners of Lands and Tenements within the Barony of Gray flock, in the County Lands7nGr»y-of Cumberland, was presented to the House, and read; ft°ck ag*imt Setting forth, That there are several large Tracts of fadolureBUU Common and Waste Grounds, within the said Barony, called Graystock and Berrier, Hutton Roof, and Low End Commons, upon which the Petitioners and others are entitled to Common of Pasture, and Turbary, as Tenants of the several Manors and Townships of Graystock, Berrier, and Murray, Hutton Roof, and Low End, the said Manors and Townships being reflectively entitled to Common Right upon different and separate Parts of the said Commons, and Waste Grounds, distinguished and known from e&ch other; and that in several Years, for upwards of Twenty Years last past, Notice has been given of its being proposed to make an Application to Parliament for an Act to divide and inclose such Commons and Waste Grounds, but, a great Number of the Persons interested therein having always been of Opinion, that the Division and Inclosure thereof was improper, and having expressed and published an Intention to oppose the fame, no Measures were taken to follow up any of such Notices by an Application to Parliament, previous to the present Session: That, the House having now given Leave to bring io a Bill for the Division and Inclosure of the said Common and Waste Grounds, the Petitioners pray that such Bill may floe be passed into a Law, for the following Reasons: Because the Waste Grounds in Question, although upwards of 3,000 Acres, are very poor in Quality, being valoed, according to the Statement in the Bill, at only £. 5 an Acre, upon an Average, for the Purchase, and abounding with Rocks and MorafTes, so as to be, for the most Part, incapable of Tillage, Cultivation, or Improvement, consequently a very improper Subject upon which to incur the Expence of anlnclosure — Recauie these Waste Grounds are at present of great Utility to the Persons interested therein, and can never be more advanta-geoufly employed for the Benefit of the Community at large, or of the Individuals interested, than in their present open uninclosed State, serving chiefly as a Pasture for Sheep, which, according to the Season, can now vary their Pasturage, and, in the instances where Horses and Cattle are put thereon, they are enabled to subsist in many dry Parts, by having Access to Water in remote Places — Because, in case of an Inclosure, it will be impossible to combine, in the Shares of by far the greatest Part of the Persons interested, w/et and dry Land, so as to render the Allotments fit for Pasturage, and, being incapable of Tillage, they will be wholly useless, because the Benefits intended to be provided for the Proprietors of small Estates, by that Clause in the Bill which directs that the Duke of Norfolk shall be at the Expence of pairing the Act, and of dividing, allotting, and inclosing, the Shares of such as have not real Estates of the Yearly Value of £. 15, will, in a great Measure, be rendered ineffectual and nugatory under the existing Circtun-stances of the Cafe, in as much as the Shares of the lesser Proprietors will be of very trifling or no Value, unless annexed or enjoyed with the more extensive Tracts, and therefore it must follow, that the greatest Proprietors will, in the End, easily obtain the Whole of these small Allotments at low and inconsiderable Prices, to the great Impoverishment and Ruin of all, a or

or reoft of, such lcfler Proprietors — Because, the Petitioners apprehend, that the Persons, who have applied to the House for such Bill, have not such a Proportion of Interest in the said Common and Waste Grounds as the Rule of the House requires in Support of such an Application, it being proposed that such Division and Inclosure shall be made according to the Purvey Rate, and the Whole of the Purvey payable by the Owners of the'Lands or Tenements claiming to be so entitled to such Common and Waste Grounds, being One Pound and Six Shillings, of which the Petitioners for the Inclosure do not pay Four-fifth Parts — And bycaule, even if an Inclosure was a Mea-fu're likely to be conducive to the Ad vantage of the Persons interfiled, the contrary of which the Petitioners apprehend to be the Cafe, still the Inclosure of separate Commons in different Manors and Townships under one Bill, like the prefenr, would be highly inconvenient, and as tending to blend and confound Interests that are distinct, unjust, the Commons of the different Manors and Townships varying considerably in Extent and Value, so that the same Property or Purvey, in different Manors or Townships, ought not to entitle the Persons paying the fame, to equal Shares; and because the different Interests in the different Manors and Townships, which are likely to produce Disputes and Litigations in some of the Townships, will probably attach upon the Whole, if the Bill should be passed in its present Form: And therefore praying, That they may be heard in such Manner as the House shall think proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for dividing and inclosing certain Commons and Waste Grounds within the Barony of Greystoke, in the Copnty of ,be read the

A Petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of Lonin Common Council assembled.

And then they withdraw.

And the said Petition was read; Setting forth. That by an Act, passed in the Twenty-ninth Year of die Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, “ An Act for building a Bridge cross the River of Thames from Blackfriars, in the “ City of London, to the opposite Side, in the County “ of Surrey," the Petitioners were authorized and ini-powered, eut of the Monies to be raised by virtue of the said Act, to fill up the Channel of Bridewell , and to make, erect, and build a good and sufficient Drain or Sewer, in and through the said Channel, of convenient Depth; and, it was by the said Act provided, that the said Drain, or Sewer, should be maintained and kept in Repair by the Petitioners out of the Monies which should be raised for the Purposes of the said Act; and that the Channel of Bridewell Deck was filled up, and a Sewer of convenient Size conllructed therein, under the Power of the said A cl: That Signs of Failure in the said Sewer have appeared, and are deemed to bfe of very serious Consequences to the Public Pafiage Way through Bridge Street, as well as to the Property adjoining; that the Consequences of this Failure are extreme Inconvenience to the Inhabitants of the Houses adjoining to the said Sewer, all Approach of Carriages thereto being prevented, and great Annoyance and Obstruction to the Public, the said Street, which is one of the greatest Avenues to, and Thoroughfares in, the City of London, being very much reduced in its Width by the Space over the said defective Sewer being r>e-

Vol. L.

ceffarily raised off, and the present State of the said Sewer is attended with constant Danger to the said valuable Houses adjoining; and that, in Addition to the Reasons above-mentioned, it is indispensably necessary that the said Sewer should be re-instated as speedily as may be, inasmuch as it forms the main Drain for a large Part of the County of and

several of the Streets within the City of London, which in case of further Obstruction, must be subjected to the utmost Annoyance and Detriment: That the Funds granted by the said Act, and applicable to the Repair of the said Sewer, have cealed and determined, and,

Disputes having arisen by whom the said Sewer ought to be repaired, the same has, on Account thereof, remained in its present ruinous and dangerous State; and that, by reason of the said Disputes, and various References to Counsel respecting the liability of the rel'pedlive Parties to repair the fame, the Petitioners, who have always been ready to come forward in all Cafes wherein the Safety and Accommodation of the Public are concerned, have been withheld from applying to Parliament (which they are very lately informed it is necessary they should) for an Act to repair and maintain the said Sewer, or make a new One throughout the said Street: And therefore praying.

That, in Consideration of the above-mentioned Premises, and very urgent and important Circumstances,

Leave may be given to present a Petition for bringing in a Bill for repairing and maintaining the said Sewer, or making a new One in lieu thereof; or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That, in Consideration of the particular Leave gi.<n. Circumstances let forth in the said Petition, Leave be given to present a Petition, as desired by the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonsof the City in Common Council assembled.

Their Imperial and Britannick Majesties have thought proper to concert together upon the Measures to be adopted for the next Campaign, and agree, for this Purpose, on such Stipulations as may best conduce to the falu-tary Object of their Intentions already mentioned.

With this View, Their Majesties have appointed their respective Plenipotentiaries; that is to say, his Imperial* Majesty, his Privy Councillor actual, and Mi-nifter for Foreign Affairs, Baron de ThugUt, Commander of the Order of Saint Stephen; and His Britannick Majesty, Sir Morton Eden, One of His Majesty's Mott honourable Privy Council, Knight of the Bath, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Vienna: Who, after having com- . municated to each other their respective full Powers, have agreed upon the following Articles.

Article I.

In order to assist the Efforts which his Imperial Mar* jetty is desirous of making, and to facilitate to him the Means of bringing forward the Resources of his Dominions, in the Defence of the common Cause, His Britannick Majesty engages to propose to His Parliament to guaranty the regular.Payment of the Half-' yearly Dividends, on the Sum of Four Millions Six Hundred thousand Pounds Sterling, which is, or is to be raised, on Account of his Imperial Majesty, on the Terms and in the Manner specified in the Two Engagements or Oftrois, the Tenor of which is annexed to this Convention; his Imperial Majesty solemnly engaging to His Britannick Majesty that he will make due Provision for the regular Discharge of the Payments which shall become due in Consequence of the said Loans, so as that those Payments shall never fall as a Burthen on the Finances of Great Britain.

Car If ord, Plomefgate, and Tbredling, in the County of plaining of the Suffolk, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners, for many Years pad, have 1 kept Two-wheeled Road Carts, made up of common and inferior Materials; for the more ready Conveyance of their Goods, Wares, and Merchandize to Towns and Markets, for Sale, which Carts they have occasionally used for Pleasure, whereby they have been, and now are, liable to be assessed for the same at the Rate of £.3. 10 s.per Annum, with the additional Ten per Cents thereon, being a Duty charged on all Carriages with Two or Three Wheels, to be drawn by One or more Horses, which should be used at any Time for the Carriage or Conveyance of Persons, and not generally used in the Affairs of Husbandry, or for the Carriage of Goods, Wares, and Merchandize, &c. by the Eighteenth Section of an Act passed in the Twenty-ninth Year of His present Majesty VReign, which Tax, the Petitioners submit to the House, is a great Grievance, and falls very heavy on them, their Carts being generally for the Purpose of conveying themselves and Families, their Goods, Wares, and Merchandize, to Markets and Places where fold, and used occalionally only for Pleasure, and are of small Value, being made up at a very moderate Expence, but, by the present Mode of affdfing, they are chargeable with as great a Duty as the most elegant and codly Two-wheeled. Calalh, Chaise, Whilkey, Gig, or Chair, kept and used by Persons of great Property and Fortune, solely for the Purpose of Pleasure, and by others to lec out for Hire; and that the Petitioners, being ever ready and willing cheerfully to contribute, according to their several Situations in Life, to the Exigencies of the State, with all due Submission to the House, beg Leave to mention, that, if a moderate Duty was laid on Carts of the above Description, of inferior Value and Convenience, and more proportioned to the Circumstances of their Owners, they conceive it would raise a much larger Sum to the Revenue of this Kingdom than what will be now raised under the pFefcnc very heavy Tax thereon, they therefore conceive it never was the Intention of the Legislature, when the last Tax on Carriages with Two or Three Wheels passed, that a Duty of £.3. 10 s.with the additional Ten per Cents thereon, should attach on Market Carts

-belonging to Farmers and Tradesmen, of such inferior Value as they generally are, and kept for their Convenience in Trade and Agriculture, or that such Carts should be assessed equally with the most costly and ele. gant Two-wheeled Chaises kept for Pleasure only, which Tax, in numberless Cafes, is more than equal to the Value of the Thing taxed: And therefore praying, That the House will take their Petition into Con-(ideration, and that the Petitioners, and others in their Situation, may be relieved from their present Grievance, in such Way and Manner as the House shall think fit.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider of so much of an Act, made in the Twenty-fifth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for granting to “ His Majesty certain Duties upon Licences to be “ taken out by Coachmakers, and also certain Duties “ upon Carriages to be built for Sale;” and also, of 5 so

by their own Laws infringed, the Peace and Harmony of their Meetings destroyed, their Burthens will be accumulated and become intolerable, and a Difiolu-tion of a great Number of those useful Institutions will be the inevitable Consequence: And therefore beseeching the House to refuse its Sanction to the afore-mentioned Bill, and thereby avert those Evils Which otherwise will ensue to the said Societies.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for enlarging the Provisions of an Act, made in the Thirty-third Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for the En*

That an Act hath lately passed for improving the Drainage of the Middle and South Levels, Part of the Great Level of the Fens, called Bedford , and the Low Lands adjoining, or near to, the said Levels, and also the Lands adjoining, or near to, the River , in the County of Norfolk, draining through the same to Sea, by the Harbour of King's Lynn, in the said County, and for altering and improving the Navigation of the said River Ouze, from, or near, a Place called Brink, in the Parish of Wiggenh Saint Mary, in the said County, to the said Harbour of King's Lynn, and for improving and preferring the Navigation of the several Rivers communicating with the said River and that by the said Act several important Works are directed to be done by Commissioners therein mentioned, which Works are necessary for the Relief, Prc-servation, and Improvement, of the Great Level of the Fens, of the Lands adjoining thereto, and of the Navigations passing through the fame, and will be attended with a very heavy Expence, towards the defraying of which the said Commissioners are enabled to raise a Sum of near f. 80,000, by and upon the Credit of a certain Tax and Tonnage for and during a Term of Ten Years, but, that there appears great Reason to apprehend the said Tax and Tonnage, for the Term so limited, will not afford a sufficient Security for the said Sum of Money directed to be borrowed under the Act, and that it will be expedient and necessary, in order to carry the same into Execution, to apply to'Parliament, in the next Session, for further Powers, and particularly for an Extension of the said Tax and Tonnage for a further Time to be limited, which Extension the Petitioners believe, and are convinced, is consonant to the Opinions and Wiihes of a great Majority of the Perions concerned in the said Lands and Navigations for the effectual Completion of the necessary and important Plan already sanctioned by Parliament; but the Petitioners beg Leave to rc-present to the House, that any Application to Parliament, for the Purposes above described, would come within certain Standing Orders of the House respecting Navigation as well as Drainage Bills, and that the Extent of Country to which it might relate being very large, and the Persons to whom it would be requisite to apply for their Content being very numerous, and dispersed at great Distances throughout various Parts of the Kingdom, the said intended Application, with all the previous Circumstances required by the said Standing Orders, will be attended with great Labour and Difficulty; as well as a most grievous and burthensome Expence, and consequent

Detriment to all Parties concerned or interested:

And therefore praying, That, in case it shall be found expedient to apply to Parliament, in the next Session, for an Act to alter and amend the said Act, and to extend the Term of the Rates on the Lands, and the Tonnage on the Goods and Merchandize thereby granted, for a further Term to be limited. General Notices of such Intention to apply to Parliament for such Act, inferred in The London Gazette, and the different County Newspapers (as directed by the First Standing Order of the 7th of May 1794) and given at the different Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be held for the several Counties in which such Lands lay, and Tax or Tonnage shall be taken, may be deemed sufficient Notice to all Persons concerned or interested, and that all such Persons as shall not express their Diflent to the intended Bill, by Petition, or otherwise, to this House, may be deemed and considered as consenting thereto, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Charles Torke, Sir Charles Morgan, &c.: And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker's Chamber; and have Power to fend for Persons, Papers, and Records; and all who come to the Committee are to have Voices.

Petition for A Petition of the Persons, whose Names are thereunto

jvnfT* Petitton fobferibed, on Behalf of themselves and others con-from the Mcr* cemed in the Trade with the Klapds of and

to GrenaH* "* Saint Vincent, was presented to the House, and read; ltd s*."vin- Setting forth. That Advices are lately arrived from cent. the said Hands, giving Intelligence of very great De-

predations having been made, in both Hands, by an . Insurrection of the French Inhabitants and free coloured French, aided by the Carribs in and in Confrquence thereof the Petitioners and others have been disappointed in the Importation of Produce to a great Value, to enable them to answer their Engagements, and send out Supplies; and that, the Petitioners not having received these Accounts before the Time elapsed for presenting private Petitions, they are under the Necessity of applying for Leave to present a Petition for such Relief as the House shall think fit: And therefore praying, That the House will permit the Petitioners to present a Petition for the Purposes aforesaid.

L re given. Ordered, That, in Consideradon of the particular Circumstances set forth in the said Petition, Leave be given to present a Petition, as desired by the said Persons concerned in the Trade with the Hands of Grenada and Saint Vincent. fcciitior, from Then a Petition of the Merchants connected with, !rad'u^gl^)ban, and trading to, the Hands of Grenada and Saint Vin-Grcnadi and cent, was presented to the House, and read j Setting St. Vmecnt. forth, That the recent Calamities which have befallen the said Hands, and the Consequences with which they have been, and will be, attended, compel the Petitioners to apply to the House for such Aid as may.

in some Degre$, alleviate their Misfortune: That these Calamities have been occasioned by Insurre<5tions of the French Inhabitants, and free People of Colour, in both the said Hands, joined in Saint Vincent by the Carribs, and although it is to be hoped, that every Quarter hath not fuftcred in an equal Degree, yet every Estate must be materially injured by the necessary Absence of the Managers and Overseers, who, in the very Season of the Crop, assembled as Militia for the Defence of the Sovereignty of the Hands; and that the Petitioners had Reason to expect an Importation of Produce- to a very large Amount, which would have enabled them to have fulfilled various Engagements, which, from the Nature of their Concerns in Business, they had entered into, and, as a great Supply of different Articles from this Country will be required for resettling and restoring the Estates, the Petitioners will be unable, without the Aid of the' House, either to fulfill such Engagements or furnish such Supplies; and that the Petitioners compute, that the clear Value of the Produce from Grenada and Saint Vincent has been equal to One Million Annually, and, as but a small Proportion of such Produce can now be expected, they already begin to feel the Pressure of so lerious a Defalcation, by the Effect which it hath produced upon their Credit in the Commercial World: And therefore praying the House, to take their same into immediate Consideration, and to grant such Relief as to the House may seem proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer reported from the Ptmion from Committee, to whom the Petition of the Merchants »he Meickams connected with, and trading to* the Islands of Grenada Grenada *nd and Saint Vincent, was referred; That the Committee St. Vincent, had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had reForted* directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk's Table:

Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petitiort,

Your Committee proceeded to examine several Merchants of eminence connected with the Islands of nada and Saint Vincent.

The concurring Accounts received from these Gentlemen, fully substantiated the Fitft Allegation of the Petition, respecting the Nature and causeS of the Calamities sustained by those Islands. — -From the Situation in which the Islands flood at the Time when the last Accounts came away, it was impofllble that any particular Detail could be given of the whole Loss which has been incurred; but it appeared; that in both the Islands a large Proportion of rhe Estates had been laid Waste,. their manufactured Produce plundered, and the Cattle driven away; and in many of them the Crops upon the Ground, and the Buildings and Works* entirely destroyed. — The necessary Absence of the Owners and Managers at the Season of the Crop, was also represented as occasioning a material Loss, even to those Estates which might have escaped actual Devaluation.

In Consequence of these Events, not only a great Part of the Crop which would have been remitted Home in the Course of the present Year, has been loft, but even on the Supposition of a speedy Restoration of Tranquillity, the Crop of the succeeding Year must be materially affected; and a very considerable Expence incurred in the Interval, for repairing the Works, and replacing the Stock on the different Estates; and, in Grenada, the Interruption of the Trade carried on with the '.Free Port established there, must be considered as an Addition to the Distress of that Island, and a further Diminution of its Means of Remittance.

On comparing the Calculations from such Materials as were in the Possession of the Gentlemen who attended Your Committee, there appeared good Reason to believe, that the Amount of the Loss in the Remittances of the present Year, together with the Expence to be incurred in restoring the Plantations to a State of Cultivation, can hardly be estimated at a less Sum than between Six and Seven hundred thousand Pounds, in each of these Islands.

It also appeared, that the Merchants connected with these Islands were under pecuniary Engagements to a great Extent, upon the Credit of the Crop which would have been remitted to them if these Calamities had not happened; and that consequently, under the present Circumstances, these Engagements could not be punctually discharged by them without some extraordinary Assistance. — The same Circumstances would prevent the Merchants from continuing the usual Advances for the ordinary Cultivation of the Islands, and must still more disable them from furnishing the additional Sums which would be required in Consequence of the late Devastation.

It was ttated, to the Conviction of Your Committee, that no Assistance would be effectual to obviate vefy serious Inconveniences, both to Individuals, and to the Public in respect both to Commerce and Revenue, which did not afford the Means of procuring an Advance of Money equal to a considerable Proportion of the Losses and Expences above stated, and which

Advance,

596 i2° Junit. 1795.

Advance, from the Nature of the Cafe, could not come into a Course of Re-payment till after the Crop of the next Year should have been remitted to this Country, and could not be wholly made good in a less Period than from Two Years and an Half to Three Years.

Your Committee also found, that there was Reason to believe that to a very large Extent unexceptionable Security could be given for such Advances; but nevertheless that the length of the Period for which they were necessary, rendered them, in the Opinion of the Persons concerned, impossible to be procured by the Exertions of private Credit. One of the Gentlemen examined, engaged in a most extensive Scale of Business, and possessing a great Capital, as well as substantial Security, unconnedled with the Indies, pointedly dated this, from his own1 recent Experience, and added, that the Difficulties proceeded not from Money being fearer, but from its being valuable; that it was easily procured for Periods of Two or Three Months; but that even with good Credit, and on the bed Securities, it was at all Times difficult, and at this Moment impossible, to procure so large a Sum for so long a Period as was necessary in the present Cafe.

Your Committee were strongly confirmed in this Opinion by the Information they received from Mr. Alderman Curtis, Mr. Alderman and Mr.

Thornton, Members of the Committee; and also from some Gentlemen who had been Commissioners under the AA passed in the Year 1793, for the Relief of Commercial Credit.

Your Committee feel it their Duty to submit to the House, as the Relult of their Examination, That the Allegations in the Petition referred to them, have been fully proved j and particularly that the Engagements which have been contracted on the-Credit of the expeCted Remittances cannot be fulfilled, nor those Supplies furnished which are necessary for the future Cultivation of the Islands, unless on a Consideration of the special Circumstances of the Cafe, Parliament should in its Wisdom think fit to adopt such Measures as may render the Credit and Resources of the Parties intereded, effectual for the Purpose of relieving them from their present Embarraffinents.

Ordered, That the said Report be referred to the Consideration of a Committee of the whole House.

liejoked, That this House will, upon Monday Morning next, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, to consider of the said Report.

MR. Thomas Stanley reported from the Committee, itnarefbo-to whom the Bill for enlarging the Time, and rough Forest reviving certain Powers, granted by an Act of Parlia- Bl11 reporltd‘ ment, made in the Twenty-ninth Year of the Reign of H is present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for reviving certain Powers granted by an Act, made in *« the Tenth Year of the Reign of His present Ma-" jesty, intituled, “ An Act for dividing and inclosing such of the Open Parts of the District called The “ Forest of Knaresborough, in the County of York, as *« lie within the Eleven Constablerics thereof, and for other Purposes therein mentioned ;” and fly an Act of the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, for “ amending the said former Act, and for making the said Two Acts more effectual,” was committed;

That the Committee had examined, and found that the said Bill is not within the Standing Orders of the House relative to Bills of Inclosure, the Bill being only for reviving the Powers of Two former Acts; and that the Committee had examined the Allegations of the Bill, and found the same to be true; and that the Committee had gone through the Bill, and made several Amendments thereunto, which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered the Bill, with the Amendments, in at the Clerk's Table: Where the Amendments were Once read throughout; and then a Second Time, One by One; and, upon the Question severally put thereupon, were agreed to by the House.

Ordered, That the Bill, *with the Amendments, be ingrafted.

Sir Charles Morgan reported from the Committee, Petition r*-to whom the Petition of the Noblemen, and the hum- [f^of ble Petition of the several other Persons, whose Names future Appli* are thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves and gau others, interested in the Navigation of the River Brink and*

in the County of Norfolk, and Owners of Lands lying King'* Lynn in, and adjoining to the Middle and South Level of

the Fens called Bedford Level, and of the Low Landsad-joining, or near to the said Levels, and in divers other Lands adjoining, or near to, the said River Ouze, and draining through the same to Sea, was referred; That the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the

7 Q Clerk's

6 02

Clerk's Table: Where the same was reid; and is as followeth j viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act. passed in this present Session of Parliament, intituled, " An Act for improving the Drainage of the Middle and South Levels, Part of the Great Level r* of the Feas, called Bedford , and the Low *< Lands adjoining; or near to, the said Levels; as also the Lands adjoining, or near to, the River in

the County of Norfolk, draining through the same to Sea, by the Harbour of King's , in the said County; and for altering and improving the Navi- gation of the said River Ouze, from, or near, a Place “ called Eau Brink, in the Parish of IViggenbaU Saint

A tury,in the said County, to the said Harbour of

“ King's Lynn; and for improving and preserving the ct Navigation of the several Rivers communicating with the said River 0#ze,”'was read: And,

William Creafy, Esquire, being examined, he was alked, Whether the Works directed to be done by the Commissioners appointed by the Act, were necessary for the Preservation, Improvement, and Relief of the Great Level of the Fens, and of the adjoining Lands, and the Navigation patting through the same ? he said. He thought they were absolutely necessary. — And being alked, Whether the Execution of those Works would be attended with any conflderable Expence ? he said, Very great. — Then,

Two Clauses in the above-mentioned Act were read, by which it appears, that the Commissioners for Drainage were empowered to raise . 70,000; and the Commissioners for Navigation ,£.8,000 for a Term of Ten Years.

And the Witness being again examined, he was alked, Whether there was reason to apprehend that the Tax on Land, and Tonnage on Navigation for the respectire Terms limited by the Act, would afford a sufficient Security for the Money so directed to be borrowed ? he said. He believed it would not. — And being alked, Whether it will be expedient and ne-eeflary, in order to'carry the Act into effectual Execution, to apply to Parliament in the next Session for further Powers, and especially for an Extenflon of the Term limited for the Tax and Tonnage ? he said. He believed it to be absolutely necessary, in order to give a sufficient Security to those who might be disposed to lend Money upon them. — And being alked. If he believed that such Extenflon was consonant to the Opinions and Wilhes of a great Majority of the Persons concerned in the Lands and Navigation, for the effectual Completion of the necessary and important Plan sanctioned by Parliament I he said. He believed it was agreeable to a great Majority of the Country, as well those concerned in Navigation, as in Drainage j that his Reasons for this Belief were, because he inserted in the Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge Papers Advertisements, apprising the Country of the Necessity of the Extenflon of the Term of the Tax and Tonnage. — That he likewise attended the First Meeting of the Commissioners for putting the Act into Execution, at Lynn, where a very numerous Attendance of Commissioners, as well for Drainage as Navigation, were present, when the Petition (now before the Committee) was read, and it appeared.to be very much approved of; and that he likewise wrote circular Letters to different Agents in different Parts, in order to collect the Sense of the Country, as to such Extenflon; and the Result was, that such Extenflon was much approved of — That he had the Advertisements inserted previous to the Meeting of the Commissioners, a Fortnight or Three Weeks — That it had been generally understood by the Country, that a Power would have been inserted in the Act lately passed for making this Extenflon, and the Advertisements were inserted to apprize the Country why it was not done; and likewise to express an Opinion, that it was necessary.

A. 1795.

and that such Application *as intended to be made in the next Session of Parliament. — And being alked. Whether he understood that the Application would come under the Standing Orders of the House, respecting Drainage and Navigation Bills ? he said. It certainly would. — And being alked, If the Extent of Country to which the Application would relate, was very large; and whether the Persons to whom it would be requiflte to apply for their Consent, were very numerous, and dispersed at great Distancas throughout different Parts of the Kingdom ? he said. He believed there were about 140 Parishes in which Notice mult be given under the Standing Orders respecting Drainage Bills — That it would be necessary to employ Six Agents, who must travel Two thousand Miles in giving such Notices; and that it would be necessary to employ Twelve Agents more to make Application to the different Land Owners, who would be taxed by the Bill, for their Consent; and that these Agents muff travel, as he supposed, between Five and Ten thousand Miles. — That the Expence of making such Application, and giving such Notices, would in his Opinion amount to near £. 2,500. — And being alked.

What was the Expence occasioned by the Notices to those 140 Parishes on the former Occasion for the late Bill ? he said. He had not got all the Bills from the different Agents employed. — And being alked. What was the Amount, according to those Bills he had got I he said, He had not a Angle Bill with him, and that he did not know the Amount. — And being alked. What was the Amount of the Expences of die Applications to the individual Land Owners? he said, He did not know. — And being alked. Not knowing the Sums demanded by the Agents, on giving the Notices to the respective Land Owners respecting the late Bill, on what Data did be form his Opinion that the Expence for the Application and Notices for the new Bill would be £. 2,500 ? he said. From the Amount of some Bills he had received, and from his Knowledge of the immense Country, the Agents were obliged to travel to apply for the Confcnts, and as these could not be Ids than Twelve in Number; he estimated the Expence of Agents Time, Horse Hire, and travelling Expences (being most of them professional Men) could not amount to less than 200 each — That when he said £. 2,500, he did not mean to speak precisely; it might be £. 500, more or less. — That he was Solicitor to the late Bill. — And being alked. Whether he did not expect to be Solicitor to the- intended Bill ? he said. He did nor, because his Affairs required his Attendance so in the Country that it would not admit of his undertaking it. — And being alked. What was the Amount of his Demand for the late Expences incurred by him as Solicitor for the late Bill ? he said, He had not made out his Bill, nor could he venture to give an Opinion what the Amount would be, as he had not so far put the Bills together. — And being alked, Whether the Advertisements inserted by him in the Provincial Papers, werefo inserted by his own Act, without any Authority? he said. They were not — That he was authorized by the Principal Promoters of the Eau Brink Act, and many of the Commissioners appointed under that Act; and that Lord Hardwicke's Signature, or Mr. s{he did not

rightly know which) was annexed to the Advertisements, as Chairman at the Meeting — That it was a Meeting held in the Committee Room in Manchester Buildings, in Westminster; and that he attended the Meeting, and took the Minutes — That he could not tell the exact Time of this Meeting, having no Memorandums with him. — And being alked. Whether it was before the passing of the Act? he said. He could not correctly say whether or not before the Act had received the Royal Assent — That he attended the Meeting at Lynn; and that there were at lead: Forty Commissioners present. — And being alked, Whether

any

16° Junii.

$5 Geo.lit is0;

any Public Minutes yrtre committed to Writing at that Meeting? he raid. Yes; and entered in Minute Books, and he believed they were subscribed by the Chairman to the Commi(Coners, and that the Minutes have since been inferred in the Cambridge Papers — That no Entry was then made of the intended Application, and that no public Debate took Place on that Subject. — And being alked, Whether he did not know that when the First Application was made to the Proprietors of Estates interested in the late Eau Brink Drainage Bill, that the Term intended to be created under that Act, was laid to be only Ten Years ? he said, He did; and that it was so expressed in the Con-lent Bill. — And being aiked, Whether he and all the Promoters of that Bill, during the whole Term of Three Years, while depending in the House of Commons, did not constantly hold the same Language regarding this Term of Ten Years ? he said. He believed they might — That the First Circumstance that pointed out the Nc-ceflity of extending the Term beyond Ten Years, was ' the Alteration of the Plan settled by Sir 'Thomas Page and Mr. My ire, and since sanctioned by the Act. — And

being alked, Whether he did not know that the Original Estimate of the new Cut was estimated at £. 53,000 only ? he said. He believed it was thereabouts. — And being alked. Whether the additional Sum of £. 25,000 more, was not created under the Act, in consequence of the new Estimate attending the Alteration of the new Cut, as recommended by the said before-mentioned Gentlemen ? be said,. He bea lieved it was. — And being alked. Why he suppoled that that Sum, so estimated, will be inadequate to the Undertaking? he said, Because the Cut is much extended in Width, and a greater Quantity of Land mull be purchased in consequence, — And being alked. Whether any Advertisements had been inferred in any Newspapers since the passing of the Act* soliciting the Loan of Money for carrying it into Execution ? he said, None — That he supposed no Persons would ad--vance their Money under the present Security of the Act, because the Tax and Tonnage would not be fuft* ficient to pay the Interest and Principal within that Termr — That the Annual Amount of the said Tax and Tonnage will be about £.6,400 — That the Amount of this Annual Estimate was known, as well before, as since the pairing of the Act. — And being alked. Whether he did not believe that many of the Proprietors who originally subscribed the Petition for the late Bill, would have objefled to any longer Term of Taxation than Ten Years? he said. He believed many would at that Time. — And being alked. Whether the Promoters of the Bill were not bound in Honour to let that Term continue in the Bill? he said* It is in the Bill — That he has no precise Estimate of the Works to be done under the Bill, nor cars one be formed, as he conceives, until Sir Thomas Part and Mr. Mylne have gone into the Country, and let out the Work upon the Spot — That he speaks from general Information, obtained in Conversations with different Engineers who have been employed. — And being alked. Whether it was the Object of this Petition to encrease the Sum of £. 78,000 to be borrowed under the Act, or only to strengthen the Security to be given to the Creditors to advance that Sum t he said. It was not intended to encrease the Sum, but only to add to the Security of the Lenders of it. — And being alked. Why he could say that it was not intended to exceed the Sum.of £.78,000, when he said that there had been no Estimate made of the Expence of the Work to be done ? he said. Though no precise Estimate had been,made, yet the Engineers may form such an Opinion, as to say that £. 78,000 will be quite competent to all the Works; and from that general Opinion which he has received from them all, he noW ventures to say he believes £. 78,000 will be sufficient. — And being alked. Whether the Works intended to be done

were so exactly marked out and ascertained at prefenr, so as to enable the Engineers to be able to ascertain the Expence with any Accuracy at all ? he said. He thought the general Outline was iufficieritly marked to form such an Estimate as he was speaking of — That he means to say, that no more than £. 78,000 was to be borrowed — That he does not know to what Number of Years the Term is to be extended j but that he believes the Extenlion of the Tetm is intended to be made corrvnenfurate to the Expence. — And being alked, Though the Subject of the Extension df the Term was not publicly debated at the Meeting of the Commissioners at Lynn, whether it was not made the Subject of Conversation by many of the Commissioners present ? he said, He believed he might hear from some of them a Term of Five Years mentioned, but it was never argued. — And being alked. Whether it was not approved of by all who did mention it ? he said, He did not hear any Persons object to it, further than Mr. Everard, of Lynn, and the Mayor, who said they had not had sufficient Information from their Friends, and therefore, for the present, declined signing the Petition. — And being alked, What Petition he (the Witness) referred to ? he laid. That which \i before the present Committee, which was then publicly read before that Meeting.

Ordered, That the said Report do lie upon the Table.

Ordered, That the Order of the Day, for the House Committee on to resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, xa°for* upon the Bill to continue an Act, made in the Twenty- JLwurage^ sixth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, in- mentofHemjl tituled, An Act to continue and render more ef- a,ul F1“*

My Lords, and Gentlemen,

At the Close of the lafb Section, I informed you of the Concern with which I observed the Disputes unhappily subsisting in the Republic of the United Provinces.

Their Situation soon afterwards became more critical and alarming, and the Danger which threatened

their

4 27° Novetnbr, 17^7*

their Constitution and Independence, seemed likely in My Lords, and Gentlemen, its Consequences to affect the Security and Interests The flourishing State of the Commerce and Reve-of My Dominidfis. nues of this Country, cannot fail to encourage you

No Endeavours were wanting on My Part to con- in the Pursuit of such Measures as may confirm and tribute fiy My good Offices to the Reftqration of improve so favourable a Situation.

Tranquillity, and the Maintenance of the lawful Go- These, Circumstances must also render you pecu-vernment; and I also thought it necessary to explain ]jariy anxious for the Continuance of Public Tran-My Intention of counterading all forcible Inter- quillity, which it is My constant Object to preference on the Part of France, in the internal Af- fe

fairs of the Republic. Under these Circumstances, the King of Prussia having taken Measures to en-> force his Demand of Satisfaction for the Insult off fered to the Princess of Orange, the Party which had usurped the Government of Holland applied to the Most Christian King for Assistance, who notified to Me his Intention of granting their Request.

In Conformity to the Principles which I had before explained, I did not hesitate, on receiving this Notification, to declare, that I could not remain a quiet Spedator of the armed Interference of , and I gave immediate Orders for augmenting My Forces both by Sea and Land.

In the Course of these Transactions, I also thought proper to conclude a Treaty with the Landgrave of Hejfe Caffiel, by which I secured the Assistance of a considerable Body of Troops in case My Service Should require it.

In the mean Time, the rapid Success of the PruJ/ian Troops under the Conduct of the Duke of while it was the Means of obtaining the Reparation demanded by the King of , enabled the Provinces to deliver themselves from the Oppression under which they laboured, and to re-establish their lawful Government.

All Subjects of Contest being thus removed, an amicable Explanation took place between Me and the Most Christian King, and Declarations have been exchanged by Our respective Ministers, by which We have agreed mutually to disarm, and to place Our Naval Establishments on the same Footing as in the Beginning of the present Year.

It gives Me the greatest Satisfaction that the important Events, which I have communicated to you, have taken place without disturbing My Subjects in the Enjoyment of the Blessings of Peace; and I have great Pleasure in acquainting you, that I continue to receive from all Foreign Powers the fulleft Af-furances of their pacific and friendly Dispofuion towards this Country. I must, at the same Time, regret that the Tranquillity of one Part of Europe is unhappily interrupted by the War which has broken out between Russia and The Porte.

A Convention has been agreed upon between Me and the Most Christian King, explanatory of the Thirteenth Article of the last Treaty of Peace, and calculated to prevent Jealousies and Disputes between Our respective Subjects in The East Indief. —

I have ordered Copies of the several Treaties to which I have referred, and of the Declaration and Counter Declaration exchanged at f'er/ailles, to be laid before you.

Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

I have ordered the Estimates for the ensuing Year to be laid before you, together with an Account of the extraordinary Expences which the Situation of Affairs rendered necessary.

I have the fulleft Reliance on your Zeal and Public Spirit, that you will make due Provision for the several Branches of the Public Service. I am always desirous of confining those Expences within the narrowed Limits which a prudent Regard to the Public Safety will permit j but I must at the same Time recommend it to your particular Attention to consider of the proper Means for maintaining My distant Possessions in an adequate Posture of Defence,

I am at the same Time persuaded that you will agree with Me in thinking that nothing can more effectually tend to secure ft) invaluable a Blessing, than the Zeal and Unanimity which were shewn by all Ranks of My Subjects on the late Occasion, and which manifest their Readiness to exert themselves whenever the Honour of My Crown and the Interests of My Dominions may require it,

That we feel, in the strongest Manner, the Propriety and Necessity of the Declaration made by His Majesty in Conformity to those Principles, when the Intention of the Most Christian King was notified to His Majesty, as well as of the seasonable and vigorous Steps taken for the immediate Augmentation of His Majesty’s Forces both by Sea ancTLand:

That the rapid and brilliant Success of the Arms, under the Conduct of his Serene Highness the Duke of Brun/wick, affords us Matter of peculiar Satisfaction, both as it was the Means of obtaining the Reparation demanded by the King of Prussia, and as it has enabled the Provinces to deliver themselves from the Oppression under which they laboured, and to re-establish their lawful Government:

That we cordially congratulate His Majesty on the important Events which have taken Place without disturbing His Majesty’s Subjects in the Enjoyment of the Blessings of Peace, and which have enabled His Majesty to enter into an Agreement with the Most Christian King for mutually disarming, and placing the Naval Establishments of the Two Countries on the same Footing as in the Beginning of the present Year:

To express our Thanks for the Communication of the several Treaties and Declarations which have been ordered by His Majesty to be laid before this House: That we shall fee with Pleasure any Arrangement properly calculated to prevent Jealousies and Disputes between His Majesty’s Subjects and those *of the Most Christian King in Ea/l Indies , and that we shall proceed, without Loss of Time, to consider what Steps it may be fit to take in Consequence of the other Engagements entered into by His Majesty:

And if they Should be required to serve in Great Britain or Ireland, Notice thereof shall be given to the Most Serene Landgrave, when they shall not only be put upon the same Footing, in all Respects, with the tijhNational Troops; but His Moll Serene High-refs hopes further, that, in same any Troops

should be sent to the Continent, and serve with the HrJJians, His Majesty will be pleased to agree, that the latter may be then treated as the former with regard to Pay, as well as other Matters, the more so as His Most Serene Highness, to prove to His Majesty his earned: Desire to serve him, has consented to receive a more moderate Subsidy than was paid bn all former Occasions of this Nature since the Year 1726. These Allowances, if granted, shall be paid into the Military Chest of His Most Serene Highness, without any Deduction or Abatement, in order that the Distribution thereof may be made to His Troops.

And when His Majesty the King of Great Britain shall be pleased to lend back the said Troops, He shall give Three Months §

previous Notice thereof to His Most Serene Highness; and cause One Month’s Pay to be remitted to Him for their Return, providing them with the necessary Means of Transport Gratis.

And the Most Serene Landgrave on His Part also promises, that in case His Majesty the King of Great Britain shall be attacked or disturbed in His Kingdoms, Dominions, Countries, Provinces, or Towns, he will afford Him, in like Manner, all the Aid which may be in his Power to give Him, which shall be in like Manner continued until His Majesty shall have obtained a good and advantageous Peace., If it should happen that, in Consequence of the present Troubles, a War should be kindled in Germany, and become general, His Britannick Majesty promises, as far as possible, to provide for the Security of the Dominions and Possessions of His Most Serene Highness, and to direct the Military Operations of His Armies, as far as Circumstances may permit, in such a Manner as to cover and sparc the Territories of His Most Serene Highness as far as may be. If however, notwithstanding the Precautions which may be taken for this EffcCl, the Territories of His Most Serene Highness Should suffer an Invasion from the Enemy on Account of this Alliance, and of the present Treaty, His Britannick Majesty will endeavour to procure for the said Landgrave an Indemnification proportionable to the Loss that may be occasioned thereby, according as has been heretofore done on similar Occasions.

some Difficulties having arisen relative to the vacant Pay, which is to be regarded as the principal Fund for defraying the Expence of Recruiting, it is agreed, That at the Spring Review made before the Opening of a Campaign, by His Britann Majesty’s Commis-fary, the Corps shall either be compleat, or the Pay for those wanting be stopt; on the other Hand, the Pay for those who may be wanting to compleat, during the Interval between one Spring Review and another, shall not be stopt, but is to be advanced, without Deduction, for the full Establishment of the Corps j and, instead of the Sum formerly allowed for each Recruit, to replace One Killed, or Three Wounded, it is agreed, that, in lieu thereof. Twelve Banco Crowns per Head shall be allowed for every Recruit, without Distinction, that shall be raised to supply their Places; but it is at the same Time to be understood, that this Stipulation extends only to the particular Objett here in question.

Petition for regulating the Coal Trade at Newcaltle and Sunderland.

White Sheet Kill Road Petition reported*

Gentlemen,

I return you My hearty Thanks for this very loyal and dutiful Address. The Satisfaction you express irt the Measures which I have pursued, and in the important Events which have taken Place, afford Me peculiar Pleasure.

You may depend upon My invariable Attention to the Happiness and Prosperity of My Kingdoms.

A Petition of the Owners, and Part Owners of Ships, using the Coal Trade in the Port of Tyne, was presented to the fioufe, and read; Setting forth, That by an Act, passed in the Sixth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “An “ Act to regulate the loading of Ships with Coals in “ the Ports of Newcastle and divers use-' ful and salutary Regulations were tstablished for ascertaining the Turn or Rotation, and directing the Manner in which Ships Should be laden with Coals in the said Ports, which Act was to continue in Force for Seven Years; and that, by.an Act, passed in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, reciting the said Act of the Sixth Year of His said Majesty, and that the same had proved useful to the Coal Trade, it was enacted,'that the said Act Should be continued from the Expiration thereof for the further Term of Seven Years; and that, by another Act, passed in the Twenty-second Year of Hrs present Majesty’s Reign, reciting, that the said Act of the Sixth Year of His said Majesty, had been found highly beneficial to the Coal Trade of Newcastle and Sunderland, by excluding all undue Preference in the Loading of Coals at such Ports, whereby the Public in general, and the London Market in particular, were constantly and regularly supplied with Fuel on reasonable Terms, and that the Revival and Continuance of the said Act of the Sixth Year of His present Majesty, would be of great public Utility, it was enaffed, that the said Act Should be revived and Continue in full Force and Effect until the 25th Day of March 1789, and from thence to the End of the

then next Session of Parliament; and that although under the Regulations established by the said Act of the Sixth Year of His present Majesty, the Coal Trade has greatly increased in the said Ports of Newcastle and Sunderland, and the Shipping and Seamen employed therein have become more numerous than at any former Period, the Petitioners conceive such Regulations may be extended and rendered still more beneficial to the Public and the Trade, and that, as from the Short Duration of the said Act, it will be soon necessary to apply to Parliament for its further Continuance, it will be more expedient now to bring in a Bill for repealing the fame, and for subjecting the Loading of Ships with Coals in both the said , Ports to further and more extended Regulations: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill to repeal the said Act of the Sixth Year of His present Majesty, and for the better Regulation of the Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of Newcastle and Sunderland.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Brandling, the Lord Mulgrave, See.: And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to fend for Persons, Papers, and Records.

Mr. Penruddocke reported from the Committee, to whom the Petition of several Gentlemen, Clergy, and Freeholders, of the County of was referred ;

That the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, of the acth of Vol.XLIII.

April 1774, relative to Turnpike Bills, had been complied with; and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, tValter Whitaker, Esquire, being examined, said. That he knows the Road leading from the Turnpike Road . from the Bottom of White Sheet Hill, in the Parish of Donhead Saint Andrew, in the County of Wilts, through the several Parishes of Donhead Saint Andrew aforesaid, Anjly, Swallowclift, Sutton Mandezille,

Compton, Chamberlaine, Baverjlock, and Barford, to the

Turnpike Road at or near Barford aforesaid, on the Road leading to the Town of Wilton, in the County of Wilts; that the same is greatly out of Repair, and is in some Parts very narrow and incommodious for Travellers and Carriages, and cannot be effectually amended, widened, and kept in good Repair, by the present Methods provided by Law; and that in widening and making the same commodious, it will be necessary to lay into the said Road Part of certain Orchards and Gardens, in the Parishes of Fovant and Sutton Mandeville, in the Occupation of Nathaniel Rowden, John Goodfellow, Richard Qoodfdlow, William Ingram, Ann While, John Smith, and Samuel Snooke. '

And the Witness being further examined, said, That the repairing and widening the said Road will be a Means of increasing the Tolls upon several Turnpike Roads near and adjoining thereto; and that the Trustees and Creditors of those Roads are willing to advance Money, to be applied in widening and repairing the said Road, and keeping the same ih Repair — That, in order to prevent evading the Tolls, it wilt be necessary to erect a Gate at the Bottom of White. Sheet Hill,upon the Shaftesbury Turn-' pike Road, ih Consideration whereof if is proposed (out of the Tolls arising by the intended Act) to repair and keep in repair the Road from thence to the Top of White Sheet Hill, during such Time as it shall be found necessary to continue such Side Gate.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in H Bill for amending, widening, and keeping in Repair, the Road from the Bottom of White Sheet Hill, through Hurdcot, to the Wilton Turnpike Road at or neat* Barford, in the County of Wilts: And that Mr. Penruddocke and Mr. Goddard do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

On the contrary, the said Warren Hajiings does solemnly affirm, that, during the whole Period of his long and arduous Government, he did steadily and uniformly, according to the belt of his Judgment, and the Means within his Power, pursue and endeavour to advance the Interest of the East India Company and the British Nation j and he trusts that, in the Result of such Examination as his Conduct will receive from the Wisdom and Justice of your Lordships, it will appear that the Welfare of the East India Company has been, during the Exercise of his said Office, materially promoted, the Happiness of the Native Inhabitants of India protested and increased, their Confidence in English Faith and Lenity conciliated and confirmed, and the Honour of the Crown, and the Character of the British Nation, industriously and successfully maintained. And the said H'arren Hajiings, before he proceeds to answer the several Articles wherewith he stands charged, humbly begs Leave to state, that whereas the said Articles do in many Instances contain long Narrations and Recitals of supposed Fasts and Circumstances, which do neither in themselves import, nor are mate-Vol. XLIIIv

rially relevant to any criminal Charge against him the said Warren Hajiings, he humbly presumes to hope, that, in submitting to answer the fame, he shall noc be understood to admit such Narrations or Recitals to contain any Matter of criminal Charge, or that he shall thereby preclude himlclf from infilling that he was not by Law required to make Answer thereunto.

And whereas the true Nature of many Measures, charged against him the said Warren Hajiings as Offences, can only be made appear by a full Exposition and Detail of the general State of Public A. flairs at the Times when such Measures were respectively adopted, and by a particular Explanation of the several Motives which induced the Adoption of such Measures , yet > the said Warren Hajiings, conceiving that an Answer framed in that Extent would have been inconfiftenc with the usual Course of your Lordships Proceedings, and that such Matters may be more properly refer ved for Evidence and Defence in a future Stage of this Proceeding; he will endeavour, as much as possible, to confine his Answer to a plain Denial or Admission of the Fasts in the said Articles stated, and in general to abstain from all Exposition and Detail of the Measures and Fasts themselves, and of the Motives from which the same originated, except where such Exposition and Detail are immediately necessary for the Purpose of rendering his Answer intelligible; and he humbly hopes, that your Lordships Justice will not suffer any Conclusions to be drawn to his Disadvantage from such his Answer to the said Articles, but will allow him to enter into such Exposition and Detail, when he shall hereafter be permitted to make his Defence at your Lordships Bar. And further, inasmuch as many of the Fasts in the said Articles stated or referred to, did not fall within the personal Knowledge of the said Warren Hajiings, and could only be known to him by Intelligence transmitted to him by other Persons, the said Warren Hajiings humbly presumes to hope, that the Admissions and Denials by him made will, in such Cafes, be construed only to mean that Intelligence was by him received to the Effect stated in his laid Answer. And further, inasmuch as several Fasts and Circumstances stated in the said Articles are complicated with various Aggravations and Inferences, so as to render it extremely difficult for him to acknowledge some of such Fasts and Circumstances, without acknowledging, or seeming to acknowledge, the Inferences drawn therefrom, or the Aggravations wherewith they are accompanied, the said N Hajiings further hopes that he may, without any Violation of the ordinary Course of your Lordships Proceedings, be. allowed to distinguish between Acts themselves, and the Inferences drawn from them by the said Articles} and that whenever he admits any Fast, he may not be understood to admit that such Fast was by him done or committed upon such Motives, and with such Designs, or in such Manner, as is suggested in the said Articles. And with these Re-fervations, as to so much of the said Articles as it is material or necessary for him to answer, the said Warren Hajiings answers as follows:

FIRST ARTICLE.

To the First Article the said Warren Hajiings fays, That Rajah Bulwant Sing, therein named, was not a Chief in any Sense of the Word, which imports independent and sovereign Power, nor was he a Zemindar of certain Provinces, as in the said Article is alledged, dependent upon the Mogul Empire, through Sujab Dowla, Nabob of Oude, and Vizier of the said Empire: And the said Warren Hajiings fays, that in or about the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Sixty-four, the Piefidenr and Council of Fort William

actuated by any of the corrupt Motives or Views in the said First Article charged upon him. And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that in or about the Month of July, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, it' was unanimously aereed in Council, on the Motion of the said Warren that the said Cheyt Sing Should be required to contribute the Sum of Five Lacks, as his Share for the Expence of the War for the current Year; and it was at the same Time agreed that the Governor General and Council Should be required to write to the said Rajah Cheyt Sing, acquainting him that the Period of One Year, for which he had agreed to pay Five Lacks of Mucklidar Rupees, as his Share of the Burthen of the War with France,on the Seventeenth of August% One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-

eight, was expired, and as the Continuation of the War (till made it necessary to maintain the same Establishment of Troops for the Defence of the Country, that the Board deemed it requisite that he Should at that Time contribute the further Sum of Five- Lacks of Mucklidar Rupees, as his Proportion of the Charge for the current Year; and that therefore the Resident had been directed to apply to him for the fame. And the said Warren Hajiings lays, that he did accordingly write a Letter to the said Cheyt Sing, to that Effect. And the said Warren Hajiings infills, that the said Rajah Cheyt Sing was bound to comply with the said Demand, and that he was fully able so to do; notwithstanding which, and although repeated Applications were by the said Resident made to the said Cheyt Sing, for the Payment of the said Sum of Money, the said Cheyt Sing falsely alledged that it was absolutely out of his Power.to raise the Sum required, and did on such Pretence withhold the Payment thereof. And the said Resident having represented to the Board that he had continued to renew the said Demand on the Rajah every Second Day, and finding that he held to the Terms of his First Refusal, and seeing no Probability of a speedy Change in his Sentiments, he was unavoidably reduced to the Necdfity of applying to the Board for farther Instructions; whereupon it became the Duty of the said Warren Hajiings, and of the said Council, to have Recourse to some effectual Method to enforce the Payment thereof; and it was accordingly resolved by the Board, on the Motion of the said Warren that the Com-

mander in Chief Should be directed to issue an Order for the March of Two Battalions of Sepoys to Benares, on the Requisition of Mr. ‘Thomas Graham, and there to remain for the further Orders of the Board that the whole Expence of that Detachment, from the Day of its March, Should be paid by the Rajah of Benares-, that such Resolution Should be communicated to him by the Governor General; and that the Resident Should be ordered to inform the Rajah of it, repeating his Demand for the Sum required; and in case of his Refusal or Non-compliance with the said Demand, the Resident Should give immediate Notice to the Officer in Command of the Detachment, that he might March accordingly. And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that he did accordingly, by Letter, and by Means of the said Resident, apprize the said Rajah of such Resolution, who having afterwards promised to pay the said Sum, did notwithstanding renew his said false Pretence of Inability, and withhold the Payment thereof, to the great Injury of the public Service j whereupon the said Resident, in pursuance of the aforesaid Directions of the Board, did require Major Carnac to March to Benares with the Detachment under his Command; and the said Sum of Five Lacks was, in consequenpe thereof, paid in full by the said Cheyt Sing, together with the Expence incurred by the March of the said Detachment. And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that in the Month of August, One thousand Vot. XLIII.

Seven hundred and Seventy-eight,-Advices were sent by the Governor General and Council to the said Court of Directors, containing an Account of the Measures pursued by the Board upon the Receipt of the Intelligence of a War in Europe, One of which Measures was the said First Demand of Subsidy from the said Cheyt Sing, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-eight, and which Measure had been, by a Minute at the Board, referred to the said Court for their Decision on the Right to demand the fame.- And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that on or about the Month of One thousand

Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, Letters were received from the said Court of Directors, acknowledging the Receipt of the said Advices; but in the said Letters the said Court of Directors did not express any Disapprobation either of the Demand itself, or of the Right to make or enforce the fame. And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that afterwards, on Twenty-second June, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty, the Governor General and Council, he being then Governor General, did again unanimously resolve to demand from the said Rajah Cheyt Sing, a further Sum of Five Lacks of Rupees; and which was accordingly demanded on account of the same Exigencies as had occasioned the Demands made in the Two preceding Years. And the said Warren Haf-tings fays, that the said Cheyt Sing did, on the said Demand being made known to him, consent and promise to comply with the fame; but notwithstanding such Promise and Consent, he did again, under various false Pretences, delay and withhold the Payment of the said Sum, to the great Detriment of the public Service; whereupon the said Governor General and Council did, on the Motion of the said Hajiings, unanimously order that Mr. Fowke, then Resident at Benares, Should inform the Rajah that the Board were much displeased with his affeded Delays, knowing his Ability to make the immediate Payment of the Subsidy; and that the said Resident Should peremptorily require him to discharge the fame. And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that afterwards, on the Twenty-sixth OAober, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty, the Board having been inform-,ed, by a Letter from the said Resident, that the Rajah, notwithstanding his solemn Assurance, had paid no Part of the Balance of his Subsidy, but had resumed his Plea of Inability, and that the said Resident could form no Opinion how long the said Cheyt Sing might think proper to protrad the Payment, the said Board did, on the Recommendation of the said Warren HaJ-tings, resolve that the said Resident Should be directed to demand instant Payment of the Balance due on Account of the Subsidy of the said Cheyt Sing-, and that, if he Should not have paid it at the Time of the Receipts of their Order, that the said Resident Should, in the Name of the Board, exact Payment of the further Sum of One Lack of Rupees, as a Fine for his past Disobedience; and that, to enforce such Order, Brigadier General Should be directed

to issue Orders to the Commanding Officers of the Battalions of the nearest Station to Benares, to march immediately to that Place, and to wait such Orders -as might be thereafter transmitted to them; and that, in the mean Time, the Board Should be informed of the Reception given by the Rajah to that Order, which, it was hoped, might be such as Should render it unnecessary to proceed to Extremities against him: But the said Warren Hajiings fays, that the said Balance being discharged, the proposed Fine was not then levied. And with respect to so much of the said First Article as relates to the said Sum of Two Lacks of Rupees therein stated to have been privately received by the said Warren Hajiings, from a Person named Sadanund, Buxey or Treallirer to the said Rajah, as a Present or Bribe, and which, by the said

L First:

tirft Article, is supposed to have been given on the Account therein dated, the said Warrtn (re-

ferring to his Answer hereinafter made in that Behalf) denies that the fame, or any other Sum of Money* was ever received by him as a Bribe* or for his own Use, or for any corrupt or criminal Purpose whatsoever, or was ever so applied.

And the said Warren H faith, That On or about the Second November, One thousand Seven hun-

dred and Eighty, it was agreed in Council that he the said WarreH Hastings Should be requested to write

to the Rajah of Benares, requiring him to furnish such Part of the Cavalry entertained in his Service as he could sparc for the Service of the Company, and to inform the said Warren Hastings what Number he the said Rajah could supply; and it was likewise agreed, that a Letter should be written to Mr. the Resident at Benares, directing him to make the said Requisition; and the said Resident was directed to inform the Rajah, that the said Force would be no longer required than during the Continuance of the War which then existed, and that it would be returned at the Clofc of it; which Requisitions were accordingly made; and the said Warren Hastings avers that the same were, in the then State of the Company’s Affairs, expedient and necessary to be made; and he denies that the Resolution last mentioned was made, or that he proposed or concurred therein, in Prosecution of any malicious or criminal Design whatsoever.

And the said Warren Hastings denies, That he did enter into any Negociation with the Nabob of for the Sale of the said Territories to the said Vizier for a Sum of Money to be paid to th India Company, as in the said Article is alledged but the said Warren Hastings insists that if he had entered into a Negociation with the said Vizier on this Subject, that he would not have been thereby guilty of any Act in Defiance of the Letter or Spirit of any Treaty, or Agreement, then subsisting between the said Rajah and the East India Company.

And the said Warren Hastings fays. That he did some Time in the Month of January, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, in consequence of repeated Repreferttations, the Truth where, of he had then sufficient Reason to believe, write a Letter to the said Rajah Cheyt Sing, which he conceives to be alluded to in the said First Article, of which the following is a Copy: “ Frequent Representations “ having been made to me of the Want of Punduality in the Payment of your Malguzary, that Part “ more particularly which is designed for the Dif-u burfement of Seidut Ally Khan’s Salary; and it “ having at this Time more than any other a bad and “ suspicious Appearance, I do peremptorily order that “ all Arrears of whatsoever Kind be paid up within “ Twenty-four Hours after the Receipt of this Per- wanna, or you must expert that bad Consequences “ will follow.” And the said Warren Hastings denies that the said Letter was written with any of the criminal Motives or Designs in the said Article charged upon him, or that he was in any other Manner criminal in rel'ped thereof. And the said Warren Hastings further fays, that in or about the Month of July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, it was resolved in Council, amongst other Things, that he the said Warren Hastings should be inverted with full Power and Authority to form such Arrangements with the Rajah of Benares for the better Government and Management of his Zemindary, and to perform such Acts for the Improvement of the Interest which the Company poflcITcd in it, as he the said Warren Hastings might think fit and consonant to the mutual Relation, and actual Engagements, subsisting between the Company and the said Rajah. And the said Warren Hastings-, admits that he did concur in the said Resolution, but

he denies that he did thereby invert himself with ait illegal or dangerous Delegation of the Powers of the whole Council, without any Authority given to him so to do by the East Ihdia Company, or by any Act of Parliament; or that the said Delegation was in any Manner illegal or dangerous, of unwarrantable: And further the said Warren Hastings admits, that he did Undertake a Journey to the Upper Provinces, and in particular to the Province of Benares but he denies that he undertook the said Journey from the Motives, or with the Designs, in the said First Article alleged.

And the said Witrreh Hastings further denies, That he did, in Prosecution of any false, wicked, or malicious Pretences* or wantonly* arbitrarily, or tyrannically degrade,’ insult, or falsely accuse the said Rajah, as in the said First Article is stated I But the said Warren Hastings admits* that he did charge the said Rajah > with certain Acts of Misgovernment and Difaftedion* and with Breach of Faith and DUtv to the East India Company; which Charges were let forth in a Paper Writing signed by him the said Warren Hastings, and delivered to the said Rajah, and which Charges the said Warren Hastings did then believe, and does now believe to be true: And the said Warren Hastings admits that he the said Rajah did manifest such Behaviour, and use such Expressions, as are in the said First Article stated. But the said Warren Hastings having Reason to distrust the Sincerity of the said Rajah, did, as the Commencement of the Proceedings, which he then deemed, and now insists were necessary and fit to be adopted on the said Occasion, order the said Rajah to be put under Arrest; but he denies that the said Arrest was a Measure of such Nature, or attended with such Circumstances, orprodudive of such Effects, as are stated in the said First Article. And he further fays, that a Party of the Company’s Sepoys having been placed as a Guard over the said Rajah, a Body of Troops in his Pay did, in his Presence, attack the said Guard, the greatest Part of which Guard, both Officers and Men, were either killed or wounded: And the said Warren Hastings denies that the said Attack was of such a Nature* or occasioned by such Circumstances, as are in the said First Article mentioned. And he fays, that during the Continuance of the fame, the said Rajah did, in Breach of the said Arrest, withdraw to a Fort in the Neighbourhood belonging to him the said Rajah.

And the said Warren Hastings admits. That the said Rajah did afterwards fend divers Letters to him the said Warren Hastings, of such Nature as in the said First: Article is stated; to which the said Warren Hastings, for good and sufficient Reasons, did not return any Answer. And the said Warren Hastings admits, that he did impute the said Rebellion to such Designs and to such Intentions of the said Rajah, as are suggested in the said First Article; but he denies that the said Rebellion was raised by any Violence, Breach of Faith, or Oppression, on the Part of him the said Warren Hastings.

And he further denies. That he did unnecessarily or criminally hazard the Safety of the Briiiftj Empire in , the East, upon the Event of a Civil War. And the said Warren Hastings say*, that he did, in Discharge of his public Duty, by means of the Company’s Troops, expel the said Rajah from the said Zemindaries, to which he had forfeited his Right: But the said Warren Hastings denies, that, in so doing, he acted wickedly, arbitrarily, or tyrannically. And he further denies, that the subsequent War with the said Rajah was, on the Part of the East India Company, unjull; or that the Consequences which arofs therefrom, are in any Manner imputable to him the said Warren Hastings-, or that he was guilty of any Misconduct, Violence, Tyranny, or Improvidence, in respcfl to the fame. *

x And

And the said Warren Hajlin denies, That he was guilty of any Extortion or Exaftion whatsoever} dr that by all or any the aforesaid Acts, Demands, Arrest, or Expul fion of the said Cheyt or in respect of any other Acts or Omissions, he has in any Manner violated the Trust reposed in him, the Faith of Treaties, or has acted contrary to his own Sense of Duty j or that he has in any Manner disgraced or discredited the Character of the Britislo Nation in } or

that he has, by all or any of the aforesaid Acts, been guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

And the said Warren Ila further fays, That after the Company’s Troops had been so cut off, and the said Cheyt Sing had so broken his Arrest at Benares as aforesaid, and whilst the said Cheyt Sing was at the Head of a numerous Force, and carried on War and Rebellion against the said Company, he, the said Warren Hajlings, did direct an Attack to be made upon the

Fort called Bidjegur, in the said Article mentioned; which Fort was garrisoned and defended by the Troops of the said Cheyt Sing, against the Troops of the said Company. And the said Warren ilajlings admits, that, at the Time of such Attack, Panna, the Mother of the said Rajah, and the surviving Women of the Family of Bulwant Sing, were in the said Fort. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that he did give Orders to leize the said Fort} and further, that he did give Orders to seize upon all the Money and Effects that might be found in the said Fort; but he denies that he did issue any Orders, directing that 'the Fort, and all the Property it contained} Should be secured for the Benefit of the Detachment employed in fe-ducing itj or that he did abandon to the Soldiery the Property of the said Women } or that he did in any Manner stimulate the Army to Rapine or Outrage. But the said Warren Ilajlings further fays, that the said Panna having proposed to him to surrender the said Fort and the Treasure therein contained, on cer- tain Conditions specified by herself, he did, in a Letter to Major Popham, declare that he accepted the said Surrender upon those Conditions, provided the Proposal was fully carried into Efteft within Twenty-four Hours after the Time of her receiving his An-lwer thereto} and did at the same Time intimate, that if (he should refuse to execute the Promise so made by herself, or should delay the Execution of it beyond the Time aforesaid, the said Warren would

then consider it as a wanton Affront and Indignity, which he could never forgive. And the said Warren Ilajlings fays, that being at the Distance of several Miles from the said Fort at the Time of the Surrender thereof, he wasi afterwards informed by Major Popham, who then commanded the Company’s Forces at the Siege of the said Fort, that the said Panna having come out of the Fort with her Family and Dependants at a late Hour of the Night, which prevented such Attention being paid to her as he the said Major Popham wished, her People were, notwithstanding all he could do, plundered on the Road of mofl of the Things which they brought out of the Fort, by the Followers of the Army under the Command of the said Major Popham, by which Means one of the Articles of Surrender was much infringedThat the Distress he Major Popham felt upon that Occasion could not be expressed, and could only be allayed by a firm Performance of the other Articles of the Treaty, which he would make it his Business to enforce.

And the said Warren Ilajlings fays. That upon the Receipt of the Letter last mentioned, he wrote to the said Major Pcpbutn, expressing the Concern of him the said Warren Hajlings,that the Licentloufnefs of any Persons under the Command of the said Major Popham Should have given Cause to complain of the Infringement of the smallest Article of the said Capi-

tulation; and hoping that he would discover the Offenders, and oblige them to make ReftitUtion, and also to punish them in the most exemplary Manner; and declaring, that he relied on the Humanity and Justice of the said Major Popham to make all the Recompence in his Power, by a scrupulous Attention to enforce the Performance of the remaining Stipulations in Favour of the said Panna.And the said Warren Hajlings believes, that an adequate Compenfacion was afterwards, in consequence of such Letter, made to the Persons plundered.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he did ever give any Licence or permission to the Soldiers to plunder, or that he did ever make any such Declaration of Right as in the said First Article is alledged; but he fays, that having received Information that the Property captured in the said Fort had been in Part distributed among the Officers and Troops present at the Capture of the fame, he did, on the Fourteenth November, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, write a Letter to the said Major Popham concerning such Subject, in which, amongst other Things, he wrote as follows: “The Subject on which lam “ now to write is a very disagreeable and painful one “ to me, but indispensable. I have received Information which, though private, is certainly authentic, that you have already distributed one Dividend “ of the Treasure found in Bidjjgur among the Officers and Troops on the Spot. If this be true,* I “ am very sorry for it, as on many Considerations it “ appears to me, that such Distribution is premature. “ I apprehend that it is a Propoficion not to be difputed, that every Thing acquired by the Army of a State, belongs to the Stare which employed those “ Arms. By Charters and Acts of Parliament, the rt foie Right to all Conquests or Captures made by “ the Company’s Arms, is veiled in the Company. a It was, however, my Intention to have used my “ utmost Authority and Influence to have obtained “ for the Troops engaged in the Service against Cheyt “ Sing, the whole Booty which might be found in Bidjygur, or other Places. I regarded it as the due “ Reward of their Services and Recompence of their Sufferings} but I never meant that they should “ seize it, and scramble for it. Besides, if the actual “ Right was in the Army at a Time like this, when “ the Exigencies of the Company are so great, surely “ they might have e'xpefted to have benefited by the “ immediate Use of it as a Loan. I had, I must “ own, such Confidence in your Discretion, that I “ did expect, if the Treasure found in the Fort should prove very considerable, you would not have proceeded to any Distribution of it, until you had re- “ ported the Amount to the Board, and obtained “ their Sanction for appropriating it to the Troops, “ or at least that you would have represented it to me, “ as I am so near you.”

And the said Warren Hajlings did in the same Letter further add, “ I must therefore require of you to fufperid any further Distribution or Dividend, until “ the Orders of the Board respecting it are received; “ and I desire you will order and require the Officer* “ who have already lhared, to refund the Sums which “ they have respectively received, and acquaint them, “ if they do nor, they will be responsible to Government} and that such Sums, as well as what shall remain, are and must be subject to the final Decision of “ the Board.”

. And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he was guilty of any Breach of Faith with the said Troops, or of any Breach of Duty to his Constituents} or that he has pretended to, or pursued, any dishonourable Object; or that he has been guilty of any Act of Injustice; or that in all or any of the Matters aforesaid, he has been guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

And

40 5° Decembris. 1787.

And the said Warrtn Hastings fays, That after the due to the Company on account of the said Tribute.

Expulsion of the Rajah Cheyt Sing from the Dominions And the said Warren I hi flings further fays. That after

of Benares,he did, without any previous Communi- the said Durbedjy Sing had been removed from his Of-

cation with the other Members of the Council, but in fice, and a Successor appointed thereto, the Widow of

virtue of a competent Authority then veiled in him for that Purpose, nominate and appoint Rajah rain, the next Heir to the Zemirtdary of , to

the immediate Government of the fame, and did appoint his Father, Durbedjy Sing, Administrator of his Authority, and did continue William Esquire, in the Office of Resident on the Part of the Company.

And the said Warren Hastings denies, That any Treaty or Agreement ever subsisted between the Britt fh Nation and the People of or that the said

People were ever considered, or did in fast constitute a. State or independant Power; but he fays, that the Grant whereby the said CheytSing held the Possession of the said Zemindary, having been forfeited as aforesaid, it became necessary to form a new Settlement of the said Zemindary; in consequence of which the said Warren Hastings did, by virtue of the Authority aforesaid, frame such Regulations, and make such Agreements as to him appeared necessary and proper. And he fays, that the Tribute was raised to the Amount dated in the said Article j and that the Duties before imposed upon Goods and Merchandizes were by him reduced to certain fixed Tables and Rates j but he denies, that any Measures adopted by him, on that Occasion, were arbitrary or tyrannical, wanton or illegal, or were in any other RefpeCl of the Nature, or attended with the Consequences, dated in the said First Article.

And the said Warren Hastings denies, That he did dispose of, as his own, the Property within the said Provinces; but he admits that he did grant Pensions to certain Persons, who he alledges were justly intitled thereto: And he begs Leave further to represent, that the Whole of his Conduct in the several Measures above specified having been communicated by him the said Warren Hastings to the Council at Calcutta, they did fully approve of, and ratify the fame.

The said Warrtn Hastings fays, That he did, in the Year. One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, continue his Correspondence with William Markham, Esquire, then Resident at Benares, and in consequence of Representations from the said Resident, that the new Relit or Tribute was then in Arrear, and that the Affairs of the Province were likely to fall into Confu-fion, the said Warrtn Hastings being then at too great a Distance to consult the other Members of the Board, and fearing that dangerous Consequences would happen from such Delay as was necessary for the Purpose of communicating with the Council, did authorize and empower him, the said William , to re-

move the said Durbedjy Sing from his Office, and to deprive him of the Official Allowance for the fame; which Measure being afterwards notified to the Council, together with the Reasons for the fame, the said Council did entirely approve thereof.

And the said Warren Hastings fays, That in consequence of the Representations aforesaid, and of other Information to the same Effect, he did direct the said Markham to take proper Measures for preventing the Flight of the said Durbedjy Sing, and the Removal of his F ffeds; whereupon the said Markham did deem it necessary to confine the said Durbedjy Sing in his own House, in which Confinement he was afterwards continued by the Orders of the Board: And the said Warren Hastings denies that the said Confinement was attended with Violence or Cruelty, or that the Nonpayment of the said Tribute was only a Pretence for the said Confinement; for the said Warren Hastings fays, that the said Durbedjy Sing was then considerably in Arrear, in respect of Money by him received, and

Bulwant Sing, and the Rajah Mahipnarain, did write a

Letter, in which, amongst other Things, they did ac-cufe the said Markham of being the Cause of the Delay in the Payment of the Tribute aforesaid, and infill upon the Innocence of the said Durbedjy . And he fays, that having sufficient Reason to believe the aforesaid Representation of the said Markham to be true, and to disbelieve the Charges brought against him in the said Letter, he the said Warren Hastings and the Council did not deem any particular Inquiry necessary relative to the fame; but he denies that he did make any Accusation against the said Widow of the said Rajah for having preferred such Charges, though he admits, that he had, prior to the Receipt of such Charges, declared his Opinion of the Presumption of the said Widow and the said Rajah Mahipnarain on a former and different Occasion.

And the said Warren Hastings further fays. That the said Durbedjy Sing was afterwards, by the Authority of the Board, and, at a Period subsequent to the Refigna-tien of the said Warren Hastings, and his Departure for Europe, continued in Confinement for the same Causes which had originally rendered such Confinement necessary.

And the said Warren Hastings further fays. That the said Markham being authorized by him the said Warren Hastings, under the Circumstances aforesaid, to nominate a Naib to the Rajah in the Room of him the said Durbedjy Sing, did bellow the said Office upon a certain Person named "flagger Deo Seo, who did afterwards distress and harrass the Inhabitants of the said Province; but the said Warren Hastings denies, that the said stagger Deo Seo was by him, the said Warren Hastings, ever obliged to distress or harrass the Inhabitants of the said Province. And the said Warren Hastings admits, that he did some Time in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, being then at Lucknow, recommend to the Board the Measure of removing the said stagger Deo Seo from his said Office on account of certain Irregularities and Oppressions by him committed, and that he was accordingly removed therefrom. But the said Warren Hastings denies that the Irregularities and Oppressions alledged upon that Occasion were merely a.Pretence for the Removal of the said stagger Deo Seo, or that they were in any Degree imputable to him the said Warren Hastings. And the said Warren Hastings denies that he was guilty of any arbitrary, illegal, unjust, or tyrannical Acts whatsoever, or that any Measures by him adopted or enforced, were productive of any such Consequences as are Hated in the said First Article. And he further denies, that in all or any of the Premises, he was or is guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

SECOND ARTICLE.

And the said Warren Hastings, in Answer to the said Second Article, fays, That he believes the Mother and Grandmother of the present Vizier ul Dowla,

Nabob of Oude, are Women of high Rank, Family, and Distinction; but he has been informed, and believes, that Suffdar flung, Father of Sujah ul Dow.'a, and

Grandfather of the present Nabob of Oude, did not first obtain his Rank amongst the Princes of by

means of his Alliance with the Grandmother of the present Nabob, although that Alliance might materially contribute to his Rank and Consequence.

The said Warren Hastings fays, That the said Mother and Grandmother of the said AJoph ul Dowla were in Possession of certain Jaghires, and of certain large public Treasures, which he has been informed and be- lieves

lieves did belong to Sujab late Nabob of

Oude, and were the aggregate Surplus of his National Revenues, and other Funds collected to supply expected Emergencies, and by him deposited in the Hands of his laid Wife, commonly called the Bhow Begum, as a Trull, and for the Purpose of Custody only, neither given to her in his Life-time, nor bequeathed to her by Will.

And the said Warren Hajling fays, That Mr. iow, Resident at Oude, did, by sundry Letters to the Governor General and Council, inform them, that he had, at the Instance of the Nabob AJopb Dowla, then considerably in Debt to the India Company, made an Application to the said Bhow Begum to assist him with a Sum of Money, representing, amongst Other Things, the Distresses of the said Nabob, and his Right to the said Treasures.

And the said Warren Hajl fays. That the said Brijlow did further represent, that the said Begum did, in Answer to the said Application, declare to the Effe<5t in the said Second Article Hated.

And the said Warren Hajl fays. That the said Brijlow did likewise represent, that an Agreement was afterwards concluded between the said Vizier and the said Begum, by the Terms of which, the Nabob acknowledged that he had taken from his Mother Thirty Lacks of Rupees, on Account of present, and Twenty-six Lacks, on Account of former Debts, in Specie, Goods, Jewels* Elephants, Camels, &c. from the Patrimony of his Father: That he had no farther Claim on her, but renounced all further Demands on her, and engaged that he would never molest her in the fenjoyment of the Jaghires conferred on her by his Father, and that he would not in future demand any Lqan from her: That he had no Claim on her, nor would he ever deviate from that Engagement} and to which Agreement, as to the farther Contents thereof, the said Warren Hajlings craves Leave to refer: And the said Brijlow did further represent, that such Agreement was solemnly confirmed by the said Vizier, and was guaranteed by him the said on the Part of

the East India Company: And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that the Guarantee thereof was afterwards, in November, One thousand Seven hundred and Se-

venty-five, confirmed by the Governor General and Council.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That he was apprized of the Nature and Extent of the said Guarantee, and has declared his Sense of the binding Forc$ and Operation of the fame; and that in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-eight, such Letter, respecting the Protection of the said Begum, was written by the Governor General and Council to Mr. Middleton, then Resident at Oude, as in the said Second Article is set forth.

And he further admits, That the elder Begum was in Possession of certain Jaghires and Effects; and that ihe, in or about the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-eight, made such Application to the Governor General and Council, through the then Resident Nathaniel Middleton, Esquire, respecting the fame, as in the said Second Article is set forth: And that the Governor General and Council, the said Warren Hajlings being then Governor General, did thereupon di-. rect the said Mr. Middleton to make such Representa-. tien to the Nabob as is Hated in the said Article: And the said Warren Hajlings does not know or believe, that any other Interferences, Powers, or Authorities, were made, given, granted, or confirmed by the said Governor General and the said Council for the Purpose aforesaid; and he denies that any Guarantee of the British Nation, or any Guarantee of any Kind whatsoever, was by the Resident under the Authority of the said Warren Hajlings ever pledged to the said elder Begum for her Protection j and the said Warren Hajlings fays, that on the Third of July, One thousand Vol. XLIII.

Seven hundred and Eighty-one, it being then deemed necessary that the said Warren Hafttngs Should vilit the Dominions of the Vizier, and the Board of Council ac Calcutta, by the Absence of the Commander in Chief, then confiding of himself and Mr. IVheler only, he did, by a Minute then entered on the Consultations at Bengal, taking Notice of his intended Departure, declare that Mr. IVheler, during his Absence, would tc be by the Confiitution possessed of the full Powers ff of the Governor General and Council of that Go-<f vernment;” and that afterwards an Order was made by the Governor General and Council of Fort William,

“ That all such Orders as the said Warren Hajlings “ Should think it proper to issue to the Troops Ha-.

“ tioned beyond the Provinces, as well in the Dominions of the Nabob Vizier as those which are situ-w ated beyond them, Should be obeyed } and that his “ Angle Authority Should be considered and received “ as of the same Force as that of the Governor General and Council collectively, until that Order Should be revoked.” And it was further ordered, “ That “ the Military Power vefied in the said Warren “ ings as Governor and Commander in Chief of the *( Fortress of Fort William and Town of ,

“ Should be exercised by Edward Wheler, Esquire, -<c during the Absence of the Governor General.” And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he did not then, or at any other Time* confer upon himself a full and complete Delegation of the whole Power and Authority of the Governor General and Council of Fort William, nor was such whole Power or Authority ever in any Manner conferred upon, or delegated to him; but the said Warren Hajlings fays, that certain Powers, which were in the then State of Public Affairs deemed proper and necessary, were vefied in him on that Occanon by certain Credentials given to him under a Resolution of the Board, made on the said Third of July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, and to which he craves Leave to refer. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that the Powers, Authority, or Command, so conferred upon him, were conferred upon him by himself, or by his foie Authority, apart from, or independent of that of the Governor General and Council, or that the Powers, Authority, or Command, so conferred, were in any Manner illegal or unwarrantable, or contrary to his Duty, or to the Nature of the Powers antecedently vefied in him. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that the said John Brijlow, Esquire, who had been nominated and appointed by the Court of Directors to be the Resident at the Court of Oude, was, after such Nomination and Appointment thereto, recalled by the Governor General and Council of Bengal, for Reasons of public Expedience then warranting such Recall.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he did ever arrogate to himself alone the Right of appointing a Resident at the Court of Oude, or that he ever inverted the said Nathaniel Middleton with the said Office by his foie Authority, and without the Concurrence of the rest of the Council j but he fays, that the said Nathaniel Middleton was inverted therewith by the Appointment of the Governor General and Council, with the Powers usually annexed to that Office.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That the Nabob of Oude was dependant upon, or under the Controul of the Governor General of Bengal: And he further denies, that he did by all, or any of the supposed Means stated in the said Article, or by any other, render himself responsible, or that he was in fad respon-fible, for the good Government of the Dominions of the said Nabob.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits. That he was bound by the Ties of Justice and good Faith, by the Duties of his Office, and the Trust reposed in him, to adhere to Treaties entered into, and guaranteed by the East India Company, or the Nation, and to at-

M tend

tend to the Happine/s and Security of the Properties, PoflVfiions, Liberties, and Lives of those who were subject to the British Power in India,

And the said Warren Ha flings fays, That under the above-mentioned Delegation of Authority, which he avers was legally made to him, he did, in the Prosecution of certain Objects mentioned in his Minute, dated the Twenty-first Day of , in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, undertake a Journey to the Upper Provinces, and did meet the aforesaid Nabob of Oude at a certain Place called Chu-nar, and jdid there enter into a Treaty or Agreement with the said Nabob, called the Treaty of Chmar; by which Treaty, after reciting, that great Distress had arisen to the Nabob’s Government from the Military Power and Dominion assumed by the Jaghiredars, it was amongst other Things agreed, “ that the said Nabob Should be permitted to resume such Jaghires as " he Should find necessary, with a Reserve for all such, “ for the Amount of whose Jaghires the Company were Guarantees, who Should, in case of the Re-

fumption of their Lands, be paid the Amount of “ their net Collections through the Resident in Moneybut the said Warren denies, that by

entering into a Treaty containing such Permission as aforesaid, he was guilty of any Violation of his Duty, or of the Faith of any Treaties, of the Sanction of the Company’s Guarantee, or of any Disregard to Justice or good Faith, or that the same was by him entered into in any Mariner wickedly, corruptly, or maliciously. And the said Warren Hastings avers, that at the Time of executing the said Treaty, he had sufficient Reason to believe, and did believe, that the Begums had been guilty of such Acts of Public Mifcon-auCt, as reasonably and justly warranted the making of that Treaty, so far as the same respected the said Begums.

And the said Warren Hastings denies. That he did ever invest the said Middleton with almost an absolute, or with any. Authority over the Dominions of the said Nabob: And he further denies, that the said Nabob was by him, the said Warren Hastings, compelled to become, or ever did become, the Instrument of Outrage or Extortion against his own Parents; or that he did force the said Nabob to yield Acquiescence to the Desires of him the said Warren Hastings, or did force the said Nabob to issue his own Orders for the Purposes in the said Second Article stated. And the said Warren Hastings avers, that the Resumption of the said Estates and Jaghires was, in the then Situation of Affairs, a just, necessary, and expedient Measure, as well on the Part of the Nabob, as of the East India Company j and he admits, that the same was carried into Effect, in a great Degree, by and with the Approbation and Concurrence of him the said Warren Hastings; but he fays, that he neither directly nor indirectly approved or concurred in the Use of any Cruelty for the Purpose of carrying the same into Effect, nor does he believe that any such Cruelty was ever used, nor did he approve nor concur in the Use of any further Violence than was necessary to enable the Nabob to accomplish what the said Warren Hastings then deemed, and Hill deems, to have been a necessary and justifiable Purpose, And the said Warren Hastings denies that, the said Measure was of the Nature, or did prodiice the Effects or Consequences, stated in the said Second Article. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that after the said Measure had been fully carried into Execution, he did, from a Conviction of its Propriety, with the Approbation of the Board, direct the Resident of Oude to use his Influence with the Nabob, to prevent any Restoration of the Jaghires till the Board should be fully apprized of his Intentions on that Subject. And the said Warren Hastings fays, he has been informed, and believes, that the Estates and Jaghires so resumed, were first assigned by the said Nabob to the

Resident in Part-payment of a real and just, and not a pretended or colourable, Debt of the said Nabob to the Company, and that they were finally mortgaged to Shroffs for the Purpose of discharging the said Debt. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that Steps were taken, by the Authority of the said Warren Hastings and the rest of the Board at Calcutta, to procure the Amount of the said Jaghires to be paid to - the said Begums } and he denies that the said Begums were by these Acts reduced to Difficulty, Distress, or Want.

And the said Warren Hastings denies, That by all or any of the Acts of Proceedings, or by the Means of effecting the same above dated* he was or is guilty of any Violation of the Guarantee of the said British Nation* or of any Breach of the Treaty of , or of

any Fraud, Violence, Extortion, or Injustice, or of any Crime of Misdemeanor whatsoever.

And the said Warren Hastings fays* That he did, in the Exercise of the Powers legally delegated to him as aforesaid, and not in Violation of any Engagements, nor upon any Pretence false, frivolous, wicked, or malicious, communicate to Mr. Middleton the Resident at the Court of Oude,through Sir Elijah Impey, in the said

Second Article mentioned, his Approbation of a Resolution which the Nabob had formed to resume the Treasures belonging to the late Vizier in the Possession, not of the said Begums, but of the Bhow Begum only, and to appropriate the same to the Discharge of his the said Nabob AJoph ul Debt to the East

India Company; which Measure was, in the Judgment of the said Warren Hastings, expedient, just, and necessary: And he denies that any Order, by him given in respect to the said Resolution, was forced upon the said Nabob or that his Consent thereto was obtained in the Manner stated in the said Second Article.

And the said Warren Hastings further fays, That the said Begums being inPoffession of a confiaerableForce, and having made Declarations which denoted an Intention to refill the Troops of the said Nabob, unless the same Should be assisted by the Troops of the Company, the said Warren ILflingsdid, in a Letter from him the said Warren Hastings to the said dleton, dated Twenty-sixth December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, give such Orders as appeared to him proper and necessary for assisting the said Vizier in the Recovery of the said Treasure* and he admits that the said Letter did, among other Things, contain Expressions to the Effect stated in the said Second Article, but to which, for the whole of the Orders by him given upon that Occasion, he craves Leave to refer: And he denies that he did thereby, or by any other Order, stimulate or encourage the said Nathaniel Middleton to any Degree of Outrage or improper Severity, but on the contrary he avers that he did, in the said Letter, declare to the said Nathaniel Middleton that itmuft be his Care to prevent an Abuse of the Powers given to those employed in the said Service, and that he himself ought to be Personally present.

And the said Warren Hastings denies that he did order a large Force to be marched into the Territories of the said Vizier without any Request from him for that Purpose, or contrary to his Desire and Inclination; but the said Warren Hastings fays, that the said Nathaniel Middleton did, by a Letter addressed to the said Warren Hastings, and dated the Nineteenth December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, represent as follows: “ The Nabob Vizier having ap-

pointed an Aumil to take Charge of the Begum’s “ Jaghires, (he has, it appears, prepared a large Body (iof Troops with a supposed Design to refill them; a “ violent and threatening Letter which I have just “ received from the Begum, would seem to leave no “ Doubt of her Intentions to support the already de-" clared Licentiousness of her Servants in opposing x “ the

« the Nabob’s Orders. I have, therefore, been obliged “ to join my Solicitations to the Vizier’s for obtain-u ing a Regiment from Colonel Morgan to support “ the Aumil in the Execution of his Excellency’s “ Command; and, I may add, that unless my Judgment far misleads me, we shall be in want of still “ farther Aid before the Measure of resuming the “ Jaghires shall become fully established, and the “ Country restored to that State of Tranquillity and “ Subordination which it enjoyed before the Contagion spread by Cheyt Sing’s Machinations.” Where-

upon the said Warren Hajlings did direct Four Regiments of Sepoys to be marched to support the Authority of the Vizier, and maintain the Tranquillity of his Country by such Means as the said Vizier should think proper to direct: And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that the said Nathaniel Middleton having afterwards represented to the said Warren ,

that the said Nabob might object to so great an additional Force, the said Order was countermanded, and One Regiment only was sent on the said Service.

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays. That he has been informed that the said Mr. Middleton did, in confeqence of the aforesaid Order, proceed with the said Nabob to the City of Fy, where the said Begums and their Troops then were, with a Regiment belonging to the said Company, and a Body of Troops belonging to the said Nabob: the whole of which

w O '

last-mentioned Force acted under the Authority and Orders of the said Nabob in the Prosecution of the said Service: And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that having been afterwards informed by a Letter from Major Naylor, who then commanded the said Regiment belonging to the said Company, that Two Days had passed in Negociation, but without Effect, during which Time the Party in the Town had collected and hourly gained Strength; and that after mature Deliberation, it had been resolved to storm the Town; he the said Warren Hajlings did, on the Ground of such Representation, charge the said Nathaniel Middleton with improper Delay in having suffered such Time to pass in Negociation contrary to the said Orders of him the said Warren Hajlings: And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he has been informed that the said City was, by the said Force under the Orders and Authority of the said Nabob, taken by the said Force} and that the Citadel, in which the said Begums resided, was secured: And the said Warren Hastings, denying that his said Orders did authorize any improper Violence, or any Cruelty or Extortion, and declaring that he does not know or believe that any such were committed by any Persons acting under his Orders, or that the Discovery of the said Treasure was extorted in the Manner, or by the Means, in the said Second Article Hated, further fays, he has been informed that the Two principal Eunuchs belonging to the said Begum were at the Head of the Force within the said Town, and did, on the same being taken as aforesaid, surrender themselves to the said Nabob, and were by him delivered over to the Charge of the Company’s Troops acting as aforesaid, on certain Criminal Charges exhibited against them by the said Nabob, who did not think it safe or prudent to trull them in the Custody of his own Sepoys. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, 'that it was represented to him, that an Agreement having been made between the said Begums and the said Nabob, relative to his Demand on the said Treasure, the said Eunuchs did enter into a Security for the Sum of Money agreed to be paid by the said Begum in Discharge thereof, and that a considerable Part of the said Sum was produced by the said Eunuchs from Places of Concealment, and paid to the said Nabob; and that Securities for the Remainder were given- by the said Eunuchs to the said Nabob. And the said Warren

Hajlings further fays, that the Sum so paid to the Nabob, and the said Securities, were transferred to the Resident by the said Nabob, on Account of his Debt to the Company. And the said Warren Hajlings fays* he has been further informed, that the said Securities not being paid when due, the said Eunuchs were, by Order of the Nabob, put under Restraint for the Recovery of the said Sum, and were at length discharged, without having fully performed the said Engagement. And the said Warren Hajlings denies that the said Eunuchs were compelled by the said , or

his Assistant Resident JohnJon, to enter into the said Securities in prosecution of any Orders of him the said Warren' Hajlings, for the Purposes in the said Article mentioned, or in order to satisfy any unjust, oppressive, or rapacious Demands of him the said Warren Hajlings; and he does not know or believe that the said Securities were in fast obtained by Compulsion by the said Middleton or the said JohnJon, or that the said Middleton or the said JohnJon did extort Payment of the fame, or of any Part thereof, in the Manner and under the Circumstances in the said Article mentioned, or that they did in any Manner extort such Payment.

And the said Warren Hajlings has been informed that a Sale, or pretended Sale, was made of some of the Effects of the said Begums, towards the Payment of the said Sum agreed to be paid to the Nabob. And the said Warren Hajlings denies that all or any of the said Transactions, io far as the said Warren Hajlings, by any Act of his own, or by any Orders given by him, was- concerned in the fame, were conducted with any Circumstances of Atrocity, or were the Means of producing any of the Effects on the said Begums in the said Second Article set forth, or were in any Manner disgraceful to the British Name and Character.

And as to so much of the said Second Article, as relates to the Women and Children of the late Nabob Sujah ul Dowla, the said Warren Hajlings denies that they were in any Manner dependant upon both, or either of the said Begums; but he fays, that the said Women, who were mostly Persons of low Condition, and the said Children, if any such there were, lived in the Khourd Mhal, on an Establishment entirely distinct from the said Begums, and were dependant for their Support solely on the said Nabob Vizier, by whom a Tuncaw, or Alignment, was granted on the Foufdarry of Sultanpore for their Support: And he fays, the Receipt and Application of the Produce of the said Tuncaw were entirely entrusted to Officers appointed by the said Vizier, without any Interference whatsoever on the Part of the English Government: And the said Warren Hajlings has heard, that, from Neglect in the Officers of the said Vizier, the Persons residing in the said Khourd Mhal have suffered occa* fional Distress j but the said Warren Hajlings denies that such Distress did in any respect proceed from any such.Causes as are in the said Second Article set forth s or that such Persons were, by such Means as are in the said Article stated, or by any Means, made, used, authorized, or permitted, by the said Warren HaJ-tings, reduced to the Want of the Necefiaries of Life, or exposed to any of the Circumstances of Shame, or Cruelty, which are enumerated in the said Second Article j or that, to his Knowledge or Belief, any such Circumstances did at any Time in fast take place: And the said Warren Hajlings further denies, that he is in any Manner responsible for any Circumstances of Cruelty or Barbarity, if any such did exilt j or that any such were the Consequenqes of any Powers affirmed, or Orders given, by the said Warren Hajlings} or that he did assume any illegal Powers, or give any atrocious or unjust Orders whatsoever.

And as to so much- of the said Second Article as states, c< That many of the said Severities and Cruel-

“ ties,”

44 56 Decembrls. A. 1787*

“ ties,” in the said Article stated, “ being made *« known to the said Warren by the Refi-

“ dent or others j and that he (the said Warren HaJtings) although informed of the fame, did take no n Steps for the Redress of the said Cruelties, but, on

the contrary, did declare the same to be justly me- rited, and did stimulate and encourage his Agents and others to continue and enforce the same the said Warren Hajiings fays, that the only Declaration made by him, relative to any of such Subjects, is contained in the Instructions given by the said Warren Hajiings, conformably to a Reference from the Board of Council, and with their Knowledge and Approbation, on the Twenty-third of in the Year One

thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two j and which is as follows:

“ The Severities which have been exercised to-u wards the Begums were most justly merited, by “ the Advantage which they took of the Troubles “ in which I was Personally involved the last Year,

“ to excite a Rebellion in the Nabob’s Government,

“ and to complete the Ruin which they thought was “ impending on ours,”

And the said Warren Hajiings denies that the said Declaration did or could relate to any Severities ex-excised towards, or Distreftes suffered by, the Persons residing in the said Khourd Mhal, or that he did ever stimulate or encourage his Agents, or any Persons whatsoever, to continue or enforce such Severities or Distreftes. And the said Warren Hajiings fays, that he had not, at the Time of making the said Declaration, nor for above Nine Months after the said Declaration was made, received any Information, or Accounts of any Kind, nor had any such been sent, nor had he any Knowledge whatsoever, relative to any Distreftes, or Sufferings, of any of the said Persons belonging to the said Khourd Mhal; the First Intelligence received by the said Warren Hajiings relative thereto, being in the Month of Auguj One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, when various Complaints having been preferred to the Board against the said Brijlow, by the Vizier and Hyder Beg Kban, the said Brijlow did, in order to criminate the said Vizier and Hyder Beg Kban, inclose in a Letter, bearing Date the Thirtieth July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, addressed to the Board, certain Letters and Papers relative to the Distreftes of the said Persons in the Khourd Mhal, which Distreftes were represented to have happened in the Months of March and ORober, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-

two, and to have been afterwards relieved at the Instance of the said Brijlow, by the said Vizier: And the said Warren Hajiings denies that all or any of the supposed Aftings, Doings, and Proceedings, by him the said Warren Hajiings, or by his supposed Authority, Council, Connivance, or Neglect, done, perpetrated, or omitted, were of the Nature, or productive of the Effects, or accomplished by the Means, in the said Article mentioned, or that he is in all or any of the several Respects above mentioned guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor.

And the said Warren Hajiings denies that he ever endeavoured to set up any false, frivolous, wicked, or malicious Pretences, in Jollification of any Acts of him the said Warren Hajiings, or that he ever attempted to impose any such upon the Directors of the East India Company, or the British Nation, or that he ever brought any malicious or unfounded Accusations against the said Begums, or that he has ever endeavoured to support such Accusations as were brought against them, by any Means disgraceful to the British Government, or by any Prostitution of the Character of British Justice in India. And the said Warren tings denies that he did ftjfle, or in any Manner unduly prevent, an Enquiry into the Crimes charged against the said Begums, or that he was bound to

make such Enquiry in Consequence bf any Declarations or Directions of the Court of Directors, or thac the said Court did make such Declarations, or fend such Directions relative thereto, as are in the said Second Article mentioned. And the said Warren Hajiings admits* that inasmuch as he did not apprehend that an Enquiry* for the Purpose above stated, was either commanded by the said Directors, or in any Manner necessary or expedient to be made, he did vote against a Proposition made by Mr. Stables for that Purpose but he denies that he did thereby endeavour to pass art Act of Indemnity for his own Crimes* he, the said Warren Hajiings, not being con-feious of any Crimes requiring such Indemnity nor did' ihfult the Sufferings of any Allies of the Company, nor Ihew a Contempt of thfe Authority or Opinion of the Court of Directors. And the said Warren Hajiings, as to the Matter of Aggravation in the Second Article, Iaftly suggested* denies that all or any of his Acts did originate in any Corruption whatsoever, or did originate in, or were in any Manner influenced by, the supposed Present or Bribe, in the said Second Article mentioned, or that he the said V/arreti Hajiings did, at or about the Time of executing the said Treaty at Chunar, or at any other Time, accept or take to his own Use a Present or Bribe of One hundred thousand Pounds, or of any other Sum, from the said Nabob of Oude, or that he did in any Manner act contrary to his Duty, the Orders of his Masters, or the pofuive Directions of Law, or to the Discredit, Disgrace, or Dishonour of the British Name, or Character, .

THIRD ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Third Article, the said Warren Hajiings fays he has been informed that an ancient Friendship did fubflft between the Nabob Sujah Dowla, Vizier of the Empire, and the House of zuffer Jung, in the said Third Article mentioned; buC whether any and what Treaties in particular were entered into between the said Sujah ul Dowla and Acbmet Khan, the said Warren Hajiings does not know nor can set forth j he believes, however, that the said Acbmet Khan was a Chief of the Nation of Afghans or Batons, of such Family, and whose Ancestors- filled such Station in the Annals of Indojlan, as is stated in the said Third Article: But the said Warren Hajiings fays, that he does not know or believe that the Ancestors of the said Acbmet Khan have been, from an early Period, or ever were. Friends or Allies of the British Power in India,

And the said Warren Hajiings fays, that he does not know nor is informed whether, “ during the Life “ of the said Acbmet Khan, the said Sujah ul Dowla u did unjustly withhold and retain Possession of certain Territories which did of Right belong to the <c said Acbmet Kban," nor whether he and his Son and Successor AJoph ul Dowla, or either of them, did, under Pretext of Friend ship, Protection, and Guardian-ftiip of Muzuffer Jung, Son and Successor to the said Acbmet Kban, make new and repeated Invasions of the Rights and Posseftlons of the said Muzuffer Jung, during his Minority, nor whether they did fraudulently obtain from the said Muzuffer Jung an Instrument, or pretended Instrument or Treaty, derogatory to former Treaties, and the Rights of Muzuffer Jung , but he has heard and believes that a Treaty was entered into between the said AJoph ul Dowla and the said Muzuffer Jung, some Time in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-five and that the said ul Dowla did appoint and place an Officer called a Sizwall in the Territories of the said Muzuffer Jung. And the said Warren Hajiings fays, he has been informed that the Sizwall so appointed was severe in the Exercise of

K

his Authority, in the Collection of the Tribute ftipu-lated to be paid by the said Treaty; and the said Warren Hastings admits, that he has expressed Doubts of the original Justice of that Tribute; but the said Warren Hastings does not know, nor can state whether the severe Exercise of the Authority of such Sizwall might or might not have been a Cause of Ruin to the Country; but he admits it to have occasioned many Complaints from the said; and

he also admits that the Amount of that Tribute has for some Time continued a Part of the Funds assigned by the said Vizier, as a Provision for the several Public Demands of the East India Company, on him the said Vizier; and that he the said Warren Hastings did, on the Twenty-second of Alay One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty, in order to relieve the said Muzuffer Jung from the Indignity and Hardships of which he complained, propose, and the Board of Council of Bengal did, upon the Motion of him the said Warren Hastings, resolve, " That One of the Company’s Ci- vil Servants Should be forthwith appointed Collec- for of the Vizier’s Alignments to the Company,

on the Revenues of the Nabob of , with

“ the same Allowances and the same Powers as had “ been given to the Native Sizawall; and that he «c should be ordered to proceed with all possible Ex-c pedition to Lucknow, where he would be inverted by the Resident with the Charge of that Office, and “ receive from him the necessary Instructions for his “ Conduct in the Discharge of the fame.” And the said Warren Hastings admits that he did propose, and that the Board did adopt, the said Measure, upon such Reasons, and for such Purposes, amongst others, as are in the said Third Article stated; and that Mr. Shee was, in consequence thereof, appointed to the^ Office aforesaid: But the said Warren Hastings denies that the said Muzuffer Jung was, by the aforesaid, or any Acts, or by any Powers or Authorities given or authorized by him the said Warren , com-

pletely taken under the Protection of the East India Company, or that the said Company, and their Servants and Representatives, or that he the said Warren Hastings, as Governor General, ever became respon-fible for the Government of the Territories of the said Muzuffer Jung, or were subject to such Obligations as are in the said Third Article stated.

And the said Warren Hastings fays, That he did, , soon after the Execution of the Treaty of Chunar, declare, “ that if Muzuffer Jung must endure Oppref- lion, and he the said Warren Hastings dared not, at that Time, propose his total Relief, it concerned “ the Reputation of the East India Company’s Government to remove their Participation in it.” And that he did, at the same Time, alledge, “that Mr.. Shoe’s Authority over the Territory of Farruckabad was in itself as much subversive of that of its lawful «c Ruler as that of the Vizier’s Aumil, or Sezawall, “ ever was; and was the more oppressive as the Power “ from which it was derived was greater.” And which several Propositions, made in the Terms last stated, the said Warren Hastings maintains to be true. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that he did afiert, as the Faff was, and not falsely pretend, that Muzuffer Jung was equally anxious with the Vizier for the Recall of the said Shee; and that he did assert, as the Fadt was, and not falsely pretend, that it was the Desire of him the said Warren Hastings, that a proper Guardian should be selected for the said Muzuffer Jung from amongst the ancient Dependants of his Family, if any such could have been found. And the said Warren Hastings denies, that the Treaty of Chunar, hereinafter mentioned, was entered into by him upon any false Pretences whatsoever, or in the Exercise of any illegal Authority, or under the Influence of any such supposed Bribe as in the said Third Article is stated.

Vox., XLIII.

And the said Warren Hasting, as to the said supposed Bribe in the said Third Article mentioned, craves Leave to refer to his Answer in this Behalf hereinafter made. And the said Warren Hastings admits that he did enter into aTreaty at Chunar with the said Nabob of Oude, in which Treaty was contained a Stipulation that no British Resident should be appointed at Farruckabad, and that the then Resident there should be recalled; but he humbly infills that such Stipulation was, in the then Situation of the contrasting Parties, and of Muzuffer Jung himself, proper and expedient to be made. And the said Warren Hastings denies that he did by that Treaty abandon the Country of Farruckabad, or deliver over the Prince thereof to the "Rapacity of the Vizier and his Servants. And the said Warren Hastings, denying that he ever pretended that the’said Shee had been Personally guilty of any Opprdfion, or that he ever accused the said Shee thereof, admits that he has never attempted to bring the said Shee to Trial for any Offence of that Nature; and that the said Shee soon after his Recall having applied to the Governor General and Council, taking Notice of an Order made by the Board for allowing Company’s Servants removed from their Offices in consequence of some late Arrangements, to draw the same Allowances as they had before drawn, until they should be appointed to other Offices, or until the Board should be pleased to withdraw that Indulgence; and having at the same Time represented to the Board that he had not, since the general Arrangements in the Vizier’s Country had rendered his Removal from Office necessary, received any such Allowances from the Company, the said Shee prayed that the same Salary which Revenue Collectors usually received might be granted him; and that it was thereupon agreed by the Board that Mr. Shee should be allowed the same Salary as had been granted to the Revenue Collectors, and that he should draw it from the Time of his Removal from his late Office. And the said Warren Hastings denies that any Pension was othewife, or in any other Manner, conferred upon the said Shee, than is herein before stated. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that at a Board of Council held on the Ninth of December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty three, the said Shee was upon the Recommendation of Mr. Wheier, a Member of the said Board, appointed Judge of the Dewany Adawbit at Dacca, in the Room of Mr. Duncanjon, deceased, But the said Warren Hastings denies that the said Office was conferred by him alone, or upon his own Motion, or in any other Iv/anner than is above stated.

And the said Warren Hastings avers. That the alledged Grounds of the said Treaty were founded in Truth, and that there is no sufficient Reason todifbe-lieve the fame, or to conclude, as by the said Article is alledged, that the supposed Bribe above mentioned was the real Ground of the said Treaty. And the said Warren Hastings solemnly denies the same so to have been. And the said 'Warren Hastings denies that it was

meant by the said Treaty that the said Vizier should have an uncontrouled Authority over Farruckabad, or that any other Provision or Stipulation was therein contained relative to Farruckabad than that herein before mentioned. But he admits that the said Vizier did shortly afterwards appoint a Person named Ali Cazun to manage the Affairs of Farruckabad; and that the said Warren Hastings did thereupon represent to the said Vizier the Impropriety of such his Appointment, and request of him to dire£F his Ministers to refrain from all Kind of Interference in the internal Management of Farruckabad. He denies however that he did compel the said Vizier to recall that Appointment, or that he did in that Respect, or in any other Manner whatsoever, violate the Treaty of Chunar.

N And

46 5° Decembris. 1787.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits. That he did, about the Month of November, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, suggest to the said Muzuffer Jung, that as he would be then left in the uncontrouled Management of his own Affairs, it would be incumbent on him to give the strictest Attention to them, both for his own Honour and Interest, and the Welfare of his People; to effect which Purposes the said Warren Hajlings did recommend to the said Muzuffer Jung to employ able Men of approved good Character; and did further suggest, that Subgbat Ally his Vakeel, had been with the said Warren Hajlings for Years, and appeared to have conduced himself with Fidelity and Attachment, and, as the said Warren Hajlings understood, was much employed and trusted by the Father of the said Muzuffer Jung-, that his Services intitled him to Reward and Consideration from him the said Muzuffer Jung and that his Zeal and Abilities, if placed in a proper Situation, might produce important Advantages to himself and his Country.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That the Suggestion thus made in favour of Subgbut , involved any Contradiction to the Reasons before given by him for the Appointment of Mr. Shee, the said Subgbut Vila not being one of the said Muzuffer Jung’s Servants, to whom the said Warren Hajlings had before imputed either Knavery or Corruption.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he did, about the Time last mentioned, or at any ocher Time whatsoever, render himself, nor did he ever become, responsible to the said Vizier for the Payment of the Tribute payable to the said Vizier by Muzuffer; but he admits, that the said Tribute was not paid by the said Subgbut Vila to the said Vizier: He denies, however, that he, the said Warren , was, in

respect thereof, guilty of any Breach of Faith to the said Vizier.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That in consequence of the Non-payment of the said Tribute, and other Misconduct of the said Subgbut and of a Declaration which the said Warren Hajlings understood the said Subgbut Ulla to have made, and which he believed to be false and scandalous, the said Warren Hajlings did, on the Twenty-seventh of April, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, write the following Letter to the said Muzuffer Jung: “ I lately “ learnt that Subgbut Ulla Khan has told you, that he “ was obliged to give large Sums in Bribes to the “ English Gentlemen, for procuring the Release of “ your Country, and that he demands Assignments of “ a Sum as far as Six Lacks of Rupees. This is entirely fallc — Out of Regard to the Justice and Wifdom of the Vizier, I with Labour and Difficulty procured the Relinquishment of it from his Highnefs, and the Removal of his Aumil, on this Con- dition, that you Should pay duly the Relit payable “ to the Nabob’s Government, according to the " Kills; and I delivered the Country into your “ Hands. — From this Transaction I had expected Reputation to myself j but, on the contrary, I am “ now disgraced. Such Conduct in Subgbut Ulla Kban “ deserves severe Punishment, and makes him unfit “ to be any longer trusted j and you will therefore “ make him restore what Money he may have taken, “ and never suffer him to be again employed in the “ Affairs of your Government, — I write this from my tC Friendship.”

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That having afterwards received from the said Muzuffer Jung a Letter in favour of the said Subgbut Ulla; and solemnly declaring, that the said Subgbut Ulla had not made any such Declaration as had been reported, and that it was certain the said Subgbut Ulla had not given One Rupee to any Gentleman j the said Warren Hajlings did not further interfere to procure the said Subgbut

Difmission, or the Substitution of any other Person in ' his Place.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That the Board at Calcutta did, by a Letter dated the Eleventh of July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, addressed to Mr. Middleton their Resident at Oude, observe, that the said Resident had not received any Part of the Sum expected from Farruckabad, and were fur-prized that he had not intimated in his Letter to the Board, or to the Governor General, the Circumstances which had prevented him from receiving any Part of the Sum expected from the Nabob Muzuffer Jung} and that should it proceed from an Advantage taken by him of their Mediation with the Nabob Vizier, the Board directed that he should immediately afford him effectual Assistance for the Recovery of what might be due to him from Muzuffer Jung, and expressly to withdraw all other Interference with that Nabob.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That the said Middleton, in Answer to the said Letter, did represent that the Board had anticipated his Reply, by adverting to what they conjectured might have been the Cause of the total Failure in the Collection of ,

which was, as they justly supposed, an improper Advantage taken by Muzuffer Jung, of the Mediation employed with the Nabob Vizier in his Behalf: That he the said Aliddleton had therefore immediately, upon

Receipt of the Orders of the Board, withdrawn all Mediation and Interference which stood between the Nabob Vizier, and the Collection of the Tribute from Farruckabad, and had afforded him the

Assistance directed, by fending a Regiment to support the Seziwall appointed by his Excellency for the Collection of the Tribute of theenfuing Year.

And the said Warren Ilaftings fays, That the Company’s Mediation and Interference in favour of the said Muzuffer Jung were withdrawn, and the Assistance stated in the said Third Article given to the said Vizier, for the Recovery of his Claims upon Farruckabad, for the Reasons stated in the said Orders; and in virtue of those Orders only; but the said Warren Haf-tings denies, that his Conduct in respect to the Measure stated in the said Third Article, was in Contradiction to any Principle of Justice or Equity towards the said Muzuffer Jung.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, He has been informed that the saidNativ eSizwall did renew Severities formerly exercised in respect tc the said Muzuffer Jung.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That he did some Time in Oblober, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, receive a Letter of Complaint from the said Muzuffer Jung, requesting a Renewal of the Mediation of the Bengal Government, for the Purpose of procuring a Recall of the Vizier’s Sizwall -, which Letter was immediately, according to the usual Practice of the Settlement, entered in the Book of Persian Correspondence for the Inspection of the Board; and that afterwards similar Complaints were at different Times received by the Board at Calcutta, through Mr. Brijlow; and that a Letter to the same Efteft was receiv* ed from the said Muzuffer Jung, in the Month of February, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he was guilty of any Delay, or Breach of Duty, in respect to the said Complaints; but fays, that the Board did not deem it expedient to interfere with the Vizier for the Recall of the Sizewall at Farruckabad, until the Month of Oblober, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three i and he denies that the Conduct of him the said Warren Hajlings, in the Matters aforesaid, was in any Degree incompatible with the Honour or Dignity of the British Government.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That in the Month of October, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, he did, from a Sense of Submission to the implied Orders of the Court of Directors, as well as from 4 an

an Opinion of the Propriety of the Measure, propose to the Council at Bengal, and the said Council did accordingly resolve, to appoint a Resident at abad, if the Consent of the Nabob Vizier could be previously obtained, and that Mr. should be

such Resident; which Consent being obtained, the said Mr. IVilles did afterwards proceed to the said City in the Execution of his Duty.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That the said Mr. Willes was impeded in the Execution of his Duty

by any Neglect or Orders of him the said Warren Hajlings,

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That either by entering into the Treaty of or that by any

Consent, or Authority to be implied therefrom; or that in all or any of the supposed Instances of Misconduct Rated in the said Third Article in respect to the said Vizier and Muzujfer Jung respectively; or that by the

said several supposed Acts or Deeds done or omitted, or supposed to be done or omitted, by him the said Warren Hajlings, he the said Warren Hajlings has been guilty either of Neglect of Duty, Usurpation of Authority, Breach of Treaty, or Duplicity towards either the said Vizier or the said Jung; or

that he has, in any of these Respects, brought any Dilgrace upon the British Name, or any Discredit upon the British Government in; or that he ever reduced himself ;o the Alternative of being guilty of a Breach of Faith, either to the Vizier or Muzujfer Jung, as is suggested in the said Third Article j or that by all or any of the several Acts Hated in the said Third Article, so far as the same or any of them were by him done or committed, he was or is guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

ARTICLE THE FOURTH.

In Answer to the Fourth Article, the said Warren Hajlings admits it to have been his Duty, while Governor General of Bengal, strictly to attend to the Expenditure of Public Money; and more particularly In a Time of War and Public Distress, to be careful that those Revenues upon which the Welfarer and Safety of the Empire did necelfarily depend, should not be diminished or ruined by Dissipation or Prodigality, and should not be diverted from the Public Service, or squandered for the Purpose of increasing his own Personal Influence, or providing for his Dependants.

And also, that it was his Duty, in every Instance in his Power, to pay due Obedience to the Orders of the Court of Directors: But the said Warren Hajlings humbly contends, such last-mentioned Duty did not require Compliance with the said Orders in Cafes where such Compliance would have been materially injurious to the Interests of the East Company or the British Nation, or where some important Advantage to such Interests might be attained by a Deviation. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that the Court of Directors of the East India Company, by the Thirty-sixth Paragraph of the General lnftrudlions given to the Governor General and Council, in March, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, reciting, that as all the Company’s Business which could conveniently be performed by Contract, was so performed in Bengal, did direct as in the said Fourth Article is stated.

And the said Warren Hastings admits. That such express Order of the said Court was made in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy, as in the said Fourth Article is stated j and that divers other Orders and Commands to the same Purpose and Effect may have been issued by the said Court of Directors, at different Times, to their Servants in India.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits. That the Opium produced in Bengal and Bahar is a very con-

siderable and lucrative Article in the Export Trade of the said Provinces, and that it has been for a considerable Length of Time managed under a Monopoly. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that of late Years (that is to say) ever since the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-three, when, in consequence of a Proposal from the said tings, the said Monopoly was taken from private Persons, by whom it had been before exclusively held without any Participation of the East India Company, into the Possession of the said Company, great Advantage has resulted from the same to the said Company.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That of late Years the Opium has been provided byContraflj but he fays, that it would not have been expedient or conducive to the Interest of the East India Company, previous to the Contracts for this Commodity being made, or in the making thereof, to have observed and followed all the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Directors of the East India Company, in regard to Contrails in general.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That Doubts having arisen in Council at Bengal, whether the Management of the Opium Concern ought, as an Article of Revenue, to be lodged with the Governor and Council, or as an Article of Commerce, to be veiled in the Board of Trade; and the same having been communicated to the Court of Directors, they were pleased to direst as follows: “ As the Revenue Coun-<c cil at Patna are of Opinion that the Opium Bufinefs may be more conveniently conducted by their *f Board than by our Commercial Servants, on that " Consideration only we direct that the Provision thereof be continued under your Management; buc tc that you consign the fame, when provided, to our ,r Board of Trade at Prime Cost, who are to dispose “ thereof at Public Auilion, and to apply the Produce towards the Provision of our Investment.”

And the said Warren Hajlings admits it to have been his Duty, not only to be careful in the Expenditure of the Public Money in the making of Contracts, and in providing for the Public Service, but also to be particularly careful not to lavilh the Money of his Employers in excessive Salaries and Emoluments to favoured Individuals.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That the Court of Direflors did order and direct that the Sum of Six thousand Pounds per Annum should be paid to the Commander in Chief in full for his Services as Commander in Chief, in lieu of Travelling Charges, and of all other Emoluments whatsoever. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that it was his Duty not to create by his Prodigality any Public Distress, and denies, that he was guilty of any Prodigality, or of any violent or oppressive Acts whatsoever. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that it was his Duty not to rob any Person whomsoever.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he did enter into any Contraft of the Nature, or with the Views, or in the Manner, or which was productive of the Consequences, in the said Fourth Article mentioned.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That he did authorize or approve of any enormous Salaries or extravagant Allowances, or did lavish away any Part of the Resources of the Company, or of the Princes in Alliance with them, as in the said Fourth Article is stated.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That it having been determined in Council, that Opium should be provided by Contract, the Governor General and Council, the said Warren Hajlings being Governor General, did, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-seven, when the former Contract was near its Expiration, unanimously agree to accept

(offered to elapse; in consequence whereof, the said ContraCt would, by virtue of the Clause hereinbefore mentioned, have continued for the Term of Six Years, that is to say, till the First of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-five, which the said Warren Hastings admits would have been for a longer

Time than the then Situation of the East India Company's Affairs in India required: But the said Warren Hastings fays, that to prevent such Continuance, the said Warren Hastings did, on the Second February, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, when, by the Restoration of Peace, a Reduction of the Military Establishment in Bengal had become practicable and safe, propose in Council, and a Majority of the Council did accordingly resolve, to purchase an immediate Relinquishment of the Contract, and the same was accordingly purchased, after it had been held only Three Years and an Half, upon such Terms as to the Board appeared reafo'nable; and which the said Warren Hastings denies to have been extravagant or unreasonable, or that the East India Company did, by such Purchase, sustain great Loss and Damage.

And the said Warren Hastings fays. That after such Purchase, the Governor General and Council, the said Warren Hastings being Governor General, did resolve, that the Provision of Bullocks for the Army Should be conducted by Agency, believing that the same might be managed in such Mode with more Advantage to the East India Company than by Contract; and did also resolve, that Sir Charles William Blount Should be employed in such Agency: But the said Warren Hastings denies that he did, by concurring in such Resolution, act contrary to his Duty, or to the Orders of his Mailers, though he admits that such Mode of conducting the Business was afterwards disapproved by the Court of Directors, as liable to the Objections in the said Fourth Article dated.

And the said Warren Hastings denies. That by all or any of the several Acts supposed to have been done or omitted by him the said Warren Hastings, he was guilty of any Part of the supposed Offences or Mif-conduCt in the said Fourth Article charged against him.

And the said Warren Hastings further fays, That the late General Sir Eyre Coote having, in the Month of March, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, arrived in Bengal, from Europe, to take upon himself the Command of all the Forces in

India, then employed in a perilous and extensive War, did in a few Days after his Arrival deliver in to the Council of Fort William in Bengal several Propositions, by which he infilled that certain Allowances then paid to General Stibbert, Provincial Commander in Chief on the Bengal Establishment, did devolve upon him the said Sir Eyre Coote, as Commander in Chief. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that the said Allowances so claimed had been granted to the said General Stibbert, partly under a Resolution of the Governor General and Council, he the said Warren Hastings being then Governor General, and having, as he admits, concurred therein, and partly by the express Orders df the Court of DireClors.

And the said Warren Hastings further fays, That the said Propositions were referred by the Council to the Board of Inspection, and a Minute was thereupon delivered in by the said Sir Eyre Coote, setting forth the Grounds upon which he had been on his first Arrival induced to rest his aforesaid Claim, and that he had since more fully examined into the same } and further-alledging, from his long Experience of the Ser-

vice, the Inefficiency of his Salary, and that he “ was certain the Court of Directors never meant he “ Should suffer in his private Fortune by carrying on “ the Public Service, and requesting that such Measures might be adopted as might prevent any unnecessary Expence from falling upon the Company,

A. 1787.

“ and which would at the same Time enable him to “ execute the Duties incumbent on him as their " Commander in Chief, to visit the several Stations “ of the Troops, or to take the Field, if necessary,

“ without involving himself in Expences which he “ Should be unable to support.” And the said Board of Inspection having taken the same into Consideration, it was by the said Board determined, he the said Warren Hastings being a Member of such Board of Inspection, and concurring in that Determination, that the Allowances made to General Stibbert did not devolve on the said Sir Eyre Coote, nor ought to be taken away from the said General Stibbert without the further Orders of the Court of Directors: But in Consideration of the Matters in the Minute of the said General Sir Eyre Coote set forth, and for other Rea-fons, which in the Judgment of the said Board appeared to warrant such Measure, did resolve that the said Sir Eyre Coote Should, as Commander in Chief of the Forces in India, receive when in the Field a specified Allowance for himself and his Staff, for the Purpose of defraying the extraordinary Expences which his Establithment in the Field would occasion. And the said Warren Hastings denies, that by concurring in the said Resolutions of the said Board he acted in the Prosecution of a corrupt or prodigal System of Government, or in Contradiction to his Duty and the Orders of his Superiors, or with any View to increase his own Influence.

And the said Warren Hastings fays, That in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, the said General Sir Eyre Coote having deemed it necessary to visit the different Stations of the Army, in order to form such Military Arrangements as the Service required, and it being expected that his Presence would be mostly confined to the Grand Posts of the Army, stationed and employed in the Defence of the Dominions of the Nabob Vizier; and the said Nabob Vizier being bound to discharge the aCtual Expences of all the Troops employed for the Protection of the Countries lying beyond the River Carumnajfa, it was for these and other Reasons resolved in Council, on the Proposal of the said Warren Hastings, that the Field Allowances and Travelling Charges of the said Sir Eyre Coote as Commander in Chief, when in the Field, Should be added to the Debit of the said Vizier’s Account, as a Part of his general Subsidy; the said Charge to commence from the Day of the said Commander in Chiefs passing the said River Carumnajfa, and to continue till his Return to the same Line j and that the said Nabob Vizier Should be written to on the Subject. And the said Warren HaJ-tings denies that, by proposing or concurring in such Resolution, he acted in the Prosecution of a System of Profusion or Prodigality, or in any Violation of the Treaty between the East India Company and the Nabob Vizier.

And the said Warren Hastings admits. That some Time in the Month of Oftobe One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty, the Court of DireClors, reserving foY a future Opportunity their full Sentiments and Instructions on the Subject, did express a Disappro-bation of the said Allowances, and direct that they Should be discontinued on the Receipt of such their Order. And the said Warren Hastings avers, that the said Allowances were, immediately on the Receipt of the said Order, in Obedience thereto, discontinued. And he denies, that he did of his own private Authority continue to the said Sir Eyre Coote such Allowances as are in the said Fourth Article dated, or that the same were, by the Command or Authority of the said Warren-Hastings, continued to be paid by the Vizier for ihc Ulo and Behoof of the said Sir Eyre Coote.

And the said Warren Hastings further denies. That in all or any of the Acts, Orders, Allowances, or

Contracts,

Contracts, done, made, granted, or ordered by the said Warren Hafiings, he the said Warren has

been guilty of any MisconduCt, Offence, Crime, or Misdemeanor whatsoever,

And the said Warren Hafiings admits, That, in the Month of December, One thoul'and Seven hundred and Eighty, the Governor General and Council, the said Warren Hafiings being then Governor General, did appoint James Peter Auriol, Esquire, to be Agent for providing Supplies for the Relief of the Presidcncy of Madras, at which Settlement there was a great Scarcity of Provisions: But the said Warren Hafiings denies that this Measure was in pursuance of any prodigal or corrupt System of Government, or that the same was a Measure either prodigal or corrupt.

And the said Warren Hafiings, denying that he did unite in his own Person all the Powers of Government, admits that the said Auriol did require the usual Commission, and that the said Warren Hafiings and the Council did determine that he Should be allowed for the said Agency a Commission of Fifteen per Cent. upon his Disbursements, the said Warren Hafiings and the Council conceiving the same to have been, under all the Circumstances, a proper Allowance.

And the/said Warren Hafiings admits that the said James Peter Auriol was at the same Time, and by the same Authority, appointed Agent of Supplies to the other Presidencies, and to the Island of Saint Helena, with the same Commission. And the said Warren Hafiings fays, that though the Proposal of the said Auriol did not extend to the said other Presidencies, and to the said Island, yet the said Warren Hafiings did believe that there existed a Necessity of providing Supplies for the same from Bengal, and that the best Mode of providing them was by the Way of Agency.

And the said Warren Hafiings admits that the said Auriol was, at the Time of such Appointment, and had been for fomc Time before, one of the Secretaries of the Supreme Council, which Office, at the Time when the said Auriol succeeded to the fame, had by the public Authority of the Board, suffered a Reduction in the regular Salary annexed to it j but the said Warren Hafiings, though he does not remember to have made any such Declaration as is in the said Fourth Article Hated, and positively averring, that neither in the Creation of the said Agency, nor in fixing the Terms thereof, he was in any Manner actuated by any Motives of private Favour to the said James Peter Auriol, humbly infills that the Experience which the East India Company had acquired, of the long and laborious Services of the said James Peter Auriol, in the said Office, and of his Abilities and Integrity, did afford a reasonable Cause of Preference in the Choice of a fit Person to execute an Agency of so important a Nature.

And the said Warren Hafiings fays. That on the Twenty-fifth Day of March, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, the Governor General and Council, he being then Governor General, did, as a proper Alteration in the Allowance of the said Agency, resolve, that, from the Thirty-first Day of December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, the said Auriol should draw no more Commission on the Freight and Charges of Shipping, or on any other Charges, than the Rate of Five per Cent. being the customary Amount drawn by Merchants; but he denies that he was thereby guilty of any Crimi-jial Misrepresentation whatsoever.

And the said Warren Hafiings admits that some Complaints wer tmade concerning Rice and other Provisions supplied by the said Auriol, which Complaint having been immediately enquired into, and satisfactorily answered, and the proper Execution of the said Contract, on the Part of the said Auriol, having been fully ascertained, the said Warren Hafiings further admits he did, in Concurrence with the other

5

Members of the Council, continue the said Auriol in the said Agency; but the said Warren Hafiings denies that he did discourage any just or necessary Enquiry into the Execution of this Service, or any Complaint of the Non-performance thereof.

And the said Warren Hafiings denies that in any of the supposed Declarations, or that by all or any of the Acts or Deeds by him, touching the Matters aforesaid, made, done, or committed* he did violate his Duty, or break the Trust reposed in him, or that he was Qr is guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

And the said Warren Hafiings further fays. That in the Month of November, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-six, he did, while Governor General and as Commander in Chief of Fort William in Bengal, propose in Council a Plan for supplying, by Means of an Agent, the Garrison of that Fort with a continual Store of Provisions sufficient for a Siege; which Plan was approved by the Council; but he denies that he induced them to approve thereof, otherwise than by dating the Nature of his said Plan,-and his Reasons for proposing it; and he admits that the same was a new Plan; but he avers, that an adequate Necessity did exist for the said Appointment.

And the said Warren Hafiings further fays, That at a subsequent Meeting of the Board, they did, on the Motion of the said Warren Hafiings, appoint John Belli, Esquire, to the said Agency; but the said Warren Hafiings denies, that he did propose the said John Belli from a Spirit of Criminal Partiality to his own Favourites, as in the said Article is charged; but on the contrary avers, that his Recommendation of the said John Belli was made in full Confidence, that the said Trust would thereby be faithfully and effectually discharged.

And the said Warren Hafiings further fays, That in consequence of a Reference by the Board to Three Merchants, respecting the Rate of Commission to be allowed for providing the Articles in Question, the said Merchants did report their Opinion to be, that no Agent could undertake to supply the Stores required, and to keep up the specified Quantity in constant good Order, for less than certain Rates therein specified, amounting in the Whole to Twenty Pounds per Cent.; but the said Warren Hafiings, being convinced from authentic Documents and Calculations, as well as from other Enquiries, that the said Service could not be effectually performed at the Rate of Commission so reported, did propose, and the Board did resolve, to fix the Rate of Commission at Fifteen per Cent, on providing the said Articles, and FifteenCent, more for Loffes arising from replacing decayed and damaged Stores, and renewing the whole Deposit of Victualling Stores every Year, which the said Agent, by his proposed Engagement, was bound to do: And the said Warren Hafiings fays, that the said Terms were reasonable and proper, with a View to the effectual Execution of the said Service.

And the said Warren tings admits, that the said Alexander Champion did, in a Letter addreflfed to the said Warren Hajlings, communicate to the President and Council of the said East India Company through the said Warren Haf-tings, then being President as aforesaid, certain Overtures of Peace, which had been then lately made to him by Fyzoola Kban, and submitted by him, the said Alexander Champion, to the said Vizier, but which the said Vizier had rejected with Difdain} and the said Alexander Champion did, in that Letter, express his Regret at such Rejection, and his Wish that the Board Should, upon due Consideration of the said Overtures, devise any Means by which the Public Good might be promoted. And the said Warren Hajlings

denies, that the Terms of Peace bffered by the said Fyzoola Kban were wife or advantageous either for the Vizier or the Company. And the said Warren Haf-tings'iays, that he did, in Answer to the Letter of the said Alexander Champion, in June, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, declare his Opinion, “ that, instead of soliciting the Vizier to relin-f< quiih his Conquest of the said Fyzoola Khan, every “ Argument Should be used to dissuade him from such an Intention} and that it was the Desire of “ the said Warren Hajlings, that the said Alexander “ Champion would discourage it as much as was in <c his Power.” But the said Warren Hajlings denies, that, in so doing, he acted in Violation of any Principles of Justice or found Policy, or contrary to any Duties of his Station. And the said Warren -tings admits, that, at the several Times referred to in the said Fifth Article, the Government of the said Company in Bengal was carried on by a President and Council, and that such Select Committee, was appointed, as is stated in the said Fifth Article} he affirms, however, that the President had Authority in certain Cafes to act singly, and to fend Orders without the Concurrence of the said Council or Select Committee. And the said Watren Hajlings admits, that, whilst he was President, as aforesaid, he did, in Conjunction with the Select Committee, in a Letter from them to the said Alexander Champion, dated the Eighth Day of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, express themselves to the Effest following: “ That their Satisfaction upon the “ entire Reduction of the Rohilla Country to the “ Vizier’s Government was increased by the Vizier’s Intentions of terminating the War by an Accommodation with the Rohillas, which might be easily “ settled in their distressed Situation, and that they “ hoped his Excellency would be disposed to con-,f ciliate their Affections to his Government, by ac- ceding to lenient Terms.” But the said Warren Hajlings, denying that he did afterwards violate the said public Order or Instruction, fays, that he did, on the Sixteenth Day of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, in a Letter of that Date, addressed to the said Alexander Champion, in Answer ,to Two Letters of the Twenty-first and Twenty-sixth of August, received that Morning, express an Hope, “ that the said Alexander Champion had resolved to “ prosecute the War to a final Issue, because he “ thought it appeared very plainly that Fyzoola Khan u and his Adherents lay at the Mercy of the said “ Alexander Champion, and because he apprehended *f much Inconvenience from Delays, and because he " was morally certain that no Good would be gained “ by negociating.” And the said Warren Hajlings did, in that Letter, further suggest, ct Thai; although “ he had referred the said Alexander Champion to the “ Vizier for conducting all Negociations, yet he by “ no Means wilhed that the Vizier should lose Time, “ by seeking for an Accommodation: That it would *f be more effectual, more decisive, and more confiftent with his Dignity, and with his Honour, which “ he had already pledged, to abide by his first “ Offers, to dictate the Conditions of Peace, and “ to admit only an Acceptance without Reservatien, or a clear Refusal, from his Adversary.” And the said Warren Hajlings did, in the same Letter, inform the said Alexander Champion, That he did intend to communicate the Substance of the said Alexander Champion’s Advices to the Select Committee for their fuller Sentiments on the Measures to be thereafter taken } but, in the mean Time, to prevent the Danger of Delay, he desired that the said Alexander Champion would be pleased to receive those Instructions for his Guide. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that at the Time he wrote the said last-mentioned Letter of the Sixteenth of September, he did confidently believe that

the

28 Geo. III. c° Decembris. 53

the Sentiments of the Seledt Committee entirely coincided with his own,supon the several Subjects Of the said Letter; and, inasmuch as he then united in his own Person, by virtue of his Commission from the India Company, the Powers and Authorities both of Commander in Chief and of President, he did conceive himself warranted by such his Powers and Authorities; thte Exigencies of Public Service, and the Necessity of avoiding the Dangers of Delay,” to give an instant Answer to the Two Letters received by him from the said Alexander Champion, as aforesaid, without waiting for a formal Communication with the Select Committee: But he fays, that the Letter last mentioned wai, on the Seventeenth Day of September, bea ing the Day next after the same was written by him* laid before the said Select Committee, who did approve of the fame, and notify such their Approbation to the said Alexander Champion, in a Letter dated the said Seventeenth of September. And the said Warren Hastings denies* that he did, by his Conduct last mentioned, Violate the Duty of his Station, or illegally or clandestinely, or in any other Manner, counteract the Object of the Orders of the said Select Committee, or that he was in any Manner guilty of such Duplicity* 'or incurred such Risque respecting the Conclufion-of the; War as is charged upon him by the said Fifth Article. And the said Warren Hastings fays* that a Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the Vizier and the said Fyzoola Khan was concluded on the Seventh of » her. One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, at a Plaee called Lai Dang, previous to the Receipt of the said Letter of the said Warren Hastings of the Sixteenth of September, One thoufartd Seven hundred and Seventy-four. That the said Fyzoola Khan, in Consideration of the Conclusion thereof, agreed to pay, and in fast paid, the Sum of Fifteen Lacks of Rupees, or some other large Sum of Money, to the said Sujab ul Dewldb, by which Treaty the said Fyzoola Khan was established in the quiet Possession of the Territories of Ramp'dre, and some other Districts dependant thereon* in the Nature of Jaghires. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that the said Alexander Champion did, on the said Seventh of ORober, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-four, sign and seal the said Treaty as a Withefs thereto. But the said Warren Hastings denies that the said Alexander Champion did thereby engage the said United Company to guarantee the same or that at the Time of the Execution of the said Treaty he Was invested with Power so to do. And the said Warren Hastings denies that he understood the Guarantee of the Company to be so engaged, although he admits that, under the Circumstances which attended the Execution of the said Treaty, it would have been proper for the said East India Company to have interfered, in order to prevent any Infraction thereof. And the said Warren Hastings believes that the said Fyzoola Khan did conceive Doubts and Apprehensions that the Security of his Jaghire Lahds might be disputed by the Vizier; and fays, that Applications from the said Fyzoola Khan were at several Times communicated, both to the said Warren Hastings and the Supreme Council at Bengal, for the Purpose of obtaining the Guarantee of the said Company to the Engagements of the said Vizier with the said Fyzoola Khan. But the said Warren Hastings denies that he did for many Months, or at all, conceal or keep secret any Solicitations of the said Fyzoola Khan upon that Subject; and he fays, that all Letters received from the said Fyzoola Khan by the said Warren Hastings were, in Effect, a Communication to, and Part of a Correfpoiidence with, the whole Board; and that the fame, as the said Warren Hastings believes, were duly entered in the Book of Per/tan Correspondence, which was always open to the Inspection of the Board, and accessible by every Member thereof.

pore, the Capital of the said Fyzoola Khan, for the Purposes stated in the said Article, he the said Warren Hastings did, upon the Ninth of One thousand

Seven hundred and Seventy-eight, propose, and the Council, of which the Majority was constituted as is stated in the Fifth Article, did approve of the Ap-pointmentof thefadDanielORaviusBarwe the

said Middleton; and did further resolve, “ That the said Cf Resident Middleton should be authorized to offer the “ Company’s Guarantee for the Observance of the “ Treaty subsisting between the Vizier and Fyzoola “ Khan, provided it Should meet with the Vizier’s " Concurrence.” And the said Warren Hastings fays, that the said Daniel ORavius Bar-well did, in a Letter to

Mr. Middleton, report his Opinion of the good Faith of the said Fyzoola Khan, and did inform the said Middleton, that he* said Barwell, had himself allured the said Fyzoola Khan that he Fyzoola Khan had preserved inviolate every Article of the Treaty of Lai Dang; but the said Warren Hastings does not believe or admit that the said Fyzoola Khan had preserved inviolate the said Treaty. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that it was represented to him and the Council at Calcutta, that the Vizier Afoph ul Dowla did consent to the Grant of the Company’s Guarantee, on Condition that he Should receive the Presents usually offered on such Occasions; and that it was in- like Manner represented that the said Treaty and Guarantee was presented to the said Fyzoola Khan with great Solemnity; and that the said Fyzoola Khan did deliver to the said Daniel ORavius Barwell a Nuzzer of Two Elephants and Horses, ahd a Lack of Rupees for the Vizier, and did offer a Lack of Rupees also for the Company, in Testimony of his Gratitude on that Occasion. And the said Warren Hastings admits that the said Daniel ORavius Barwell did not immediately accept the said Money, but took an Obligation for the fame, and that the said Offer was communicated to the Board at Calcutta; and that the said Warren Hastings did propose, and that the Board, notwithstanding the Objection of Mr. Francis, then a Member of the said Board, did agree to accept the same for the Use of the Company, and that the same was accordingly so accepted; but the said Warren Hastings denies, that by the Whole pr any Part of the Conduct of him the said Warren Hastings, in respect to the Matters aforesaid, he has violated the Faith of the Company, or degraded the English Nation in the Eyes of India, or has broken any Treaty, or violated any Duty of the Trust reposed in him. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that by the Treaty of Lai Dang, the said Fyzoola Khan did engage,

“ That he would always whilst he lived continue in “ Submission and Obedience to the Nabob Vizier, and retain in his Service Five thousand Men, ftipu- lated by the Nabob Vizier, and not a single Man <l more: That with whomsoever the Nabob Vizier Should engage in Hostilities, he would afilft him} “ and that if the Nabob Vizier Should fend an Army “ against any Enemy, he would also fend Two or Three thousand of his Troops to join them; and if the said Vizier Should go in Person against any “ Enemy, he the said Fyzoola Khan would Personally “ attend him with his Forces. That he would have “ no Connexion with any Person but the Nabob Vi-<c zier, and would hold no Correspondence with any “ one (the English Chiefs excepted): That whatever “ the Nabob Vizier directed, he would execute; and tc that he would at all Times, and on all Oceafions, “ both in Adversity and Prosperity, continue his firm “ Associate.” And the said Warren Hastings admits, that >t was not stipulated by the said Treaty whether all or any of the said Troops Should confiftof Cavalry:

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that he did, at or about the several Times in the said Sixth Article mentioned, receive from Saddamind, the Buxey or Treasurer of

Sing, from AJopb ul Dowla, the Nabob of and

from a Person called Nundoolol, the several Sums charged in the said Sixth Article to have been tefpec-tively received by him from the said several Persons. But he fays, that he did not take, accept, or receive the same, or any of them, or any Part thereof, for his owni Use or Benefit, or with any Intent or Purpose so to apply the fame, or with any corrupt or criminal Intent or Purpose whatsoever} and that the fame, and every of them, and every Part thereof, were by him respectively accepted and received, during a Period of great public Exigency, for the foie Use and Benefit of the East India Company} and he avers that the fame, and-every of them, and every Part thereof, were accordingly so applied.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he did ever, in any Manner, contrary to his Duty, or inju-rioully to the Interests of the said East India Company, or of the Brilijls Nation, let any Lainds to Kil~

commending that Measure, appointed to the Office of Guardian of the Nabob ill to

which Office the said Warren avers, it was

then proper and expedient to appoint the Paid Mutiny Begum j &nd he denies, that such Appointment did invest her in any Degree with the Government of his Dominions, if by that Expression is meant the Government of Bengal, or was contrary to the Orders of the Court of Directors, or that the same was to the Prejudice of the Rights and Interest of the said Company, or of the Nation.

Aiid the said Warren Hajlings fays, That at a Meeting of the Council held on the Thirtieth ,

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays. That he

did, on the Thirty-first MarcOne thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-five, dissolve a Council then held; but he fays that such Difiolution was not for the Purpore of preventing an Enquiry into any Charge against him, he the said Warren Hajlings having, by a Minute, dated Thirteenth , One thousand

Seven hundred and Seventy-five, pointed out a Method to the said Majority, by Which any such Enquiry might be as effectually prosecuted in his Absence as before a Meeting of the Governor General and Council, at which the said Warren Hajlings Should preside as Governor General; and to which Minute he did, on the said Thirty-first of March, refer the said Majority, in order that such Method of Enquiry might by them be adopted; and he denies that such DifTo-lution was arbitrary, illegal, or improper.

And the said Hajlings denies that he has, in respect of all or any of the several Matters stated in the said Sixth Article, violated any of the Duties of his Station, subverted good Government, shewn an evil Example to the Servants of the East India Company, been guilty of Corruption, Peculation, or Extortion, or has acted in Defiance of any Act of Parliament, or was or is guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatso-: ever.

ARTICLE SEVENTH.

IN Answer to the Seventh Articlej-the said Warrelt Hajlings denies, that by the Laws and Customs of Bengal, according to such Information as he has been able to procure respecting them, the Zemindars havej or have been generally held or reputed to have, such Rights of Property in the Lands of Bengal, as are in the said Seventh Article stated; but he fays, they ard poflfefled of certain qualified Rights of Property therein, which he believes have been charged with Debts, and under certain Limitations fold, and otherwise conveyed: And he further fays, that other Natives, called Talaakdars or Ryots, hold subordinate Rights of Property or Occupancy in the said Lands;. and that'the greater Part of the said Natives are whose Rights and Privileges are grounded upon regular Grants; and that the Estates derived thereunder nave, in some Instances, been enjoyed in a Course of Family Succession, and acquired by Purchase, subject however to the Right of the Sovereign Power to derive a Revenue from the Lands, adequate to their real Value, and to make Ordinances and Regulations respecting such Revenues and Lands, not inconfiftenc With the Rights of such Zemindars.

And the said Warren Hajlings has heard and believes. That Bengal was under the Dominion of the Mogul, and subject to a Mohammedan Government, for above Two hundred Years.

And the said Warren Hajlings does not know, or believe it to be true, that while the Mogul Government was fin its Vigour, the State of Property in the Zemindars was such as in the said Seventh Article is stated, or that the Relit of the Provinces had not been materially altered, from the Year One thousand Five hundred and Seventy-three to the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Forty; or that in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Forty the regular and effective Mogul Government ended.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. He has been informed that, from the said last-mentioned Period, to the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Sixty-five, Invasions, Usurpations, and various Revolutions, did take place in the Government of; in Confe-

quence of which, and of other Circumstances, the Country was considerably reduced and impoverished, and that in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Sixty-five, the East India Company received from the present Mogul Emperor Sha Alum a Grant of the De-wanny of Bengal, Bahar, and Orijfa. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that there was, about the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy, a Famine in the Provinces of Bengal and Bahar, by which he has heard that a great Number of the Inhabitants perished; and he has also heard, that the Revenue was, in the Two Years immediately preceding the Appointment of the said Warren Hajlings to the Government of Fort William, kept up to its former Standard, and collected from the remaining Inhabitants; and that the Country was impoverished.

And

58 5* Decemhris.J. 1787.

And the said Warren Hastings fays, That he knew of the Effects produced by the said Famine; and that the Collections of Revenue in the said Provinces, prior to the Appointment of the said Warren Hastings to the said Government; had contributed to increase the Distress of the said Country, and were likely to produce a Decay of the Revenue, unless Means were adopted to prevent such Decay.

And he admits, That it was his Duty, when appointed to the Government of Fort William, to apply such Means for that Purpose as were within his Judgment and Power.

And the said Warren Hastings, denying that the Knowledge and Judgment which he entertained at the Time referred to in the said Seventh Article, respetting the Rights of Zemindars, and the Advantages to be expected from entrusting to them the Collections of the Revenues, are therein fully and truly set forth, craves Leave to refer to a Letter written and transmitted by himself and the Council to the Court of Directors on the Third Day of November, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-two, which Letter contains at large the then Knowledge and Judgment of him the said Warren Hastings upon those Subjects; and from which Letter the said Warren Hastings apprehends that the Matters referred to in the said Article are ex traded.

And the said Warren Hastings fays, That the Court Of Directors having resolved to stand forth as Duan, and by the Agency of the Company’s Servants to take upon themselves the entire Care and Management of the Revenue* of Bengal; and having directed that the Presidency of Fort William should plan and execute this important Work, and adopt such Regulations and pursue such Measures as should at once secure to the Company every possible Advantage, and free the Ryots from the Oppressions of the Zemindars and petty Tyrants, the said Warren Hastings did, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-two, soon after his taking Charge of the Office of President of Fort William, diligently undertake the said important Work; and having employed the belt Means in his Power of procuring Information on a Subject then much involved in Difficulties and Obscurity, the said Warren Hastings did, with the unanimous Concurrence of the then Council of the Presidency of Fort William, form and carry into Execution such Plan for the Collection ind Management of the Revenues of the Province of Bengal, and for the internal Government thereof, as upon mature Consideration appeared to the said Warren Hastings most conformable to the Orders and Intention of the Court of Directors, and belt calculated to promote the Ends proposed.

And the said Warren Hastings fays, That certain new Regulations having been completed and publickly notified, the Revenues were settled for a Period of Five Years, upon such Terms as to the President and Council appeared reasonable and just, with progref-live and accumulating Increase on each of the Four last Years of the said Settlement; but he denies that such Settlement of the said Revenues was made at a higher Rate than had ever been received before.

And the said Warren Hastings denies that, in respect of the said Settlement, he acted in any such Manner, or was guilty of any such Offences as are stated in the said Seventh Article, or that the said Settlement, so formed, was, in any Respect, unjust, inexpedient, or improper.

And the said Warren Hastings, denying that, in the Measures hereinafter mentioned, he acted with a View to accompliffi any iniquitous Purpose whatsoever, alledges it to have been a Part of the Plan hereinbefore mentioned, that the Lands of Bengal Should be let out in Farms; and the said President and Council, he the said Warren listings being then President* did

accordingly publish their Intention so to do, and did invite all Persons to make Proposals for farming the said Lands; but he fays, that such Mode having failed of its intended Effect, it was deemed expedient to put up the Lands to public Auction; and the Lands were accordingly let in th^t Mode, at the usual Season. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that the said Lands were, prior to such letting, in the Possession of divers Zemindars, Talookdars, Farmers, and others; and that a Change of Possession did, in some Instances, take place; but that, in every Instance, a Preference was given to the Zemindar who was willing to give what was considered to be an adequate Relit for the Lands; and that an Allowance was made to the Zemindar, whenever his Proposal was rejected, agreeably to the ancient Usages of the Country. And the said Warren Hastings further fays, that, in some Instances, the Lands were let to Persons who were the Banyans of British Subjects. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that, notwithstanding many Precautions were used to prevent it, Part of the said Lands fell into the Hands of some Persons who proved, in the Event, unable to perform their Engagements with the Company; but he denies that such Event was foreseen by him. And the said Warren Hastings avers that, in making the Settlement aforesaid, the President and Council, he being then President, did pay every Attention to the State of the Country and its Inhabitants which Policy and Humanity required; and denies that the said Settlement, either in FaCt was, or did in Form appear to be, of such Kind, or calculated for such Purposes, or productive of such Effects, as are in the said Seventh Article, in that Behalf, set forth; but he admits that it did afterwards appear, that the Zemindars and Farmers had engaged for a higher Relit than the DistriCts could afford, and that the real Receipts did fall considerably, but not unusually, shorc of the Settlement; but as to the Amount of such Deficiency, and the particular Periods thereof, the said Warren Hastings craves Leave to refer to the public Accounts and Proceedings of the said Presidency, touching the fame.

And the said Warren Hasting, denying thatjie was a Party to, or in any Manner concerned in, or answerable for, any Impoficion, Fraud, Peculation, or Embezzlement, fays. That the Court of Directors of the East India Company, having received Intelligence of Peculation and Embezzlement supposed to have been committed by some of the Persons constituting the Committee of Circuit, at a Time when he the said -ten Hastings had ceased to act in the said Committee, did direct Prosecutions against such Persons, and against all other proper Parties, which Prosecutions, h® admits, never proceeded to Trial: But h« fays that, in Consequence of a Report from the Advocate General, to whom the Subject had been referred by the Governor General and Council, the said Warren Hastings did, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, declare, that having attentively read and weighed the Arguments urged by the Advocate General in his Report concerning the Prosecutions long depending in the Supreme Court of Judicature, he the said Warren Hastings was clearly of Opinion, that there was no Ground to maintain them; and as it was manifest from his the said Advocate General’s State of them, they would only be productive of Expence to the Company, and unmerited Vexation to the Parties; he the said Warren Hastings proposed, that Orders should be given for withdrawing them, which Orders were accordingly given by the Board.

And the said Warren Hastings further fays, That previous to the Settlement hereinbefore mentioned, he admits that he did, in Concurrence with the Council, establish certain Regulations to be obfefved in executing the fame* sunongst which were the Two follow*

ing:

ing: tc That the Farms Should consist of entire Purgunnahs, provided they did not exceed the Annual *c Amount of One Lack of Rupees, in which same " theylhould be divided into such equal Proportions as Should reduce the Amount of each considerably *below that Sum, unless the acknowledged Respon-" Ability and good Character of the Farmer Should “ support his Pretensions to relit the whole Purgun- nah j and that all Villages or Portions of Land “ which had been theretofore let in separate Farms, <( Should be re-annexed to the Purgunnahs to which “ they originally belonged.” — >* That no Pelhcar, Banyan, or other Servants, of whatever Denomi- nation, of the Collector, or Relation or Dependant of any such Servant, be allowed to farm Lands, nor directly or indirectly to hold a Concern in any Farm, nor to be Security for any Farmer: That the Colle&or be strictly enjoined to prevent such Prac- tices; and that if it Should be discovered that any t{ one, under a false Name, or any Kind of Cpllufion, <c had found Means to evade that Order, he should be “ subjedb to an heavy Fine, proportionate to the " Amount of the Farm, and the Farm should be relet or made Khas j and if it should appear that the u Collector Should have countenanced, approved, or *« connived at a Breach of that Regulation, he Should <e stand, ip/o/ae7o,dismissed from hisColledtorship: Neither Should any European, directly or ihdiredUy, be “ permitted to relit Lands in any Part of the Country.”

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That Cantoo Baboo, Banyan of him the said Warren , was

accepted by the said President and Council, as the Renter, on his own Account, of several considerable Farms, of Part of which he had been some Time, and before the Arrival of the said Warren in ’,

in Possession; and that, in the Absence, and without the Knowledge of the said Warren , the said

Cantoo Baboo was accepted by the said Council as Security for other Farms j but what was the Annual Amount thereof the said Warren Hajlings cannot set forth: And he

also admits that the said Cantoo Baboo was afterwards permitted by the President and Council, he the said Warren Hajlings being such President, to relinquish Two of the said Farms; but the said Warren Hajlings denies that in all or any of the Matters aforesaid he was guilty of any Violation of the said Regulations, or of the Public Trust reposed in him, or of the Duty of his Station as in the said Article is charged, or that he was in the whole, or any Part of the Transafkion aforesaid, guilty of any Collusion with his Servant, or Fraud on the East India Company.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits that he was of Opinion, that Innovations in the Management and Collection of the Revenues of Bengal were in general liable to many of the Objections in the said Seventh Article, in that Behalf, set forth; and that he has upon different Occasions declared such to be his Opinion, and that the Court of Directors did, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-seven, declare their Apprehension that a sudden Transition from one Mode to another, in the Investigation and Collection of their Revenues in , might have

alarmed the Inhabitants, particularly the Native Zemindars and Landholders, lessened their Confidence in the Stability of the Company, and been attended with other Evils; yet, as it was acknowledged on all Hands that the Measures alluded to in that Letter had produced the good EffeCl of ascertaining, with a sufficient Degree of Precision, what Revenue might be collected from the Country without Opprelfion, they flaould avail themselves of that Information, and were pleased to find it in their Power to yield proper Relief to the Natives, without involving the Company in the least Inconvenience. The said Warren Hajlings jiowever did consider it to be his Duty, and he did ac_ cordingly, from the Commencement of his Go_

vernment, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-two, to the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, whilst he bore the several Offices of President and Governor General as aforesaid, introduce, and in Concurrence with the Council carry, into Execution, many different Measures, for the Purpose of improving the Mode of Settlement, Collection, and Management* of the Territorial Revenues of Bengal-, but he denies that in the Introduction or Execution of such Measures he acted in such Manner, or that the said Measures were of such Nature, as in the said Seventh Article is stated.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That he did,' as President of the Prelidency of Fort William, immediately after his taking Charge of the said Office, in April, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-two* in Concurrence wnth the Council of the said Presidency, abolish the Office of Naib Duan, or Native Collector of the Revenues, then existing, and at the same Time did appoint a Committee of the Board to go on a Circuit through the Provinces, and to form a Settlement of the Revenues for Five Years j and that he did with the like Concurrence, and at the same Period of Time, continue the Company’s Servants in the Management of the Collections, One of such Servants being left in each District under the new Title of Collector, inltead of the former Title of Supervilor, and with some Alteration in the Nature of their Employment, adapted to the new System then established; and that he did, with the like Concurrence, and in the same Year, abolish the General Board of Re venue at Muxadavad, for which lait Measure such

Reasons were aifigned, amongst others, as are in the said Seventh Article in that Behalf mentioned.

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays. That in November, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-three, with the like Concurrence, he transferred from the Collectors to several Councils of Revenue, commonly called Provincial Councils, the Collection and Management of the Revenues. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that he has declared an Opinion in favour of the Plan of Provincial Councils; but as to the particular Advice given by him to the Governor General and Council in his Minute of the Twenty-fifth October, One thousand Seven hundred and Se-

venty-four, and the Declaration contained in the Plan for the future Settlement of the Revenues, transmitted to the Court of Directors on the Twenty-second April, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-five; and as to the Provisions contained in another Plan for the better Administration of Justice, transmitted to the Court of Directors on the Eighteenth January, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-six j and the Draught or Scheme of an Act of Parliament for the better Administration of Justice in the Provinces, transmitted t"6 the Court of Di-reCtors on Thirtieth April, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-six, the said Warren Hajlings humbly begs to refer your Lordships for the Contents of the said Minute, and the said several Instruments, to the said Minute and Instruments, when the same shall be produced; and that your Lordships will be pleased to take into Consideration the Occasion and the several Circumstances under which the same were respectively made.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That with the like Concurrence of the Council he did detach from the general Province of each Council certain DistriCts, which it was deemed expedient, for the better Management thereof, to form into separate ColleCtorships, an4 that some additional Expence was thereby created to the East India Company. But he denies that in so doing he did invade, alter, or violate the Principles on which the System of Provincial Councils was professedly founded; or that the said Measure was of the Nature, induced by the Motives, calculated for the Purposes, or productive of the Effects, in the said Seventh Article stated.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That he ever the said Warren Haft mgs also fays, that every proper knew or believed the said Measure to be such as is Provision was made to prevent any Inconvenience be-reprefenced in the said Seventh Article. And although ing suffered by the Country from the Mode or Time he admits that he did in Council, on the Nineteenth of carrying the said Plan into Execution, and that January, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy- no Inconvenience was occasioned thereby, nine, make use of the Expression in the said Seventh And the said Warren Hajlings, denying that he did Article in that Behalf set forth, yet he denies that he arbitrarily or corruptly abolish the said Councils, ad- did thereby avow, or mean to avow, or had in FaCt mits, that it was a Part of the said Plan of One thou-been guilty of any Corruption, Breach of TruH, or sand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, that a Commit-Mifgovcrnment; or did use any scandalous or crimi- tee of Revenue at , confining of Four Persons,

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That the ever profefied, or that the Powers thereby veiled in Court of Directors did fend Orders to the Governor the said Committee tended to deprive the Members of General and Council, dated the Fifth of February One the Supreme Council of a due Knowledge of, or In-thousand Seven .-hundred and Seventy.seven, in the -speCtion into, the Management of the Territorial Re-Words, or to the Effect in the said Seventh Ar- venues, or to veil the same in EffeCl solely and entirely

Trust or Duty in the Deputation or Appointment of the said Aumeens, or that he the said Warren had any Design or Wilh thereby to draw into his Own Hands the foie Orderingj Management, and Government. of any of the Territorial Acquisitions and Revenues of the East India Company, or that any Allegation made by the said Warren , of the.

Purposes for which the said Aumeens were appointed,-was false or pretended. And the said Warren Hajiings denies, that he well knew, or ever was convinced in his Judgment or Opinion, as a general and unqualified Proposition, that there was not any Trust to be put in the Accounts delivered in by the Aurfteens, or that no Dependance could be placed on that Mode of Enquiry, or that Aumeens were not to be trusted.

And the said Warren Hajiings denies, That he did assume to himself the Power of appointing, or that he did actually, by his own Authority appoinr, the Persons who were employed in the Execution of the aforesaid Object, or that he did invert, or concur in inverting them with such Powers as are in the said Seventh Article dated; but he admits it to have been his Duty to recommend Persons properly qualified for that Purpose. And the said Warren Hajiings further fays, that in order to assist the Persons to whom the principal Management and Superintendartce of the aforesaid Enquiries were entrusted, the Governor General and Council did, on his Recommendation, appoint the aforesaid Gunga Govind Sing to the Office of Pefficar, whom he admits to have been once dismissed from an Office in the Revenue Department; but he fays, that such Dismission was, in the Judgment of him the said Warren Hajiings, improper and unjust j and that he the said Warren Hajiings did consider the said Gunga Govind Sing as better qualified than any other Person to fill the said Office of Pelhcar.

And the said Warren Hajiings admits, That he was of Opinion, that the granting of long Leases of the Lands was in many Respects better for the East India Company and the Inhabitants than Annual Settlements, which he has declared to have been often productive of such Consequences as are in the said Seventh Article in that Behalf set forth. And the said Warren Hajiings also fays, that the Committee of Revenue at Calcutta, to whom it was referred by the Governor General and Council, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, to form a Plan for the Settlement of the Revenue for the ensuing Year, did, amongst other Things, report their Opinion, " That “ with respect to the Period of the Leases in general, “ it appeared to the said Committee to limit them to “ One Year would be the best Period, giving a Preference at the Settlement of the next to such Per-u fons as should have paid up their Rents, and making a Promise of this on the Part of Government.” And the said Warren Hajiings fays, that the Governor General and Council, he being Governor General, did for the most Part approve of such Report; but the said Warren Hajiings denies, that in giving such Approbation he did neglect his Duty, or dilregard the Interest of the Eajt India Company, and the Ease and Welfare of the Inhabitants, or contradict any of his own Professions or Declarations, or that he did not hold himself bound or restrained by the Orders of the Court of Directors.

ARTICLE NINTH.

AND the said Warren H, in Answer to the said Ninth Article, denies that he did ever drive any Persons to such Distress as he thought might oblige them to offer Bribes to him for their Ransom, or that he did ever entertain any such Design or Thought} and he further denies that he did suddenly and corruptly alter his Language, as in the said Ninth Article is dated; but he fays that he did, in his Minute of the Twenty-first of May, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, at which Time a material Alteration had happened in the Situation of Affairs, with regard to Foreign Wars and Enemies, from that in which they flood on the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Days of December, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, make such Representation of the State of the Province of Oude, as in the said Ninth Article is mentioned; and that he did thereupon propose in Council, himself and Mr. Wheler being at that Time the only Members present at the Board, a Delegation to himself, containing, as the said Warren tings affirms. Powers neither new, dangerous, or exorbitant, such Powers being delegated for the Pur-jjofe, amongst others, of assisting the Nabob Vizier m forming such Regulations as might be necessary for the Peace and Order of his Government, the Improvement of his Revenue, and the Adjustment of the mutual Concerns subsisting between him and the Company, with such Authority to enforce the same as the Governor General and Council might or could exercise on Occasions in which they would be warranted to exercise the fame, by the Claims which the Honourable Company held or might have on the Revenues of the Dominions of the said Nabob, and to form and conclude such several Engagements or Treaties with the Nabob Vizier, the Government of Berar, and with any other of the Chiefs and Powers of Hindostan, as he Should judge expedient and necef-

fary, whether for the Termination or more effectual Prosecution of the War with the Maratta State, or for the Advancement of the Interests of the Honour-ble Company, or for the strict and permanent Establishment and Confirmation of the Alliances which did then sublist, or which he, the said Warren -tings, Should judge necessary to form with the said Chiefs and Powers respectively. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that the Instrument of his Delegation did also declare that all such Acts, and all such Engagements or Treaties made as aforesaid, Should be binding on the Governor General and Council, in the same Manner, and as effectually as if they had been passed and done by the special and immediate Concurrence and actual Sanction of the Governor General and Council, in Council assembled.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies that the Commission thus given to the said Warren Hajlings was destructive of the Constitution of the said Council, contrary to the Standing Orders of the East India Company, or to the Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, in the said Ninth Article mentioned.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he did ever conceive or understand that the said Commission v.ia illegal j but he fays that he did, on the Third ‘/.ffy. One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, and not on the Third July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, as in the said Article is stated, deliver in a Minute, of which the following is a Copy: “ In my Minute, which I laid before the Board on Twentyfirst May, I expressed the Satisfaction with which I could at this Juncture leave the Presidency, from * the mutual Confidence which was happily between “ Mr. Wheler and me. I now readily repeat that Sentiment, and observe with Pleasure, that Mr. “ Wheler confirms it. Before my Departure it is €c probable that we shall in Concert have provided at u the Board for almost every important Circumstance that can eventually happen during my Absence; but if any Should occur, for which no previous .« Provision shall have been made in the Resolution “ of the Board, Mr. Wheler may aft with immediate Decision, and with the fulleft Confidence of my Support, in all such Exigencies, as well as in condufting the ordinary Business of the Presidency, “ and in general in all Matters of this Government, “ excepting those which may specially or generally be “ intruded to me. Mr. Wheler, during my Absence, “ may consider himself as possessed of the full Powers rt of the Governor General and Council of this Government, as in Effect he is by the Constitution j and he may be assured, that so far as my Sanction “ and Concurrence shall be, or be deemed necessary “ to the Confirmation of his Measures, he shall reccive them.” And he denies that he delivered in the said Minute with any of the Views or Motives in the said Article stated, or that the same is of the Nature or Tendency therein set forth.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies that the Acts done by him, in his Negotiations with the Vizier, in virtue of the aforesaid Commissions, all which he avers to have been legal and justifiable, could have been equally well done, or with less Question as to their Validity, by the British Resident at the Court of Oude, or by any other Person deputed by the said Warren Hajlings. And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he was guilty of any unwarrantable Affump-tien of Power, or that the Power exercised by him Was unconstitutional or irregular, fpreign to his Duty, Or unnecessary for any good or legitimate Purpose, or that he attempted to enforce or cover the same by any intricate and subtle Devices, or that he did in any Manner diferedit the Office of Governor General or the British Government.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That he did proceed to meet the said Vizier in Consequence of the said Commission, at a considerable Charge. But the said Warren Hajlings denies, that any unnecessary Charge to the East India Company was incurred upon that Occasion. And the said Warren IHjlings, as to the said supposed Gift or Bribe of One hundred thousand Pounds in the said Ninth Article mentioned, craves Leave to refer to his Answer in this Behalf already made. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that he did, on the Nineteenth of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, at a Place called Chunar, enter into the said Treaty or Agreement, commonly called The Treaty of in which he

did consent to certain Propositions for relieving the said Nabob Vizier from the Charge of certain large Bodies of Troops, then in the Pay of him the said Nabob Vizier, and for the Particulars of the said Propositions the said Warren Hajlings craves Leave to refer to the said Treaty, when the same shall be produced: But the said Warren Hajlings denies that he did, at any Time after making the said Treaty, violate his own or the Public Faith, by putting Troops on the Establishment of Oude in the Manner, or under

tier the Circlimftaiices, stated in the said Nirtth Article j but the said Warren Hajlirtgs fays, that in Consequence of certain Representations made to him by the then Resident at Oude of the Necessity of rein-forcing the Troops in that Country, a Detachment of Four Regiments of Sepoys, with a proper Field Train, was ordered to March for the Purpose of supporting the Authority of the Vizier, and maintaining the Tranquillity of his Country, by such Means aS-the said Vizier Should be plealed to direct. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that he did, in a Letter dated Twenty-fourth , One thou-

sand Seven hundred and Eighty-one) addressed by hirfi upon that Occasion to Mr. , then Rclident

at Oude, suggest, that as the Force thus meant to bb

employed for the Domestic Tranquillity of the Vizier’S Dominions, was an Addition to the Brigade on Subsidy, and which was ordered to be in Readiness for Marching at the lhorteft Notice to defend any Part of his Excellency’s Territories which a foreign Enemy might be tempted to invade during civil Commotions, the Vizier would, the said Warren Hajlingl made no Doubt, chearfully consent to pay the Expences of the Detachment, by a fixed Monthly Subsidy during the Service. And the said Warren tings fays, that upon a Representation thereupon made to him, that the March of such Detachment, under the Circumstances stated, would, it was believed, be contrary to the Inclination of the said Vizier, arid understood by him as an Infraction of the Treaty of Chunar, and be construed a Replacing of the Troops which it had been agreed to recall, the said Warreh Hajlings did afterwards, by another Letter to the said Middleton, dated Third Janua, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, revoke the said Orders 1 and the said Orders were never carried into Execution: But the said Warren Hajlings fays, that afterwards, upon receiving various Representations of the disordered State of the Vizier’s Dominions, the Board, in the Absence of the said Warren , resolved

and ordered, in the Month of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, that a strong Detachment, under Colonel Sir John Cummings, should march into the Dominions of the Nabob Vizier, both for its internal Defence, and for the Relief of the Detachments which had been made from the Army Rationed at Cawnpoor j and the Board were informed, by a Letter from Mr. Brijlow, then Resident at , dated the Twelfth of December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, that the Nabob had. expressed his entire Con vision of the Necessity for the said Detachment, and that the Vizier would approve its being Rationed in his Dominions; and the same was Rationed there accordingly. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that it was provided by the First Article of the Treaty of Chunar, amongst other Things, that the English Officers, with their Sebundy Battalions, and other Gentlemen, excepting the Resident’s Office then upon the Nabob’s Lift, should be no longer at his Charge for the then current Year, the Arrears being paid up, with the Addition of Two Months Allowances. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that he did disregard any Engagements entered into by him on the Part of the India Company, or pursue any corrupt Purpose, or that he did in any Manner impose, or knowingly suffer to continue, any Pensions or Allowances over and above those spe-cialiy provided in the said Article, of the said Treaty, or ufc any deceitful Pretence respecting such Subject, or that he did make any such Confession relative thereto, as in the said Ninth Article is set forth.

TENTH ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Tenth Article, the said Warren Hajlings fays, That by the Second Article of the Treaty

x

of Chunar, reciting that great Distress had arisen to the Nabob’s Government from the Military Power and Dominion assumed by the Jagheerdars, for Remedy thereof it was provided, that the Nabob should be permitted to resume such as he might find necessary, with aReferve, that all such) for the Amount of whose Jaghires the Company were Guarantees) Should, in same of the Resumption of their Lands, be paid the Amount of their Net Collections through the Resident in ready Money. And the said Warren Hajlings fay9, that the said Nabob) conceiving the Authority and Influence of the Jagheerdars in the Jaggheer Districts, to be the Ciufe of Disorders in his Government, and entertaining Suspicions of the Fidelity of some of the said Jagheerdars, and intending to reduce the said Jaghires to their Original Value, had proposed of his oWn Accord, and without any Interference of the said Warren Hajlings, to resume the said Jaghires without any Exception whatsoever, which Intention having been communicated to the said Warren Hajlings, he had approved thereof.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That be wai afterwards informed that the said Jaghires were uni- verfally resumed by the said Vizier) which Refump* tien he believes to have been a warrantable and pro- per Measure j but he denies that it was under any Compulsion made use of by him or by any Person by him authorized thereto. And the said Warren tings further denies, that the said Vizier had made any such Seizure of the said Jaghires, or had entered into such Obligations, or had given such Assurances, as in the said Tenth Article are stated j but he has been informed) that during the Residency of Mr. the said Nabob having taken a Sum of Money to relieve his Distresses from Two Persons, named Mirzd Alii Khan and Sallar Jung, the said Nabob Vizier did engage to repay the Sum taken as aforesaid, and fur- ther, that the same should not be done in future.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits, That some of the said Jaghires resumed as aforesaid, were at the Time of such Resumption possessed by Persons of the Description in the said Article stated; but whether the same were of the Value in the said Article stated he cannot say, but he has heard that the Lands out of which the said Jaghires were paid did yield more than the Amount of such Jaghires, which Surplus did of Right belong to the said Vizier. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he does not know or believe that the Persons whose Jaghires were re- fumed in Manner aforesaid, were thereby reduced to such Distress as in the said Article is stated, or that such other Consequences did follow from the said Measure as are therein also set forth.

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That the Nabob Vizier did signify to him the said Warren tings, his Wilh to restore certain of the said Jaghires; but he denies that the said Vizier did signify a With to restore all the said Jaghires, as in the said Article is suggested, or that Applications were made on that Subject by the said Vizier for a long Time without Effect; but he fays, that the Approbation of the Board of Council was given to that Measure soon after the aforesaid Applications from the said Vizier, and that the said Jaghires were fully restored by the said Vizier.

ELEVENTH ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Eleventh Article, the said Warren Hajlings fays. That at the Time of executing the Treaty of Chunar, he did propose to the Vizier a certain Article, which he conceives to be the one referred to in the said Eleventh Article of Impeachment, and of which the following is a Copy:

. “ Having on my Behalf agreed to the Requisitiona

«« of

28 Geo. III.

,c of the Nabob Vizier, without Diminution or Reserve, I mull now repeat the Request which I be-<c fore verbally made to him, that he will be pleased “ to attend to such Proposals as 1 shall have to make " to him, and to those I expect his Assent the more “ readily, as they have for their ultimate Object his “ Interest alone* that of the.Company being no further concerned than in the Interest which they will tc eventually have in the Payment of the Debt due from the Nabob to the Company. I therefore re-c commend to him to reduce the great Number of his Sebundy and other Troops to regular and complete Establishments, not to be paid by Afllgnments 11 of Revenues, but in Money from the Treasury,

“ and their Number not to exceed the certain Means of paying them: But as this may be difficult without making a Separation of the Nabob’s public and *c private Funds, I further recommend* that he receive into his private Purse no more than a fixed Monthly Sum for the Expences of his Person and Household,

“ and that the Remainder of the net Colledions be “ left in a Public Treasury, under the Management “ of his Public Ministers, and the Inspection of the Resident, for the Discharge of his Military and Ci- vil Disbursements. This Advice is not meant to affect the Alignments actually made, and which “ must be Annually renewed, for the Payment of the “ past Debt and the current Demands of the Com-« pany.”

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That the said Nabob did assent to the said last-mentioned Article, and did execute the fame., And he denies that the said Article is or was intended to be worded in loose and ambiguous Terms, or that he did ever reprel'ent it in that Light, or to that Effect, in any Letter written by him to Edward Wheler, Esquire. But he fays that he did write a Letter concerning the said Treaty to the said Edward Wheler, containing a Paragraph, of which the following is a Copy, and which he conceives to be alluded to in the said Eleventh Article:

“ To the Copy of the Articles of Agreement,

“ N° i, I have added the Papers, N° i, A, B, C,

“ which will explain my Reasons for the several Ar- tides, and to these I beg Leave to refer you.

“ Upon the whole, generally, I have only to oblerve “ further, that the Agreement was drawn up from a “ Series of Requisitions presented to me by the Nabob, to whom I was happy in the Occasion of making such a Return, for the uncommon Inffiance of “ Fidelity and Attachment which he has recently “ lhewn to our Government, by an instant and unqua-lifted Assent to each Article. This was done verbally in his Presence; and in like Manner I requelled and obtained his Acquiescence in the shorc “ Condition which followed mine. I considered the “ Subjects of his Requests as essential to the Reputatien of our Government, and no left to our Interest than his and, if the Resident performs his Duty in *{ the Execution of my Instructions, the'Nabob’s Part “ of the Engagement, by a Angular Inversion of their <c Purposes in both Instances, will prove of still greater “ Benefit to him than to our Government, on whose “ Behalf it was exacted.”

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he knew, or had heard, at or before the Time of executing the said Treaty, that the said Vizier considered the said last-mentioned Article to be such as in the said Eleventh Article of Impeachment is stated neither did the said Vizier, to the Knowledge of the said Warren Hajlings, withhold his Assent from the same, or decline to put his Seal thereto. And the said Warren tings further denies, that any Person or Persons had Authority from him to give the said Nabob such Af-furances as in the said Eleventh Article are stated; nor did the said Warren Hajlings hear or know, either be-

fore the Execution of the said Treaty, or at the Time Vox.. XLIII.

thereof, when the said Wdrren Hajlings admits he was present, that such Assurances were given. And the said Warren Hajlings, denying that he did ever meditate any perfidious Acts, fays* that on the Twenty-third of September, One thousand Seven hundred and

Eighty-one, he did write a Letter to Nathaniel dleton, Esquire, then Resident at the Court of the said Vizier, in which he gave certain Instructions for carrying the said Article of the Treaty of Chunar into Effect; but he denies that the said Letter did contain Directions, in the Terms, or to the Kffedt, in the said Eleventh Article of Impeachment stated. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that the said Nathaniel Middleton did, in sundry Instances, carry the said In-strudtions into Effect.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That the Mode of conducing the said Treaty, or the subsequent acting thereon, so far as the said Warren Hajlings was in any Manner concerned therein, was of the Nature, or had the Tendency, stated in the said Eleventh Article.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That he did ever destroy, or conceal, or withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the Court of Directors, the original Papers and Documents, on the Matter of which the said Treaty was made, or the Original Treaty itself.

'TWELFTH ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Twelfth Article, the said Warrerl Hajlings fays, That in or about the Month of ber, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-five, in consequence of a Lettfcr received at the Board from John Brijtow, Esquire, then Resident at the Court of the Nabob Viiief, communicating a Request from the said Nabob to be furnished with Eng* lish Officers to Six Battalions of Sepoys, as well as with a Corps of Artillery and Cavalry in Proportion* and containing various Reasons in favour of the said Measure, the Governor General arid Council, he the said Warren Hajlings being Governor General, did unanimously resolve to comply with the said Request, and to adopt a Plan propufed by General Clavering for the Formation and Regulation of Troops in the said Vizier’s Service, and the Appointment of British Officers thereto agreeably to the said Request, of which Measure the said Vizier was duly informed. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that at the Time of the said Original Establishment, he neither was nor did pretend to be of Opinion that the Appointment of British Officers to Command the Troops of the said Nabob was in any Kefpedl a pernicious Measure; but he did entertain and declare an opposite Opinion, and did enter the same on the Consultations of the Board of Council. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that afterwards, that is to say, on or about the Fifth Day of May, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-seven, on submitting to the Board a Plan for a different Military Establishment, he did state his Opinion, that certain Evils had been found by Experience to result from the said Establishment, made in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-five. And the said Warren Hajli7igs further fays, that on or about Twenty-fourth September, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-seven, Application was made to the said( Board by the said Nabob Vizier, Hating that he had determined to keep on Foot Three Battalions, Part of a Force of Twelve Battalions then serving under the Command of Colonel Goddard, and which he had before proposed to have disbanded, for the Purpose of collecting the Revenue, and requesting that Major Hanncy, with Two or Three Officers, might be sent to take Charge of the aforesaid Battalions. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that the Board did unanimously resolve to comply with the said Request;

Measure was originally brought forward, he did pro-

pose in Council that the Recommendation Should be AND the said Warren Hajlings, in Answer to the repeated to the said Nabob, and the Resident ordered Thirteenth Article, admits, That he was bound fub* to support it. And the said Warren Hajlings further ftantially, and with good Faith, to obey the Orders of fays, that the said Proposal being taken into Confide- the Court of Directors of the East India Company; ration at the said Board, Richard Barwell, Esquire, but the said Warren Hajlings denies, that any such pro-then a Member of the said Board, did intirely approve hibitory Orders respecting Military Officers were given thereof, and Edward Wheler, Esquire, then also a by the said Court of Directors, as in the said Article Member of the said Council, did express himself as arp fitted. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that follows: “ I think the additional Reasons now urged there did exist a Treaty of Alliance oll'cnfive and deby the Governor (meaning the said Warren Haf- fenfive, between the said Nabob Vizier and the East “ tings) for raising a Corps of Infantry, may, with India Company; but he denies, that the Dominions of Propriety, be represented by Mr. Middleton to the the said Nabob were in a State of Dependance on the “ Vizier; as he has already rejected the former Pro- said Company, or those who exercised their Authoposition, I think it should be left entirely to his rity. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that the said “ Discretion whether to carry the present into Exe- Company had an Interest in the Prosperity of the “ cution or not;” and Philip Francis, Esquire, also a Territories of the said Nabob of , and in that of \ Member of the said Council, did express himself as the Provinces immediately under their Jurisdiction; follows: “ As Mr. Middleton informs us, the Nabob and that the said Warren Hajlings was bound to attend “ has thought proper to reject the Plan altogether, I thereto, and to abstain from any Act which had a “ think there would be an Impropriety in our pres- Tendency to the Prejudice thereof: But denying that sing him to adopt it.” And the said Warren Haf- he entertained any such Intentions and Views as are tings further fays, that it was agreed by the said Board in the said Thirteenth Article stated; or that he did to write again to the said Nabob in Recommendation by his own Influence and Power establish the Corps of the said Plan, stating the additional Arguments in under Lieutenant Colonel Hannay, in the said Nabob favour of it; and further, that a Letter should be Vizier’s Service, or did in any Manner originally ap-written to the said Middleton to support the said Re- point or introduce the said Hannay to that Service; commendation by such Arguments in support of it as the said Warren Hajlings fays, that the said Lieutenant might tend to insure its Success; which being accord- Colonel Hannay was permitted to enter into the said ingly done, the said Vizier did agree to adopt the said Vizier’s Service, in consequence of a particular Re-Plan. And the said Warren Hajlings denies the same quest contained in a Letter received from the Vizier to have been iniquitous, without Colour, or oppressive, on the First of June, One thousand Seven hundred and or that in all or any of the Matters aforesaid, he did Seventy-seven, wherein the said Vizier did express act contrary to his Duty or his Conscience, or against himself as follows: Major Hannay is a Gentleman his Opinion of what was conducive to the Good of the “ of great Understanding, Worth, Quickness of Con-Service. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, <( ception, and nice Penetration, and one of the old that the Governor General and Council were inform- “ Friends of the late Nabob, who, being acquainted ed, that the actual Expence of the Company’s tempo- “ with his Abilities, had the highest Regard for him; rary Brigade, and the Charge of the aforesaid Corps in “ as he is moreover a Gentleman very much in my the Service of the Vizier, under the Command of Bri- “ Favour, I am very desirous of having him with me,

“ as

as the intimate and inseparable Union which fubfills between us makes us desirous, on every Occa-tf fion, of giving Pleasure to each other j I therefore take the Liberty of requesting, that, avoiding all Appearance of Distinttion between us, you will “ permit Major Hannay to repair to me, and continue with me.” And the said Warren fays, that

in another Letter received from the said Vizier on the First of September, One thousand Seven hundred and

Seventy-seven, is contained as follows: Three of the Twelve Battalions under Colonel “ which I proposed to have disbanded, I have now determined to keep on foot, for the Purpose of colletting the Amount of the Tunkas to the These I have placed under the Orders of Mr. Middie ton; but as it will be necessary that an Officer be te appointed to the Command of them, I have fixed “ my Choice on Major Hannay, an Officer of Expe-4C rience and Abilities, to whom I am desirous of giv-c ing the Command of these Battalions. As our Affairs are inseparably connetted, I apply to you,

“ without Ceremony, to request that you will give “ your {Approbation to my Choice, and will lend Major Hannay, with Two or Three other Officers,

to the Charge of the aforesaid Battalions.” And the said Warren Hafiings further fays, that the Gover-

nor General and Council did afterwards, in compliance with the said Rcquests, unanimously resolve to permit the said Hannay to proceed to , and to enter into the said Nabob’s Military Service there: And that after the Arrival of the said Hannay, the said Vizier, in a Letter received from him on the Twenty-' second of December, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-seven, did express himself, amongst: other Things, to the Effett: following: “ As Major Hannay is a good and experienced Officer, of greac Bra- very and Condutt, I regard him in the Light of a sincere Friend. Your Compliance with my Request tr in fending him to me, is a striking Proof of the “ Warmth of your Friendship. His Arrival has ct given me the most sincere Pleasure; and I am convinced that the Business I shall put into his *c Hands will prosper.”

And the said Warren Hafiin denies that he did at any Time recommend the said Hannay to the Farms or Collettion of Revenue of the said Provinces in the Dominions of the said Nabob of Oude, called Baraitcb and Goruckpore, or that he did procure him to be appointed thereto: But the said Warren Hafiings has been informed that the said Hannay was appointed thereto by the said Vizier, and that such Appointment was by him the said Vizier made of his own Accord: But the said Warren Hafiings denies that the Appointment in question was of such Nature, or pro-duttive of such Consequences, as are suggested in the said Article. And the said Warren Hafiings fays, that he does not know nor believe that the said Hannay made such Use of his Power as is stated in the said Article. And the said Warren Hafiings fays, he believes that the said Nabob did remove the said Hannay from his said Appointment, and did afterwards restore him thereto: But the said Warren Hafiings denies that he did procure both or either of those Measures; or that he did ever obtrude the said Hannay into the Management of the said Nabob’s Revenues -, or that he had any sufficient Reason to believe that the Power of the said Hannay was exorbitant, or that the said Hannay had been guilry of any Abufc of Power. And the said Warren Hafiings admits that he did on the Twenty-sixth of April, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty, write a Letter to the said Nabob, expressing, amongst other Things, his Satisfaction at his Restoration of the said Hannay to the Employment with which the said Nabob had formerly invested him; that he esteemed this as a Mark of the said Nabob’s Attention to his original Recommendation :” But $

the said Warren Hafiings denies that he originally} or in any other Manner, recommended the said Hannay to the Service of the said Nabob, than as herein is before stated. And the said Warren Hafiings did in the same Letter, to which he craves Leave to refer, tell the said Nabob nearly to the Effett, but nor in the Terms, stated in the said Article. And the said tings denies that the said Letter, was of such Nature or Tendency as in the said Thirteenth Article is stated i or that the same was in any Manner improper; or that any former Complaints respetting the said Hannay had ever been made to the said Warren tings or that the said Warren Hafiings was in relpett: of the Matters aforesaid guilty of any Breach of Duty whatsoever. And the said Warren Hafiings fays, that the said Vizier did, about the latter End of the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, make Complaints, through the then Resident at Oude, to the Governor General and Council, the said Warren HaJ-tings being Governor General, to the Effett: stated in the said Article; and which the said Warren Hastings admits to have included the Corps under the said Hannay and Ojborne, and certain other Corps. And the said Vizier did further represent, that in that “ distressed State of his Affairs it was just and requi-<c site that Mr. Hafiings and General Sir Eyre Coote, “ and the Supreme Council, should give himRelief;” and that " he could not that Year pofiibly provide for *c the new Brigade at Futty , the Corps of Horse, and other detached Bodies of Troops in his Coun- try.” And the said Warren Hafiings fays, that he did not ever declare that the Request made or supposed to be made on this Occasion, for the Dismission of these particular Corps, was totally inadmissible: But he fays, that the Objection made by him the said Warren Hafiings, was made to the Demand of the said Vizier, considering the same as one entire Proposition, and which the said Warren Hafiings did then consider, and yet considers, as made at such a Season, and in such a Manner, as well justified such Refusal to comply therewith, as is contained in the Letter written by the said Warren Hafiings in Answer thereto, under the Direction, and with the immediate Approbation, of the Board; and to which Letter, and to the Proceedings of the Board upon that Occasion, as well for the Reasons inducing such Refusal as for the Terms in which the same is expressed, the said Warren Haf-tings craves Leave to refer. And the said Warren Hafiings denies that the said Corps, or any other Corps Rationed in the Vizier’s Country, had no Concern with Foreign Wars, or that they were solely employed in the Collettions; although he admits that they were generally so employed. And he fays, that although the Native Soldiers, of which such Corps confided, had no Concern with the Company’s Establishment, nor were to return thereto yffien discharged from the Nabob’s Pay, yet he avers that the Company had on several Accounts a material Interest and Concern in the Time and Manner of the Discharge of such Corps. And the said Warren Hafiings fays, that he did on the Thirteenth of December, One thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-nine, by his Minute of that Date, propose that a Letter should be written to Mr. Purling, then Resident at Oude, which, if agreed to, might serve as the Substance of one to be written on the same Subject to the Nabob, and in which Letter he did amongst other Things propose to date, that “ the Application “ of the Vizier gave Cause for the most alarming " Suspicions, since he could not be ignorant that the Mabrattas, the Enemies of the Company, and the " ancient Enemies of his Government and Family, “ were in Arms, and a War unavoidable: That at “ such a Juntture a Proposal for disbanding any Part of his forces could not fail to enepurage them to attack his Dominions: That the Advice of his Ministers, who had instigated him to make the said

I seized an advantageous Opportu-bob by Order of the Board. And he further fays, “ nity (attacked) and killed Seventeen of the Enemy that he did in his Minute bf the Fifteenth of the u oh the Bastion, and wounded several others. About said Month, state, amongst other Things, “ that he “ Half after Ten at Night they made an Attack upon “ Was inclined to bring to Punishment, if his In- “ the Western Bastion; as there was a Straw Chupper “ ftuence could produce that Effect, those Incendia- uon that Bastion, I took Shelter under it, and threw “ aries, Who had endeavoured to make themselves the “ down with all my Force a Part of the Erick BartleInstruments of Division between the Nabob and “ ment on the Enemy, by which Four of them were “ the Company :” But he denies that the fame, or “ killed.

A Third Time, about Three o’Clocic rify the Nabob or his Ministers, or any other Per- “ in the Morning, the Country People raised a great fons, from Representations on this or any other Sub- “ Shout, and attacked us again; I was then engaged jest affecting the Nabob's Revenues, or the Wei- “ on the Inner Fort Bastion; Havildar was

I gave him Orders tlannay to the Charge of any Provincial Colle<£tions; “ to put them all to the Sword; he instantly struck.

From the Fastern to by the Persons, or under the Circumstances, stated in “ the Western Gates within the Mahul, they fur-the said Article.

We continued engaged for Five tien were ever committed or occasioned by any Per- “ Pahr (Fifteen Hours) with the Enemy, without fons whatsoever, that the same or any Part thereof was “ tailing either Food or Water.” And the said -committed or occasioned by any Support or Counte- ren Hajlings fays, that the said Deposition did further nance directly or indirectly derived from him the said contain as follows: “ I wrote an Account of the Warren Hajlings. And the said Warren Hajlings fays “ Whole of this Affair to Colonel Hannay and Cap-that he does not know or believe that the said Hannay “ tain; after a few Days an Order came from

The Order is not writ-fition made by one Allahd Sing, a Native Officer Com- “ ten to me, I will write to the Colonel on the Sub-manding the Fort of Goruckpcor,at the Time it was “ jedt.” And the said fays, that it fur-

attacked, as hereinafter mentioned, which Deposition ther appeared by the said Deposition, that Orders were was made soon after the Insurrection at Benares, in the afterwards given that the Head of the said Monlh of November, One thousand Seven hundred and Khan should be struck off, and that he was beheaded ac-Eighty-one, and, amongst other Things, contained cordingly; and that a Proclamation was made tnrough as follows: “ I had confined, under my Guard, at the Town, that those who were guilty of such Crimes

to

to make an Enquiry into the Conduct of the said Hannay, relative to any of the Particulars above stated. And the said Warren Hastings fays, that no Complaints of the Mother or Grandmother of the said Nabob of Oude, concerning any Misbehvaiour of the said or Captain Gordon,if any such were ever in Fact made,

ever came to the Knowledge of him the said Warren Hajlings whilst he continued to be Governor General. And the said Warren Hastings denies that he ever knew of any Application of the said Hannay to the said Vi* zier, if indeed the said Ilannay did again apply to the Vizier, for the Farm of Baraitcb and .

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he has lince heard that a Report did, in Fadt, prevail, that the said Hannay was about to return to Oude; and the said Warren Hajlings fays, that the Vizier did, as he apprehends, in Consequence of such Report, or of some Intelligence to that Effect, write a. Letter to him the said Warren Hajlings, which was received by him on the Fifteenth of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two-, containing such ExprefTions as are stated in the said Thirteenth Article: But the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he was, at the Time of the receiving that Letter, and before, and for several Weeks afterwards, confined by a long and dangerous Illness j and that, although no Answer was returned by him to the said Letter, until the Thirtieth of December following, yet he humbly submits, that any more immediate Answer thereto became unntcessary by the Death of Colonel Hannay, which happened early in September, and before the Letter of the said Nabob was received by him the said Warren Hajlings. And the said Warren Haftingsdenies that there was any sufficient or reasonable Ground for the Vizier, or for any other Person, to be allured, or to suppose, that the Death of the said Hannay alone prevented his being again employed in Oude. And the said Hajlings

further denies that he, at any Time subsequent to the Treaty of Chunar, ever meant or intended that the said Hannay should return to Oude. And the said ren Hajlings denies, that in all or any of the several supposed Acts or Negledts, in the said Thirteenth Article charged against him, he was guilty of any Breach of Duty whatsoever, or that in respect of all or any of the several Matters in the said Article mentioned, he was guilty of any Breach of Duty whatsoever, or has been the Cause of Damage to the Country of Oude, of any Breach of his Trull; or that he did, in any Respect, dishonour the Name or Character of this Nation; or that he has been guilty of any Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

FOURTEENTH ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Fourteenth Article, the said Warren Hajlings, denying that the Nabob Vizier had any Reason to entertain, or did in Fadt entertain, any Apprehension from the said Warren Hastings,relative to the Security of

his own Person, or the Stability of his own Situation, or that he the said Warren Hastings was guilty of any Malice or Corruption, or that any Bribe was by the said Nabob Vizier ever given to the said Warren Hastings, or that the said Warren Hastings did, in any Instance, treat the said Nabob Vizier with Inhumanity, Perfidy, or Rigour; and denying also that the said Nabob had any such Cause of Apprehension or Alarm as in the said Fourteenth Article is stated, fays. That the said Resident Middleton did, in a Letter bearing Date the Seventeenth October, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-one, transmit to the said Warren Hastings certain Extracts of Letters from Lieutenant Colonel Hannay, expressing the Suspicions of the said Hannay respecting the Attachment of the said Nabob Vizier; and that, at the Instance of the said Warren Hastings, certain Affidavits were made before Sir Elijah Impey, Vol. XLIII.

His Majesty’s Chief Justice (but'not acting in such Capacity, as in the said Fourteenth Article is fug-gefted) tending to criminate certain Relations of the said Nabob Vizier; the said Warren Hastings, however, denies that he was, in any Manner, criminal in respect of the taking of the said Affidavits. And the said Warren Hastings, denying also that, to hi? Knowledge, the said Nabob Vizier did fall into such State of Mind, as in the said Fourteenth Article is set forth, admits. That he the said Warren Hastings was informed that, in the Month of February, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, the said Nabob Vizier had expressed a Desire, to the said Resident Middleton, to make him the said Warren Hastings a Present of Ten Lacks of Rupees, subject to his the said Warren Hastings' Consent to, and Acceptance of, the fame! But the said Warren Hastings denies, that he did ever consent, or entertain any Intention of consenting, to accept the fame. And he fays, that he has been informed, and believes, that Assignments on the Revenue had been given by the said Vizier to the said Middleton, prior to the aforesaid Offer, for the Purpose of discharging, out of the Produce thereof, the Debt due from the said Vizier to the said Company; but he believes, that no specific Assignments, or any other Se- curity, or Bill, were, at any Time, given by the said Vizier for the Payment of the said intended Present. And the said Warren Hastings denies, that any Letter from the said Middleton to the said Warren Hastings, or any Letter from the said Warren Hastings to the said Mh/<//r/<w/prelative to the said Present, has been,' against Law or his Duty, or for any base, clandestine, or corrupt Purpose, by him suppressed. And he avers, that he did, very soon after receiving Intelligence of the said Design of the said Nabob, communicate what he the said Warren Hastings knew, or had heard, relating to the said intended Present, to the Members of the Supreme Council; and did, at the same Time, declare his Intentions relative thereto, as hereinafter explained. And the said Warren denies, that

he was guilty of any Neglect or Misconduct, in respect of the said Transactions, or that from any Part of the Conduit of the said Warren Hastings therein, either the said Middleton, or any other Person, could be taught to consider the Receipt of Bribes as a Matter which might bring no Danger or Discredit to them. And. the said Warren Hastings denies that no Notice was taken of the said Transaction, or any Document concerning the same produced, to the Members of the Council General, by the said Warren Hajlings, until the Month of July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three; on the contrary, the said HaJ-

tings fays, that although no Entry was made on the Consultations respecting the fame, prior to that Period, yet the said Tranladtions, and all the Particulars relative thereto, were, very soon after the said Warren Hastings was acquainted therewith, and long before the Time mentioned in the said Article, communicated to the then Members of the Supreme Council; and Instructions touching the same were, with their Privity and Consent, prepared and given, as hereinafter mentioned. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that, by Order of the Board of Council, Richard JohnJon, Esquire, who, in the Month of ,

One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, had been recalled from Lucknow, was, in the Month of June, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, required to make his Defence as to certain Articles of Charge which had been, by the said Board, preferred against him, One of which Articles was in the following Terms; for fending repeatedly to the Vizier, and to his Minister, Uyder Beg to advise them

against transferring the Ten Lacks of Rupees, intended as a Present to the Governor General, so the Company’s Account; as it would be a Precedent for further Demands, which, if the Vizier did not refill T in

70 5 0 Decembris.A, 1787,

in the first Instance, this Government would never ccafe to harrass him for Money. In Answer to which Article of Charge, the said Richard did state

as follows: “ The Act and Intention, as far as I “ should limit them in admitting myself the Cause of preventing the Ten Lacks mentioned from being, t( at that Time, paid to the Company, are true; the “ Reasons assigned for such Prevention, left the said “ Nabob should be again harrafled, &c. are the'Minifter’s own Words and Objections made to me, “ transferred into my Mouth. The Mode also, by “ Message, is likewise misrepresented; but that is “ immaterial; suffice it for me to explain the Act. I “ acknowledge Fifty Lacks were due in Balance; all “ the Nabob’s Resources not promising to prove “ equal to discharge this Balance, a new Claim was, “ at this same Instant, made of Eighty-two Lacks; “ the Resources in my Hands, the foie Fund existing “ to answer both the Means, unequal to this End, the Question remained^which of the Two Claims, the “ new or the old, should be first paid. I did not hefitate one Instant to declare, that if any of the Assets placed in my Hands should be attempted to be u estranged from the Purposes for which they were “ assigned, I should declare it to be a Breach of “ Treaty: They were to discharge the Balances of Years, the foie Object of the late Treaty, and all “ the Measures connected with it had the single Point “ for their End. Could I, deeply pledged for the “ Fulfilment of the Treaty, subscribe to the total “ Subvcrfion of these Measures, at the very Moment “ of their Completion, in the Termination of the 4t Year prescribed and allotted for their Operation ? “ I could not, I ought not; therefore I thus obstructed the Whole of Course; the Parts of that Whole ,c for the Reasons above assigned, and no other what- ever. Whether such Preference, so given to a previous Claim, was criminal or meritorious, rests “ with the Honourable Board to declare, when they " recollect that retarding neither expunges or diminifties a Claim. Permit me here to subjoin: Had ct the Ten Lacks been uninvolved with the Seventy- two, or had the aggregate Sum not been required within the Period left for liquidating the Balances intruded to me, or had not the Assets lodged in my Hands for this Purpose been the foie Funds from “ which such Payments could be attempted, so far “ from impeding, even for a Moment, such a Claim, “ I should have been the first to support and urge it to ,ec its Completion.”

And the said Warren HaJUn fays, That in his Observations on the said Answer, deliver,ed in 'Council on the Twenty-first October, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, he did afiert as follows:

“ I am morally certain, that Zaidads or Assets of Ten <c Lacks* either in Assignments of Lands ot in Bills, had been prepared, and were in the Charge or Possession of Mr. Middletonbefore Mr. Palmer's “ Arrival, and left with Mr. on Mr.

“ ten's Departure; that this Sum was declaredly given

“ for my Use, but never accepted by me; the only “ Advantage 1 made of the Offer was, to request the Nabob to transfer it, with the Obligation still resting with equal Weight upon my Gratitude, for the original Destination of it, to the Company, for the “ Relief of their pressing Necessities: The Rectitude “ of this Transaction depends essentially upon Principies which every Man feels and acknowledges in w his own Bread, but can hardly be judged by the “ Test of any Official Rule. It might indeed have "added to the Company’s Claims on the Nabob, but <c I am not sorry that Mr. chose to defeat my

“ Intentions, since it would have added to the Nabob's Distresses, but with no immediate Relief to the Company; if in his own Bread he could view thefecret Motives of this Tra/ilaftion, and on their

“ Testimony approve, I also acquit him, as 1 do acquit him, of the Charge on public Ground.” And the said Warren HaJUngs fays, that John

Esquire, a Member of the Supreme Council, in his Oblcrvations on the Answer of the said Richard ,

did declare with respect to the aforesaid Charge, thac as the Transaction was dated in September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, when Mr.

Jon was ordered to quit his Station, he considered it as equally injurious to the Wilhes of the Governor General, and replete with Infidelity on the Part of Mr. Johnson to his Employers; that it remained still to be cleared up between Mr. Jobnf and Hyder Beg Ca'ion; and he declared that he had understood at the Time, that the Ten Lacks were in Bills, and not a mere Offer to pay such a Sum from the future Revenues of the Country.

And the said Warren HaJUng denies. That in concurring in the Enquiry into the Conduct of the said Mr. Johnson, the said Warren HaJUngs had any such

Object, or entertained any such Intention, as are in the said Fourteenth Article in that Behalf let forth, or that he made any Declaration respecting the said Charge, other than what is herein before stated, or that he did suddenly, or in any Manner, put an End to the said Enquiry: But, on the contrary, the said Warren HaJUngs fays, that such Enquiry was publickly prosecuted by the Board of Council, in such Manner as to them ieenied right; nor was the said Enquiry concluded till after every previous Step had been taken, which the said Board thought necessary for the Formation of their Judgment thereon; nor till after the Opinion and Determination of every Member of Council had been regularly and finally pronounced upon the said Charges. And the said Warren HaJUngs admits, that he was of Opinion, and did accordingly declare, that some of the Charges agiinft the said chard Johnson were proved; but the final Determination of the said Board relative thereto, was, that upon the whole, although they considered the Conduct of the said Richard Johnson blameable in several Instances, jet they were also of Opinion, that he had been sufficiently punished by the Deprivation of the Office which he had held, and by the sudden Manner in which the Complaints and Evidence then before them, induced them to call him to the Presidency.

And the said Warren HaJUngs fays. That afterwards, in the Month of January,. One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, the Governor General and Council, he the said Warren HaJUngs being Governor General, did, on his Recommendation, unanimously appoint the said Richard Johnson to be Resident at the Court of the Nizam, conceiving him to be duly qualified for that Employment.

And the said Warren HaJUngs admits, That the said Board did not examine the said Nathaniel ,

in respect: to the aforesaid Charge against the said Richard Johnson; and that the said Nathaniel Middleton was at the Time of the said Enquiry at his own Conduct: being then a Subject of Enquiry, before the said Board, upon Accusations preferred against him by the said Warren HaJUngs, for sundry Misdemeanors charged to have been committed by the said Middleton during his aforesaid Residency ac Lucknow. But the said Warren Ilaftings denies thac he the said Warren Ilaftings in any Manner avoided such Examination, or that he said or did any Thing to prevent the fame.

And the said Warren Ilaftings fays. That he had no Concern directly or indirectly with the said Alignments, otherwise than as herein before Hated: But he has heatd and believes that regular Accounts were kept of all the Alignments which were made by the said Vizier to the said Middleton; and that the Produce of the said Alignments was regularly carried to the public Account of the said Vizier with the East India

Company.

Company. And the said JVarren denies that

the said Assignments must have been, or that to his Knowledge or Belief they were, madO for any secret criminal Purpose, or that the Money received therefrom must have been, or to his Knowledge or Belief was, so applied.

And the said Warren Hr./lings fays. That after having been informed of the aforesaid Offer made by the said Vizier of the said Ten Lacks of Rupees, he the said Warren Hajlings did in the Month of One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, with the Privity and Approbation of the Members of the Supreme Council, depute Major , and Major

Davy as the Assistant of the said Major to

the said Nabob Vizier, with written Instructions, in which, amongst other Things, the said Major Palmer was directed in the Words following: “ The Nabob Vizier having by an Intimation made to Mr.

“ dleton, in the Month of February last, been pleased u tq express his Desire to make me a Present of Ten

<c Lacks of Rupees, and requested my previous Con-tc sent and Acceptance of the fame, I detire you will make my Acknowledgment in proper Terms for “ this Instance of his Liberality and Benevolence, and acquaint him that I am precluded from accepting it by many Conditions, but by One efpedaily, which I beg him to take in good Part, namely, that if I had received it at the Time in t{ which the Tender of it was made, it would have “ been liable to Constructions even in his Breast, so “ repugnant to the distnterefted Friendship which I <l profess and bear towards him, that no Considera-rt tien of Personal Profit could have induced me to accept it at such Hazard. If he should renew the Offer to you, you will inform him that my Objec-<c tien remains the fame, and is insuperable j but that if he will be pleased to transfer it to the Company “ for the Relief of their present and known Diffreffes, “ I will accept of it on their Behalf with a Thank- fulness equal to that which I Should have felt and expressed for the Gift had it been made to myself, the Wants of the Company being at this Time of equal Concern to me as my own. Let him understand this Subject rightly, and he will fee in my Refusal, thus qualified, the most convincing Proofs u of my Friendship for him, and a Regard for his u Interest.”

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That the said Major Palmer and Major Davy, having proceeded to Lucknow on the said Agency, and having, in pursuance of the said Instructions, made such Application to the said Nabob Vizier as is therein directed relative to the said Ten Lacks, the said Nabob Vizier did write a Letter, bearing Date Twenty-third One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, to the said Warren Hajlings, in which, after mentioning the Application made to him by the said Major and

Major Daiy respetting the said Ten Lacks of Rupees, the said Vizier did refer, for his Answer thereto, to a I.etter he had written to the said Major Palmer. And the said JVarren Ilafings fays, that the said Letter from

the said Nabob Vizier to the said Major so

referred to, is in the Words following:

“ On the Subject of Ten Lacks of Rupees, you u repeatedly have said that the Nawab Governor’s u Pleasure is, that I Should give them for the Expences of the Company’s Sircar. The Nawab Go-tc vernor’s Will is binding upon me. I can make no “ Excuses. Take Ten Lacks of Rupees for the Expence of the Company’s Sircar; but you have said, “ that if I am willing to alTill: the Affairs of the Com- pany’s Sircar, you will fulfil my Request agreeably u to the Paper. As the Nawab Governor’s Permis-<c fion is arrived with respect to the Two Points of f* which you have spoken, 1 agree to both of them,

“ and will give, for the Expenses of the Company’s “ Sircar, Ten Lacks of Rupees this Year, and Six “ Lacks of Rupees Yearly, in lieu of Regiments, “ upon Condition that I obtain my Request and Authority. It is proper that you adjull mv Reoucfts “ agreeably to a Paper upon which the Nawab G>vernor has given Orders, and restore me to the “ Management of every Concern.”

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That the said Nabob Vizier did, in and by his said Letter to the said Warren Hajlings, urge several Reasons for not furni/hing a Loan of Sixty Larks of Rupees, with which he was required to assist. the Com-

pany. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that it does not appear in the Correspondence between the said Vizier and the said Warren Hajlings, whether the said Vizier did or did not advance the said Ten'Lacks for the Use of the East India Company, as he was requested and had promised to do; nor does it appear whether or not any Answer was written immediately by the said ll 'arren Ilajlings to the Letter of the said Vizier. And the said Warren though he has no particular Recolledlion on the Subject, is induced to believe that he did not answer such Letter; as, in a Letter from the said Warren Hajlings to the said Nabob Vizier, dated Ninth September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, the said tings did state as follows: “ My late Illness has caused “ a Delay in fending the Answer to your several Letters. I am now, thank God, recovering; and have “ come a few Miles above Calcutta for the Change of “ Air upon the River.” And the said Warren Raftings fays, that he was, about that Time, attacked with a levere Illness, from which he did not recover for the Space of some Months. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, he believes that the aforesaid Letter from the Vizier to the said Warren Hajlings had been communicated to the several Members of the Supreme Council, and was deposited in the proper Office, and open for their Inspection at the Time of the aforesaid Enquiry; and the Contents thereof more fully known to every Member of the said Board. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that any Paper, relative to the Matters aforesaid, which it was his Duty to have produced, was ever suppressed or withheld by him, or that he had the least Desire to suppress or withhold from the other Members of the Supreme Council, or from the East India Company, the Whole or any Part of any Paper or Letter from the said Vizier

relative to the Matters aforesaid.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies. That he has purposely left the Evidence relative to the Matters aforesaid in a State of Contradiction or Obscurity, or that he has involved the same in Mystery, or that he has been guilty of any intentional Omillion relative thereto, or that he did or doth wilfully and criminally omit to produce or withhold the full Correspondence touching the fame, or any Part thereof, or of any Agents in the said Tran fact ions. And the said ren Hajlings avers, that the said Ten Lacks of Rupees, mentioned by the said Nabob Vizier in his aforesaid Letter to the said JVarren Iladings and the said Major Palmer, are the identical Stun offered to the said Nathaniel Middleton; and he lubmits, that it doth sufficicncly appear to be so. And the said ll'arren Hajlings, admitting that a Governor General is bound to take Care, so far as in him lies, that the Management and Accounts of the East Company’s Revenues entrusted to his Care, or whatever may affect the fame, mediately or immediately, Should be kept in a Manner clear, open, and tl ill met; and that a Governor General is also bound to the Obffr-vance of such other Points of Duty as are in the laid Fourteenth Article in that Behalf let forth; denies, that he has in any Manner deviated therefrom , or

i 5° Decembris. 1787.

or that he has been guilty of any of the Criminal Ats, Offences, or Miscondut in the said Fourteenth Article charged, or that the Whole, or any Part of the Conduit ol the said Warren in the Matters in the said Fourteenth Article mentioned, was of i'uch Nature, or had I'uch Tendency or Effet, or was calculated to produce such Elicit, as in the said Article is let Lrth.

FIFTEENTH ARTICLE.

I N Answ’er to the Fifteenth Article, the said yen 1 ladings, denying that he did entertain any such Opinions, Views, or Motives, as are therein stated, and craving Leave to refer to the Answers he has already made to such the Allegations therein contained as have been by him already answered, fays, That in or about the Month of MarcOne thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, an Account was made up at the Presidcncy of Fort William, by William El quire, the Accountant General to the East India Company at the said Presidency, in the Course of his Official Duty $ in which Account were contained certain Articles of Charge upon the said Vizier, which the said Nabob was justly liable to pay, and which did amount to about the Sum of Four hundred thousand Pounds; and the said Account having been transmitted by Order of the Board of Council to Nathaniel Middleton, Esquire, then Resident at Luck-

now, the same was submitted to the Examination of the proper Officers of the said Nabob; and having been examined by them, the Articles of Charge on the Nabob were allowed, but certain Counter-claims were set up on the Part of the Nabob.

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That the said Counter-claims being communicated to the Governor General and Council, were duly investigated, and the said Accounts were afterwards settled, and the exact Balance due to the said Company ascertained. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he did, as his Duty required, demand Payment of the Amount of the Debt which was justly due to the said Company from the said Nabob; and he denies that he took any Means to recover the fame, or pursued any Conduit in respect thereto, contrary to, or inconsistent with, his Duty.

And the said Warren Hajl fays, That the Debt due from the said Vizier to the Company did, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, amount to a considerable Sum of Money; and that, in order to discharge the fame, the said Governor General and Council were informed by the said Bris-tow, that the said Nabob had borrowed Money at the usual Interest of his Country; but he denies that the said Debt had been occasioned by enforcing any un-jult Demands made on the Part of the Company, or any Persons in their Employ; and he denies that any such were made or enforced.

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That having quitted India on the Eirft February, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-five, he cannot, from his own Knowledge, set forth the State of the Account between the said Company and the said Nabob since that Period; but he does not believe that such Consequences did arise from the Company’s Demands on the said Nabob, affeefting his Country and Government, as in the said Article are ftaced; and he denies that the said Demands were brought forward with any such Views as are therein set forth.

And the said Warren Hajlings craving Leave to refer to the Answer he has already made in respect to the Deputation to Lucknow of Major Palmer and Major Davy, in the said Article mentioned, denies that he ever did authorize or instrutft the said Major Pal-

mer or the said Major Davy to make any such Demand of a Loan from the said Vizier as in the said Article is stated; but he fays he did instrueft the said Major Palmer as follows: “ I desire you to endeavour to obtain from the Ministers, and from “ such Sums of Money as they can spare from their “ own Means, or raise by their Credit upon Loan, “ for the Service of the Company. To effect this, “ it will be necessary to convince them, that they will be no Losers by it, but that on the contrary their Property will acquire a Security from being lodged “ in the Company’s Funds. Explain to them the “ Nature of the Company’s Interest, Notes, and the of Means of Credit by which they pass in Circulation, <c and are transferable from the original to other fuc-<c cefiive Proprietors, so as to give them a just Idea “ of the Tenure and of the equal Footing on which. “ Native, Alien, and British Proprietors stand in Pof-" session of them. At the same Time it will be proper to apprize them of the Fluctuation of their <c current Value, which it would be criminal to suppress. You may assure them that when Peace is “ restored to our Establishment, and our Expences fc are consequently diminished, the Debt will be gradually paid off, as a former Debt contracted before “ my Appointment to the Government, to a much “ larger Amount, was discharged in the Course of t( Two Years within your own Remembrance; and that “ the estimated Value of the Notes will rife to the “ Rates of their specific Sums, and even above them, “ on the Prospect of Payment; so that the Proprie- tors will be subjected to no Loss, unless they “ shall chuse to part with their Property in the “ Notes during the intermediate Times of our Inability to discharge them, the Annual Interest due “ in the Interval being duly and punctually paid. I “ have no Doubt of their Fidelity, but it can be no of way so strongly shewn, nor the Company’s Support “ of them be so strongly engaged, as by the Assist-u ance required.” And with respect to the Demand charged in the said Articles to have been made. That the said Vizier Should take Four Battalions of the Company’s Troops into his Pay for the Collection of his Revenue, the said Warren Hajlings fays, that. Application having been made in or about the Month of March, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, by the said Vizier to the Governor General and Council, for certain Troops to be Rationed for the Defence of the Nabob’s internal Dominions, and no specific Answer having been given to the said Application, the said Major Palmer was instructed to confer with the Nabob on the said Subject, who then expressing an Unwillingness to have the said Measure carried into Execution, it was immediately abandoned.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That he never did falsely or evafively deny, or endeavour to explain away, any Share he actually had in the above Proceedings; and he denies that he was ever guilty of any Falsehood or Evasion on the Subject.

And he admits. That he did not call the said Major Palmer, or the said Major Davy, to account

for their Condut in the Transactions aforesaid, believing the n, as he now does, that they had not done any At which made it incumbent upon him so to do.

SIXTEENTFI ARTICLE.

I N Answer to the Sixteenth Article, the said Warren Hajlings, denying that he did ever entertain any such Design, or was atuated by any such Motive, or was guilty of any such Criminal Ats as are, in the Introdution to the said Article, stated, fays. That Almas AH Khan, therein mentioned, did farm con* § siderable

a 8 Geo* III. 50 Decembris. 73

siderable Districts in the Dominions of the Nabob of Oudey and was a Person of great Influence and Power therein. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that at various Times, previous to the Twenty-third of October, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, he had received Information, which he believed to be true, that the said Almas Alt Khan was at the Head of a considerable and powerful Force, at a Time when the Dominions of the Nabob were also, in other Respects, in great Disorder and Confusion, and that he was in a State of Rebellion, and had retreated with the said Force, and a considerable Treasure, to the Confines of the said Dominions. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he made a Representation to the Minister of the said Vizier, concerning the said Conduct of the said Almas Alt Khan, and that the Vackeel of the said Vizier did receive, at Calcutta, a Perw&nnah, purporting to have been sent by the said Vizier, the Contents of which were communicated to him the said Warren Hajlings, and which repre-fented the Information before received by the said Warren Hajlings, touching the said Almas Ali Khan, to be false and without Foundation: But the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he had, at that Time, good Reason to believe the Contents of the Perwan-nah itself to be, in this and other Respects, untrue. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that he was afterwards informed that the said Almas Ali Khan did return to the Capital of the said Vizier, under an Engagement for his Personal Safety, And the said Warren Hajlings Iurther fays, that on or about the Twenty-

third of Oblober, One thousand Seven hundred and

Eighty-two, being then absent from Calcutta for the Recovery of his Health, he did, in Consequence of a Reference made to him from the Board of Council, draw up certain Instructions for Esquire,

then Resident at the Court of Oude,. containing, amongst other Things, the following Paragraph i “ The Means by which Almas Ally Cawn has been permitted to acquire Independency have been long ,f seen, and the Effects of it foretold by every Person “ acquainted with the State of that Government, ex- cept those immediately interested in it. The late “ Resident has been his constant Advocate j and I lately understand that, however truly, the Minister “ disclaims all Concern in this imprudent Measure. It is very extraordinary that his Defection, his Re- treat to the Frontier, the subsequent Negociations “ which passed between him and the Nabob, the “ Engagements concluded between then?, which re* “ semble more a Treaty between equal States than a “ Transaction between a Sovereign. and his Vassal, “ have all -passed, without the leafbCommunication or Report of them made to me by the Resident, or “ his Aftistant, or the Minister; and in a Letter “ which I have lately received from the Nabob, the “ Minister has had the Presumption to make the “ Nabob declare the Whole to be false and without u Foundation, and to affirm that every Part of his Dominion enjoyed the most perfect Peace and “ Tranquillity. Upon this Subject the Behaviour of the Minister is so reprehensible, that 1 think it in-« cumbent upon me to let him know my Sentiments of it; it will at least Ihew him how thin the Veil “ is by which he covers his own Acts, and that such “ Artifices will only tend to make them the more €t Criminal, from the Falsehood and Duplicity with of which they are associated. As for Almas Ally Cawn “ himself, the Policy which has been observed towards him has been scandalously derogatory from “ the Nabob’s Dignity and Interest, and hurtful to “ the Reputation of our Government, as far as it is “ connedied with it. If any Engagement shall ac- tually sublist between them at the Time you have_ u Charge of the Residency, it must, however excep-« tionable, be faithfully observed; but if h? has been Vol XUII.

tf guilty of any Criminal Offened to the Nabob his “ Master, for which no Immunity is provided in the “ Engagement, or he shall break any one of the Con* “ ditions of it, I do most strictly enjoin you, and it tl must be your special Care, to endeavour, either by Force or Surprize, to secure his Person and bring “ him to Justice; by bringing him to Justice I mean,' u that you urge the Nabob, on due Conviction, to punish him with Death, as a necessary Example to “ deter others from the Commission of the like “ Crimes; nor must you desist, till this is effected. “ I cannot prescribe the Means; but, to guard my- self against that Obloquy to which I may be ex* “ posed by a forced Misconstrudtion of this Order by those who may hereafter be employed in searching our Records for Cavils and Informations against f< me, I think it proper to forbid, and protest against “ the Use of, any fraudulent Artifice or Treachery, " to accomplish the End which I have prescribed; “ and as you alone are privy to the Order, you will of course observe the strictest Secrecy, that it may not transpire; but I repeat my Recommendation of “ it as one of the first and most essential Duties of “ your Office.”

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That the said Instructions being laid before the Board Coun-: cil at Calcutta, for their Approval and Correction, they did unanimoully approve of the fame, and ordered that they should be copied fair, and dispatched to the said Brijlow, which was accordingly done. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that, at the Time the said Instructions were given, he knew of any such Engagement on the Part of the said Vizier with the said Almas Ali Khan, as in the said Sixteenth Article is Hated, or fhat the said Instructions to the said tow were of such Nature or Tendency, or that the Condudb of the said Warren Hajlings in respect thereof was such as in the said Sixteenth Article is. stated, or that he was in any Manner Criminal in respect thereof. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that the said Bristow did represent that he had not attempted to seize upon the Person/of the said Almas Ali Khan, declaring

that, inasmuch as the said Almas Ali Kban had returned to Lucknow, under a positive Engagement of Personal Safety, such a Measure would have been considered an Act of Treachery, and was therefore, as he the said Brijlow did also declare, peremptorily forbidden by the said Instructions. And the said tings fays, that the said Brijlow did afterwards transmit to the Board of Council sundry Complaints and Documents respecting such Subjects as are in the said Article stated; and the said Board did thereupon di-red! an Enquiry to be made as to the Truth thereof j and he admits, that he did, on the First of ,

One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, write a Letter to the said Almas Ali Khan, containing Expression of Favour and Protection, and gating, that he did not give Credit to the Accufarions against him t which Letter, he avers, was in the then State of Public Affairs proper and necessary. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that, after going to Lucknow, he did invest the said Almas Ali Khan with any Power whatever; but he fays that the said Almas Ali Khan was by the said Vizief continued in the same Authority as he had before possessed.

And the said Warren Hajlings believes it to be true, that previous to the Arrival of the said Warren HaJ-tings at Lucknow as aforesaid, the said Almas Ali Kban had held his Farms of Revenue from Year to Year; and the said Warren Hajlings fays, that some Time in the Month of July, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, the said Vizier did make a Settlement of his Country with his Aumeens or Collectors, and amongst the rest with the said Almas, for a Term of Five, and in some Instances, Six Years; but the said Warren Hajlings denies, that the said Settlement with

the said Almas was of such Nature as in the said Six- Subjects as might require his Assistance. And, as to teenth Article is stated: And he further fays, that a the supposed Salary and Emoluments stated in the said Sum of Money, amounting to Fifteen Lacks of Ru- Seventeenth Article to have been paid to Major Wil-pees, was afterwards, on the Suggestion of him the Ham Palmer therein mentioned, the said Warren said Warren Hastings, advanced by way of Loan to the tings fays that the fame, if any such were paid, were said Nabob Vizier by the said Almas, concerning which paid without the Knowledge, Privity, or Recommen-the said Warren Hastings did, in a Letter to the Court dation of him the said Warren Hastings. of Directors, dated the Thirtieth of April, One thou- And the said Warren Hastings fays, That in or about find Seven hundred and Eighty-four, write as follows: the Month of July, in the Year One thousand Seven " The Third Article (meaning the said Loan) was ob- hundred and Eighty-three, a Paper was received, intained by my own Suggestion from Almas Alt Kban, closed in a Letter to the Governor General and Counwho complied chearfully and without Hesitation cil, from Mr. purporting to be aTranflation

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that Information of the above Transactions was transmitted to the Board of Council, and that a Letter from the said Vizier was received on the Twenty-third of gujl, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, containing certain Representations of the Distresses of himself and his Family. And he admits, that no Order was made by him the said Warren Hajlings for the Provision of any of the said Family, or for the Return of the said Mirza.

And the said Warren Hajlin fays, That he did, in the Discharge of his Official Duty, hold Communications through different Persons with the said Hyder Beg Khan and the said Nabob; but he denies that he did, contrary to Law or his Duty, omit to produce , any such Communications, or any Part thereof; and he fays, that he did, at different Times, receive various Complaints from the said Hyder Beg against British Residents in Oude, all which Complaints were laid before the Board of Council, and were by them proceeded upon as the Nature of such Complaints required: But the said Warren Hastings denies, that he did aft thereupon in such Manner as in the said Article is stated. AnA he further denies, that he did unlawfully, or contrary to his Duty, or with any of the Views, or for any of the Purposes, stated in the said Article, fend up to Lucknow the said Major Pal-met and Major Davy; but he admits, that he did, in certain Letters to the Vizier, make use of the Expressions concerning Major Palmer stated in the said Article. And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he did transmit, through the said Agents, divers Letters to the said Minister, or the said Nabob, of which the Public Residents did not receive any Copy or Translation, or of the Contents of which they were not authentically informed; and he fays that, in Letters to the said Nabob, and to the said Hyder Beg, entered on the Public Consultations, there do appear References to the said Major but not to the

said Major Davy, for further Information; and he denies, that any Letters have been illegally or improperly by him suppressed, or that he ever did, without due Examination of their respective Merits or Demerits, take Part either with the Resident or Minister, or wilfully, or for any evil Purpose, in any Manner abet or ferment any Disturbances or Distrac-tiens whatsoever. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he did, in Consequence of certain Accounts which he had then lately received of the Neglect and Misconduct of the said Hyder Beg Khan, write to the said Hyder Beg Khan such Letter of Complaint and Remonstrance as is referred to in the said Article, and already in Part recited in this Answer, and to which he craves Leave to refer: And that he afterwards received a Letter from the said Major Palmer to the Effect stated in the said Article, and that he did transmit to the Board of Council a Letter from the said Hyder Beg to the said Major Davy, containing Charges against the said and he fays, that

as well in Consequence of those Letters, as of various other Informations received by him relative to the distracted State of the Vizier’s Country, the Truth whereof the said Warren Hajlings had Reason to believe, and which appeared to him to prove the Neglect of the then acting Resident, he did recommend to the Board at Calcutta (which he was then unable from Illness to attend Personally) to order the said John/on immediately down to Calcutta, and that the Commanding Officer at Cawnpore Should be directed, in case of the Disobedience of Mr. John/on, to fee the Orders of the Board enforced; and he further expressed his Opinion, that a Copy of the Orders of the Board Should be transmitted to Mr. Middleton, that he might likewise assist in the Execution of them; which Recommendation of the said Warren Hajlings, the Board accordingly adopted. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that he had at any former Time rc-V*l. XLIII.

ceived any Charges against Mr. John/on of a Nature equally alarming with those contained in the Letters herein last mentioned. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he did, after the Recall of Mr. on the Twentieth of October, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, in a Letter of that Date, express his Disapprobation of the Conduct of the said Hyder Beg Khan. But he fays, that the Subject of such Letter was wholly foreign to any Matter of Charge against the said John/on, and unconnected with the Causes of his Removal. And the said Warren Hajlings fays, that he did, in a Letter dated the Twenty-second of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, and to which Letter he prays Leave to refer, recommend to the Board the Recall of the said Middleton, on certain Grounds therein stated. And he did, in his said Letter, state, that the said Middleton had failed in his Duty in not having carried into Execution the Conditions and Spirit of the said Treaty. Put he denies that such Recall was contrary to good Faith, or that he did ever make any such Promise, as in the said Article is stated.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he did, by all or any of the supposed Means stated in the said Article, ever throw any Difficulties or Discouragements in the Way of any Resident; or that he was guilty of any such Conduct with respect thereto, as is stated in the said Article; or that he did upon any such supposed System, or under the Influence of such supposed Motives, as are in the said Article suggested, or in any other Manner whatsoever, ever weaken or render odious the British Government, disturb or distract the Government of Oude, disorder the Company’s Affairs, protract the Payment of the Debt to the said Company from the said Nabob, or. give any Incitement to Rapacity or Peculation, as in the said Article is charged against him.

NINETEENTH ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Nineteenth Article, the said Warren Hajlings fays. That in the Month of September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, believing the Affairs of Oude to have been long in all ill Condition, owing to the Mismanagement that prevailed therein, and to other Causes, he did write the following Letter to the Council General at Fort William, bearing Date, upop the Ganges near Look/agore, Twenty-second September, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, at which Place he was then confined by Illness:

*« Gentlemen,

u A few Days before my present Indisposition com- menced, I informed you, that I was sorry to find that the Resident at the Vizier’s Court had evi- dently failed in his Duty to this Government, in not tc having carried into Execution the Conditions and " Spirit of the late Treaiy with the Vizier. I had “ farther the Mortification to be obliged to inform you, that neither the Resident, nor his Deputy in “ his Absence, had communicated to me the Confulions which had arisen in the Vizier’s Dominions *« from a Neglect or Violation of the Treaty. The “ Letters which I wrote in Consequence of such Mif-ft management to the Resident, and to the Acting “ Minister of the Vizier, were laid before you and “ approved. Upon the same Occasion I observed to “ you, that the Obstacle which opposed itself to the “ Nomination of Mr. Brijlow to the Refidentship at “ Oude no longer existed; it was removed by my having vindicated what must ever be esteemed one of the ct necessary Privileges of this Government. I had u the Pleasure of finding, upon the most impartial . X “ Enquiry,

said Brijiow continued to hold the said Office of Refi-

dent; and the said Warren did repeatedly and

strongly press the Board of Council to form and fend such Instructions and Directions to the said as

they might judge to be neccessary and proper. And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he was guilty

of any Omission, Neglect, or Delay in this Behalf. And the said Warren Hajlings denies that he did, for the Purpose of preventing the Council from giving a Support to any neccessary Reforms in , or for any other Purpose, maliciously, wilfully, perfidiously, or fraudulently, or against Law or his Duty, hold back any Letter whatl'oever; but he admits that a Letter was received from the said bearing Date the

Twelfth December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-two, which Letter was immediately or soon after lhewn to the several Members of Council. And the said Warren Hajlings admits, that the said Bristow, in his said Letter of the Twelfth December, and in other Letters addreffied to the said Warren Hajlings, of the several Dates in the said Article in that Behalf mentioned, did make sundry Complaints respecting the said HyderBeg Khan-, which Letters, with their Inclosures, being separately addreffied to the said War rep Hajlings, were not entered on the Proceedings of the said Board of Council till the Twenty-first April, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-

three: But the said Warren Hajlings denies that he disregarded the Representations of the said Brijiow. And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, that ^having received Two Letters from the said Nabob Vizier, containing various Complaints and Charges against the said Brijiow, and representing the Measures pur* sued by the said Brijiow to be an Usurpation on his the said Nabob’s Authority, but which Measures the said Warren Hajlings denies to have been pursued under any Authority from him the said Warren Hajlings, did, on the said Twenty-first of One thousand

Seven hundred and Eighty-three, as he conceived it was his Duty to do, produce and fubrnit to the Consideration of the Council the said Two Letters of the said Nabob Vizier, together with the aforesaid Six Letters from the said Brijiow, and Three Letters from the said Hyder Beg Khan.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits that he did afterwards produce to the Council various other Letters from the said Nabob, from Time to Time, as they were received, containing repeated Complaints and Charges against the said Brijiow, who, on his Part, wrote to the said Board of Council various Letters of Complaint against the said Nabob Vizier and the said Hyder Beg Khan.

And the said Warren Hajlings, craving Leave, as before, to refer to the said written Instructions to the said Brijiow hereinbefore mentioned, and also craving Leave to refer to a certain Letter addreffied to the said Hyder Beg Khan, by the said Warren Hajlings, which the said Brijiow was empowered, if he Should think fit, to deliver to the said Hyder Beg Khan, and from which certain Paffiages are stated in the said Nineteenth Article, relative to the said Hyder Beg Khan and the said Nabob Vizier, the said Warren Hajlings fays that he did, upon mature Deliberation, and after having carefully examined all the Information he was able to procure, consider the aforesaid Letters from the said Nabob as his own, and as written from Impressions on his the said Nabob’s own Mind; and he denies that the same were of such Nature or Tendency as in the said Nineteenth Article is stated, or that the Declarations of the said Warren Hajlings, in the said Nineteenth Article alluded to, were properly applicable to them, or that he had in this same any Reason to consider the said Letters as written to promote the Interests of the said Hyder, and not the Independency of the said Vizier.

And the said Warren Hajlings admits that he received

several Letters from the said Hyder Beg Khan, containing various Complaints and Charges against the said Brijiow, which the said Warren Hajlings having submitted to the Consideration of the Board, the same were entered on their Proceedings; and the said Warren Hajlings, for the several Contents thereof, craves Leave to refer to the fame: And he denies that he considered the said Letters as ^mounting to Proofs of all the Facts related in them, or that, in forming his Judgment upon them, he omitted to give to every Circumstance that could properly operate against the Credit of any of the said Letters its due Weight; but the said Warren Hajlings submits that it was the Duty of him the said Warren Hajlings, and the Council, to receive the said Letters, and to pay Attention thereto, as forming a neccessary Part of the Information by which the Measures of the said Governor General and Council were to be governed: And the said Warren Hajlings denies that the said Hyder Beg Khan, and the said Palmer, could properly be considered in the Light in which they are represented in the said Nineteenth Article, or that the said Warren Hajlings did in any Manner violate or disregard Decency or Justice, or that he did attempt to deprive the said Resident of his Office, in the Manner stated in the said Article.

And the said WarrenHaJlings fays. That on laying the aforesaid Letters before the Board, on the Twenty-first April, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, he delivered a Minute, in the following Words: “ The Governor General lays before the Board the “ accompanying Letters and Papers received from tf the Nabob Vizier, and his Minister Cawn,

“ containing various Complaints and Charges against “ Mr. Brijiow, for Acts said to be done by him, in (( his Official Character, since his last Appointment of <c Minister at the Court of Lucknow, and grounded on “ the Instructions given to him by the Beard, through <c the Governor General. The Governor General defires the Board to consider the delicate Situation in <c which he {lands, both with respect to the Nabob Vizier and Mr. Brijiow, and which they well know “ to be particularly distreffiing, on an Occasion this Nature. He wishes, for this Reason, to follow the " Line which they may prescribe, rather than recom-f mer.d what in his Judgment may be requisite to ct the several Points offered to their Deliberation in “ these Papers; and shall wait for their Opinion upon “ them, before he delivers his own, if the Board, in “ Relief to him, will admit of this Mode for the “ Discussion of the general Subject. The Governor “ General desires that his Instructions given to Mr. “ Brijiow, which were read to the Members of the *c Board, and minuted, in Consultation, on the “ Twenty-fourth October last, may be now entered, and prefixed to the accompanying Letters.’*

And the said Warren Hajlings further fays, That the Council having taken no Notice of the aforesaid Letters, he did again draw their Attention to the fame, on the Nineteenth May,-One thousand Seven hundred

and Eighty-three, by a Minute, in the following Words: “ I beg Leave to remind the Board of the “ Papers which I laid before them on the Twentyfirst of April, respecting the Complaints preferred by the Nabob Vizier against Mr. Brijiow. The “ Fa6ts, as stated in these Complaints, are certainly Usurpations of the Authority and even of the Sovereignty of the Nabob Vizier. They are affirmed to “ have been justified by an Appeal to my Instructions. “ It therefore becomes me most particularly to endeavour to redress them, or to remove the Grounds “ on which they are said to have been produced; for “ which EffeCc I do, in the First Place, disavow <c having given him any Instructions intended for such *f Purposes; and, in the Second, I do, as it is my “ Duty, move the Board to transmit to Mr. Brijiow “ the Papers containing the Charges against him, to

And the said Warren Hastings craves Leave to refer to the Proceedings

of the said Board for an Account of the said Measure, and their Reasons for the fame, together with the Circumstances which preceded and attended the Execution thereof.

And the said Warren ID flings denies. That he did jever countenance an Opposition to the Establishment of Courts of Justice in Oude or that he is guilty of all or any of the Acts or Neglects of Duty, or of any of the supposed Offences or Jnstances of MisconduCt, in the said Nineteenth Article set foith, or that any Measures by him pursued did produce any such Effects as are in the said Article dated, or that he was the Cause of any Want of Security to the Property or Lives of the Inhabitants, or of any Evils, Mischiefs, Piforders, Tumults, Robberies, or Murders, as in the said Nineteenth Article is charged against him.

TWENTIETH ARTICLE.

IN Answer to the Twentieth Article, the said Warren Hastings fays, Tha. the Nabob Vizier being, in the Year One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, indebted in a large Sum of Money to the East India Company, and having offered to find Security for the Payment thereof, as well as for the Demand of the current Year, on Condition that John , Ef-

quire, then Resident at his Court, and Esquire, Assistant to the said Briflow, Should be recalled, and the Residency at his Court entirely withdrawn, the said Warren Hastings did, in the Month of July, One'thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, propose that the said Offer Should be accepted; but the said Proposal was, by the Majority of the Board of Council, rejected. And the said Warren Hastings further fays, that the said Majority did afterwards, by a joint Minuie, dated Thirty-full December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three,' propose to accept the said Offer, on Condition that the said Warren Hastings would hold himself responsible to the said Company, and to the Public, for the faithful Performance of certain Engagements on the Parr of the said Vizier and his Ministers, to wit. That the Balance due to the said Company Should be paid into their Treasury by Bills on creditable Bankers, payable Half in One Month, and tire remaining Half in Two Months from the Date of the Surrender by the said Briflow to the said Vizier of his said Office; which Proposal the said Warren Hastings did decline to accept, conceiving that it was thereby meant, that he Should be Personally responsible for any Failure that might happen of the said Payments within the Time aforesaid. But the said Majority having, in a subsequent Minute, dated Thirty-first December, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, explained the Responsibility proposed in the former Minute to mean such Obligations as constituted Responsibility in a decided Recommendation of any Mealure contrary to the general Opinion of the Board; the said Warren Hastings did agree to become specially responsible for the Propriety of accepting the Offer made by the said Vizier and his Minister for the Payment of the Balance due to the Company, and for the current Demands of the Year, under the express Condition that the said and

William Cowper, Esquire, Assistant to the said Briflow,

should be recalled. And the said Warren Hastings Vol. XLIII.

fays, that he did, on 6 tabbut the Twenty-first j

One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-four, receive from the Board of Council, certain Credentials* whereby he was inverted with the full Power and Apthority of the said Board (so far as the same could be legally delegated) for the Accomplishment of certain Objects in the said Credentials particularly specified. And the said Warren Hastings admits, that he did proceed to Lucknow, and return to Calcutta on the Days in th« said Article mentioned. And the said Warren -tings denies, that the said Commission was unnecessary* or that the Expences attending the said Delegation did amount to the Sum of Money in the said Article men* tioned; but he admits, that he did take with him several Engliflh Gentlemen; he denies however, that tho Number of them was unnecessary, or that any Burthen was thereby brought upon the Nabob; or that thd taking such Gentlemen with him was a Measure repugnant to the Sense of the Information which is stated in the said Article to have been sent by him the said Warren Hastings to Edward , Esquire. And the

said Warren Hastings fays, that, being at Lucknow as aforesaid, he did, in Consequence of the Resolution of the Board hereinbefore mentioned) acquaint the said Nabob Vizier, that his aforesaid Proposal had been accepted and agreed to by the said Board; And the said Warren Hastings fays, that in the Month of January, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-five, he did, in a Minute of that Date, recommend to the said Board to engage with the said Vizier, that while the said Vizier continued to fulfil the Engagement into which he had entered, no Person should be de- , puted to reside in his Court but at his own fponta-neous Inclination, nor Should any Authority be exercised within the Limits of his Dominions by the Appointment or Permifllon of the Board, except such as Should be required by the Nabob himself from the Military Officers stationed for his Defence and the Protection of his Country, until the Conclusion of the then current Year, or until-the Orders of the Court of Dire<5tors Should be received in Consequence of the References which had been made to them, if such Orders Should either enjoin or authorize a different Condu<5t. And the said H arrHaflings humbly fub-mits, that the Measures by him pursued with the Vizier were well authorized by the Powers with which he was then inverted. And he further lays, that a Clatile was, at the Instance of the several Aumils, or Persons raking Farms, inserted in their Leases from the said Vizier, that the said Leases Should be in full Force for the complete Term thereof, provided no foreign Authority was exercised over them 5 or in other Words, that their Engagements Should cease whenever they Should be interrupted in their Functions by the Interference of a Britishj Resident j which Clause the said Warren Hastings admits was inserted with his Approbation; but he denies that the said Clause was of such Nature, or productive of such Effects as are in the said Article stated, or that the same was in any'Respect unwarrantable or illegal. And the said Warren Hastings avers, that the Arrangement by him made and recommended, in respect to the Vizier, as hereinbefore mentioned, was, in the then Situation of the Company’s Affairs, fit and ex-, pedient. And the said Warren Hastings denies, that he did ever assign any Reasons for the said Measures dishonourable to the British Name or Character; or that any Imputations ever thrown upon the British Name, Government, or Influence, were in any Respect owing or imputable to any MisconduCt of the said Warren Hastings. And he further denies, that he did ever endeavour to destroy the Dependance on British Faith, or that he did ever attempt to create a Reliance on his own Personal Faith, in Exclusion or to the Prejudice of a due Reliance on the Faith of the British Nation. And the said Warren Hastings further.

Y fays.

5* Decembris. A. 1787.

fays, that Major Painter, in the said Article mentioned, did continue at Lucknow as Agent to the said Warren Hastings, on the Appointment of him the said Warren Hajlings, at the special Instance and Request of the Nabob, but not at any such Yearly Expence to the said Vizier, known to the said Warren Hajlings, as is dated in the said Article.

And the said Warren Hastings denies, That he did, on his Return to Calcutta, day in the City of Benares (or the Purpose in the said Article mentioned: But he admits he did remain fume Time at Benares j and he avers, that his Continuance there during such Time,

was for proper and justifiable Purposes. And the said Warren Hajlings likewise denies, that he did, after his

Return to Calcutta as aforesaid, bring forward Charges against the said Brijlow, as in the said Article is dated} but he fays that he did, whilst at transmit to

the Board certain Objections made by the said Vizier to the Accounts of the said Brijlow, in order that the said Brijlow might give an Answer to the fame; and an Answer was afterwards accordingly delivered in to the Board by the said Brijlow, which by the said Board was taken into Consideration after the Return of the said Warren Hajlings to Calcutta. And the said Warren Hajlings denies, that he had settled any Pen-(ioners on the Revenues of the said Nabob, or that he did corruptly leave, under the aforesaid Major Palin er, any Establishment of English Pensioners, authorized by him the said Warren Hajlings, to be paid out of the Revenues of the said Nabob. And the said Warren Hajlings also denies, that he did in any Manner preserve to himself in the Province of the said Nabob any corrupt or improper Influence whatever.

And the said Warren Hajlings denies, That he did give up or abandon the said Nabob and his Territories, or the Company’s Interests therein, to the entire Dominion of Hyder Beg Cawn, as in the said Article is alledged. And with respect to such Part of the said Article as states “ that the said Warren HaJtings,by his Agreement, did leave sundry of the

great Farms of the Revenue in the Province of u Oude under Almajs Ali Khan," the said Warren Haf-

tings humbly craves Leave to refer to his Answer in this Behalf hereinbefore made.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays, That he did not make any Stipulation with the Vizier respetting any of the Persons in the said Article mentioned; but he denies that he was guilty of any Neglect or Breach of Duty in that Respect, or that the said Persons were thereby exposed to the Resentment of the said Hyder Beg Khan, or that the said Warren Hajlings knew any Resentment was entertained by the said Hyder Beg Khan against those Persons.

And the said Warren Hajlings fays. That the Bankers, whose Security was taken for the Payment of the said Debt from the Vizier to the Company, were, at the Time of giving such Security, Persons of unimpeached Credit and Responsibility, and the Bills taken from the said Bankers for the said Debt were all duly discharged, except One, which the said Warren Hajlings has been informed was not regularly paid when it became due; but which, as he has likewise been informed, has since been discharged. And the said Warren HaJ-tings denies that the Pay ment of the said Debt was pretended or delusive j and he further denies that he did take ay ay any Security from in the said Article

mentioned: But the said Warren Hajlings fays, that a Bond having been executed by the said John Brijlow, on the Parc of the said Company, to the said Gopal Dojs, dated the Eighth of June, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty-three, for a certain Sum of Money advanced by the said Gopal for the Use of the said Company, to be repaid from whatever might remain after providing for the Company’s necessary Disbursements, from the Receipts of certain Assignments specified in the said Bond; and the said Sum, by Reason

of the urgent OCcafionS of the Government not having been duly discharged, according to the Condition of the said Bond, certain other Arrangements were made by the Board of Council with the said Gopal Dojs for the Liquidation of the said Demand, which was afterward* fully satisfied. And the said Warren Hajlings denie* that the Credit of the said Company was, in any Re-speft, affected by any of the Matters aforesaid.

And the said Warren HaJHngs denies. That by alt, or any, of die Measures aforesaid, he did dangerously affect the Paymetits of succeeding Years, or that the actual Amount of the Debt due from the said Nabob to the said Company was, in any Manner, imputable to any Negled of Misconduct of the said Warren Haf~ tings j or that he was, or is, in fefped of any of the Premises in the said Article mentioned, guilty of an Crime or Misdemeanor whatsoever.

1 1 — a v.

AND as to all other Matters and Things in the said Articles contained, and not hereinbefore particularly answered unto, the Did Warren Hajlings fays, he is not guilty of them, or any of them, in Manner and Form as the same are charged upon him In and by the said Articles. And the said Wafren Hastings humbly requests of your Lordships, that in this hia Answer to the several Matters in the said Articles contained, your Lordships will be pleased to understand him to have followed the Order and Succession iit which the same are in the said Articles arranged and set forth j and in referring to such Articles, generally to have referred to such Parts and Passages thereof as correspond with and relate to the Faffcs, Circumstances. Declarations, and Expressions then particularly considered and adverted to, and to which his Answer is in such Instances immediately applied; and also that in all Cafes where the Narration or Statement by him in his said Answer given touching any FaCts, Circumstances, Declarations, or Expressions* materially varies from or contradicts the Narration of Statement of like Fafrs, Circumstances, Declarations* or Expressions contained in the said Articles, that he may be understood to deny such latter Narration of Statement to be true to the Extent in which such material Variance and Contradiction exists. And the said Warren Hajlings humbly hopes, that your Lordships wilt excuse any fmperfeftions or Defects with regard to Expression or Form in his said Answer j and will permit him, with all Humility, to bespeak your Lordships Candour and Indulgence on Account of the peculiar Nature of the several Articles of Impeachment} which he apprehends, both as to the Manner in which the same are framed, and the Matter which is the Subject of them, will be found materially different from any which have ever yet been exhibited at your Lordships Bar: For, with respect to the said Charges, the said Warren Hastings begs Leave to observe, that they consist of a minute and elaborate Scrutiny into his whole Official Conduct during a Government of Thirteen Years, comprehending an infinite Variety of Events, and involving the Management of a great Commercial and Political System, in a Service of uniform Difficulty and Exigence, and at many Times of extreme National Peril: Nor are the said Charges confined to Measures, but even his Declarations and Opinions delivered in the Course of Debate and Consultation, according to such Information as he possessed at the Moment, and often under Circumstances which would not afford Time for adequate Deliberation, are made Subjects of Accusation against him. The said Warren Hastings therefore humbly represents, that, under such Circumstances, he must necessarily stand in much Need of your Lordships favourable Construction of his ConduCt, in order that the many Omissions and Imperfections, which.

in the Review of the past Measures of his long and arduous Administrarion, your Lordships fuperiorWif-dom shall discover, may be imputed to Error and Infirmity, and not to any corrupt or criminal Intention. And the said Warren Hastings feels it the more necessary to solicit your Lordships Indulgence, as he was separated at a very early Age from his native Country, from every Advantage of that Instruction which might have better qualified him for the high Offices and difficult Situations which it has been his Lot to fill, and left to form his Rule of Conduct in a great Degree on his own Practice, and by the Light of his own Understanding.

And the said Warren Hajling begs Leave further to J-epresent, That many of the Measures which in the said Articles are stated as Crimes or Misdemeanors by him Individually committed, were, in Fad, Measures of the Council at large, and for which, therefore, he humbly conceives, he ought not to be separately and distinctly charged; and, with respect to many others of the said Measures, he trusts he shall be able to satisfy your Lordships that they were rendered expedient and necessary by former Acts and Resolutions of the Board, adopted, in some Instances, hot only without his Concurrence, but against his Opinion and Vote; and he trusts that your Lordships will permit him to observe, that many of the Plans and Arrangements which are in the said Articles drawn Into a Matter of Criminal Charge against him, were by him at first proposed with a Reference to the known Opinions and Sentiments of those with whom he was appointed to ad, and were afterwards varied and modified, in the Course of Discussion at the Board, so as to be irt the Result, and at the Period of their Execution, essentially different from the State in which they were originally offered; and that many Measures Which are also made the Subject of Charge against him have been fully approved by his Successors in Office, and continue to form a Part of the present System of Government in India; and he doubts not but your Lordships will consider the Length of Time which has elapsed since several of the said Acts are charged to have been done, and the Distance of the Countries in which they are supposed to have taken place, and that on these Accounts he mull labour under much Difficulty in giving a full and particular Explanation of the fame, of the Causes by which they were produced, and the Circumstances with which they were attended. And further, in as much as many of such Transactions relate to Negociations with the Ministers of Foreign States, who cannot be produced as Witnesses in his Defence, however material their Testimony might be, and require the Evidence of certain other Subjects of such States who are like-wife not amenable to the Process of this High Court, your Lordships' will therefore, he humbly trusts, be disposed to" receive with due Indulgence, the Defence he may hereafter make under such Disadvantages j and, as many of the said Articles of Impeachment are founded upon his Opinions and Declarations, as extraded from divers ^Letters and Entries upon the Public Consultations, written at various Times, and under Circumstances materially different, connected also with, and dependant upon, the former Declarations and Opinions of himself and others, not stated in the said Articles, he further presumes to hope that your Lordships will not suffer him to be prejudiced by any Opinions or Declarations thus detached and brought forward, but will at the same Time examine the Series of Letters and Consultations relating thereto, and will compare together such Parts and Passages of them as may give Light to each, and to the Whole. And he further humbly submits, that as in Political Negociations and Treaties with Foreign Powers, when the Interest of several Parties distinct from and oppo-fne to each other are to be adjusted, great Address is

necessary in the Management thereof,* and such Terms are often proposed, and such Arguments used, as carry an Appearance different from the real Intention of those who treat j in which Respect it may be difficult to reconcile the various Means used for the Attainment of the End proposed: The said Warren Hajlings humbly requests that, with regard to his Conduct in all such Respects, he may in like Manner receive your Lordships Indulgence. And he further ventures to observe to your Lordships, that in the Conduct of the important Concerns intruded to his Charge, he has often been obliged to act upon general Appearances only, and according to such Information as he could collect and such Judgment as he was enabled to form at the Moment, particularly in Cafes in which immediate Evils seemed to threaten the Government Under his Charge, and which it became his Duty by instant Exertion to prevent.

And further, the said Warren Hajlings begs Leave to represent, That the general Nature and Quality of many Measures, now the Subject of Charge against him, considerably depend upon the Manners, Customs. Principles, and Laws, peculiar to the Countries in which such Measures were adopted } and cannot, therefore, as he conceives, properly be judged of by the same Rules and Principles as would determine the Quality of like Actions in the Country where he is now called to answer for the fame.

And, in Addition to the many peculiar Circumstances which char?derize this Cafe, he is persuaded it will not escape the Difcernmerit of your Lordships, That he stands charged with a Relponfibility, eqqally new in its Kind, and unlimited in its Extent: That h^ is required to answer not only for Acts of supposed Misconduct in himself and others, Subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, or Servants of the East India Company j but is also questioned for various Acts of real or supposed Error or Malvcrfation, committed by the Ministers or Servants of Sovereign Princes, connected, by Alliance, with the Company j

and, in some Instances, for the Vices and Neglect of Duty in those Princes themselves, and that too, not in Matters of a Public Nature only, but in the private Relations of Civil Life: That he is, upon other Occasions, charged as responsible for the calual Effects of Military Tumult, for a supposed Decline of Population, Arts, and Agriculture; and, in general, for every Symptom of internal Disorder and Decay, suggested to exist in Countries rempte from the Seat of BritiJlj Government, and exempt from its immediate Authority and Controul.

And the said Warren Hajlings further hopes, That your Lordships will not deem him to have erred in supposing, from his several Re-appointments by the Legislature, at the Times and in the Manner stated in the Introduction to this, his Answer, that he had reasonable Cause to conclude, that the general Principles on which he acted, and the Measures he had punned previous thereto, as far as they were respectively known, did thereby receive a Legislative Sandion.

And further the said Warren , with all Hu-

mility, observes. That notwithstanding the Length of Time his Conduct has been the Subject of Parliamentary Investigation, and during which he has been charged with Acts of the most flagrant and notorious Corruption, Rapacity, Extortion, Injustice, and Breach of Faith, by which he has been alledged to have sacrificed the Interests of the East India Company, dishonoured the British Name and Character, and reduced Provinces to Desolation j yet, of the Multitudes who mull have been Sufferers by such enormous Wrongs, if such had existed, not One Individual has yet appeared to complain against him; bur, on the contrary, the Native Inhabitants of the Provinces immediately subject to his Authority, do generally, as it is well known, and as he trusts lie shall be able to prove, x hold

hold the Memory of his Government in RefpeCL The Sovereigns and Princes of India, who were connected by Treaty or Intercourse with the East India Company during his Government, have not only preferred no Complaints against him, but several of them have, since his Departure from India, corresponded, and do still correspond, with him, by Letters, profdTing Sentiments of Friendship and Esteem for his Person and Character. And he begs Leave further to represent, that Letters from some of the said Princes, containing their Acknowledgments of his good Faith, Honour, and Integrity, have been transmitted to his Successor in Office, and to the Court of bireCtors, and appear upon the Public Proceedings of the East India Company. And the said Warren Hafiings further, fays, that the British Inhabitants of Calcutta, and the Officers of the Army who were the Witnesses of his ConduCt, have Publicly testified their Sentiments of the same in Two separate Addresses presented to him after his Resignation of the Service; and one of them, many Months after his Return to England, expressing the Acknowledgments and Thanks of the Persons whole Names are subscribed to the fame, for the upright, equal, and beneficent Exercise of the Authority with which he had been, during a long Course of Years, inverted over them, for the vigilant Attention and active Support given by him in the most difficult and perilous Times, to the great and extensive National Interests intrusted to his Charge, and for having been inrtrumental to the Splendour and Glory of the British Arms by the Services on which they were employed under his Direction.

And, lastly, the said Warren Hafiings fays, That the East India Company, and the Court of Directors of the said Company, whose immediate Concern it was to have called him to a Public Account, and to whom the ordinary Courts of Justice were open for legal Redress, if it were true, as is alledged in the said Charge, that the Interests of the said Company have suffered great and essential Injury by the Neglect of Duty, Disobedience of Orders, Breach of Public Faith, and Corruption, of him the said Warren tings, so far from calling him to an Account for the said supposed Crime*, have afforded him their public Approbation of his ConduCt; and the said Court of Directors did on his Return, by an unanimous Vote, bestow on him their Thanks for his long, faithful, and able Services. And the said Warren Hafiings humbly hopes, that he will not be deemed to have trespassed on your Lordships Indulgence, in having laid before your Lordships these Testimonies of Approbation, being, as he apprehends, Matter of fair , and honourable Mention, at a Time when the general Tenor of his Public Conduct is impeached, and Motives of Action are aferibed to him utterly repugnant to his Disposition and Character: And with all the Assurance of an innocent Man he begs Leave lolemnly to declare, that in the high Stations he has been called upon to fill, he has ever, according to his belt Skill and.Judgment, ailed with a sincere and ardent Zeal for the Public Service, uninfluenced by any View to his own private Advantage; and thus with all due Humility, but at the same Time with that Confidence which a Sense of his own Integrity, and of the high Honour and Justice of this august Tribunal, must inspire, he submits himself to your Lordships Judgment, firmly trading that he shall thereby receive that full and honourable Acquittal, which, next to the Approbation of his own Confidence, it must be his highest Ambition to obtain.

That of all the Estates which were forfeited to the Crown by the Adherents to the Cause of the Family of Stuart, either in the Year 1715 or 1745, the Derwent water Estates alone remain {fill vested in the Trustees of the Public, and, the Petitioner is confident that if, with better Pretensions, he alks less Favour than any of the Persons to whom forfeited Estates have been lately restored, his Application will not be rejected j and that the same of the Petitioner is peculiarly singular, and differs from the Cafes of all other Sufferers for the same Cause, in the following striking In-

Vol. XLIII.

stances: That his Grandfather, the late Charles Rad* clyffe(by whose Attainder the Derwentwater Estates became vested in the Crown, in the Year 1731, upon the Death of Mr. John Radclyffe, the only Son of the attainted Earl of Derwentwater, without Issue Male) was nearly allied, by Consanguinity, to the Person whose Fortunes he followed, and was attainted before he had attained the Age of Nineteen Years; that the Value of the Property forfeited by the Petitioner’s Anccftor far exceeded that of any other Person who forfeited for the same Cause, and that, by the uninterrupted Enjoyment of such Property for Fifty-six Years, the Nation hath received from the Petitioner’s Family more ample Atonement than from any Family in the like Situation j and that a considerable Part of the Derwentwater Estates, upon the Death of the said Charles Radclyffe, in the Year 1746, was prevented from vesting in the Petitioner’s Father (the late Earl of Newburgh) in Tail Male, as the first Son of the Body of the said Radclyffe, under a Settlement, made in the Year 1712, not by the Eft'e&s of the Forfeiture of the said Charles Radclyffe his Father, nor for any Criminality, either in himself or his Ancestors, but by ;the Interference of Parliament, in Consequence of many great Doubts and Difficulties which the Twenty-second of his late Majesty King George the Second recites to have existed, reflecting the Alienage of the Petitioner’s said Father (who was born in France, though of English Parents) and the Necessity of a Claim being put in to the Estates in Question by the Trustees to preserve contingent Remainders in the aforesaid Settlement on Behalf of unborn Children, which was not directed by the forfeiting Acts, nor required by the Law of the Land, and' which the Petitioner’s said Father was at that Time unable to bear the Expences of litigating, and the said Act leaves open and undecided; and that the Petitioner is allured, from undeniable Authority, that the Royal Hospital at Greenwich hath not, for the last Five Years, received from the Derwentwater Estates more net and clear Money than 20,000 per Annum, or thereabouts $ and that the Petitioner doth not urge either similar or stronger Pretensions for the Rcftora-tien of all the Estates of his attainted Ancestors, than others to whom such Restorations have been made, but is resigned and ready to pay, for ever, as much as the Public hath ever received from the Estates of his Ancestors, if Parliament shall be pleased, in their Mercy and Humanity, to veil all the Derwentwater Estates in the Petitioner, in Fee Simple, subject to a perpetual Relit Charge of £. 20,000, payable for the Benefit of the Royal Hospital at Greenwich for ever; and that the Petitioner is fully confident, that no Objection will be made to his Petition, when there have been so many late Instances of the Restoration of all the other Estates forfeited for a more recent Rebellion, to the forfeiting Persons themselves, or their Dcfcendants, subject to no other Burthens than such as they were charged with at the Time of their Forfeiture, and that, if the same Principles were applied to the same of the Petitioner, in lieu of a perpetual Relit Charge of £. 20,000 per Annum, the Derwentwater Estates would be liable only to £.28,900; and that the Petitioner’s Father was, as is also the Petitioner, most loyally attached to the present Government: And therefore praying, Thac Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for diverting the Fee Simple and Inheritance of the said Estates out of the Commissioners and Governors of the said Hospital, and for subjecting the said Estates to the Payment of a perpetual Relit Charge of /. 20,000, for the Benefit and Advantage of the said Hospital, and for veiling the said Estates, so subject, in the Petitioner, for an absolute Filiate of Inheritance in Fee Simple, or for granting to the Petitioner such other Redress or Relief as the singular and unprecedented Hardships of his same shall appear to deserve.

Vexations, and Injuries of the East India Company, or their Servants in Authority there; and also in the View of affording to the said East India Company it- self.

self, the Means of obtaining Justice against the Frauds and Misdemeanors of its Servants, in a Court which Should be independent of, and unconnected with, the said Servants, did provide that the Chief Justice and Judges of the said Supreme Court should be appointed by His Majesty, and not by the India Company, or by any of its Servants, and Should be removeable from their said Offices of Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court, by His Majesty, or His Successors, and not by the said East India Company, or any of its Servants; and did further grant to the said Chief Justice and Judges large and ample Salaries, sufficient to remove any Temptation of seeking to increase their Fortunes by any ocher and indirect Means, and rendering themselves thereby dependent on the Servants of the said East India Company; and did further ftriXly forbid the said Chief Justice and Judges to accept of any Present or pecuniary Reward, other than their said Salaries, or to Carry on, or to have any Concern in, any Traffick or Commerce, either for themselves or for the Account Cf any other Persons; and the manifest Spirit and Intention of the said Provisions and Regulations was to secure the Independence of the said Supreme Court of Judicature, and to keep the Administration of Juf-ticfe pure and separate from all Political Views, Trans-aXions, or Connexions whatever; and the main and principal ObjeX of the Establishment of the said Supreme Court, and of the Provisions and Regulations relating thereto, was the general ProteXionof the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces against the Oppref-fions of the said Company’s Servants, and more particularly the special ProreXion of the Native Inhabitants, who should accuse and complain of the said Company’s Servants, and particularly in the Instances in which the said Servants so complained of should possess the highest Authority, and should be most able to oppress the said Native Inhabitants, and to resent their Complaints and Accusations.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey was well acquainted with the said Provisions and Regulations, and with the salutary ObjeXs proposed thereby, which are obvious'in themselves, and which the said Sir Impey was well apprised of, as appears by many Declarations and Professions made by himself, both in Writing and publicly from the Bench, expressive of the'Senlc he entertained of the said Provisions and Regulations, and of their ObjeX; and the said Sir Elijah Impey did accept of the said Appointment in the full -and perfeX Knowledge of the Duties and Obligations attached thereto, and did thereby render him-lelf responsible for any NeglcX, Breach, or Violation thereof.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey was appointed to the said Office at London, in the Year 1774; and did arrive at Fort William in Bengal, in the Month of October in the same Year; and did immediately, or soon after, enter on the Discharge of the said Office of Chief Justice.

That, soon after the Arrival of the said Sir Elijah Impey at Calcutta, and the First Establishment of the said Supreme Court, Warren Esquire, at that

Time Governor General of Bengal, was publicly accused of various Peculations, and other corrupt Practices, in his said Office of Governor General, by a Native of high Rank and of great Eminence in the said Province of Bengal, named the Maha Rajah Nun-ducotnar. That the said Accusations were made by the said Maha Rajah befort the Council General, a Majority of which received the fame; and instituted an Enquiry and Examination into the Truth thereof, as it was their Duty to do, and in Obedience to the particular and recent InstruXions given by the Court of DireXors of the said East India Company, when the

said Members of the Council General were appointed

to their said Offices. That the said Accusations were in Writing, and specified with great Minuteness the particular Charges, and all Circumstances relating thereto, and were not contradiXed by the said Warren Hajiings-, who, inltead of confronting his Accuser, challenging Enquiry, disputing or refuting the said Charges, thought proper, under Pretence of his Dignity, to decline all Defence, to difiolve, in an arbitrary and illegal Manner, the said Council General, at various Times, when met to enquire into the said Charges, and did otherwise, by every Means in his Power, whether legal or otherwise, oppose and refill the Examination of the said Charges, affording the reby strong Confirmation of the Truth thereof, and manifesting strong Apprehensions of the Consequences with which the said Accusation would threaten him, if enquired into, or suffered to proceed.

That a Majority of the said Council General having refused to suppress the said Accusation, and having declared their Determination to proceed in its Invef-tigation, notwithstanding the illegal and unwarrantable Opposition made thereto by the Person accused, he the said Warren Hajiings endeavoured to defeat the said Accusation, by prosecuting the said Maha Rajah in the Supreme Court, for a Conspiracy against him, and several other Persons holding high Stations in the Company’s Service; and immediately after the Commencement of the said Profecurion for the said Conspiracy, but before any IndiXment for the same hdd been found, or any Trial thereof, a direX Attack was made on the Life of the said Accuser of the Governor General, by indiXing the said Maha Rajah Capitally before the Supreme Court, for a Forgery, said to have been committed by the said Maha Rajah Five Years before; which pretended Forgery had been, and still was at the Time of the Commencement of the said Prosecution, the SubjeX of a Civil Suit in the Dewannee Adaulet, a Country Court of Justice, and no Steps had been ever taken to make the same a Matter of Criminal Prosecution, and much less of a Capital IndiXment, until the said Rajah had become the Accuser of the Governor General. That the Circumstances aforesaid could leave no Doubt in the Mind and Opinion of any Person acquainted therewith, that the said Prosecution was fee on Foot with a View of defeating the said Accusation brought by the said Maha Rajah against the said Warren ;

and the same was considered as a Political Measure, contrived either by the said Warren , or by

his Party and Adherents, to extricate the said Warren Hajiings from his said desperate Condition, and calculated at the same Time both to revenge the said particular Accusation brought against the said Warren Hajiings, and efteXually to deter all other Natives of the said Provinces from attempting the like in any other Instance against the said Warren , or any

other European.

That the said Maha Rajah was entitled to Justice from the said Supreme Court of Judicature in common with other Men, and more particularly as being a Native Inhabitant of the said Provinces; but he was most peculiarly, and above all, an ObjeX of their especial Protection, from the Circumstances in which he flood, and which had given Occasion to the said Prosecution. For he was a Native Inhabitant of the said Provinces, and he was engaged in an Undertaking which had been deemed hazardous and fatal' for Natives before the Establishment of the said Supreme Court, but which it was the principal and proper ObjeX of the said Establishment to render safe to all Persons, whether Native or European, namely, the Accusation and DeteXion of corrupt and evil Practices in the Servants of the East India Company enjoying Power and Authority in the said Provinces. That it was therefore the bounden and sacred Duty of

the said Sir Elijah Impey, as Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, to afford Protection to the said Malta Rajah, so far as it might come within the Limits of his Functions and Office legally so to do. But he the said Sir Elijah Impey did> on the contrary, in Violation of his said Duty, in direct Opposition to the Letter and the Spirit of his Commission, contrary to every Principle of English Law, and of general Justice, become in Effect the Abettor and Instrumenc of the said Warren Hajlings, or of his Partizans, in the said wicked and unprincipled Attack on the Life of the said Accuser; and the said Sir Elijah Impey converted His Majesty’s Commission and Authority, the Laws of England, and the sacred Character of Magis-tracy, into a new Means of Impunity, and a new and additional Engine of Revenge, Oppression, and Terror, in the Hands of those whom he was commissioned to controul.

That, in pursuance of the said corrupt and abomi-liable Design, to defeat the said Accusation by putting the said Accuser to Death, he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, did entertain the said Prosecution, and did permit the said Capital Indictment to be tried by a Jury of British Subjects, and did pass Sentence of

Death on the said Maha Rajah, and did refuse to grant an Appeal therefrom, and did refuse to respite the said Sentence until His Majesty’s Pleasure Should be known, and did order and cause the said Capital Sentence to be executed on the said Maha Rajah, in a Manner (hocking to the religious Opinions of all the Gentoo Inhabitants within the said Provinces, although the said Maha Rajah was not within the Criminal Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court, which had no legal Authority to try the said Indictment under the said Act of the Thirteenth Year of His present Majesty, and although the said pretended Crime, of which the said Maha Rajah was indicted, was not Capital in India, either by the Gentoo Law, or the Mahomedan Law, or the English Law j but the said Indictment was completely illegal, and ought to have been quaffied, and every Step in the said Prosecution, from the Indictment to the Execution of the said Sentence, was plainly and directly contrary to the Law of and unwarranted by the Act of Parliament, or the Charter of Justice, under Pretence and Colour of which the said Sir Elijah Impey put the said Accuser of the Governor General to Death pending his said Accusation j and although the said Proceedings were still more manifestly contrary to the first and plained Principles of natural and general Justice, and could not have been justified even by their Conformity with English Law, if such Conformity had existed, which it did not j and it would have been on that Account the Duty of the said Chief Justice to respite the said Sentence till His Majesty’s Pleasure Should be known, even if the Letter of the Law had constrained him to pronounce the said Sentence, which it did not 5 and although the said Trial, Sentence, and Execution, tended, in the Circumstances above recited, to defeat the principal and most salutary Purposes of the said Commission, and, instead of encouraging the Native Inhabitants to seek Redress in the said Supreme Court, and in the Laws of England against the Oppressions of the said Company’s Servants, must have increased, and did accordingly increase, the Terror, and the implicit Submission of the said Native Inhabitants under their Wrongs, by impressing them with an Opinion that the Authority of the said Company’s Servants was now augmented by the Subserviency of the said Supreme Court, which armed the said Servants with new and more terrible Powers, and placed the Lives as well as the Fortunes of the said Native Inhabitants at the Mercy and at the Discretion of the said Servants.

That the said Trial, Sentence, and Execution,

were contrary to Law, and not warranted by any legal or competent Authority,

First, because the said Act of Parliament of His present Majesty, which authorized His Majesty to grant the said Charter, and to establish the said Supreme Court, did also describe, limit, and define, the several Powers and Jurisdictions to be exercised by the said Supreme Court j but it did not confer on the said Supreme Court (nor authorize His Majesty to confer the fame) any Criminal Jurisdiction whatever, in any same whatever, over the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces; and albeit the said Charter did nevertheless contain Clauses for conferring Criminal Jurisdiction over Native Inhabitants of certain Descriptions, and in certain Circumstances, in the said Charter particularly mentioned, yet the said Charter was not competent, without the Authority of Parliament, and contrary to the Meaning of the said Act, to confer such Criminal Jurisdiction, by any legal, valid, and sufficient Authority; and the said Sir Elijah Impey, being conversant in the Laws and Constitution of England, well knew the Insufficiency of the

said Charter to that Effect, and is respohfible for acting under an Authority which he knew to be invalid and unwarranted in Law. And the said Sir Elijah Impey is the more responsible on Account of the Invalidity of the said Charter, because he declared from the Bench, that he had been himself principally con-fulted and employed in drawing and preparing the said Charter, after he knew that he was to be appointed Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, and that the Powers, which by his Advice were illegally inserted in the said Charter, were to be exercised by himself, and were therefore in Effect conferred by himself on himself.

That the said Proceedings were contrary to Law, Secondly, Because the said Maha Rajah was held to be subject to the Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court, under the Authority of the said Charter, as having been an Inhabitant of the said Town of Calcutta at the Time of his committing the said pretended Forgery j but it was unjust to make him amenable to the said Supreme Court, and subject to a Foreign Law, and all the Penal Consequences thereof, on that Account, because he was brought to Calcutta by Force, and detained there a Prisoner, by Order of the President and Council, at the Time aforesaid j and, if the said Construction of the said Charter Should prevail, it would be easy to bring any Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces within the Criminal Jurisdiction of the said Court, and subject them to the Penal Law of England, by first dragging them in Chains to cutta, and then treating them as Inhabitants of the said Town within the Meaning of the said Charter, and as becoming by such compulsive Inhabitancy amenable to the said Supreme Court, and to English Law.

That the said Proceedings w>ere illegal,

Thirdly, Because the Act of the Second of George the Second, Chapter 25, which rendered Forgery a Capital Felony in England, did not extend to ,

and no Indictment or Prosecution thereon, against any Person, whether English or Native, resident in the said Provinces, could be legal, or maintained in Law; for no Act of Parliament can be construed to extend to any foreign or dependent Dominion of Great Britain beyond the Seas, nor beyond the Realm of England, unless it be so expressed in the Act; and there is no such Expression in the said Act of George the Second, to extend the same to India, or to any other of His Majesty’s Dominions beyond the Sea. But, on the contrary, the Operation of the said Act is clearly and manifestly, by the Preamble, by the Provisions of the said Act, which are applicable to England alone, and incapable of being applied to any other Country or

Place,

28 Geo. IIL 120 Decentbris. 11 j

Place, and by the whole Purview of the said Act,* strictly confined to the Realm of England; and the said Act contains an express Proviso, that it shall not extend even to Scotland. That the said Indictment ought therefore to have been quashed; and the Guilt of the said Sir Elijah Impey, in refusing to quash the fame, and in executing a Capital. Sentence on a Native of :'India, under the said Act, is aggravated, in a very high Degree, by the Consideration that Sir Robert Chambers, one of his Brethren on the Bench, and a Person well and deeply skilled and learned in the Law of England, did make a Motion from the Bench for quashing the said Indictment, on the Ground of its Illegality, as being founded on the said Statute of George the Second, which had not the Force of Law in India, and was not binding on the Inhabitants of those Provinces j and the said Sir Robert Chambers delivered his Reasons for the said Opinion \ but the said Sir Elijah Impey did over-rule the fame, and did rejcft the said Motion, and did proceed and perfilt, not only irvthe illegal Trial, but also in the Execution of the said illegal and Capital Sentence.

That the said Trial, Sentence, and Execution, were contrary to Natural Justice,

First, Because the said Crime of Forgery was not Capital by the Laws of the Country of which the said Maha Rajah was a Native and an, Inhabitant; and it is repugnant to the Principles 6f Justice, of Humanity, and of Reason, to subject a whole Nation to the Penalties of a Foreign Law, more especially when that Law is incompatible with the Opinions, Manners, PJabits, and Religion of the said Nation, and when the said Foreign Law is written (when written at all) in a Language not understood by the said Nation, and is in a great Measure unwritten, and therefore both unknown and impossible to be taught to the said Nation, and is administered by Forms with which the said Nation are utterly unacquainted, and by Persons with whom the said Nation cannot converse, and is, in all these, and many other Respects, utterly inapplicable to, as it was in Fast framed without any Contemplation of, the said Nation. And the said Statute of George the Second could be binding in India only on the general Ground that the whole Body of the English Penal Law was transplanted, without Distinc-tien, Selection, or Modification, into the said Provinces, and became binding on the said Native Inhabitants; which Supposition is no where supported by the said Stature or Charter, and is utterly repugnant to Reason and Justice j and the said Sir Elijah Impey has himself expressed, on other Occasions, his Opinion of the Inconvenience and Mischief of “ infiift-cc ing the same Punishments which are inflicted in tc England for the like Offences,” and the Practice of the said Sir Elijah Impey, anc), of the said Supreme Court, has accordingly been to depart, in various Instances, from the Letter of English Law, and to" modify it according to their Discretion, in such Manner as appeared in those Instances to render it more applicable to the Circumstances of the said Provinces, and of the Inhabitants thereof. And the said Sir Elijah Impey did therefore deem it competent for him to depart from the Rigour of Penal Statutes, and was not bound, according to his own Principles and Practice, to adhere to it more in this than in other Cafes; and his Pertinacity on the said Trial of the said Maha Rajah, in a same of Life and Death, is on that Account the more unwarrantable, and the more obnoxious to the Imputation and Suspicion of a corrupt and dishonest Motive.

That the said Proceedings were contrary to Natural Justice,

Secondly, Because the only Pretence under which the said Indictment, Sentence, and Execution could, with any Colour, be justified, was the Operation of His Majesty’s said Charter of Justice, which the said Vox.. XUII.

Sir Elijah Impey falsely pretended to be sufficient for establishing the Criminal Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court, and the English Penal Law, over the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces; but the said Chatter of Justice was not granted by His Majesty till the Year 1774, and did not reach Calcutta, nor was published there, until the Month of October in the said Year; whereas the said pretended Forgery was alledged to have been committed by the said Maha Rajah in the Year 1770, and was therefore not Capital, even under any British Charter, whether competent to make it so or not, at the Time of its find pretended Commission; and the said Charter of Justice granted by His present Majesty could operate on, or be applied to, the said Calc only ns an ex pojt fatlo Law, which is contrary to the univeifally received and acknowledged Principles and Practice of all rational Societies and civilized Nations, and is aTy-ranny not to be justified under any Act of a British Parliament, or any Charter of a British King, and is utterly repugnant to the Spirit of English) Law, and to the Practice of English Tribunals, and is (hocking to the Englishj Character and Manners 5 and the Application of an ex post fast0 Law by the said Sir Elijah bn-pey as aforesaid, in a same of Life and Death, would alone, if there were no other -Circumstance to aggravate the Guilt thereof, remain a Stain on the English Name, which nothing can efface but a National Dif-avowal and Condemnation thereof.

That it is a Maxim of our Law, which in England is not thought incompatible with a due and wholesome Administration of Justice, that in Criminal Prosecutions the Judge on the Bench is Counsel for the Prisoner; and the Practice of British Judges, whom the said Sir Elijah Impey was commissioned to represent in India, is consonant to the said Maxim, which is*, not more founded in Mercy than in Justice; for the Counsel and Advocates for Prisoners are not permitted, in Capital Cafes, to address the Jury, and the Prisoner, being often unbilled in.Kufinefs, unaccuf-fomed to address public Assemblies, diffracted and depressed by his Situation, or otherwise unqualified to plead his own Cause, would lose the fair Advantage to which he is entitled^ of commenting on the Evidence, observing on the comparative Credit of the Witnesses, and furnishing to the Jury the Lights and Assistance of which they (land in Need in long and intricate Enquiries, if the said Defect in Criminal Trials was not supplied, and perhaps fully compen-fated, by the said Practice of the Judges, who take especial Care, both during the Trial, and in their Charges to the Jury after the Evidence is closed, that the Accused shall have the full and* fair Advantage of all that is favourable in his Cafe. That without such Assistance from the Bench, in the helpless and forlorn Condition of Prisoners (landing on Trial for their Lives, Innocence would be frequently overborne and confounded, even in England. But the said Assistance from the Bench is (till more requisite in dispensing the Penal Laws of England to the Native Inhabitants of India, since the Ignorance of Prisoners, being Natives of the said Provinces, both in the Law and in the Language of the Court which is to pronounce on their Lives, muff: utterly disqualify them for making any Defence for themselves. That the said Sir Elijah Impey did, on One Hand, conform to the Practice of English) Courts, by refusing to permit the Counsel for the said Maha Rajah to address the Jury on Behalf of their Client; and he was the more bound not to omit or to neglect the said Other Practice of English Judges, which supplies the Prisoner’s Loss of Assistance from the Bar, by the Vigilance and Authority of the Bench: But the said Sir Elijah Impey not only wilfully failed altogether in that important Branch of his Duty, but became in Efteft the Agent and Advocate of the Prosecutor, and pro-

H h nounced

liounced a Charge, when he summed up the Evidence given on the said Trial, with the most gross and scandalous Partiality, dwelling on all the Points which appeared favourable to the Prosecution, and either omitting altogether, or passing lightly over, such as were favourable to the Prisoner, and manifesting, throughout the whole Proceeding, an ardent Wish and determined Purpose to effett the Ruin and Death of the said Maha Rajah. That the said Partiality and the said Purpose are particularly obvious in his Observations on the Evidence of a certain Wit-hess named Kijfen Juan Dojs, which, if true or be-

lieved, the said Sir Elijah Impey did himself admit, mud acquit the Prisoner, but which he laboured at great Length, and with unwearied Pains, Ingenuity, and Art, to diferedit, on flight, trivial, and insufficient Grounds; while he barely touched on the strong-elt and most valid Objections, both to the Competence and Credit of certain other Witnesses, on whose Evidence the Conviction of the said Maha Rajah rested; and the said Sir Elijah Impey was not contented with passing slightly over the said several Objections to the said Witnesses, but did falsely, and knowing himself the Fallhood'thereof, represent the said Witnesses as credible and unimpeached in their Characters i although the said Sir Elijah Impey had himself Personally witnessed Fallhood, Prevarication, Venality, and Infamy in One of the said Witnesses, in former Proceedings before himself, and respecting the said Maha Rajah; and the ipid Sir Elijah Impey had again, after the Trial and Conviction of the said Maha Rajah, on the Evidence of the said Witnesses, and while the said Maha Rajah lay under Sentence of Death, in Consequence thereof, further Instances and stronger Proof, in other Proceedings also before himself, and from the Confellion and Declaration of One of the said Witnesses himself, made and delivered in his own Presence, that he the said Witness was a Person of infamous Character, and ought not to be believed on his Oath. But the said Sir Elijah Impey did nevertheless refuse to relpite the said Sentence, and did cause the same to be executed, although the said Circumstances did raise a strong Presumption of the Innocence of the said Maha Rajah, and did at least throw great Doubt and Uncertainty on his Guilt.

That by virtue of the Statute and . Charter aforesaid. Authority is given to the Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature, in Criminal Cafes, to grant or to refuse an Appeal from the Judgment of the said Court, as they shall think proper. That, after Judgment of Death had been passed on the said Maha Rajah, a Petition of Appeal was presented on his Behalf to the said Supreme Court. That the Circumstances aforesaid of Doubt, both in Point of Law and Fast, and more especially the Difference of Opinion between Sir Robert Chamb, One of the Judges, and the said Sir Elijah Impey and the other Judges, on a Point which involved the Legality of the whole Proceedings, and which direCUy affected the Life o( the said Prisoner, did render it the Duty of the said Sir Elijah Impey to grant the said Appeal. That the manifest Injustice of subjecting the said Maha Rajah, a Native of India, to the Penalty of Death under a British Statute, for a Crime which was not liable to the Punishment of Death by the Native Laws of the said Provinces; and the Establishment thereby of a general Principle, by which the Native Inhabitants became liable to all the penal and local Statutes of England, without Distinction or Modification, and in some Instances to the Penalty of Death, for Act ions which, although not agreeable to the Manners of England, and for that Reason forbid by the English Law, are not forbid by the Laws of , and are not even Criminal in themselves, but are universally practised by all the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces; and the Impossibility that the Legislature could intend

to establish a Piinciple so Tyrannical and so absurd, even although the Letter of the Statute or Charter had been capable of bearing such a Construction; that the said several Considerations did render it further the manifest: Duty of the said Sir Elijah Impey to grant the said Appeal. That the peculiar Situation of the said Prisoner, as the Accuser of the said and the strong Grounds which the same afforded to believe that the said Prosecution was set on Foor, not for the ordinary Purposes of Justice, but for other and unjustifiable Purposes, did also further iner&afe the Propriety and Necessity of granting the said Appeal.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey did, notwithstanding all thq said Considerations, and in Opposition to his manifest Duty in all the said Respects, refuse the said Appeal.

That the said Supreme Court had also, by virtue of the said Statute and Charter, Authority to reprieve and suspend the Execution of all Capital Sentences, until His Majesty’s Pleasure Should be known; and several Applications were made on Behalf of the said Maha Rajah to the said Court, for the said Purpose; and, particularly, an Application was made for the said Purpose by Mobarach al Nabob of the

said Provinces, which, amongst other Grounds urged therein, did especially represent the Ruin and Trouble which would be occasioned to the Inhabitants of his Country, and the Rigour and Hardship which would ensue, if Transactions which had happened before the Arrival of His Majesty’s Charter, Should be tried by the Englijf} Law lately introduced, and punished Capitally, although not liable to such Punishment by the Laws and Customs of his Country; and did also set forth the former Services of the said Maha Rajah to the English Nation, his, the said Nabob’s, own Conviction of his Innocence, and the probable Malice of his Prosecutors, who had long been his declared Foes.

That all the Considerations, which rendered it, as aforesaid, the Duty of the said Sir Elijah. Impey to grant the said Appeal, did also render it his Duty to reprieve and suspend the Execution of the said Sentence of Death, until His Majesty’s Pleasure should be known; more especially since it was impossible that the Objects of Justice could in any Event be defeated thereby; for the very imprisonment of the Maha Rajah, during so long an Interval as must have elapsed before the Signification of His Majesty’s Pleasure could be received in India,would have amounted to a Punishment as severe as the Crime of the said Maha Rajah was liable to, either by the Laws and Customs of the said Maha Rajah’s Country, or even by those of England,previous to the said Statute of George the Second.

That, notwithstanding the many powerful and obvious Considerations aforesaid, the said Sir Elijah Impey did refuse to respire the Execution of the said Sentence, and did cause the same to be executed accordingly.

That the said Sir Elijah Impty'% proceeding to try the said Indictment of a Person not within the Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court, on a penal and capital Statute which did not extend to and

was not Law within the said Provinces; and the partial and undue Means by which he procured the Jury to convict the said Maha Rajah, on false and insufficient Evidence; and his Refusal to grant the said Appeal, and to respite the said Sentence, notwithstanding all the several Circumstances and Considerations aforesaid, do evince and demonstrate a corrupt Interest of the said Sir Elijah Impey in the Destruction of the said Maha Rajah, for Purposes detestable in themselves, but much more detestable in the said Sir Elijah Impey'% peculiar Station.

That the said Trial and Execution were contrary to Law, and were contrary to Justicq, and were re- pugnant

' pugnant to the Spirit and Intention of the Establishment of the said Supreme Court; and disappointed therein the just and salutary Object of His Majesty and of the Parliament; and brought Disrepute and Shame on the said Supreme Court at its first Institu-tien; and deprived the said Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces of all Confidence in the Law or

Justice 5 and deterred all Native Inhabitants from daring to accuse or complain of any who

might in future injure or oppress them; and gave just ’ Grounds to the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces, and to the rest of the World, for believing that the said Proceedings were the Fruit of a corrupt and wicked Confederacy between the said Sir Elijah impey and the said tVarren Hajlings, or his Abettors, for the Purpose of screening the said Warren Hajlings from a just Accusation, by accomplishing the Death of his Accuser; and that the Law of England was made the Engine and Instrument of the said Confederacy j and the said Sir Elijah was, and is, in

all and singular the said Particulars, guilty of High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

SECOND CHARGE.

Patna Cause.

THAT ill the Year of our Lord 1772, the Power and Authorities relative to the Ordering, Management, and Government of the Territorial Acquisitions and Revenues in the Provinces of Babar, and

as aforesaid, and did report upon the same in Manner and Form as they had been used and accustomed to do ever since the Establishment of such Courts as aforesaid, under the Authority of the Govern-

ment, and were, by their Skill in the Laws, Languages, Manners, Customs, and Religion of the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces, eminently qualified for the Execution of the aforesaid Trusts reposed in them: That at Patna aforesaid, in the Province of Bahar aforesaid, in the Year of our Lord 1777, a certain Suit was commenced in the Court of the Provincial Council of Patna, then and there fitting and acting as a Court of Justice, between -der Beg Khan, Nephew and adopted Son of one Shabbar Beg Khan, deceased, a Native of Caloul, and Nauderah Begum, Widow of the said Shabbar; in

which the said Babader Beg claimed his Share of the Inheritance of the Deceased, according to the Ma-bomedan Law, and did present a Petition to the said Provincial Council of Patna, {fating his Right to the said Inheritance, and that the Widow was secreting and removing the Effects of the Deceased, and therefore prayed, that the Officers of Justice Should be stationed to prevent such Removal, “ and that an Order Should be issued to the Cawzee, to ascertain “ his Right, and having established his Right, that “ the said Cawzee Should give Information to the said “ Provincial Council, in order that he, the Petitioner, might obtain his Right.” — That such Suit, the Parties being Mahomedans, according to the Prayer of the said Petition, and the Practice of the Courts, was referred by the said Provinical Council to a cer-> tain Cawzee, and certain Mufties, by Name Cawzee Sadhi, Muftie Barnctoolah, and Muftie Gullaum Muck-

doom, being Officers versed in the Mahomedan Law, belonging to the said Court, according to the usual Practice of the said Provincial Council of Patna, and the true Intent and Meaning of the Powers, Rights, and Authorities, so continued to them by the said Governor General and Council of Bengal as aforesaid, and the true Intent and Meaning of the said Regulations; according to the Tenor of which, it was their Duty to adminiflrer Justice in the said Province of Bahar: That the said Suit was duly proceeded upon, according to the Usage and Practice of the Courts aforesaid; and the said Cawzee and Mufties did, according to the Duty of their Office, the Practice of former Times, and the absolute Command of their Superiors, examine the Witnesses, and did regularly report the Evidence, and their Opinion upon the Validity of certain Deeds, under which the said Nauderah Begum did claim the Property of the Deceased, to the Provincial Council, and after recapitulating the Evidence, did conclude the same in Bubftance as follows: — “ That as it appeared to them, “ from their Enquiry, the Will and Deed of Gift under which the Widow claimed, were spurious, 4< and not deserving of Credit, from many Circumstances j that as the contradictory Relations of Coja *c Zekereab (the Representative of the Widow) did

t( confirm their Belief of their being so; as an Ekrar Aum, viz.another of the Deeds relied on by the

“ Widow, was not of itself sufficient to secure Succession to the Inheritance; and as the Marriage * Settlement, which was another of the Deeds relied on by the Widow, was- not produced to them; and of as Coja Zekereab founded the Widow’s Claim upon “ all the Three together^ and as, in Short, every “ Thing urged on the Part of Coja Zekereab wanted “ Support} and, on the other Hand, s

tf Story appeared clear and explicit j they therefore recommended, that, exclusive of some Property in Ultumgaw, which composed no Part of the In-

heritance, all the Property of the Deceased Should “ be divided imo Four Parts, whereof Three Should

“ be given in Trust to Behader Khan, his Father being the legal Heir of the Deceased, and himlclf the iC adopted Son, and the remaining One to “ the Widow of the Deceased:” — And the Provincial Council aforesaid did, upon receiving the above Report, and the same not being excepted against, nor in anywise objected to (although the said Nauderah Begum, or her said Representative or Vakeel the said Coja Zekereab, had Notice thereof) give Judgment

according thereto; which said Judgment neither was at the Time, nor has it been since, appealed against, nor anywise objected to, according to any 5f die Forms in Use in the said Provinces, for appealing from, or impeaching Judgments given by, the Provincial Councils.

That in Consequence of the said Judgment, a Perwannah or Precept was issued to the said Cawzee Sadhi, Muftie Barnctcclah, and Muftie Gullaum Muck-

deem, by the said Provincial Council, for die Execution of the said Judgment, according to the Tenor thereof: That the said Cawzee 'Sadhi, Muftie tcoLih, and Muftie Gull aura whose Duty it

was to execute the Proccls of the fin’d Court, did, according to the Exigency of the said PerSvannah or Precept, and according to the belt of their Judgment and Ability, execute the fame: That subsequent to the said Judgment and the Execution following the reupon, the said Nauderah Begum did, on the Day of in the Year of our E^ord 1779,

commence an Addon of Trespass, in the Supreme Court of Justice hereinafter mentioned, against the said Cawzee Sadhi, Muftie Barnctoolah, and Muftie Gullaum Muckdoom,f<or the Part which they had taken in making the said Report, and in executing the Judgment aforesaid, according to the Orders and Commands of their Superiors, and against the said Babader Beg, for the Part which he had taken in claiming his Rights as aforesaid.

That in pursuance of the said A eft, made in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, certain Letters Patent issued under the Great Seal, appointing and establishing a Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, with Power to exercise all Civil and other Jurisdiction, in Manner and Form as is in the said Act and the said Letters Patent mentioned: That Sir Elijah Inpcy, at that Time Eljah Impey, Esquire, was nominated and ap-

pointed, by the said Letters Patent, to the Office of Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court of Judicature.

That the Powers and Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court are, by the said Act of Parliament and Letters Patent, strictly and clearly defined and limited: That the said Elijah Impey, and the other Judges of the said Supreme Court, had, by the said Letters Patent, full Power and Authority to make such Orders for their Proceedings as the Justice of the same Should seem to require, and to hear the respective Allegations of Parties, and to give Judgment according to Justice and Right: That the said Court of Judicature was formed upon Principles materially different from those which form the Balls of Courts of Justice, the Judges of the said Court of Judicature having the Province both of Judge and Jury assigned to them; and the said Supreme Court, or the Judges of the fame, were not bound to adopt Modes and Forms of Proceeding inapplicable to the Principles of its Formation, and to the State and Condition of the Inhabitants of the Country over whom they were to administer Justice; but, on the contrary, were bound to govern and demean themselves, in Cafes within their Jurisdiction, according to the Laws of England, as nearly only as the Circumstances and the Condition of the same might seem to require, and so far as the Circumstances and Occasions of

1 the

)

the said Provinces (meaning the Provinces of Beng

bar, and Orijfa) ana People (meaning the Natives of the

laid Provinces) should admit and require :.That the said Sir ElijahImpey well knew that he was not bound to follow strictly and technically the Forms and Pro* ceedings used in the CouTts of Law and

well knew that it was his Duty to accommodate both the Principles and Practice used in the Courts of Law in England to the Manners, Customs, Laws, and Religion of the Native Inhabitants over whom he was lent to administer Justice; that such Accommodation was essential to the great Ends of Justice, and to the fulfilling the beneficent Intentions of the Legiflarure, and the gracious Commands of His Majesty, communicated to the said Impey by the said Letters Patent, and to the determining according to Justice and Right.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey has frequently declared it to be his Duty to vary the Forms of Proceedings, and to depart from and vary the Rules of Pleading used in the Law of England, according to the Circumstances of the Country, and has frequently exercised the Power and Authority so to do.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey is therefore highly culpable and grossly Criminal, if ever he permitted the rooted Prejudices of the Native Inhabitants of Bengal, &c. to be Ihocked, their Principles of Government overset, their Judges and Magistrates disgraced, and their Laws and Religion violated, by too ftrilt an Adherence to Laws framed for another State of Society, other Manners, and a different Religion: That the said Sir Elijah Impey was still more grossly Criminal if he permitted all this to be done from a rigid Adherence to Form and not to Substance, to technical and minute Niceties, and not to leading, fblid, and essential Principles; and such a Conduit, if ever followed, cannot be aferibed to Ignorance or Error in Judgment (if Ignorance in a Chief Justice could be an Excuse) but must be aferibed to Injustice, Partiality, Corruption, and an outrageous Lust for Power and Authority.

That the said Supreme Court was by no Part of the said Alt of Parliament or Letters Patent, authorized to supersede the established Powers and Authorities of the Courts to which the Native Inhabitants of the said Provinces had been accustomed to resort for the due and regular Administration of Justice, according to their own Manners, Forms, Laws, Customs, and Religion; or in any same whatsoever to hold Pleas of Trespass, &c. against any of the said Natives, of what Religion soever, except in the Cafes hereinafter mentioned, that is to say, First, where such Native should be, or should have been, directly or indirectly, in the Service of the United Company of Merchants trading to the East; and Se-

condly, where the Cause of Altion should arise upon a Contralt or Agreement in Writing above the Value of 500 Current Rupees,-and wherein the said Parties Should have-mutually agreed, that in case of Dispute, the Matter Should be determined in the Supreme Court; in which last same only the Supreme Court was authorized and empowered, whenever any such Altion Should have been first commenced in any of the Country Courts of Justice, on the Petition of either Party suggesting such Agreement in Writing, on Oath, to award and issue a Writ or Precept di-relted to either of the said Parties, commanding him or them immediately to surcease proceeding in the said Suit, and was thereupon itself empowered to hear and determine the said Suit.

That the said several Powers exercised by the Provincial Councils as aforesaid, and permitted by the said Alt of Parliament and Letters Patent to be exer'-cifed by the said Supreme Court of Judicature, were wholly diltinlt, separate, and independant Powers and Authorities.

Vol. XLIII. '

That the said Provincial Cotihcils were fiot irt arty-wife bound to proceed according to the Laws of England:That from the very Nature of their Con-d ftitution, and the Objelts principally within their Jurisdiction, such Proceedings would have been im- possible, because the Laws, Manners, Customs, and Religion of the Natives of the said Provinces differ eflfentially and fundamentally from the Laws, Manners, Customs, and Religion of the British Subjells.

That the said Supreme Court possessed no Jurisdiction, either Original or Appellant, over the said Provincial Courts, and was not authorized, under any Pretence whatsoever; to controul or interfere with the Process of the said Courts: That; in the Angle same of a written Agreement between the Parties in a Cause, the said Supreme Court was authorized to' stay Proceedings by a Writ direlied to the Parties; but that the said Writ could not extend to the Judges of the said Provincial Court, in any same or under any Pretence whatsoever.

That the said Provincial Councils, and the Members and Officers thereof, were not therefore, in anywise or under any Pretence whatsoever, responsible to the said Supreme Court, for any Alts done or omitted to be done by them in the Course of their Judicial Administration.

That as neither the final Judgment nor the intermediate Process of the said Provincial Councils was, either directly or indirectly, subject to the Controul of the Supreme Court; so neither could the Officers, appointed by the said Provincial Councils to execute such Process as Should be direlted to them, whether' intermediate or final, be taken or understood to be, in anywise or under any Colour or Fiftion whatsoever, subject to the Authority of the Supreme Court.

That the said Impey well knew, that if it had been in the Contemplation of the Legislature of this Country, providing, as they endeavoured, a Remedy for the Defelts and Failures of former judicial Establishments, by the Creation of the Supreme Court, to entrust the said Court with the Administration of Justice among the Natives, it could not pofllbly have escaped their Wisdom or their Benevolence, to have invested the said Supreme Court, either with a direlt and intelligible Authority to hear and determine all Causes between the Natives in the first Instance, or with an ultimate Appellant Jurisdiction from the Sentence of the said Country Courts.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey well knew that the Intention of Parliament was directly opposite to such a Construction; having himself declared from the Bench, upon his Arrival at Bengal, that the said Letters Patent were not meant in anywise to extend to the established Courts of Judicature, to which the Native Inhabitants of the Provinces had been accustomed to resort.

That an Altion of Trespass was commenced as aforesaid by the said Nauderab Begum, against the said Bahader Beg, and the said Cauzee and Mustees, for the Alts done by them as aforesaid, the one as Suitor, and the others as Officers ailing under the Orders of the Provincial Council as aforesaid.

That in Prosecution of a wicked and arbitrary Design of extending his own Authority and that of the said Supreme Court, in the Provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orijfa, and of destroying the Confidence

of the Natives in the Administration of Justice in their own Courts, and the established Government under which they lived, of rendering the due and regular Execution of those high Trulls with which the-Judges of the Mahomedan Law were invested, dangerous to themselves, and unprofitable to the People, he the said Impey did proceed in the said Cause to Trial and Judgment.

That in the Course of the Proceedings in the said Altion, the said Elijah Impey did betray many In-

rnent of the Cauzee; nor can we expert the other Officers of these Courts to carry any Orders of Consequence into Execution, till they are allured u of Safety and Protection in the Discharge of their “ Duty.”

That on tendering the said Bail to the said Amount, the Sheriff’s Officer having the Execution of the said Writ, informed the said Provincial Council, that he could not, agreeable to his Instructions, accept of any Bail without first mentioning it, and receiving further Orders from the Court.

That the said Sheriff’s Officer further informed the said Council, that his Orders in this same were particularly ftriCl, and that the Parties could not, as it was usual for Persons arrested, be allowed to remain in their own Houses until the Time for carrying them away, but -mult remain in Boats on the River till he had further Directions in what Manner to dispose of them.

That in Consequence of the refusing the said Tender of Bail, and of the said further Orders given to the said Sheriff’s Officer, the said Cauzee was dragged from his House, and kept in hard and rigorous Confinement for a long Time in a Boat'on the River, that is to say, until the said Sheriff’s Officer could send to Calcutta, in thp Province of Bengal, at the Distance of 500 Miles as aforesaid, and until he could receive an Answer land further Directions as to the Disposal of the said Prisoners; and that the said Cauzee and Babader Beg were not set at Liberty until Sixteen Days after the said Arrest, at which Time the said Sheriffs Officer had received Instructions from Calcutta aforesaid to admit all the Defendants to Bail.

That when the said Action of Trespass, so commenced as aforesaid by the said Nauderab Begum against the said Defendants, came on to be tried in the Supreme Court before the said Elijah Impey, Babader Beg Khan,one/ of the Defendants to the said

Action, did offer a certain Plea, in the Nature of a Plea to the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, setting forth, that he was not within the Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court, he the said Babader Beg being neither direClly nor indirectly in the Service of the East India Company, being only a Security for One of the Renters of Part of the DistriCls in the Provinces aforesaid.

That in Support of the said Plea, William Young, Esquire, One of the Members of the said Council at Patna, deposed, “ That he did not know that the said “ Babader Beg held any Employ under the Company, “ or under the Provincial Council at Patna: That “ he could not hold any such Employ without the “ Knowledge of him the said William That

“ the Provinces of Gbtdore and Amertoo were let to c< Farm to one Zulficar AH, between whom and the “ said Provincial Council written Engagements had “ been entered into; and that the said Babader Beg “ was Security for the said Zulficar Ali: That the “ Security was sometimes in FaCt the Principal, but that there was nothing particular to make him, the said Young, suspect that Babader Beg was the Prin-* cipal: That until Failure of the Principal, it is not a Question with Government whether they shall “ come upon the Security for the Balance.”

That nevertheless the said Impey did, by a forced and unjufiifiable Construction of the Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, and the Letters Patent issued in Consequence of the said Act as aforesaid, and by a forced and unjustifiable Perversion of the Evidence of the said William Young, Esquire, maintain and decide, that the said Babader Beg was the real Farmer of the said DistriCls of Gbtdore and Amtr-too, and was thereby within the Meaning of the said Act and Letters Patent; and under those Pretences

did dilallow and over-rule the said Plea to the Jurisdiction of the said Supreme Court.

That the violent and arbitrary Proceedings of the said Impey, in thus extending the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to Persons over whom the said Act and Letters Patent had given him no Authority whatsoever, was not only an Act of great Injustice and Oppression towards the said Babader Begy'rn subjecting him to the Power and Influence 6f Laws which he could not know; but was calculated to excite (and did in Fadl excite) a general Alarm among all Ranks of Persons, and deter.the Natives from undertaking the Management or Improvement of the Farms; and tended thereby essentially to injure the Revenues and weaken the Authority of the India Company.

That in Consequence of the Opinion delivered by the said Impey on the said Plea to the Jurisdidlton (wthereby it was declared, that the having once held a Farm, or been a Security for a Farmer of the Revenues, shall subject such Person for ever after, in all Cafes whatsoever, to the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Judicature) Various Petitions and Remonstrances were presented to the said Provincial Council of Patna: That in particular the principal Natives and Renters of the rich Province of Babar did, by Petition and Remonstrance to the said Council, uepnefent the extreme Hardships and Misery of their Situation, dating, “ That they had not the “ smallest Knowledge of the Laws and Customs of the English Court; that those Laws were formed for

another State of Society, Religion, and Country; *« that their own Courts were regulated by the Laws *« and Customs of their own Country, and that the Gentlemen appointed to preside in them, were or-« dered to decide according to the ancient Constitu* tiens; that to these they repaired without Fear; they pleaded their Causes themselves, or through *« their Vakeels, in their own Manner, no Expence or “ Delay attending the Process; that the Regulations “ were so framed that Justice might, be dispensed to “ all, and yet a due Attention and Support be given «« to the Collections; that Farmers and Zemindars “ were not to be called in, on any Account, during " the Season of the Harvest; but that since the Decifion of the Supreme Court, no one would pay the lead Regard to the Time when the Settlement and Collections most required their Presence in the “ Pergunnah Sarejfa, but that they might be dragged “ away by a Warrant in the Night, without having “ Time to settle their Affairs.

“ That many of them could not pay a Deputy to “ take Charge of the Collections; and that if they <c could, the Ryots would not regard a Deputy when “ they Should fee the Principal seized like a Robber, “ and hurried away to a Place whence it was possible “ he might never return.

« That Consequence and Authority are absolutely " necessary to enforce the Collections, for that the “ Ryots are always glad of any Pretext to elude the “ Payment of their Rents; but who would venture to “ enforce the Payment of them, when he Should renr “ der himself liable by it to an Action of Trespass in “ an English Court of Justice, and to be dragged “ away, to the Distance of or 500 Miles, at the Suit “ of the most litigious or contumacious Person in the “ Pergunnah?

“ That even after Acquittal their same is equally of deplorable: Turned forth from Prison at an immense Distance from his Friends and his Home, the “ Farmer, on his Return, finds his Credit, loft, and his “Farm, his foie Dependance, perhaps ruined, or gone into other Hands, while he is (till answerable for his “ Arrears to Government, with whom no Plea of “ what he had suffered would be heard in Miti-« gation.

« That

124 ix° Decembris. 1787.

“ That having the n> for the first Time, after the u Supreme Court had existed Four Years, heard of Mt their being amenable to its Jurisdiction, and not

having been aware of it at the Time they made “ their Agreements with Government, they beg to of relinquish their Farms, and retire with their Fami-

lies, into another Country.”

That besides the said Plea to the Jurisdiction so pleaded to the said Babader Beg, the said and

the said other Defendants pleaded the General IlTue Not Guilty to the said Actions 5 and further, delivered in Two separate Notices of Jollification, under the Authority of a Rule of the said Supreme Court, whereby Defendants were enabled to give the special Matter in Evidence ujjon delivering a Notice of the same to the Plaintiffs, the true Object and Intent of which Rule was to enable Defendants to go into the Merits of their Cafes, without being hampered with all those Niceties with which special Pleas in Jullification are attended in the 'Practice of the British Courts of Justice.

That the Jullification of Babader Beg Hated, that he took Possession of the Portion of the Goods allotted him under the Judgment of a Court competent to hold Cognizance of his Suit; and that all the Acts whereof the Plaintiff had complained against him, were Acts done by him as a Suitor in the said Court, humbly soliciting Justice in the fame.

That under Pretence of administering Justice according to the English Laws, and the Rules and Practice on Proceedings in England, the said Impey, after hearing the Arguments in Support of the said Plea of Jullification, arbitrarilyover-ruled the fame, and would not permit the said Babader Beg to enter into Proof of the Allegations contained therein.

That the false Pretence under which the said Impey over-ruled the said Notice of Jullification, was as follows, that is to say. That the said Notice did not cover all the Counts in the Plaint exhibited by the Plaintiff Nauderab Begum; thereby attempting to apply Rules and Maxims supposed to be applicable to special Pleas of Jollification in England, to a same totally distinct and different, and to a same which it had been the Object of a particular Rule framed by himself, to take out of all those Rules and Maxims which he the said Impey, in Defiance of the Justice of the Cafe, and of the true Sense and Spirit of his own Rules and Regulations, thus applied to them; and the said Babader Beg was thereby precluded from going into that which would, and in Justice ought, to have been a full and compleat Jullification.

That by the said Letters Patent issued in pursuance of the Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty as aforesaid, the said Elijah Impey was in no wife enjoined to proceed according to the strict and technical Formalities adopted in the Proceedings of British Courts, whenever the essential Distribution of Justice might suffer by too rigid an Adherence to them; but on the contrary, was permitted by the said Letters Patent to exercise a discretionary Power of relaxing the said Forms of Practice, in whatever Degree the substantial Justice of the same Should seem to require.

That the said Impey was therefore well and duly apprized, that he was not bound to proceed according to those Principles of Practice which formed a Rule of Conduct of which he knew the Defendant to be ignorant: That it was his Duty.to use the Discretion with which His Majesty in His said Letters Patent had inverted him, to relax the Severity of those Forms whenever they should Hand in the Way of the essential Administration of Justice: That in the present Instance the Jullification of Babader Beg, even admitting that it was not drawn with due technical Skill and Propriety, did, in Point of Fast, meet

and deny the Wrong and Injury with which he was charged.

That the true Administration of Justice to the Natives in India will be rendered utterly impracticable if a Judge, catching at the Semblance of a Departure from the rigid Forms and Mysteries of English special Pleading, shall be authorized to deny a Defendant the Right of going into the Merits of his Cafe, and of justifying himself by his own Usage* and Laws.

That in thus perverting the Rules of Proceeding, under the Pretence of being compelled to govern himself according to the most rigid Forms and Principles of Pleading adopted in the British Courts, and applying the same to Cafes totally different and dif-tinct, and to which he well knew they were wholly inapplicable, the said Impey committed great and wanton Injustice towards the said Defendant; that he thereby proved himself to be a partial and corrupt Judge, and was guilty of a High Crime and Misdeameanour.

That the said other Defendants, Cauzee Mustee Barucktoolab, and Mustee Gullaum did also offer to the said Impey another Notice of Justification, Hating, “ That the Council of Patna were “ a Court of Justice for the Province of Bahar; that *c they, the Defendants, were Officers attending the said ,c Courts that all Civil Suits arising within the Jurisdiction of, and brought before, the said Provincial '* Council, where the Parties were were

“ used to be determined according to the Mabomedan u Law, and for that Purpose were referred to certain Moulavies or public and known Officers, versed in

the Mabomedan Law, and called by the Name of " Cauzee and Mustees; which said Officers upon hearing the Parties, or their Vakeels, made a Report to the said Council of j and that thereupon the Court of Provincial Council passed Judgment upon the fame, subject to an Appeal to the “ Governor General and Council at Fort William, &c. “ That an Action was commenced in the said Court, “ in which Nauderab Begum, the Plaintiff in this present Action, was Defendant; that the said Action was “ referred to them the said Defendants, being Cauzee “ and Mustees attending the said Court} that they “ did proceed to examine the said Suit according to “ the Mabomedan Laws, and having heard the Parties, “ did make a Report of the same to the said Council “ of Patna, who thereupon passed Judgment, and if- sued Process of Execution accordingly} and that “ all and every the Acts complained of by the said “ Nauderab Begum in the said Plaint filed, &c. as “ Trespasses, were no Trespasses, but Acts done by “ the said Defendants in their respective Capacities “ of Cauzee and Mustees - as aforesaid, and as their Duty in such Capacities required.”

That the said Elijah Impey did also over-rule the said Jullification pleaded by the said other Defendants, under Colour and Pretence of a supposed Maxim of the Laws of England, Delegatus non potejt delegare; that is to say, that the said Provincial Council of Patna, possessing only a delegated Authority themselves, had no Right to delegate such Authority to others, which, upon the Face of the Jollification, they had done in the present Instance; and under a further Pretence* that it did not appear upon the Face of the Justifica-tien, by what Authority the Council of Patna rieferred Actions to the said Cauzees and Muftees} although it was dated upon the Face of the said Notice of Justification, that the constant Usage and Practice had been, ever since the Iijftitution of such Courts, ta make such References, and the same were id Sense and Substance Part of the Constitution of the said Courts.

That the said Impey well knew that the said Maxim

of

by

of Delegatus non potejl delegare, did riot universally prevail even in that Code of Jurisprudence which he pretended to make his Example and his Rule for the Distribution of Jutfice: But that the Application of the said Maxim to the same of a Mahomedan Defendant, justifying his Procee'dings as a Mahomedan Magistrate compelled to act under the Orders of a Court of Justice erected and fcftabliflied by British Subjects, was in the highest Degree injurious and oppressive.

That the said Impey well knew, that neither by the Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, nor by the Letters Patent issued as aforesaid in Consequence of the said Act, he possessed any Right to interfere with, or controul, or reverse, any Acts or Judgments, or any Proceeding whatsoever, of the native Mahomedan Courts: That all illegal Proceedings of the said Courts,.if any there Should be, were removable by Appeal to another Tribunal, namely, the President and Council, and, after the said Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, the Governor General and Council at Fort William: That if the Rights and Authorities of any Body of Men, either in their individual Capacity, or incorporated as a Court of Justice, were infringed or invaded by the Practice of referring Causes usually adopted by the Provincial Councils, they were not the Rights of the Supreme Court Judicature, but of the Governor General and Council: That the said Governor General and Council had not only tolerated, but approved, -the Practice which was adjudged by the said Impey to be Criminal and illegal, as it tended to reconcile the Natives to the Government of the Eajt India Company, by suffering them to live under the Influence of those Institutions which they had been accustomed to reverence and obey.

That the said- Impey further knew that he was mif-

applying this Maxim of Delegatus.non potejl delegare, for the Purpose of Oppression and Injustice; as it appeared on the Face of the Justification of the said Defendants, that in Causes where only Mahomedans were Parties, the said Defendants being Cauzee and Mustees as aforesaid, did possess, and were from Time immemorial accustomed to exercise Jurisdiction.

That such Jurisdiction was not diverted or taken away from them by any Thing contained in the said Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, appointing a Governor General and Council to preside over and order all Things for the Government arid Administration of Justice in the Territorial Possessions of the said East India Company: That the Perwannah or Precept issuing from the said Provincial Council, tinder which the said Defendants acted, as aforesaid, was an Order to judicial Officers for the Exercise of an Authority which they had been used and accustomed to exercise from Time immemorial.

That the said Impey further knew that the Defendants, being such Mahomedan Officers as aforesaid, were bound to obey the Perwannah or Precept so issued to them as aforesaid, according to the Exigency thereof: That he well knew that it was not competent to the said Defendants to esquire,.nor, if it was competent, had they the Means of enquiring, whether the Authority usually exercised by the Provincial Council of Patna, their immediate Superiors, in referring Causes to their Investigation, were or were not contrary to the Terms of the Appointment of the /aid Provincial Councils, or an Invasion of the paramount Rights and Authorities of the Governor General and Council, or a Breach of any Maxim of the Laws of England: That the Cauzee and Mustees stood in the Condition of Subjects of a State which had parted under the Dominion of the British Arms: That to provoke a Discussion of speculative Points, and to stir up a Question of so delicate and dangerous a Tendency, as in what Degree the said Defendants ought or ought not to yield Obedience to the Orders Vol.XLIII.

of the said Provincial Courts, was an Act of aggra^ vated Criminality in the said Elijah Impey; inasmuch as the said Impey,by passing Judgment against thfc said Defendants, not only declared his Sense to be iri Favour of a Principle which, if followed up by other' Mahomedan Officers in Gmilar Situations, must have produced universal Anarchy, or univeffal Revolt throughout the Provinces, but sanctioned thaft Opinion by an Act which operated as a Punilhmeri’t on the said Defendants, for not having furnished an Example of Rebellion to the Natives of in a pofi-tive Resistance to the Orders of the Provincial Court of Patna.

That according to the Analogy of the Laws of England, which the said Impey has often affected to make the Rule of his Conduct, and according to the Analogy of the Acts made for the Protection of Officers acting under the Orders of Courts of Justice, of by virtue of Writs or Warrants from them, the said Impey ought to have permitted the said Perwannah to have been given in Evidence upon the Plea of Not Guilty, as a Justification, without compelling the tri to prove that which it was impossible for Men in their Situation to prove; viz.the Regularity of the Pro-, ceedings of the said Council, and the Regularity of their respective Appointments j and which Irregularity, if it had existed, it would have been impossible for them to have offered to the said Council as a Ground for tefufing Obedience to the said Perwannah in the First Instance.

That if this Authority was original and not delegated, the said Elijah Impey was highly Criminal in applying it to the present Defendants, and cannot be justified under the comriiori Fallibility of humad Judgment.

That if the said Authority was delegated and not! original, the said Impey,besides being guilty of a High

Crime and Misdemeanor in endeavouring to stir up the Discussion of dangerous Questions, as to the Limits at which the Obedience of the Natives to the ruling Authority ought to stop, was further guilty of a Criminal Omission of his Duty, in not exercising the Discretion with which the said Letters Patent had inverted him, and dispensing with a Maxim of the English Law, which he knew was not universal, in a same in which it was notoriously impossible that the Parties Defendant could by any Means have had Notice of its Tendency and Operation.

That the said Impey was further guilty of a wanton Perversion of the English Laws, in calling upon the said Defendants to establish the Legality of their own Acts under the Authority of the Provincial Council, further than in obeying the Exigency of the Perwannah so directed to them as aforesaid: That the Professional Experience of the said Impey well enabled him to know that Officers, having the Execution of any Writs that issue out of the Courts to which they belong, cannot, under any Pretence whatsoever, dispute the Authority, or object any Irregularity in the Proceedings in Consequence of which the said Writs issue* more especially in Cafes notoriously within the Jurisdiction of the Court; and that this Principle has been established and recognized in many of the oldest Cafes in our Laws.

That it is no where attempted to be proved by the said Plaintiff, or alledged on any Construction by the said Impey, that the Cause in which the said Perwannah issued to the Defendants, was not within the Jurisdiction of the Provincial Council: But that on the contrary the said Impey, in delivering his Opinion on the Justification of the Defendants, expressly ac-» knowledges such Jurisdiction to be in the said Pro* vincial Council.

That under all these Circumstances the Application of this Maxim of Delegatus non potejl delegare, by the £ffeft and Operation of which the said Defendants

K k were

were precluded from going into the Merits of their Cafe, and thus condemned without being heard, was highly unjust:, partial, and oppressive: That it was produttive of serious and fatal Disorders in all the Judicial Departments of the Country Adaulets, where the Natives had been used to seek for Justice in Matters of Litigation between themselves: That by this Decision aforesaid of the said , the Power and Jurisdiction of the Lid Courts was virtually abolished, and the Confidence reposed in their Wisdom and Stability, by the Natives, was effectually destroyed: That the Non-observance of a Maxim, the Knowledge of the Exirtence of which it was impossible that dan Law Officers could obtain, or when obtained, could understand, having thus been adjudged a Trespass against the Laws of England, and to subject the Person offending against it to an Action in the Supreme Court, in which Damages might be recovered against him to any Amount, rendered it difficult to find any Person daring enough to administer the established Justice of the Country, or conform in administering it to its ancient Manners and Constitution: That such was the natural and obvious Consequence of converting the Performance of a public Duty, originating in the Authority of a Magistrate, into the private Responsibility of an Individual.

That as the different Provincial Councils, established in the said Provinces of Bengal, Babar, and , had been ever since their Establishment accustomed to refer Causes of great Moment and Importance, particularly all Questions of Cast, Marriage, and Inheritance (on which the Prejudices of the Natives are the strongest) to the Moulavies or Cauzees and Mustees attending the Courts of the said Councils; and as various and weighty Questions of extensive Property, of the Lawfulness of Marriages, of the Distinction of Calls, in which are comprized the chief Points of Importance in the Mahomedan and Hindoo Religions, had of Necessity been referred to them: By the Application of this Maxim, all Judgments and Decisions passed by the Moulavies or Pundits, to whom such Causes were referred, became from that Instant totally null and void, and as if no such Decisions or any Proceedings in the said Causes had existed: That besides the complicated and dreadful Responsibility instanta-neoufly attached to the Situation of all Officers of the Mahomedan or Hindoo Laws, who might have been concerned in the Administration of Justice under the Faith of their own Institutions, and of the Protection of the Provincial Councils, the Misery and Confusion which must infallibly result from this Determination, to every Individual who might, under a litigated Point in any of the above Questions, have accidentally been within the Exercise of any judicial Authority of his own Courts, at any Time since the Settlement of the English East India Company in the said Pro-

vinces, was well known and well understood by the said Impey: But that the said Impey, actuated by a greedy, corrupt, and tyrannical Motive of drawing all Judicial Proceedings in Cafes in which he had, and in Cafes in which he had no Jurisdiction, within his own Grasp, was careless of any Consequences that might result from the Gratification of his own Avarice for Power, how dangerous soever to the Security of the British Government, or fatal to the Happiness of

-the Natives.

That the said Impey, in the following Extract of a Letter to the Right honourable Lord at

that Time one of His Majesty’s Secretaries of Stare, dated 2d March 1780; that is to say, “ The Business “ of the Court, as I estimate, has fallen off near One " Third, and in a Term or Two, when the Causes u already commenced are got rid of, I expect it will “ be reduced to the Trial of a few Causes arising in “ Calcutta. The Advocates and Officers

" of the Court will be reduced to a most miserable

" Situation. The Attornies have petitioned us, that “ their Number may not be increased by new Admillions, though Persons may come from England “ so qualified. I really apprehend that we shall do lt them (meaning the Attornies from England) little “ Service by admitting them, for. it seems to me, “ that it will be only to give them the Privilege of starving in Company with the present Attornies;” did betray one Motive for the corrupt Extension of the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which his Proceedings in this Cause abundantly prove not to have been absent from his Mind in the Year 1778; a Motive highly disgraceful to the Character and Dignity of an English Judge; and the Tendency of which,

by encouraging a Spirit of Litigation, must prove at all Times highly detrimental to the Public.

That in Consequence of the over-ruling the said Pleas of Justification, so pleaded by the said Bahader Beg, as to his own Part, and by the said other Defendants, Cauzee Sadhee, Mustee and Muf-

tee Cullaum Muckdoom, on their Parts as aforesaid, the said Cause or Action of Trespass was determined in Favour of the Plaintiff Nauderab Begum; and the said Defendants were not permitted by the said Impey to go into their Evidence at that Time, bur, as an Act of special Indulgence ir\ the said Impey, were permitted to offer the said Evidence in Mitigation of Damages.

That in the Course.of examining into the Question of Mitigation of Damages, the said Impey did, in many Instances, conduct himself as a partial and corrupt Judge, particularly in distorting the Rules and Principles of Evidence to the Injury and Opprefiion of the Defendants.

That it appears by the Acknowledgement of the said ' Impey, that this was the first Action within his Memory, where every Thing preliminary to the Merits had not been admitted by such Consent, as the Court could not have admitted without Consent.

That in asserting that the Court had not, in this Instance, the Power to remedy the Grievance of which the said Impey above affects to complain, and that ic was not competent in him to relax from the Severity of those Rules by which Evidence is admitted and re-jedled in British Courts of Justice (especially when the said Impey had, on the First of his Arrival in conceived himself authorized to establish Regulations, dispensing with many other Forms of Proceeding relative to the Admiflibility of Evidence) and, under this Pretence, in compelling the said Defendants to the strict legal Proofs of certain preliminary Points, of public Notoriety, the said Impey was guilty of a Criminal Neglect of his Duty, and of Partiality and Injustice towards the said Defendants.

That the said Impey did first object to the said Defendants, that they had not proved the Appointment of the Provincial Council under whose Orders they the said Defendants had attempted to justify their Proceedings: That by the Laws of England, it was not in anywise incumbent on them to prove the legal Existence of the Court of which they were attendant Officers; but that nevertheless it appears, by the Evidence of Mr. Young, One of the Members of the said Provincial Council at Patna, at the Time the said Action was commenced between Bahader Beg and Nauderab Begum, that the said Court was used to fit and act as a Court of Justice; that the said Defendants were Officers of the said Court; and that in Cafes of Inheritance, where Mahomedansalone were Parties, both the Fadl and the Law were usually referred to them.

That an Action was duly commenced in the said Court, between Bahader Beg on the One Part, and Nauderab Begum on the other; and that the said Parties thereto being Mahomedans, a Perwannah or Precept issued from the said Court, of which the said 2 Mr.

a8 Geo. Ill* 120 D 141

Mr. Young was a Member, to the said Cauzee and

Mustees, dating to them, that Babader Beg and the Widow were disputing concerning the Property of the Deceased, and commanding them, that “ having sent “ People on their own Parts and on the Part of the “ Vakeels of both Parties, and having made a due and exact Inventory of all the Goods, of all Kinds “ whatsoever of the Deceased, and having collected *l the dispersed Goods and locked them up and sealed of them, they the said Cauzee and Mustees do station “ and place People to guard the said Goods, in or- der that no one may be able to embezzle the fame,

“ until the Time of the Decision and Division there-of} and also, that, according to ascertained Fasts,

“ and legal Justice, they the said Cauzee and Mustees *€ do transmit to the Council a written Report on this “ Cause, &c. And the Fast, that the said De-

fendants did duly execute the said Perwannah, and did in all Things proceed according to the Or-' ders, and under the Authority of the said Court, was also fully proved by Simeon , Esquire, another Member of the said Provincial Council, and by the said Mr. Young.

That in further Support of the alledged Irregularity in the Proceedings of the said Cauzee and Mustees, the said Impey objected that they the said Cauzee and Mustees had taken an Inventory of the Effects in Dispute between the Parties, without appointing a Vakeel on the Part of Nauderab Begum, the Defendant in the

said Suit, although they were bound so to do according to the Modes of Proceeding in the Mahomedan Law.

That the said Impey had no Authority whatsoever to enquire into any supposed Irregularity in the Proceedings of Mahomedan Courts of J.uftice: That of this the said Impey was in nowise ignorant; for that, in giving Judgment in a Cause between Gbora Chund JDutt, fVitham Hosea, Esquire, President of the Court

of Dewannee Adaulet at Moorjh, and Rajah Dula Roz, the Dewan of the said Division; which said Action was commenced in the Supreme Court in the Year' 1779, the said Impey did declare, that “ in the same “ of Suits instituted before Provincial Councils, except in Cafes of manifest Corruption, the Court “ will not enter into the Regularity of the Proceedings:” And further, “ I do not think it is the Province of the Court (meaning the Supreme Court)

to enquire into the Regularity of the Court’s Proceedings.”

That the said Nauderab Begum ctfuld have no Right to impede the Course of Justice by contumaciously refusing to assist its Process, and appoint a Vakeel, as it was her Duty j and in Default of such Appointment on her Part, the said Defendants would have been fully justified in proceeding without it; but that the said Nauderab Begum did in this Respect actually make Choice of one Cojab , a confidential

Agent of the said Nauderabto be and aft as her Vakeel in this Behalf, and him did constitute and appoint according to the Mode usually followed by Mahomedan Women of that Rank to which the said Nauderab pretended: That a Declaration was made by the said Nauderab, and afterwards taken down in Writing, and attested with the Seal of the said , by which

said Declaration the said Nauderab made known that file had appointed the said Ccjab to be and

aft as herVakeel; which said Declaration in Writing, or Power of Attorney, was tendered in Evidence to the said Impey, and by him rejected; and although it appeared that such was the tifual Form of appointing Vakeels by Mahomedan Women, yet the said Impey did, in this Cafe, refuse to admit the said Declaration in Writing, or Warrant of Attorney,* or any Evidence of the Matters therein contained, unless the Witnesses thereto would speak to the Personal Consent of the said Nauderab that the said Zekereah should be

her Vakeel, which the said Impey well knew to be impossible, for he well knew that Women

were excluded from the Sight of Men, and that they and their Families were contaminated and disgraced if they were either brought into a Court of Justice to give Evidence, or if Men were admitted into their Presence, in order to authenticate their Deeds;

That ,the said Zekereah did take upon himself the said Office of Vakeel, and did and performed divers Acts in Behalf of the said Nauderab, and was so considered by the said Defendants.

That the said Impey did further object a Variety of* other Acts to the said Defendants, that is to say, that the said Cauzee and Mustees did not duly examine into the Rights of the Parties; that they, were guilty of certain Irregularities in executing the Judgment so passed by the Provincial Council in this Cause as aforesaid, and of various Acts of Oppression against the Begum; and that the Vakeels had not been duly acquainted with the Report of the Cauzee and Mustees: To all which said Objections the Evidence before the Supreme Court did, at the Time of making the said Objections by the said Impey, afford a corn-', pleat and satisfactory Answer; and further, that the said Impey had no Jurisdiction to enquire into the said Proceedings.

That in all these Instances the said discovered manifest Partiality in discharging the Duties of his Office; and under Colour and Pretence of these, and other similar Objections, did hold the said Cauzee and Mustees to be responsible in their Individual Capacity, as Trespasser against the Laws of England, for Acts proved by sufficient Evidence to have been done as Officers of a Mahomedan Court of Justice, proceeding under the Orders of a superior Court, according to the Mahomedan Manners and the Principles of Mahomedan Jurisprudence,

That the said Elijah Impey, being further actuated by a partial, corrupt, and oppressive Intent of perse^ cuting and ruining the said Defendants, did, by divers forced and false Constructions of the Evidence given in the said Action of Trespass so brought in the Supreme Court by the said Nauderab Begum as aforesaid, search for a Pretence to inflame the Damages against the said Defendants to a very enormous Amount.

That for this Purpose the said Impey did, by maliciously suppressing certain Parts of the said Evidence, endeavour to make it appear, that the said Nauderab had suffered a Loss of Property exceeding, by many Degrees, the Property so divided at the House of the said Shabbaz Beg Khan, the deceased Husband of the

said Nauderab, by the said Defendants, in pursuance of the Perwannah issued by them, and by the said Provincial Council, to that Effect, as aforesaid.

Thar at the Time of taking an Inventory of the said Goods by the Defendants, according to the Exigency of the said Perwannah, Inventories of the said Goods were taken by the respective Parties to the Suit of Inheritance so proceeded upon by the Cauzee and Mustees as aforesaid, or by their Vakeels: That on the Trial of the said Action of Trespass in the Supreme Court, the Attornies on both Sides were served with Notices to produce the said Inventory on each Side respectively: That on the Part of the Plaintiff in the said Action, it had been found by the said Cojab Zekereah, that “ Four, or Eight, or Ten Days” before the Trial he had seen such Inventory in the Hands of the Plaintiff’s Vakeel.

That on the Part of the Defendants fti the said Action, a fair Copy of the said Inventory, with a Translation annexed, and which had been authenticated ac the Time of the Trial in the Suit of Inheritance, and long before the commencing or giving Notice of the said Action of Trespass in the Supreme Court, by the Cauzee and Mustees in their Judicial Capacities, and also by the Signatures of the Chief and Council of

Patna,

Patna, was tendered in Evidence, but was rejected by the said Impey, “ because an Original was a better

Species of Evidence.”

That the said Original was taken at the Time of the said Trial of Inheritance, upon divers foul Scraps of Paper and loose Memorandums, and was of a very great Length when all the said foul Scraps of Paper and loose Memorandums Should be put together, to wit, of the Length of Seventy-five Feet: That no Translation thereof had been prepared by the said Defendants, either in Confidence that the Plaintiff would have produced the Inventory so taken by her Vakeel during the Trial of the said Suit of Inheritance, or that the Copy, which they deemed the best authenticated Evidence in this Cause, having the Authentications of the said Cauzee and Mustees, and of the said Provincial Council of Patna as aforesaid, would have been admitted: That by a Rule of the said Supreme Court, no Perfi Paper was allowed to be admitted in Evidence, except accompanied by a Translation.

-That on the Second Day of the Trial of the Action of Trespass in the Supreme Court, the said Defendant tendered this said original Inventory, in Confidence and Hope that the said Elijah Impey would have received the fame, and directed a Translation to be made thereof: That the said Impey refused to give such Directions j in Consequence of which said Refusal, the said Persian Paper Hands an Exhibit in the said Cause unintelligible, and unattended to in the Decision: That the said Defendants further prayed the said Impey to allow Time to prepare a Translation of the said Paper, but the said Impey, not regarding the said Prayer, nor the Justice of the Cafe, did positively refuse such Permission: That the Trial of this Cause lasted Ten Days; and there was ample Time to obtain a Translation of the said original Inventory.

That the said Defendants did, as the last Resource left them in this Cafe, tender to the said Impey the Parole Evidence of Persons present at the Time of taking the said Inventory: That among others who were present at the taking the said Inventory, the Evidence of one Haujee Hautim, the Person who had appraised the said Goods, and according to whose Valuation the said several Inventories (whereof the attested Copy of One so tendered by the said Defendants as aforesaid, and Notice to produce the other was so served upon the Vakeel of the said Plaintiff as aforesaid) had been made out, was tendered to the said Impey; but the said Impey did also reject this Evidence, on the Pretence that Oral Testimony shall not be admitted where written Evidence exists.

That the Inventory taken by the said Haujee Hautim, and which he the said Hautim was ready to verify, valued the said Goods so appraised by him as aforesaid, under the Sum of 93,000 Current Rupees.

That the said Impey,well knowing that another Inventory did exist on the Part of the Plaintiff, did partially, corruptly, and maliciously admit the Parole Testimony of the said Cojab Zekereab on the Part of the said Plaintiff, although, by the Testimony of the said Zekereab, it appeared that he the said Zekereab had seen such Inventory in the Hands of the Plaintiff’s Vakeel Five or Ten Days before the Trial.

That by the Evidence of the said , who

during the Whole of his Testimony, from the Beginning to the End of the Trial of the said Cause, had been guilty of Prevarications, Inconsistencies, and notorious Perjury, which the said Impey did at all Times well know and encourage, to the Injury of the said Defendants, the said Impey did falsely and maliciously take the Value of the said Goods, so divided as aforesaid, to amount to 2,46,000 Current Rupees, or nearly Treble their Value, according to the Inventory aforesaid, and did falsely and maliciously efti-mate the Damages according to such. Valuation, to

the grievous Oppreflion and Ituin bf the said Dej fendants.

That with a further Intent of obtaining a Pretence to aggravate the Damages against the said Defendants* the said Impey did endeavour, by divers forced and false Interpretations, to make it appear thdt they the said Defendants had been guilty of Corruption in thd Execution of their Office.

That the said Charge was at no Time whatsoever advanced at the Trial, by the Plaintiffs in the said Cause, much less was it attempted to be substantiated by any Evidence whatsoever: That the said Impey therefore did evince a corrupt and malicious Purpose in his Mind, by travelling out of the Complaint before him, in order to fix such an Imputation on their Integrity.

That in pursuance of this corrupt and malicious Purpose, the said Impey did endeavour to establish an Appearance of Collusion between them the said Defendants, and Babader Beg the original Plaintiff in the Trial on the Inheritance: That he therefore fabricated a Distinction between the Order of the Council on the Petition of the said Babaderand the Terms of the Perwannah or Precept issued to the said Defendants in consequence of the said Petition: That under this Distinction the said Impey did falsely assume and pretend that the said Provincial Council knew nothing of any Dispute between Babader Beg and Nauderab Begum, as no such Knowledge, according to the said appears on the Face of the Order of the said Council; but that those who drew the Perwannah did know of such Dispute, as it appears by the Terms of the said Perwannah, to which Knowledge they could not have arrived, except by secret Means and corrupt Communication with the said Babader Beg.

That, in Support of this false and frivolous Distinc-tien, the said Impey stated that the Order of Council alluded merely to a Division of the Property, and the Allotment of Shares, and the ascertaining which precluded the Possibility of its being in the Contemplation of the said Provincial Council, that any exclusive Claim to the Whole of the Property could have been made by the said Nauderab Begum, and consequently that there could be no Suppdfition of a Trial: But that, on the other Hand, the Perwannah did positively state a Dispute between the Parties, and did suppose the Possibility of a Trial.

That the said Impey well knew that he was in this Respect falsely and maliciously endeavouring to Criminate the said Defendants: That the Petition of Babader Beg, which was in Evidence before the said Impey, did positively afiert that the said Nauderab Begum was removing and secreting the; and did,

in direit and expjicit Terms, pray that his Right might be ascertained by the Cauxee and that the said Petition was not a simple Prayer to a superior Author rity, for the Grant of a particular Object, but the regular Commencement of a Suit at Law, and the First Step in its Proceedings.

That the said Impey well knew, that even the weak and frivolous Inference of Collusion, grounded on the Distinction he had so fabricated as aforesaid, between the Order of the Council and the Perwannah issued thereupon, could not be supported without Proof, that the said Defendants were privy to the drawing up and issuing of the said Perwannah: That finding no Evidence whatsoever of such Privity on the Part of the Defendants, the said Impey did maliciously and daringly presume it, saying, “ As the Perwannah is “ in Persian, no Doubt it was drawn either by the Defendants or their Clerks.”

That if it was Criminal in them to know any Thing relative to the Merits of this Cause previous to the Trial, it was highly Criminal in the said Impey conclude that they had obtained that Knowledge by Communication with the said Babader Beg, the Plaintiff

tiff in that Trial, when no Proof, or even Allegation, was offered in Support of such an Imputation; and when, by fair Inference from the FaCts, they might, and evidently did know it by honest and regular Means; that is to say, by the Petition upon which the said Perwannah was grounded: That, under these Circumstances, to decide against the Integrity of respon-fible Officers, to fix a Suspicion of Collusion upon their ConduCt, without either Accusation or apparent Ground that could be collected from the Circumstances, and to supply the Defect of Proof by forced and false Construction of plain Evidence, proves, that the said Impey was acting in pursuance of a partial and corrupt Bias against the said Defendants, and falsely administering the Justice of the Country.

That further, to compleat his said cruel, oppressive, corrupt, and malicious Purposes against the said Defendants, so betrayed and manifested as aforesaid, the said Impey did recite divers Objections to the Modes of Proceeding by the said Defendants, at the Trial of the Right of Inheritance: That for this Purpose the said Impey, well knowing that the Mode of Proceed-

ing, according to the Mabomed Laws and Customs, is summary; well knowing, that the Report made on the said Trial of Inheritance by the said Defendants to the said Provincial Council, contained as full and satisfaSory an Account of the Proceedings at the said Trial, as it was usual to make, and as the Nature of summary Investigations will admit; well knowing, that the said Provincial Council, to whom only belonged the Right of objecting to the said Report, were thoroughly satisfied therewith, and that no Objection whatever was taken to the same by the Parties interested, at the Time when the same was made; well knowing also, that he had no Right or Authority whatsoever to examine into the Irregularity of any such Proceedings, upon the Nature of which, being according to the Mabomedan Customs and Laws, he was not competent to determine; well knowing also, that no Complaint whatsoever, of any Corruption, or any such Irregularity, had been offered on the Part of the said Plaintiff in this Action against the said Defendants, did arbitrarily reject the Whole of the said Report so recited as aforesaid, and refuse to consider it as Evidence in this Cause in Favour of the said Defendants.

That in order to justify his Rejection of the said Report, the said Impey had again Recourse to the Maxim of Delegatus non potejl delegare:That he de-

clared the Trial in the Supreme Court, on which he the said Impey was then delivering Judgment, to be the Examination of a Proceeding absolutely coram dice-j that the Report therefore, although fufliciently authenticated, could not be considered as such a Record in these Proceedings, as would entitle the Defendants to give it in Evidence; but that although it could not be given in Evidence for the said Defendants, it could be given against them, as containing their own Confession and Account of the Proceedings.

That it appeared from the said Report so rejected by the said Impey as aforesaid, that in the Examination into the Right of Inheritance so referred to the Cauzee and Mustees by the Provincial Council as aforesaid, sufficient Matter had arisen in the Course-of the said Enquiry to warrant the said Defendants in declaring the Claim of the said Nauderah Begum to be ill-founded, and the Right of Inheritance to be in the Heir at Law, inasmuch as the Deeds under which the said Nauderah claimed the Whole of the Estate, appeared, to the Satisfaction of the said Cauzee and Mustees, fitting in a Judicial Capacity to try the Right of the said Eabader Beg, to have been forged after the Death of the said Shabbaz Beg Khanand further inasmuch as the said Deeds were insufficient, according Vol. XLIII.

tt> the Mabomedan Laws and Customs, r6 constitute a good Title.

That the Inconsistencies, Prevarications, and false Swearing of Cojah Zekereah, the Vakeel and Repre-fentative of Nauderah Begum, by whom the said Deeds were produced before the said Cauzee and Mustees, as the Grounds of the Claim of the said Nauderah Begum, relative to the Authenticity of the said Deeds: That the incautious Confession of One of the subscrib-' ing Witnesses to the said Deeds, that it had been written by Niaz Aly (in which said Confession the said Cojah Zekereah was obliged afterwards to join): That the Testimony of the said Niaz who had been for a long Time Secretary to the deceased Shabbaz Beg Khart, to this Effect, that is to say, that he the

said Niaz Aly had, at the Desire of the said Cojab kereah, and after the Death of the said Shabbaz Beg Khan, copied a Will from a Draft given him by the said Zekereah, purporting to have existed in the Lifetime of the said Shabbaz Beg, and the concurrent Testimony of several credible Witnesses, as may b6 seen more fully in the Report, amply justified the said Cauzee and Mustees in determining against the Validity of the Deeds, as Evidence of the Title of the said Nauderah Begum.

That as to the legal Effect and Operation of the said Deeds, according to the Mabomedan Law, the said Impey could have no possible Pretence, or was in any Degree competent to esquire: That the Cauzee and Mustees so fitting, for the Purpose of ascertaining the Title of Bahader Beg, as a Court of Justice as aforesaid, and being versed and learned in the said Laws and Customs, were the only fit and competent Judges of the Validity of the said Deeds to convey Property.

That the said Impey, by thus usurping the Authority of enquiring into and condemning the ConduCt of the said Cauzee and Mustees, on the Ground of their having decided against the Widow’s Claim, contrary to the Effect of the Mabomedan Evidence, and to the Operation of the Mabomedan Law, did fully manifest, that where an Error against the Forms and Technicalities of the British Laws should fail to reach them, he was determined that they should not escape the perverted Interpretation of their own; and the said Impey did therefore take upon himself to determine not only against the Justification of the said Defendants under these FaCts, but did further collect from the said FaCts a Pretence of aggravating and inflaming the Damages against them.

That the said Impey, in considering the Evidence given at the Trial of the said Action of Trespass in the Supreme Court, on the one Side in Support and on the other in Impeachment of the Validity of the said Deeds, and in further Aid of his corrupt, partial, and oppressive Views against the said Defendants, did endeavour to make it appear, that the said Defendants had grounded their Charge of Forgery of the said Deeds on Evidence that related to a certain Copy of a Deed which was not before them at the Time of the Trial of the Right of Inheritance; that the Original Deeds themselves were not before them at the Time of the said Trial; that the said Cauzee and Mustees did not, in Point of Fact, make the Report above recited to the said Provincial Council, but had fur-reptitiously obtained the said Deeds long after the said Trial, and had been permitted to accommodate their Report to the said Deeds.

That it appears that the said Impey did, in this Re-' gard, give Credit to a certain false and contradictory Narrative of the said CtjahZekereah-, in which Narrative the said Zekereah is contradicted by divers competent and credible Witnesses, and by his own Testimony, delivered at various Times during his Examination as a Witness in the said Action of Trespass.

L 1 That

That as to a certain other Deed, which is stated in the Report of the said Cauzee and Mustees to have been attested with the Seal of one at the

Request of the said Cojab , and which the

said Syed affirmed, both at the Trial before the Cauzee and at the Trial of the said Action of Trefpafs, to have been offered to him for Attestation as an Original Deed, and which the said did notice as that Copy of a Deed which was not before the Cauzee and Mustees at the Trial of the Inheritance; the said Cojab Zekereab did affirm, that the said Deed was a Copy and not an Original, and did attempt to account for his having clandestinely obtained the Signature of Syed Abmud thereto, by dating, that being desirous to inform his Relations at Caboul of the Manner in which the Deceased had disposed of his Property, he the said Zekereab did procure the said Deed to be copied by Niaz Aly, after the Death of the said Shabbaz Beg Khan j and the said Zekereab did further endeavour to account for the Method in which he procured the said Copy, by affirming, that being so desirous as aforesaid, he searched in the Inkstand of the said Niaz Aly, where he found a foul Draft of that original Hebena-mah, or Deed of Gift, under which the Widow claimed the Estate of the Deceased, and to which said Hebenamah he the said Cojab Zekereab was a subscribing Witness: And the said Zekereab did further affirm that the Seal of the deceased Beg Khan was

not affixed to the said Copy.

That in this, as well as in divers other Parts of his Evidence to this Point, the said Zekereab is directly contradicted by the Testimony of the said Niaz Aly, who deposed, that the said Zekereab brought him the said Niaz the foul Draft of the Hebenamah as aforesaid, and that he made Two Copies of the same at the Desire of the said Zekereab; and is also contradicted by the Testimony of Syed Abmud and other credible Witnesses, who either attested the said Paper t'hem-selves, or to whom the said Paper was tendered for Signature in the Presence of others; and that all the said Witnesses deposed, that the Seal of Shawbaz Beg was annexed thereto.

That as the said Nauderab Begum was left in Possession of all the Property of the deceased Shawbaz Beg, the Seal of the said Shawbaz was in her Possession, together with the rest of his Effects.

That the said Impey did give full Credit to the said Zekereab, who stated, that the Charge of Forgery against him, contained in the said Report of the Cauzee and Mustees, was grounded on the Deed so mentioned to have received the Attestation of Syed Abmud, and so sent by him the said Zekereab to his Relations at Cabouland that the said Charge could notin anywise relate to the Deeds on which the said Nauderab claimed the Property of the Deceased, because (the said Zekereab further deposed) that the Originals of the said Deeds had at no Time, during the Trial of the Inheritance, been produced to the Cauzee and Mustees, but that he the said Zekereab had produced only Copies thereof to which no Signatures had been annexed: And to account for the said Original Deeds being in the Possession of the said Defendants, and recited with the Names of the subscribing Witnesses in the Report so by them made to the said Provincial Council as aforesaid, the said Zekereab further stated, that he had produced them to the Members of the said Provincial Council in Consequence of the Charge of Forgery exhibited against him by the said Defendants; and the said Impey, in order to help out the Story of the said Zekereab,concludes, without any Evidence what-

ever, that the Members of the said Provincial Council, did put the said Deeds, purporting to be Originals, into the Hands of the said Defendants, and that the said Defendants were thereby enabled to accommodate, and did accommodate their Report to the said Deeds.

That this Explanation of the said Impey of the Account given as aforesaid by the said , mali-

ciously imputes to the said Council of Patna a Conduit the most disttonourable and corrupt, and a fraudulent Collusion with the Defendants: That of this Conduit there was no Proof; but of the Falsehood of the Story of the said Zekereab, there was a Chain of clear, regular, consistent, and credible Evidence.

That the said Impey well knew, that in Point of Fait, the whole Account given of thisTranfaction by the said Zekereab, was false from the Beginning to the End that it was in Evidence before the said Impey that this very Report, so stated by the said Impey never to have been made, was read in the Presence of the Vakeels of both Parties, and that they were satisfied therewith; that by the Evidence of Niaz , and Mustee Karremonllab, one of the Mustees appointed by the Provincial Council to attend at the Trial of the Right of Inheritance, the Deeds in Evidence before the Supreme Court were the identical Deeds which had been produced to the said Cauzee and Mustees by the said Zekereab, as the foie Grounds of the Widow’s Claim; that with respect to the Authenticity of the said Deeds, it was in Evidence before the said Impey, that the subscribing Witnesses thereto differed essentially from the said Zekereab, as to the Date of executing the same; that as to the whole Account given by the said Zekereab, respecting the Production of Copies instead of Originals to the said Cauzee and Mustees, it stood directly and evidently refuted by himself in various other Parts of the Testimony delivered by the said Zekereab, in the Course of the said Trial before the said Impey.

That it appears that the said Zekereab deposed, that the said Nauderab Begum delivered to him the original Deeds, and ordered him to make Copies thereof; and if any one Should create Disputes,to lhew these Copies to the Cauzee: That he therefore had a Copy of one of the said Deeds, called an Ekrar Aum, taken by Mustee Guval, and attested with the Seal of the said

Mustee Guval; and that he took a Copy of the other Deed, called an Hebenamah, himself, to which he had not an Opportunity of procuring the Annexation of the Seal of the said Mustee Guval, and that those were the Papers produced to the Cauzee and Mustee.

That the said Zekereab,in direct and flagrant Contradiction of this Account given by him at the Time, in respect to the Production of the said Copies, did ac another Time depose before the fifid Impey, that in Consequence of a Demand from the Cauzee Sadbie, one of the said Defendants, to know what were the Foundations of the Widow’s Claim; he, the said Zekereab, did ajk her for the said Deeds: That the said Nauderab Begum did refuse to part with them; but that after Four or Five Days difpitting. at the Desire of the said Zekereab, lhe gave him the Deeds; that this was the First Time he had seen them since the Death of Shawbaz Beg: That no Seals were annexed to the Copies he produced to the Cauzee and Mustees.

That from the contradictory and incredible Account given as aforesaid by the said it appeals that

the said Zekereab pretends to say, and to have it believed by others, in the same Manner as it was corruptly admitted and acted upon by the said Impey, that notwithstaoding the Cauzee and Mustees were, to the Knowledge of the said Zekereab, fitting in a Judicial Capacity by Orders from the Provincial Council, to ascertain the respective Titles of the said Nauderab Begum and Bahader Beg, whose confidential Agent, Representative, and Vakeel, he was; notwithstanding that he well knew, that if he failed to produce the original Deeds, he could not make out any Title in the said Nauderab Begum, for whom he was acting in the Capacities aforesaid, and that Judgment must go accordingly against the said Nauderab -, notwithstanding

4 that

that he had himself persuaded the said Begum

to deliver into his Custody the said Deeds which contained the only Proof of the Claim and Title so set up by the said Nauderab as aforesaid, and had also persuaded her to conform in all other Respects to the Orders of the Cauzee; notwithstanding that the said Zekereah was himself a Legatee under one of the said Deeds; notwithstanding that the said Cauzee and Mustees were in Part examining into a Charge of Forgery against himself, the Consequences of which he well knew would be immediate Imprisonment, and Loss of Character, all which he wobld avoid by producing the said Deeds; notwithstanding, as it appears by the Evidence of the said that he had ac-

tually suffered one of the said Deeds to pass out of his Possession, in order to obtain a Copy, and procure the Attestation of the Mustee Guval to the fame: That he, the said Zekereah, did not produce the said Deeds,

purporting to be Originals as aforesaid, at any Time, to the said Cauzee and Mustees.

That the said Impey did not only aft with a Criminal Neglect of Duty, and flagrant and unjustifiable Partiality, in thus admitting and acting upon the said false and contradictory Testimony of , but

also in making the Fasts so asserted in the Evidence of the said Zekereah a Pretence for aggravating the Damages against the said Cauzee and Mustees; for that, by the Ad million of the said that the

Deeds io produced by him as aforesaid were Copies and not Originals, the said Defendants (land compleatly justified in not awarding the Estate to the Plaintiff in the present Action of Trespass: Yet the said Impey, who was bound in every Rcfpeft, both as

he was discharging the Funftions of a Jury in trying the Fasts in this Cause, to give every Fast, whether proved on the one Side or on the other, its due Weight in the Scale of his Determination, and as he was also administering the sacred Duty of a Judge, to pronounce the Law without Prejudice or Predeliftion for any of the Parties before him, did wholly omit, and wilfully, corruptly, and maliciously pass by the said Part of the Evidence of Zeker, from which, to the Knowledge of the said Impeythe compleat Justification

of the said Defendants, both as to the Rectitude of their Decision in Point of Law, and the total Absence of all imputed Corruption as to their Motives, was the necessary and infallible Result.

That as the Authority of the Legislature had united in the said Impey, with an humane Intent of communicating its Protection to the Subjects of its remotest Dependencies, those high and extensive Powers of Judge and Jury, the Distinction and Separation of which from each other, by the strictest Boundaries, had been the constant Object of its Provisions for securing the Purity of Justice in this Country, so did its Wisdom annex to the Execution and Discharge of those Powers, double Duties, double Integrity, and double Responsibility: That in the notorious Violation of every Part of the Trull so reposed in him by Parliament, in this Respect, the said Impey is guilty of a High Crime and Misdemeanor.

That the said Impey, in further pursuance of the corrupt and malicious Purposes so entertained by him against the Defendants as aforesaid, did wilfully, and without due Cause, reject and consider as of no Weight the Evidence of certain Witnesses produced on the Part of the said Cauzee and Mustees; thereby giving full Force, Credit, and Effect to the contradictory Narratives and glaring Perjuries of the said Zekereah; And that the said Impey, in considering and balancing the Credibility of the Testimony of the said Zekereah, did wilfully, and contrary to the Duty of his Office, omit to estimate the Contradictions and Perjuries of the said Zekereah, as well in those Parts of his said Testimony as is above recited, as in divers other Parts

theteof: That in particular, it appears that the said Zekereah, who pretended to have been a subscribing Witness to the said Deeds in the Life-time of Beg Khan, was examined as to his own Hand Writing, and to certain Writings round the Seals of the several subscribing Witnesses; and that he gave Evidence thereof in Manner as follows ;

Question i Who wrote the Writing which is hound the Seals ?

Answer. What is wrote about my own Seal and that of Chuput Beg, in the Hebenamah, I remember writing myself, but the other Three I do not remember writing; I am lure that above the Seal of Ma~ zum Bey is not mine, that around Ullab is not my writing.

Question. You must know your Hand Writing i answer, is it your Hand Writing, Yes or No ?

Answer. It is not; it is not in my Memory that it is; I do not remember it, if it is my Hand Writing: It may be so.

Question. You must know your Handwriting, you need not look at it so frequently.

Answer. If it is, it may be, I do not recollect it t if it may be, it may be; I do not recollect it: It is certainly my Hand Writing.

Question. Now you have swore, it is your Hand Writing, and that it is not; which is true? one or the other of them must be true.

Answer. It is my Hand Writing.

Question. You did not fee Mahcmed write Ullah, therefore why did you write under it ?

Answer. I remember that when Ghyrut Beg affixed his Seal, as he could not write, the Deceased, -baz Beg Cawn, desired me to write over it, and having procured Iwazto write in my Absence Ullab, he delired me to write Ullah.

Question. You have said, I think, that you never saw the Hebenamah after your own Seal was put to it, and till after the Death of Beg and

that when you did put your Seal to it, the other Seals were not put to it, nor the Signature Ullah-, how came you now then to say, that after the Seal of Ghyrut Beg was put to it, and the Signature , that Shawbaz Beg Cawn desired you to write upon the Hebenamah ? ’

Answer. It is true, that when he desired me to put my Seal to it, there was no other Seal than his; but about the same Time, or a Day after, when the other Witnesses witnessed it, I was by, and he desired me to witness it; I was always present with Shawbaz Beg Khan.

Question. Were you by when Mahomed Iwaz wrote the Word Ullah ?

Answer. I was not present then; when Innayet Ullab Beg and Ghyrut Beg put their Seals to it, I was present.

Question. Why, if you did write under the Word Ullah, as you now say you did, why did you immediately say that you did not write under it?

Answer. I was in Doubt about my own Hand Writing, and having sworn, I was cautious in acknowledging it.

Question. What did you mean by saying, that you never saw the Paper, after you had put your Seal to it, till after the Death of Shawbaz Beg l^han, if Shawbaz Beg Khan did in Fast produce it to you, to write upon it, at any Time after you had put your Seal to it ?

AnfWfcr. It is not a Contradiction: After all the Seals were put to it, after that Time I meant to say

I never

J. 1787,

1 never saw it till after the Death of Khan.

Question. Is all the Writing over the Seals of your Hand Writing ?

Answer. - The last is not my Hand Writing.

Question. Look to it, and be sure ?

Answer. This is also my Hand Writing.

Question. Why did you say it was not your Hand Writing when it is ?

Answer. I did not remember writing it; but on seeing it is the same Flow of the Pen, l'acknowledge it to be my Hand Writing.

That nevertheless the said did falsely represent the Testimony of the said Zekereab to be “ con- fiftent and unimpeached,” and thereupon did take upon himself to determine in Favour of the Authenticity of the Deeds on which the said Nauderah Begum founded her Claim to the Property of Shawbaz and did, under all the Circumstances of the supposed Illegality of the Conduit of the said Cauzee and Muf-tees, in trying the Fadts of the said Cause of Inheritance, of Irregularity of the Proceedings therein, and in executing the Judgment thereupon, and of the Credit due to the respective Witnesses in the said Action of Trespass, give and pass Judgment in Favour of the Plaintiff Nauderah Begum, with Damages to the Amount of 3,00,000 Sicca Rupees, or 36,000 Sterling, against all the Defendants.

That it appears from the Evidence in the said Action of Trespass, and was known and manifest to the said

Impey, that the Reports delivered in by the Cauzee and Mustees on the divers Suits and Actions which it had been customary to refer to them, were never considered by the said Councils as having any legal Effcdl or Operation whatsoever, until they had been solemnly confirmed by the Judgment of the said Council delivered upon such Reports, after reading the same in the Presence of the Vakeels of both Parties.

That the said Councils we^e used to exercise, and, in the present same before the said Impey the said Council of Patna did exercise, their Discretion in altering and amending such Reports, according to the Exigency or general Impression of the Justice and Equity of the Cafes stared therein: That the said Councils were Courts competent to the passing Judgments in Causes between Mabomedans, and to the holding Cognizance of such Causes in all Cafes whatsoever: That the Cauzee and Mustees were compellable to execute the Process of the said Courts; and that in the Instance before the said Impey the said Judgment was passed, and the said Process did issue to the Defendants from the Council at Patna.

That the said Impey,in further pursuance of his malicious Purposes against the said Defendants, and with a View to their utter Ruin and Destruction, did give Credit to certain loose and general Evidence of Cojab Zekereab, as to the easy Circumstances and Affluence of the said Cauzee and Mustees, although it was in Evidence before him, that the total Salary of the said Cauzee amounted to no more than 100 Rupees, or about £.10 per Month, and that the Salary of the Five Mustees did amount to little more than the same Sum; and under Pretence thereof, and of their Ability to pay the Amount of the said Judgment and Costs of Suit, did maliciously estimate the Damages alledged to have been sustained by the said Nauderah Begum, at the said Sum of 3,00,000 Sicca Rupees.

That in the Course of the said Trial, the said Impey fitting as chief Criminal and Civil Judge over all the Subjects of these Realms residing in the Provinces of Bengal, Rebar, and Or if a, and immediately repre-

fenting the Sovereign, did assert and maintain divers false Maxims and Principles of Law, highly dangerous to the Security of our Territorial Poflfessions in India, and disgraceful to the Honour and Character of his Station.

That in particular the said Impey, in endeavouring to establish the Corruption of the Cauzee and Mustees, and thereby to obtain a colourable Pretence for their Persecution, did state, that Corruption was the necessary Consequence of Poverty, declaring that “ it was not surprizing that they (meaning the said Cauzee “ and Mustees) should be mean, weak, ignorant, and *c corrupt, when the Salary of the principal Judge " does not exceed 100 Rupees per Month.”

That the said Principle is false, scandalous, and immoral, highly disgraceful in the Lips of a British Judge, and highly dangerous to that Stability and Purity of Character which is absolutely necessary to the adequate Performance of the Duties of his high Office: That it tends to weaken the Confidence of the Native Inhabitants of India in the Probity of those Officers by whose Advice the Provincial Councils are accustomed to abide, in determining the Law, upon all Questions of what Importance soever: That the said false Maxim, so sanctioned by the deliberate Avowal of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was but little calculated to inspire the Natives of with an Hope that in the Discharge of his own Duties he would steadily perlift in the Path of a severe and scrupulous Integrity; but rather to awaken in their Minds an Apprehension that a Judge, solemnly holding forth such a Principle to the World, would apply that Rule to his own Conduct, which his Conjectures on the Motives of others had suggested to him, and be ready to secure his Virtue by every Method that might lead to the Advancement of his Fortune.

But that if the Poverty and Mcannefs of the said Defendants was taken for granted as aFadt by the said Impey, when he meant to infer that they were corrupt, at least it ought to have protected them against the exorbitant and vindidtive Damages awarded against them by the said Impey.

That perpetual Imprisonment, even as the Punishment of a Criminal Offence, is unknown to the Laws of England; but that the said Impey, by awarding Damages to so enormous an Amount, when he well knew the total Incapacity of the said Defendants to discharge the fame, did indirectly procure all the EffedVs of a rigorous Criminal Sentence, in a yet greater Degree than is known to the Laws of England, to be inflicted as a Punishment on the said Defendants, by subjecting them to perpetual Imprisonment.

That the said Impey is answerable for all the Consequences of this Act: That the Execution of the Judgment of the Supreme Court produced the miserable Death of the Cauzee Sadhi, who funk in Age and Infirmity under the Persecution of the said Elijah Impey.

That the other Defendants were imprisoned in the Common Jail at Calcutta, where they remained for a Period of Two Years and upwards, until they were set at Liberty by the humane Interposition of the British Parliament, directing their Release, and the Restoration of the Mustees to the Offices they had executed before with fair and unsullied Characters; and that the Court of Directors, at the Recommendation of a Committee of the House of Commons, appointed, in the Year 1782, to enquire into the Abuses of the Supreme Court, ordered them a liberal Compensation for their Sufferings.

That in all and every the said Acts, the said Elijah Impey appears to have been instigated by dangerous and corrupt Views of Personal Ambition, and by the Spirit of a dark and hateful Malice against innocent Individuals.

That in taking Cognizance of the Subject Matter of a Cause which had been before determined in a Court over which he had no Authority whatsoever, either Original or Appellant, under the Pretence of trying an Action of Trespass, and in awarding heavy and vindictive Damages against Officers acting under the Orders of the Court to which they belonged, and the Legality of whose Proceedings they could not dispute, the said Impey discovered a corrupt Design of

extending the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, of Overturning the whole System of Jurisprudence, under which the Natives had lived in Comfort and Security, of deterring the Magistrates from exercising the regular Functions of their Offices, and of holding forth his own as the only Tribunal to which the Natives could resort for Judicial Enquiry, contrary to the Spirit and to the Letter of the Act of Parliament by which it was Created, to the State of Habits and Society in Indiay and for the sordid Purpose of encreasing the Influence and Emoluments of his Situation: That these violent and arbitrary Proceedings fully manifested that the said Impey was equally regardless of the great and humane Object of his Appointment, of preserving the Purity of those Laws which he was deputed to administer, of adhering to those strict and wife Limitations which Parliament had prescribed to his Authority, of respecting the Manners, Religion, and Opinions of tnofe over whom he had illegally extended its Operation, and of the Stability and Existence of the English Government in India.

That in promulgating his Determinations on all the leading Points and ultimate Ifiue of this Cause, as according and agreeing with the Principles of those Municipal Institutions to which Obedience was yielded in Great Britain , and in holding forth to the Inhabitants of the Provinces subject to the British Government, that such was the true Meaning of the Protection granted them by Parliament against the Oppref-fions of British Subjects, that such were the benevolent Results 6f British Legislation; the said Impey gave Sandtion to a Belief, that the boasted Excellence of our Laws, and of our Constitution, was unknown but in its Name; and that the Legislature, in erecting the Supreme Court, meant only an Insult to their Prejudices, and a cruel Mockery of their Miseries: That t>y these Means the said Elijah Impey brought the Cha-radler of a British judge into Disgrace, the Name and Administration of British Justice into Terror and Abomination, and is thereby guilty of High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

'THIRD CHARGE.

Extension of Jurisdiction.

THAT by the aforesaid Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, it was declared to be “ lawful “ for His Majesty, by Charter or Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great to erect and

tf establish a Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William aforesaid j” which Supreme Court was to

have full Power and Authority, among other Things, ft to form and establish such Rules of Practice, and such Rules for the Process of the said Court, and tc to do all such other Things as might be found ne-{ ceflary for the Administration of Justice.” And by the said Act it was further provided, That, under the new Charter which His Majesty was so impowered to grant, the said Supreme Court of Judicature (besides pofiefling a local Jurisdiction within the Limits of the Town and Fadlory of Calcutta, and the Fadlories fub-ordinate thereto, as well as a Personal Jurisdiction over all His Majesty’s Subjects residing in Bahar, and GriJfsJ Should also be duly authorized to Vol. XLIII.

entertain, hear, and determine et any Suit, Action, or Complaint against any Person who shall, at the ct Time when such Debt, or Cause of Action> or " Complaint, shall have arisen, have been employed “ by, or shall then have been directly or indi-<r redlly in the Service of the aforesaid United East “ India Company, or of any of His Majesty’s Sub-« jedls.”

That the Charter which His Majesty was by the said Act impowered to grant, ought to have been co-equal and co-extensive with the said Act 5 and no Jurisdiction could be legally conveyed by the said Charter, which the said Act did not specifically fane-tien, other than as His Majesty might have a Right to convey the same by the Law of Nations, and the common Law of this Realm.

That the MuJJulmans, Gentoost and others, Natives

of the Kingdoms or Provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and OriJJa, not having been born in natural Subjection to the Laws of Great Britain, nor having since been enerally subjected thereto, according to any ac-nowledged Law of Nations j the Right of conveying to an English Court of Judicature a Jurisdiction over such Natives as might be directly or indirectly in the Service of the Company, or of British Subjects, was an Assumption on the Part of the Legislature of Great Britain, which was indeed fully warranted by the good and beneficial Purposes for which it was intended, but to which the Terms of the Charter ought to have been expressly and precisely limited.

That all Powers, Authorities, and Jurisdictions, however legally conveyed by the said Act, or the said Charter, ought to have been exercised by the Judges of the said Supreme Court of Judicature with much Caution, Circumfpedlion, and Moderation, in all Cafes which attached, or might in any Manner be construed to attach on the Persons or Property of the said Natives, in as much as from the total Diffimila-rity of their Language, Manners, Customs, Laws, and Religion, such Natives must be necessarily ignorant of, and abhorrent from, the Principles and Practice of English Law; and it was more particularly the Duty Of the said Sir Elijah Impey, Knight, as Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court of Judicature, so to exercise the said Powers, Authorities, and Jurisdictions; and the said Sir Elijah has frequently declared himself to that Effect.

That it was the Duty of the said Judges, and in particular of the said Sir Elijah Impey, as Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, to take especial Care, by Means of such Rules of Practice, and Rules for the Process of the Court, and such other Provisions as they were legally authorized to make, that the Natives not subject to the Jurisdiction of the Court, Should not be compelled by any Process to appear therein, and to plead to the Jurisdiction thereof j since such Process must, in the first Instance, be frequently enforced by Means highly derogatory from the Dignity of all Natives, whether MuJJulmans, or Gentoos of exalted Hank or Call; and such Plea must further be prosecuted at a great and burthensome Expence, as well as with much Trouble and Vexation, and often to the no small Detriment of their private Affairs, from a long and distant Attendance at Calcutta-, in Consequence whereof, large and alarming Defalcations must occasionally enl'ue in the Public Revenues.

That the said Judges, and the said Chief Justice, Sir Elijah Impey, did manifest a proper and laudable Sense of their Duty hereinbefore Hated, by the Promulgation of certain Rules or Orders, intituled the 17th and 18th of the Rules and Orders of the Supreme Court of Judicature, which were framed by the said Sir Elijah Impey, and are as follow: 17th, “ It is or-w dcred. That no Summons to any Defendant, to M m “ appear

tl appear in any Plaint levied in this Court, if such “ Defendant do not reside within the Town of “ cutta, or Ten Miles thereof, do issue from the “ Prothonotary’s Office, unless Affidavit be made, " to the Satisfaction of the Court, or a Judge thereof, “ that the Defendant is subject to the Jurisdiction of “ the Court, and that the Affidavit do particularly “ specify in what Manner the Defendant is subject to “ the Jurisdiction of the Court.” i Sth, “It is or-« dered, That every Affidavit sworn before this Court, “ or a Judge thereof, for the Purpose of a Capias “ issuing in any Cause, do particularly specify in what <T Manner the Defendant is subject to the Jurisdiction “ of the Court.” And in the 4th Term of the Year 1775, the said Two Rules or Orders were repeated and confirmed. That the Intent of the said Rules or Orders requiring an Affidavit of Jurisdiction to

tisfaction of the Court, was to leave it in the Discretion

of the Court, or of the Judge before whom such Affidavit was made, to issue Mesne Process, or not, according to the Grounds assigned, or in other Words, to make such issuing of Mesne Process, a Judicial Act in the Court or Judge, for which they or he are or is consequently responsible: And the said Sir Elijah

Impeydoth himself give such Operation to the said Rules or Orders, where he himself fays, in Explanation thereof, that “ no Person can be arrested without " a positive Affidavit that he is subject to the Jurisdictiorr, and of the particular FaCt that makes him Jo; and to this the Judge, who grants the , bim-

“ self examines."

That the said Sir Elijah notwithstanding he

did thus know, and at different Times, and in different Modes, did thus recognize it to be a Duty incumbent upon him to exercise the Jurisdiction which was entrusted to him over the Natives with Lenity and Tenderness, did nevertheless indicate an early and systematic Disposition to extend his Jurisdiction over the Native Inhabitants of Bengal, Bahar, and Orijfa: And being himself employed in, or consulted relative to, the drawing of the Charter under which he was to administer Justice in the said Kingdoms, he did insert, or procure to be inserted therein, new Power, Authority, and Jurisdiction over the said Natives, not warranted by the aforesaid Act of Parliament on which the said Charter was founded, nor such as the Crown of Great Britain could by its own Prerogative grant and confer, agreeably to the Law of Nations and the Common Law of this Realm: And that whereas the Parliament of Great Britain, from the wife and benevolent Motives before-mentioned, did assume, and impowrr His Majesty to exercise a Right of subjecting to the Supreme Court aforesaid all such Natives, Inhabitants of the said Kingdoms, as were cither, directly or indirectly, in the Service of the United East India Company, or of Subjects,

at the 'Time when the Cause of Suit, AS!ion, or Complaint arose, he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, did add, or fug-gest, or approve the Addition of certain other Words, by which all such of the said Native Inhabitants as might be, either directly or indirectly, in the Service of the said Company, or of British Subjects, at the Time of any Action being brought, and not only when the Cause of such Alt ion accrued, were, in Consequence of an Act perfectly indifferent in itself, to become amenable to a new Judicature and new Laws, for the past Transactions of their former Lives, before they had any direct or indirect Employment under the said Company, or any British Stibjeft, in any Manner whatsoever.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey did especially Ihew a settled and deliberate Purpose of bringing under his Jurisdiction all the Natives concerned in the Payment of the Landed Revenues of Bengal, and Orijfa,

to the Company: And although the said Sir Elijah

Impey, the better to colour his Designs with the Appearance of Moderation, did affect to consider mere Zemindars as exempt from the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, yet he did assert it to be his Opinion

no sudden Opinion,” but as old as “ from the Time of passing the All of Parliament” under which the said Court was established) that all Farmers of Revenues, or of Lands from whence the Revenues issued, were amenable to the said Court, or to that Effect; he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, at the same Time well knowing that in the Year 1772 Warren then President

of the Presidency of Fort William in Calcutta, had let out all the Lands of Bengal, Bahar, and Orijfa, to Farm j consequently, that all the Zemindars who (Fill continued in Possession might be considered as Farmers also of their own Zemindaries; and the said Sir Elijah Impey did in sundry Cafes so assert them to be, and did accordingly contend to draw them within his Jurisdiction.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey, in pursuance of his sinister Purpose aforesaid, did, soon after his Arrival at Calcutta, seek to degrade the Situation and Rank of His Majesty’s Chief Justice, by offering his Services to attend as an Assessor and Adviser in the Sud-der Dewannee Adaulet, or Court of Appeal from thfe Dewannee Courts of the different Provinces and Dif-trifts, or in some other Dewannee Adaulet or Adau-lets; although he did at the same Time declare the Business of his own Supreme Court to be so extensive, that, “ were the Judges to fit only on the Causes “ between the Black Inhabitants of Calcutta, they “ could not go through with One Half of them and he did therefore propose, under Pretence of Ease to the Judges of the said Supreme Court, that a new Provincial Dewannee Adaulet should be established in Calcutta, under the Controul of the Supreme Court, to try Actions between Native and Native for Debts not exceeding 300 Rupees Current, or £. 30 Sterling i and did further intimate the Propriety of erecting fi-milar Courts (that is, under the Controul of the Supreme Court)in the chief Towns of the Provinces at large, though he «« hardly dared to propose the fame,” because he knew the Sense of the Legislature to be ad-verse to any Interference therein.

That fjiling in the Object of his said Offers, which the Governor General and Council declined to accept, and not meeting with better Success in his said Propositions and Intimations to His Majesty’s Ministers at Home, for the Extension of the Controul of the Supreme Court, the said Sir Impey did early

begin, and from Time to Time continue to issue his Summons, Capias, Writ of Sequestration, and other compulsory Processes, or did encourage and abet the Puisne Judges of his Court in issuing the fame, against various Zemindars and other Native Inhabitants, on Affidavits of the Jurisdiction, which on the very Face of them ought not to have been satisfactory to the Court, or the Judge proceeding thereon: And in Answer to repeated Applications, Admonitions, and Remonstrances of the Supreme Council on that Head, he did defend and maintain the Legality of such Processes, by drained and unwarrantable Constructions of the aforesaid Act of the 13th of His present Majesty, and of the Charter consequent thereon; and did per-fist in issuing or enforcing the same or similar Processes, to the great Diminution of the Public Revenues, to the Distress, Affiiftion, and Terror of the Native Inhabitants, and to the Violation of their Honour and Religion, many of them deposing, that their Zenanas, or Female Apartments, were entered, and their Places of Worship plundered, by the Officer* of the Supreme Court: That the said Sir Elijah Impey did thus ultimately drive the Supreme Council, in their Defence of the Rights of the Natives, to an Ex-» tremity bordering on Civil Violence; from which

alarming State of internal Dissention the Governor General, Warren Hastings (between whom and the said Chief Justice, Sir Elijah there had all the

Time subsisted a private Correspondence on Terms of Intimacy and Affection) did take a Pretence for purchasing a Reconciliation with the said Sir Elijah Impey, by reviving the Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, and by placing him, the said Sir Elijah as

Judge at the Head thereof, with a large Salary: And when the said Sir Elijah had thus obtained the End at which he had so long directly and indirectly aimed, by the Means before-mentioned, all Disputes between the Supreme Court on the one Hand, and the Supreme Council on the other, relative to the Jurisdiction over Zemindars, and others connected with the Revenues, did then, and from that Period, immediately cease and tlifappear.

That in the Course of the improper and unjustifi-able Endeavours so made or abetted by the said Sir Elijah Impey, for extending the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, that is to say, some Time in or about the Month of Jlpril 1775, the Rajah Choiton Zemindar of Bijjenpore, was summoned to appear before the Supreme Court in Calcutta, there to answer in an Action for Debt against him the said Rajah; and the Council of Burdwan having undertaken to be responsible for his Obedience, but having neglected to enter Common Appearance for him in the Time allowed by the Writ, the said Rajah was arrested for Contempt of the Court, and brought a Prisoner to Calcutta: That on a general Representation from the Council, as to the Public Inconveniences likely to ensue from the Arrest of many Persons- of high Rank, the said Sir Elijah Impey did affirm, that no Process had been improperly issued, and did justify the Claim of Jurisdiction over the Rajah Choiton Sing as follows: “ The Rajah Choiton Sing is the “ Joint Zemindar of a small Diltrict called “ of which he is the Joint Farmer, that is, Col- leCtor of Revenues, which he pays over to the Company, except a Part which he is allowed to retain.”

That the Rajah Choiton Sing was not the Joint Zemindar of a small Diltrict called Patcheet, but of a large Diltrict called Bijjenpore, which yielded ft.40,000 per Annum,or thereabouts, to the Public Revenues; and having been formerly dispossessed by the unjust and arbitrary Act of Warren Hastings before-mentioned, he was allowed, in common with other Zemindars, a certain Proportion of about 10 Cent, on the gross Revenues of the Zemindary -, which Allowance, Stipend, or Pension, the said Sir Elijah Impey did afterwards himself consider but as a Refer-vation of so much of “ the Produce of the Country,” wherein he did admit every Zemindar “ to have an acknowledged Property But the said Rajah having been afterwards re-admitted to Relit his own Zemindary, he was, like other Natives similarly circum-ltanced, suffered to retain the said Pension: That the Principle of the aforesaid loose, obscure, and perplexed Justificacion, advanced by the said Sir Elijah Impey, did involve the same of almost every individual Zemindar, who was then in the Management of his own Lands j and the Description of a Person, who farmed even his own Country, as a mere Collector of the Revenue, did more strongly implicate every one ofthofe who rented from Government the Zeminda-ries of others; and the Production of such a Principle, on this, one of the First Occasions which occurred, did plainly mark how far the said Sir Elijah Impey was then pre-determined to pulh the Jurisdiction of the Court.

That in the Representation before-mentioned, bearing Date May16th, 1775, the Supreme Council did

express their Wishes, That “ the Limits of the Ju-« rifdiction of the Supreme Court should be afccr-

‘£ tained, that it might be known to thi People and “ to the Government, what Persons were, and what " Persons were not, within their Jurisdiction bus the said Sir Elijah did decline giving any satisfactory Answer thereto, and didperfuade the other Judges to declare, in Conjunction with himself, that they had no Authority to make, extra-judicially, any particular Description of the Powers of the Court, other than is given in the Charter of their Establishment: That the Supreme Council did, in Reply, again urge their constant Desire to have the Jurisdiction of the Coure clearly defined, observing, that they understood Writs had been served indiscriminately upon Rajahs, Zemindars, Talookdars, Farmers of the Revenue, Dewans of the Provinces, and other Native Officers employed in the Collection of the Revenues: And the said Council proceeded to state. That* *« if the Parties, sttBenjal “ by not pleading to the Jurisdiction of the Court, Appendix,

“ are thereby understood to acknowledge it, and if &+

“ their Acknowledgment, whether direct or implied,

“ subjects them to such Jurisdiction* we foresee, that “ it must soon in FaCt be extended to all the Inhabi-

“ tants of the Provinces, or with very few Exccp-

“ tiens. The Few who may be instructed to plead'

“ to the Jurisdiction, will be put to great Trouble <{ and Expence, whether the Plea be ultimately allowed or not. If, from not being able to find Bail,

“ they should be arrested and brought from a distant “ Province to Calcutta, they are thereby disgraced in the Eyes of their Province, supposing them to be “ Men of Rank, and probably ruined, by being torn “ from the Care of their Family and Affairs.” — That the said Sir Elijah Impey, being thus pressed, did altogether evade any further Difculfion, by refusing to receive the said Letter of the Council, because it was not addressed to all the Judges collectively, though it was in Answer to a Letter from himself alone.

That the said Rajah Choiton Sing, having been thu9 forcibly dragged down to Calcutta, by the Operation of a Writ issued on improper and inefficient Grounds, while he was there waiting the Event of his Cause, was arrested on another Affidavit, as an Inhabitant of Calcutta, and was confined for many Weeks a Prisoner in the common Gaol.

That various other Instances of Writs served upon Zemindars and other Natives, not in the Service of the Company, or of any of His Majesty’s Subjects, do appear to have been communicated from Time to Time in the aforesaid Year 1775, by the different Provincial Councils, to the Supreme Council in Fort William.

That in the Month of January 1776, the Supreme Council did receive at one Time, Petitions from Five principal Zemindars of the Calcutta Division, complaining of Writs having been issued from the Supreme Court, and of the Prejudice arising from the Abuse of the Authority veiled in the Persons who were sent with the Execution of them: The said Zemindars affirm themselves to be neither Servants of the Company, or of any English Gentleman, nor Pottah Holders in Calcutta; at the same Time representing their total Ignorance of the English Law, their consequent Apprehensions of its Penalties, anfl their Inability to support the Expence of Proceedings in the Supreme Court j and Rajah Indenarrain, Zemindar of the Seven Annas Tumiook, did further represent, that “ the Peons or Officers of the Court passed Rfpori 00 *.* through Two Apartments, and Jeated themselves Toucher, Pe- in those which contained the Women-, — pro- App"* Refer*

“ hihited them from Fire and Water, and began to be toN°j — N‘i*. “ abusive."

That during the same Year 1776, various other similar Petitions and Representations were transmitred to the Supreme Council, by the Provincial Councils, from their respective Departments , and the fame

Complaint*

A. 1787*.

Complaints did afterwards continue from Time to Time to be made: Particularly it does appear, that a Woman of some Rank, who possessed the Zemin-D°GeniA(>p* dary of a Purgunnah called “ who had

N” * " never been in the Service of the Company, or of

" any individual Europe'was confined for Two Months to her own House by Two Peons or Officers, who seated themselves at her Door, for the Purpose of serving upon her a Writ from the Supreme Court} and that the Vakeel of the Ranny of Raje did

represent various Summonses from the Supreme Court D"GeniApp« to have been procured against his Mistress, "who *s‘ “ was in no wife dependant on the Authority of the

" Court, and who had passed her whole Lifetime in " the Mahl Sarayc (or Female Apartments) nor ever “ had Transactions in Business with any one.” And the issuing of the said Processes against Women, and especially against a Woman of such Eminence as the' Ranny of Raje Shaby, whose Zemindary yields to the Company a Revenue of £. 300,000 per Annum or thereabouts, was a gross Outrage to Female Decency, according to the Manners of the East, where (as the said Sir Elijah Impey hath on another Occasion truly affirmed) a Hindoo or Moor Woman, if she be not the Ourcaft of the People, would stand out any Process ra-Gc > l^er t^ian aPPear *n 3 Court of Justice; as " the In-Afy> “ di8nity so greaC and her Feelings of it so strong,

“ that (he would not, after what (he would consider " such a Disgrace, submit to live.”

That, besides his Opinions conveyed in the aforesaid Jollification of the Proceedings against Rajah CkitonSiig, and in his general Approbation of all the Processes issued to that Period, the said Sir Elijah Impey, in the Month of January 1776, did send to the Governor General certain Answers to Questions which the Governor General had put to him, concerning the Jurisdiction of the Court over Natives; and he does therein intimate a positive Opinion against mere Farmers or Renters, with whatever Caution, he refers it conditionally to the Words of the aforesaid Act and Charter, but not daring openly to avow in the Ab-straft what he had maintained in the particular same of the said Rajah Choiton Sing, that all Zemindars who farmed their own Lands, were amenable, he professes " to think them not so — quo ad Zemindars;” at the same Time insidiously reserving a Condition, " if “ they were neither Servants of, or employed by, the “ Company,” under which Description he held them to be included in the Instance of the said Rajah, and on which Principle alone the Writs which had issued could have been founded.

That in the Year 1778 Issue being joined on a Plea of Jurisdiction, the said Sir Elijah Impey did, in his solemn Opinion thereon, give his Sentiments mod: decisively "and unequivocally against all Farmers or Renters; and although Sir Robert Chambers did on that Occasion incline to draw an equitable and solid Dillinftion, by which very many, if not the greater Part of the Farmers or Renters would have been exempted from the Jurisdiction of the Court, yet such was the Alarm which the Opinion of the said Sir Eljab Impey struck into the Minds of the Natives, that the Renters of a whole Province in a Body petitioned Government, that they might be allowed to be free from the Power of the new Court, or to abandon their Leases under Government.

That, not contented with drawing to himself the complete Cognizance of all Civil Suits relative to private Property and personal Wrong between the SifEtijshlm- greater Part of the more opulent Natives, yet hardly j'Jni Rocb- ° daring to propose openly that Provincial Adauluts fmf, March Should be established under the Controul of the Su->775- prenie Court, because the Legislature had not thought fit to interfere with them, but on the contrary doth plainly seem to have confirmed them according to their ancient Constitution, by the full Powers given

to the Governor General and Council in all Matters of Revenue; the said Sir Elijah Impey, by forced and misapplied Constructions of the Act and Charter aforesaid, by over-ruling the Proceedings, superseding the Commitments, and intimidating the Judges and other Officers of the Dewnnnee and other Native Courts, did usurp to himself a large and unjustifiable Share of Power over Causes, in which he did confess himself to have no Jurisdiction, either originally or by Appeal; and the due Authority of the Company'* Government was thereby much difgriced and weakened, and great Interruption was given to the Collection of the Revenue.

That, in particular, a certain Native Farmer or Renter, called Comaul o'Deen, who had been a principal Witness against the Maha Rajah Nundcomar aforesaid, and whose Testimony on that Trial the said Sir Elijah Impey had with much Partiality laboured to establish, was, soon after the Conviftion of the said Maha Rajah, put into Confinement, according to a customary Mode of Proceeding in such Cafes, till he Should have adjusted an outstanding Demand of the Company to the Amount of £. 13,000, and upwards, for which he had been called to Account previous to the said Trial; but on an Application from the said Comaul o'Deen for a Habeas Corpus, he was, by the said Sir Elijah Impey,discharged on Bail; and a verbal Intimation was given to Mr. Cottrell, the President of the Committee who had confined the said Comaul o'Deen, that he must not be committed again.

That the Supreme Council having examined, and found the Proceedings of the Committee to have been perfectly according to Precedent, did direct them to proceed in the usual Way: That accordingly Mr.

Cottrell again arrested Comaul ;and Comaul

o'Deen, on paying a small Balance of 900, which, he owned, was discharged by the said Sir Elijah , who also illegally threatened Mr. Cottrell wien an Attachment for Contempt of Court, in disregarding, agreeably to his Duty, the private and extra-judicial Intimation which he had received from the said Sir Elijah Impey.

That the Balances due from the said Comaul o'Deen to the Company did, in Consequence of the Protection thus afforded him by the said Sir Elijah , increase in the very next Year to a Sum little Short of Jf. 40,000.

That, encouraged by such Examples, dishonest Men and Defaulters did find frequent Pretences, by complaining to the Supreme Court, to delay Payment of" their Public Debts; and that, in the Year 1779, the Dewan of the Zemindary of Burd did represent General App» the Confusion of the Country and the Arrears of the N*6, Revenue in his District, from the Terror in which himself, his Officers, and the Inhabitants under his Protection, were kept by Menaces of Writs from the Supreme Court; and the said Dewan did particularize Ten different Instances of Persons who by such Means withheld their Rents, or forcibly detained Lands not their own; at the Head of which Lift he did place the Name of the Maha Rajah who

was the Principal in procuring an Address from the Native Inhabitants of Calcutta to the said Sir Impey, and the other Judges, on the Execution of the aforesaid Maha Rajah Nundcomar, and who, not long before the Time of the said Dewan’s Representation, had been again active, though without Effect, to procure an Address in Favour of the said Sir Elijah Impey against the Supreme Council; anci the said Dewan asserts, that the Relit of the said Rajah was near £. 4,000 per Annum, of which he had not paid a single Rupee for the past Year. — “ I cannot (he adds) fend " Peons to enforce Payment from him, Account of “ Apprehensions from the Supreme Court; and any Mefsages which arc sent to him to this Effect, he dif-" regards.”

4 That,

28 Geo. III. rz° Decemb

That, as the said usurped Controul of the Supreme Court strengthened and extended itself, the Power of the Native Courts declined; the Sudder Dewarinee Adaulet was abolished; and the Adaulet of Calcutta ceased to act; the Cauzees, Mufties, Foujedars, and the other Judges and executive Officers, in many of the Provinces, refused to exercise their. Functions 5 and at length, the whole Authority and Dignity of Native Justice wer# violated and diflionoured in the Person of Mahomed Rexa Khan, the Naib Nazim (or Mahometan Chief Justice) of who having ar-

rested a Native accused of Forgery as he was returning from Calcutta, whither he had been sent in Civility by

the Naib himself, to give Evidence before the Supreme Court, was directed, by a Writ of Habeas Corpus, to produce his Prisonerj but the Naib making no Return thereto, an Attachment was ordered against him, as for a Contempt.

That, by all and every of the said unwarrantable 'Attempts to extend his Jurisdiction, contrary to the plain Intention of the Legislature in the Act under which he was appointed to his Situation at the Head of the Supreme Court, and in Disregard of his obvious Duty, known and recognized by himself, and also, in a more particular Manner, by the various vexatious and illegal Processes by him issued or enforced, or abetted, defended, and approved, and by the Opinions and Judgments in which he so abetted, defended, or approved the vexatious and illegal Processes issued by others, as well as by his Refusals and Evalions, when repeatedly desired by the Supreme Council clearly to define the Limits of his own Jurisdiction, the said Sir Elijah Impey, Knight, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at Fort William in Bengal, did, for his own sinister and corrupt Views, frustrate the wife and benevolent Purpose of Parliament; did 'diferedit and disgrace the Administration of British Justice in the Eyes of all FRndojlan j and did convert a System, designed for the Relief and Protection of the Natives, into an Engine of Oppression and Ruin, at the same Time that he did materially disturb and diminifti the due Collection of the Public Revenues; — in all which Acts the said Sir Elijah Impey was, and is, guilty of High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

FOURTH CHARGE.

Cossijvrah Cause.

THAT, pending the aforesaid violent Exertions of the said Sir Elijah Impey, for the unjust Purposes of bringing all the principal Natives of Property in Bengal under his Jurisdiction, and of superseding the Authority of the Company’s Government, a disputed Matter of Account arose between the Rajah narrain, Zemindar of the Purgunnahs of and Shdport, which form Part of the District of Mid-

nap ore, in the Province of on the one Side,

and Cojfinaut Baboo, a principal Merchant at Calcutta,

and nearly allied to the said Rajah, on the other; as also between the said Cojfinaut Baboo on the one Side, and the Treasury of Calcutta on the other; the said Cojfinaut Baboo having been the said Rajah’s Security for the Rents payable to Government, and Manager of all Affairs relative to the Zemindary, during almost Five Years.

That the said Matters' of Account having been in Discussion before the Chief of Burdwan, that Officer made to the Governor General and Council a Report unfavourable to the Pretensions of the said Cojfinaut Baboo, against whom Process was thereupon ordered, for the Recovery of the Balances due to Government; and he was in Consequence thereof arrested and confined.

Vol. XUII.

That the said Cojfinaut Baboo, complaining of great Hardffiip and Severity in such Confinement, did apply to the Supreme Court for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, which was accordingly granted That the Return to the Writ appearing to be essentially defective, Time was, by Consent, allowed to amend the fame; and the said Cojfinaut, under the same Consent, was set free, on the Undertaking of his Counsel to Government for the Appearance of him, the said Cojfinaut, at the Day of the Return ! That, in the Interval, the said Cojfmaut sent in a very respectful Petition to the Supreme Council, proposing to deposit the Balance demanded, to await the final Decision of the said Council, and requesting a further and more exaCt Examination of Accounts which Proposition was accepted, the said Cojfin actually depositing the Sum in Dispute on the 17th of June 1777, and the Governor General and Council engaging for the full and fair Investigation required in the Petition.

That, when Two Years had elapsed without any Settlement to the Satisfaction of the said Cojfinaut Babco, the principal Officer rtill making a Report un-favourable to his Claims, the said Cojfinaut, on the 25th of May 1779, did present to the Supreme Council a Petition, requesting a speedy Determination; and the Superintendant of the Khalfa Records was there- upon ordered to examine; and report on the said Subject in Dispute: That the Superintendant,‘on the 28th of the same Month, did accordingly make such Report, accompanied with Two AbstraCts of the Account Current between the Parties; but the said Cojfinaut Baboo objecting to this Mode of adjusting the Accounts, his Objections were transmitted to the Rajah Soonder-narrain for his Answers; and the Matter was actually thus under Examination, when the said Cojfinaut,on the 13th of August 1779, commenced a Suit against the said Rajah of in the Su-

preme Court, by an Affidavit, dating, among other Things, that “ the said Rajah Soonder-narrain is “ Zemindar of the Purgunnah Cojfijurah and “ pore, in Bengal, and is employed by the United “ Company ot Merchants of England trading to the East Indies in the Collection of the Revenues due “ and payable to the said United Company out of the said Purgunnah.” And on this Affidavit, Mr. Justice Hyde gave an Order for issuing a Capias against the said Rajah.

That the said Affidavit was irregular and informal, according to the aforesaid 17th and 18th Titles of the Rules and Orders of the Supreme Court; inasmuch as the said Rules and Orders require a positive Oath to the Jurisdiction, even before a Summons can issue; and much more ought such Rule to have been observed, when a Capias was the first Process; but in the said Affidavit no such Oath to the Jurisdiction exists.

That the FaCts sworn to prove the Jurisdiction (namely, that the said Rajah was “ Zemindar of the “ Purgunnah Cojfijurah and Sabapore," and was employed by the Company in the Collection of “ the “ Revenues of the said Purgunnah”) ought, on the very Face of them, not to have been satisfactory to the Judge; inasmuch as the Words of the Affidavit do obviously seem to state the said Rajah as employed by the Company in the Collection of the Revenues, in virtue of his Situation as Zemindar; or they must mean, that he was the Farmer or Renter of his own Zemindary: But, whatever be their Signification, they did appear, as they flood, so little satisfactory to the said Elijah Impey, that, notwithstanding his before-mentioned DoCtrines in the same of the Rajah Choiton Sing, he did nevertheless, in his own Reference of the present Question to His Majesty’s Ministers at Home, think it adviseable altogether to conceal and suppress the very material Admission of the said Rajah’s being the Zemindar of Cojfijurah, and did merely state him

N n to

13B 12° DecembriA. 1787.

to be described as employed by the Company in the “ Collection of their Revenues” in the said Pur-gunnah.

That the other Fad, which seems to be sworn with a View to the Jurisdiction, and which is also noticed for the same Purpose in the same Reference of the said Sir Elijah Impey (namely, that the Debt was contracted at Calcutta) is not and ought not to have been more satisfactory j for the local Jurisdiction, here intended, resting on the Law of Nations, cannot by that Law operate on one who has passed the Limits thereof.

That, even if the said Rajah had been an avowed Servant of the Company, he would not, under the Act of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, have been amenable to the Supreme Court, according to the said Affidavit} because he is therein dated not to have been employed by the Company at the Time when the Debt arose, but to be so at the Time when the Action was brought} which was an Addition illegally inserted, or procured to be inferred, in the Charter, by the said Sir Elijah

. That the said Affidavit, to have been satisfactory, ought to have set forth, that the said Rajah was a Servant of the Company at the Time when the Cause of Action accrued, or that he was an Inhabitant of cutta, both then and when the Action wras brought: That in Truth it set forth neither one or the other; and the said Rajah, in Fad, was notoriously neither one or the other: That all Proceedings had on an Affidavit so loose, defective, and unsatisfadory, were highly irregular} and all Violences committed in the Execution thereof were illegal} and all Persons who approved, enforced, abetted, or defended any or all of the said Proceedings, and Violences consequent thereon, were culpable and criminal. /

That the aforesaid Capias being sent into the Pur-gunnah by a Sheriff’s Officer, the said Rajah concealed himself} and Notice of the Transaction having been lent to the Supreme Council by Mr. , Collector of Midnapore,the Council laid the same before Sir

John Day, who, in Consequence of repeated References on this very Subject, of the Attempts made by the Supreme Court for the Extension of their Jurisdiction, had been recently lent out as the Company’s Advocate General by the Court of Directors, with the full Concurrence and Approbation of His Majesty’s Ministers, and of His Majesty.

That the Advocate General advised, “ that in the ft same before him the Zemindar Should have Notice, “ that not being subject to the Jurisdiction, he Should “ not appear, or plead, or do or suffer any Ad, which

may amount, on his Part, to a Recognition of the Authority of the Judicature as extending to himfelfAnd he likewise advised, “ that in all fimi-

lar Cafes, as well as the present, the Power of Government Should not, if called upon, be employed “ in Aid of the Judicature} but that they Should be ,c left to their own Means of executing their Process, “ and thus render themselves alone responsible, Should . “ such be the Event, for having unnecessarily hazarded the Dignity and Authority of the King’s Judicature, by exposing its Process to Contempt, and “ its Officers to Resistance and Repulse.” That Mr. Pearce was instructed accordingly} and, if any Application for AHiftance was made to him, to report the Circumstances to the Board; and to wait their Orders thereon.

That, in Consequence of the Capias returning unexecuted, a Writ of Sequestration was ifi'ued against the Lands, Houses, and Effects of the Rajah of jurah, for the Purpose of compelling him to appear to the Action: That this Writ was sent by an European Officer, attended by some Peons, who proceeded to the Execution of his Orders} but being surrounded, and his Communication with the Country cut off.

though no Violence, or Appearance thereof, was offered to his Person, he sent to require further A Alliance } and, with the Privity and by the Advice of the said Sir Elijah Impey,the Sheriff lent a Reinforce-

ment of Er.giish Sailors, Sepoys, and Peons, to the Number of Sixty Men, or some other large Number, all armed with Musquets, Bayonets, or Scymiturs: That on Notice of the said Reinforcement, the Rajah, whose Servants had repulsed a> former Attempt of the Peons first sent to enter the Zenana, now told his People to drop all Resistance , and bade them, “ Go,

and with empty Hands claim the Protection of the “ Great Council} and (he added) though they may

kill Two or Three of you, say nothing, for this “ Reason, because we are poor Zemindars-, and cannot contend with the People of the Great Adau-tc let:” And the European Officer did afterwards proceed, at the Inltance of a Servant of named Gocul, to bind and beat several of the superior Servants of the Rajah; and broke the Door, and entered the Zenana, and plundered the House and Effects: And the next Morning, the expected Reinforcement being arrived, they again beat and disgraced the Servants, sequestered the rest of the Effects, and sealed the Door. — “ Even thus much did f‘they do, that they entered the House of the Tokoo " Jew (or the Temple) where no is per-

“ mitted to go, and spit in it, and allb stripped it of “ the Gold and Silver Ornaments. — Such Outrages “ as these were never known to be committed in the “ Annals of any King.” -

That the said Sir Elijah Impey, Knight, Chief Justice at Fort William,in Calcutta, appears to have been privy to, and to have been aiding or assisting in all those various Proceedings} and either to have directed or fuggdted them in the first Instance, or to have adopted and enforced them, tvhen they had been previously done or directed by others} and that, in a long and laboured Letter, dated on the 3d of March 1780, and addressed to Lord Viscount IVeymonth, then One bf His Majesty’s principal Secretaries of State, he doth defend and maintain the Propriety and Legality of the Whole and every Part of the said Transac-tiens, putting false Glosses and Colours on FaCts, with Intent to deceive His Majesty} and doth avow, that when the Complaint of the Officer first sent with the Writ of Sequestration “ confided more in what he apprehended would be done, than what had in FaCt “ been done,” he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, “

*3 9

sand Pounds a Year was annexed to the Office of Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court of Judicature; and it was by the said Act specially provided, that the said Salary Should be in Lieu of all Fees of Office, Perquisites, Emoluments, or Advanrages whatsoever, and that no Fees of Office, Perquisites, Emoluments, or Advantages whatsoever, Should be accepted, received, or taken by the said Chief Justice, in any Manner, or any Account or Pretext whatsoever, other than such Salary or Allowance as by the said Act was directed to be paid to him; and by the said Act, the Acceptance of any Gift, Donation, or Reward, by the said Chief Justice, in any Manner, or any Account whatsoever, was expressly prohibited: That the said Sir Elijah Impey did, together with the other Judges of the said Supreme Court, in a Letter from the said Supreme Court to the Court of Directors, bearing Date the 14th of December, in the Year 1776, express the most anxious Desire that they Should not be under the slighted Obligation to the Governor General and Council, even for a mere Mercantile Accommodation in remitting to England the Amount of their Salaries; declaring in the said Letter, that the Influence which such Accommodation tended to create was of a Nature degrading to the King’s Judges, and might be so subversive of Justice, that they hoped the least Surmise of it would be sufficient to procure an effectual Redress against it: And they did farther, by the said Letter, declare, that they had nothing to depend on but their Salaries, and could have no Means of acquiring Property, other than their Salaries.

That by virtue of the said Act of Parliament, by the Nature of the said Office of Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, and according to the declared Sense and Opinion of the said Sir Elijah Impey relative thereto, it was the Duty of the said Sir Elijah Impey not to accept of any Office of Power or Profit,. his Continuance in the Enjoyment whereof Should or might depend on the Pleasure of the said East India Company, the Governor General and Council of Ben-galy or any other of the Servants of the said East India Company.

That in the Year 1772, the President and Council

of Bengal did make divers Regulations for the better Administration of Justice in the different Courts of Mofuffell Dewannee Adaulet,' throughout the Kingdoms of Bengaly Bahary and Orijfa, being Courts of Justice for the Trial and Determination of Civil and Revenue Causes arising in the said Kingdoms; which Regulations the Court of Directors of the said East India Company did approve of, and did give particular Orders that no Alteration Should be made therein, without the previous Communication of such intended Alteration to the said Coure of Directors. That the said President and Council did, at the same Time, establish a Supreme Court of Appeal from the said Courts of Dewannee Adaulet, by the Name of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, to be held at Fort Williamy and to consist of the President and not less than Two of the other Members of the said Council, assisted by the Dewan of the Khalfa, and other Native Officers who Should be acquainted with the Laws and Customs of the said Kingdoms of Bengal, Babary and Orijfa.

That by virtue of the said Statute of the Thirteenth of His present Majesty, Cap. 63, the Powers, Jurisdiction, and Functions of the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet became vested in the Governor General and Supreme Council, established and appointed by the said Statute, but no Power or Authority was thereby given to the said Governor General and Supreme Council to part with the said Powers, Jurisdiction, and Funftions, or the Exercise thereof, from themselves, or to confer the same on any other Person or Persons whatsoever.

That on or about the 28th Day of March, in the

3

Year 1780, the then Governor General and Council did make several Regulations relative to the said Courts of Dewannee Adaulet; by which, among other Things, they did order and direct, that a covenanted Servant of the said East India Company Should, by the Name of Superintendant, preside in each of the said Courts: That all Civil Causes, not regarding the Revenue, Should be tried and determined in the said Courts of Dewannee Adaulet 5 but that all Matters of Revenue should be under the Jurisdiction of the several Provincial Councils, which had before then been instituted and established by the President and Council of Bengal. That by the said last mentioned Regulations, the Appellate Jurisdiction was continued in the said Governor General and Supreme Council, as constitming the Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, to wit, from the said Dewannee Adaulet Courts, in Civil Cafes, not regarding the Revenue, and from the said Provincial Councils in Matters of Revenue. That the said last-mentioned Regulations were an Alteration of the former Regulations hereinbefore mentioned, and were established and carried into Execution without any previous Communication thereof to the said Court of Directors, in direct Diiobedience of the said Orders of the said Court of Directors.

That in and before the said Year 1780, a great and dangerous Difference and Contention had arisen between the said Supreme Court and the said Governor General and Council, as constituting the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, touching the Jurisdictien in Civil Causes and Matters of Revenue, and touching a Right claimed by the said Supreme Court of entertaining Civil Causes and Suits against the Zemindars, or Hereditary Landholders, in the said Kingdoms of Bengal, Bahary and Orijfa, which Difference and Contest had been chiefly occasioned and fomented by the said Sir Elijah Impey.

That in or about the Month of September, in the said Year 1780, Warren Hajlings, Esquire, then Governor General of Bengal, did move, propose, and carry in Council, that the said Sir Elijah Impey Should be requested to accept of the Charge and Superintendance of the said Office or Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, under its then present, and such other Regulations as the said Supreme Council Should think proper to add thereto, or substitute instead thereof; and that, on his Acceptance thereof, he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, Should be styled the Judge of the Sudder Dewannee Adaulet; and the said Warren Ilajlings did, at the same Time, declare his Opinion, that the said proposed Appointment would prove a Means of Conciliation between the said Supreme Court and the Council.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey, being then Chief Justice as aforesaid, was, in Consequence of such Motion and Proposal of the said Warren Hajlingsy requested to accept, and did accept, the said Office of Judge of the Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, to be held during the Pleasure of the said Governor General and Council.

That some Time in or about the Month of October, in the said Year 1780, the said Warren Hajlings did move, propose, and carry in Council, that a large Salary, and other Emoluments, amounting to the Annual Sum of Eight thousand Pounds, or some other large Annual Sum, Should be granted to the said Sir Elijah Impey, being then Chief Justice as aforesaid, as and for,his Salary and Emoluments in the said Office of Judge of the Sudder Dewannee Adawlet; which said Salary and Emoluments were to be paid to the said Sir Elijah Impey by the said East India Company; and the said Sir Elijah Impey did consent to and accept the said Grant of the said Salary and Emoluments, to be enjoyed during the Plea* sure of the said Governor General and Council.

/ That

L.

That the said Sir Elijah , by his Acceptance of the said Office of Judge of the Sudder Dcwannee Adaulet, did virtually and implicitly, so far as in him lay, relinquish the Claim of the said Supreme Court to exercise Jurisdiction over the said Causes and Persons, in the Maintenance of which, before such Appointment had veiled the said disputed Jurisdiction in his own Person, he had proceeded to fitch dangerous Extremities in the said Contention with the Governor General and Council j for he accepted the same at the Requifuion, and under the Appointment, of the said Warren Hajlings, who had declared his Opinion as

aforesaid, that the said Appointment would prove a Means of Conciliation between the said Supreme Court and the Council.

That the said Sir Elijah did further not only virtually relinquish, on the Part of the said Supreme Court, but did also in Effect deprive the said Supreme Court of the Exercise of the disputed Jurisdiction aforesaid, by his said Acceptance of, and Appointment to, the Office aforesaid, of Judge of the Sudder Dewannee Adaulet j for the said Jurisdiction being claimed and exercised by himself in his said Office of Judge of the Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, the Parties and Causes were interrupted by him, the said Sir Elijah Impey, in the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, before they couid be brought before the said Supreme Court j and the Suitors who might have been inclined to carry such Causes into the said Supreme Court, in Preference to the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, if the said Sir Elijah Impey had not presided in both the said Courts, were discouraged and deterred therefrom by the Fear of offending the said Sir Elijah Impey, in neglecting to bring the same in the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet.

That the said Supreme Court, for these Reasons, and in Consequence of the said Appointment of the said Sir Elijah Impey to the said Office of Judge of the Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, did cease, in Point of Fadt, to exercise the said disputed Jurisdictions.

That the said Consequences of the said Appointment do prove, either that the said Sir Elijah Impey did not think the said former Claim of the said disputed Jurisdictions, on Behalf of the said Supreme Court, was valid and founded in Law; or that the said Sir Elijah Impey had consented to relinquish and depart from the said valid and legal Claim of the said Supreme Court, on a corrupt Consideration of acquiring to himself, in lieu thereof, the said disputed Jurisdictions, Powers, Influence, and Authority, throughout the said Kingdoms, together with a great Salary, and other pecuniary Emoluments attached thereto.

That, after the said Appointment of the said Sir Elijah Impey to the said Offices, the said Sir Elijah Impey did propose, and, with the Approbation of the Majority of the said Governor General and Supreme Council, did establish, certain new Regulations, for the Conduct of the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, and the said inferior Courts of Dewannee Adaulet, whereby, among other unwarrantable Ex-tenflons of the Power of the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, the said Sir Elijah Impey did declare it competent to the said last-mentioned Court to receive new Evidence on the hearing of Appeals, which had not been given or produced in the inferior Court or Courts from which such Appeals had been brought.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey, by accepting the said Office and Salary, did receive, de from the said Governor General and Council, a Judicial Power and Authority, which they had no Right to confer on him, or on any other Person j and, by accepting the same after the Eitablilhment of Regulations of the said Courts of Dewannee Adaulet, polterior to those

which had been established in the Year 1772 as aforesaid, before the same had been communicated to rhe said Court of Directors, did give his Sanction and Countenance to the Disobedience of the Orders of the said East India Company, by their Servants, the said Governor General and Council.

That by the said Regulations, established by himself, he did bellow on himself, as Judge of the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, Powers, not only more extensive than were veiled in those who had attempted to delegate their Judicial Authority to him, but totally inconsistent with the Nature of an Appellate Jurisdiction.

That he did also, by his said Acceptance of the said Office and Salary, defeat the salutary Purpose of the Legislature, in prohibiting the said Judges of the said Supreme Court from receiving any Emolument or Advantage whatsoever, excepting their Salaries as such Judges; that he did thereby, contrary to the Nature and Duty of his Office, as Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, and his own declared Sense and Opinion thereof, become, and render himself, dependant on the said East India Company, and their Servants, the said Governor General and Council, both for the Continuance of the Power and of the pecuniary Advantages which were annexed to the said Office of Judge of the said Court of Sudder Dewannee Adaulet, degraded and disgraced the said Supreme Court of Judicature, of which he was Chief Justice j and by his said several Acts was, and is, guilty of High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

and cruel Manner, carried into Execution, by extorting and seizing Effects and Treasures of the said Princesses to a great Amount, in Consequence of the Orders received by the said Nathaniel Middleton from the said Warrcn Hajlings, through the said Sir Elijah Impey, and by the colourable Authority of the said Vizier, a Prince entirely under the Influence and Controul of the said Warren Hajlings, but contrary to the declared Inclination, as well as the filial Duty, and the Feelings of the said Vizier.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey did also, during his said Journey, become the Adviser and Instrument of the said Warren Hajlings, in collecting pretended Proofs and Evidence against Cheyt Singy the Rajah of Benares, who had been then recently expelled from his Territories by the Oppression and Tyranny of the said Warren Hajlings, in order to procure for the said Warren Hajlings a pretended Justification of the said oppressive and tyrannical Expulsion, «and of the Proceedings of the said Warren Hajlings previous to, and in order to effect that wicked End.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey did moreover become, during his said Journey, the Adviser and Instrument of the said Warren Hajlings, in collecting, in like Manner, pretended Proofs and Evidence against the said Princeflfes, the Mother and Grand-mother of the said Vizier, in order to furnifti a Pretext for the said pre-concerted forcible Seizure of the said Effects and Treasures of the said Princesses.

That none of the said Depositions or Affidavits, so taken by the said Sir Elijah impey% were relative to any Suit, Cause, or Proiccution then depending, or about to be inftitmed, in the said Supreme Court, or before the said Sir Elijah Impey, as Chief Justice thereof, or as a Magistrate or Justice of the Peace.

That although the said Sir Elijah Impey well knew that the said Depositions or Affidavits, in as far as they related to the said Princesses, were intended by the said Warren Hajlings to be made the Foundation or Pretext for seizing their said Effects and Trea-fores, yet he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, neither gave, nor caused nor advised to be given, to the said Prin-cefifes, or to either of them, before, at, or after the Time of taking the said Depositions or Affidavits, any Notice or Intimation of the Intention and Purpose of taking the fame, or of his having taken the fame, or of the Contents or Purport thereof, or did Vol. XLIII.

That although, in certain of the said Affidavits so taken at Lucknow, there was contained Matter of Accusation against the said Vizier himself, charging him with Acts of Disaffection to the British Government, and although the said Sir Elijah Impey was then his Guest, and did, during his Continuance at Lucknow, accept of Presents, and various other Marks of Hof-pitality and Respect from the said Vizier, yet he, the said Sir Elijah Impey, did receive such Matter of Accusation against the said Vizier, and did not inform him thereof, nor afford him any Opportunity of con-tradiding or disproving the said Acts of Disaffection to the British Government, so by the said Affidavits imputed to him.

That the said Sir Elijah Impey not only advised the Measure of taking the said Depositions or Affidavits, but did also advise and prepare the Form of the Caption or introdudory Part thereof, and did take the said Depositions, when reduced into Writing, sworn to, and signed by the respective Persons taking the fame, into his Custody and Keeping, and did afterwards deliver the same to the said Warren Hajlings, to be by him used for the iniquitous Purposes aforesaid; and did therefore, in those Relpeds, ad as the express Solicitor or Attorney of the said Warren Hajlings, against the find Cheyt Sing and the said Princesses, of the Accuser against the Accuied; — thereby taking upon himself, being then Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, a Species of Agency which could not have been honourably exercised by any Solicitor, Attorney, private Person, or even menial Servant, of the said y/arren Hajlings.

To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgestes, in Parliament assembled. ‘

The Second Report of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the State and Condition, of the Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, and to fell or alienate Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents.

IN our First Report, made during the last Session of Parliament, we briefly mentioned, that the Landed Possessions and Revenues of the Crown were composed of Three distinct Branches: That is to say,

First, Of the Landed Possessions of the Crown granted by Lease.

Secondly, Of the Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chaces.

Thirdly, Of Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents.

And we mentioned, that we should regulate our Proceedings and Reports on these Subjects so as to keep the Examination and Enquiry separare and distinct on each Branch, for the Reasons there set forth.

It was our Intention, that the Woods and Forests should have been the Subject of our Second Report; because the Abuses which we have discovered to exist in that Department, and the Importance of preserving and protecting those Nurseries of Timber for the Support of the Naval Strength of this Kingdom, seemed to demand from us the earliest Attention: But

Another

Another Circumstance, which increases the Difficulty of ascertaining precisely what Rents now belong to die Crown, is, that many of the Rents liable to Sale tinder the Acts of 22d and 23d Charles IId, were in Jointure to Catherine, then Queen Consort, afterwards Queen Dowager, and were fold in Reversion after her Decease: On the Death of that Queen, which happened in the Year 1705, the Revenues which had been in Jointure to her were directed, by the then Lord Treasurer, to be given in Charge to the several Auditors and Receivers of the Crown Land Revenue, according to their respective Divisions: Bur, either from the Officers to whom that Business was entrusted not knowing what Rents in the Queen’s Jointure had attually been fold; or, the Auditors not having the Purchase Deeds inrolled before them; many Rents which had been disposed of, were then given in Charge, and have ever since been continued on the Rentals, though constantly returned in Arrear. And although such Purchase Deeds must have been inroiled in some One of the Four Courts, to make the Title of the Purchaser valid, yet, as such Inrollments were made, promiscuously with others, in each of the Four Courts, and there are not, at this Dav, any other Helps to an Examination of them than Indexes of the Names of the Parties, an Investigation of that Kind would have been attended with much Expence, and, probably, with little Utility. To these Causes, principally, we conceive it to be owing, that the Rentals for most of the Divisions of the Englif Counties are loaded with Rents which are never received, but are kept in Charge under the Denomination of Supered Rents, or, Old Supers; an Official Term, applied to Rents which have been Sixty Years or upwards in Arrear.

For these Reasons, arid because we have not been able to obtain any exact Lifts of the Fee Farm Rents payable to the Crown before such Sale began, nor of the Rents fold in pursuance of the aforesaid Acts, we have been obliged to take up the Matter, as we found it, from the Returns made to us by the Auditors and Clerk of the Pipe; and have, consequently, been subject to great Uncertainty, in forming Conclusions respecting the Rents in Arrear, which of them ought to be deemed good or recoverable Rents, and which have been actually disposed of, or are become illeviable from any other Cause.

Assisted by the Returns above-mentioned, we have formed the Three Schedules accompanying this Report, and severally marked A. B. C.

The Schedule A. contains an Abstract of the Vif-contiel Rents and Seizures, Yearly sent out in Process from the Great Roll of the Pipe, to be levied by the respective Sheriffs; whose Duty it is, likewise, to receive and account for the Post Fines, Fines of Assize and Sessions, Monies levied by Writs of Levari facias. Felons Goods, and other Matters: But these being casual and not fixed Revenues, we have not included them in this Schedule; which is confined to the Vif-contiel Rents and Seizures, and is abstracted from the Returns made to us by the Clerk of the Pipe, of the Whole of the Sheriff’s Accounts, as they were passed for the Year ending at Michaelmas 1785.

In forming this Schedule, we have endeavoured, from the Returns made to our Precepts by most of the Under Sheriffs, and from Information obtained through other Channels, to supply the Names of the Persons at present liable to the Payment of the Rents, as far as we have been able to discover them, instead of the Names appearing on the Great Roll of the Pipe, which, in many Initances, have been the same for Centuries part. To this we have added, an Abstract of the ancient Description of the Estate, with the Annual Rents, the Number of Years in Arrear, and the present Amount of the Arrears; in which we have

endeavoured to distinguisfi the Rents Annually received by the Sheriff's, from the Rents not received, but answered by them out of their olvn Purse; and have given an Account of the Rents which are chtiled, or vihilled, on the Sheriff’s AppofaI,on parting of his Account: And at the Conclusion of the Schedule, we have formed an Abstract of the Whole,

r.

shewing, at one View, the Annual Amount of the Rents actually received by the Sheriffs, and of those answered, but not by them received; the Total Amount of the Rents and Seizures, as well answered as nichilled', and the Total Amount of the accumulated Arrears,

On Reference to this Abstract it will appear, that the Annual Amount of the Rerits actually collected by the respective Sheriffs of Counties, Cities, and Towns in England, as far as we have been able to ascertain by Returns, is Three hundred and Thirteen Pounds Thirteen Shillings and Nine Pence Farthing: That the Amount of Rents answered by the Sheriffs, though not actually received, is Two hundred and Fifty-tw'o Pounds Fourteen Shillings and Three Eighths of One Penny. But the Sheriffs of Horsetfire, Hertford fire, and Oxford fire, as also of the Cities of Canterbury and Norwich, and the Towns of Nottingham and Southampton, not having returned any Answers to our repeated Precepts, we cannot insert the Proportions in those Divisions: All that we can ftatc, with Certainty, is, that the Amount of the Fee Farm and fixed Viscontiel Rents, answered by all the Sheriffs, is only Eight hundred and Twenty-seven Pounds Eleven Shillings and One Penny Three Farthings: That the Amount of such Rents rdcbilled on parting the Sheriffs Accounts, is Two hundred and Twenty-eight' Pounds Thirteen Shillings and Six f

Pence Farthing: That the Amount of Seizures, adtu- f#

ally answered, is Four Pounds Five Shillings and £-4* s-Four Pence: That the Annual Amount of Seizures given in Charge to the Sheriffs to be collected, but nichilled on parting their Accounts, is Five thousand £.5,494. is. Four hundred and Ninety-four Pounds Eighteen Shillings and Five Pence; and that the Aggregate of the accumulated Arrears to Michaelmas 1785, is Three hundred and Eighty-nine thousand Nine hun- £.3*9,905. 1. dred and Five Pounds One Shilling and Five Pence Three Farthings.

£.Sc7.

A more particular Detail of the Manner of fending out the Annual Procels to the several Sheriffs, from the Office of the Pipe, and of the tedious and chargeable Forms of parting the Sheriffs Accounts, through the numerous Offices connected therewith, in the present System of accounting; with our Opinion how the same may be conduced with more Dilpatch, and greater Oeconomy, will be the Subject of a future Report: We shall only observe here, that an Officer, whose Authority continues for One Year only, is not well calculated to collect or preserve a Revenue so generally and vaguely described, as the Estates chargeable with these Rents appear to be, in the Process with which the Sheriffs are furnished.

The Schedule B. contains a Particular of the Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents in the Principality of Wales, including Monmouth; in which are specified, the Estates from which the Rents issue, by what Grants they are reserved (where the Grants appear) by whom payable, to what Time paid, the Number of Years in Arrear, and, the Amount of Arrears in each County; of all which, an Abstract is formed at the End of each Division, and a general Abstract at the End of both. By Reference to the Abstract at the End of the Division of North Wales, it will appear, that the Annual Amount of Fee Farm Rents given in Charge to the Receiver Geneial, Glynn Wymt, Esquire, is Three thousand Three hundred and £.3,;,05. 4. Five Pounds Six Shillings and One Penny Farthing;

but out of this Total, many of the particular Rents in each County are become illeviable, from a Variety of Circumstances, and others are fallen many Years in Arrcarj but we trust, that most of the latter will be recoverable by proper Exertions. It is not easy, at this Juncture, to discriminate accurately between the illeviable Rents, and recoverable Rents in Arrear; but the Aggregate Amount (including the Collection Rents in the Receipt of Edvard , one of the Bailiffs or Sub-Receivers) at the Time of making up this Account, on the 10th of October 1786, was Thirty-two thousand and Ninety-nine Pounds Six Shillings and Seven Pence.

The same Kind of Abstract, at the End of the Division of South Wales and County of , ffiews,

that the Annual Amount of the Fee Farm Rents given in Charge to the Receiver General, the Right honourable Charles James Fox, including certain Payments called Comorthas (which are a Species of Rents payable Once in Two, Three, or Four Years, according to the Custom, and which are Averaged at those Rates respectively) is Three thousand and Thirty-six Pounds Fifteen Shillings and One Penny Half-penny. The Rents in this Division are much better collected and brought to Account than those in North Wales; for the Aggregate Amount of Arrears is only Six thousand Six hundred and Seventy-two Pounds One Shilling and Six Pence Farthing j of which we conceive a considerable Part to be recoverable, from the Shortness of the Periods at which they respectively commenced. The Annual Amount of the Rents in Charge, in the Two Divisions, is Six thousand Three hundred and Fifty-two Pounds One Shilling and Two Pence Three Farthings; and the Total of the Arrears accumulated thereon, amounts to Thirty-eight thousand Seven hundred and Seventy-one Pounds Eight Shillings and One Penny Farthing.

It may be proper here to remark, That amongst the Rents in Wales there are many called Collection Rents, of which a considerable Part is now in Arrear; and there is a Relit called The Tunc Relit, peculiar to Fiintshire,amounting to Eighty Pounds Twelve Shillings and Two Pence per Annum, which is attended with Circunistances of a singular Nature, and requires fomc Exertion to restore the Collection thereof. Formerly every Sheriff of Fiintshire, at the Time of passing his Account before the Auditor, paid this Relit of Eighty Pounds Twelve Shillings and Two Pence, in full, at the Audit, until the Sheriffalty of Thomas Kyffyn, FTquire, in 1766, when only Twenty Pounds were paid to the Receiver; and in the following Year, the Payment was reduced to Ten Pounds; since which Period no Part of it has been paid at the Audits.

The Schedule C. contains a Particular of the Fee Farm and other Dry and Unimproveable Rents within the Audits of James West and Henry Shelley, Esquires; comprizing all the Counties in England, except Monmouth: In which Schedule are dated, as concisely as possible, the different Descriptions of Rents receivable in each County and Division, in the Order in which they are enumerated in the Lift at the End of the Schedule: And, in order to Ihew the aCtual State of the receivable Rents, and the current Arrears thereop, in Comparison with the Old Supers or illeviable Rents, the Totals of these Three Columns are made up at the End of each Class, and the general Total at the End of each County, as well as at the End of each Receiver’s Division; so that, as far as regards each Receiver, the Abstract we have formed at the End of his particular Division, ffiews, at one View, the Total of Rents he ought to receive Annually, the Arrears which he or his Predccessors have differed to accumulate on the receivable Rents, and, the Annual Amount

of Rents admitted as Old Supers; of which latter Kind we have thought it diffident to state the Totals only, as the Insertion of the Particulars would have swelled the Schedule considerably to no Purpose.

On Reference to the Recapitulation of the Abstrafks of Rents in the Collection of the several Receivers General, at the End of the Schedule C. it will appear, that the Annual Total of good Fee Farm Rents, re-ceiveable in the Audits of James West and Henry Shelley, Esquires, amounts to Five thousand Fojur hundred and Sixty-two Pounds One Shilling and Five Pence Three Farthings; that the Annual Total of Old Supers is Ninethousand and Seventy-three Pounds Five Shillings and Six Pence Seven Eighths of One Penny; and, that the Annual Total of Fee Farm and other Dry Rents, which, at first View, appears to be the Amount of the Annual Rental, it Fourteen thousand Five hundred and Thirty-five Pounds Seven Shillings and Five Eighths of One Penny. The Aggregate of the Arrears is Eight thousand Eight hundred and Seventy-eight Pounds Seventeen Shillings and Nine Pence; which we shall call on the several Receivers to collect or account for, agreeable to the Powers of the Ad, if the Arrears are not speedily reduced to a reasonable Balance, in those Counties where they appear most considerable.

Upon the Whole, it will appear that the Amount of the receivable Fee Farm and other Dry and Unimproveable Rents in the several Counties of England and Wales, accounted for before the Clerk of the Pipe, and the respective Auditors, is as follows:

Viscontiel Rents and Seizures in the English Counties, accounted for in the Pipe Office,

Rents in North and South Wales, accounted for to the Auditor of that Principality, — —

Rents in the several Divisions of the Counties of England, in the Aaidits of James West and Henry Shelley,

Esquires, — —

' $

Making a Total of 12,635 19 2*

Though we have stated the Totals of the Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents audited in these several Departments, to be the Amount of such Rents at present payable to the Crown; yet we muftiemark that the Fee Farm Relit of One thousand and Two hundred Pounds, paid Half Yearly into the Exchequer from the Manor of Mulgrave and is of the lame

Description, and Should be taken in Addition to the Totals above stated; and, that this Part of the Land Revenue will be considerably augmented in the Year 1804, by the Return of many Rents, formerly settled on Catherine Queen Dowager, but afterwards granted away for Terms of Ninety-nine Years, to commence at her Death, which happened in the Year 1705.

Of these Rents we have already fold a considerable Number to the Proprietors of the Estates out of which they issued, to whom the Act directs the Preference of Purchase to be given until the First Day of January next; and we have received Applications for the Purchase of a great many more. — The Produce arising from the Sale has been inverted in the Three per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, agreeably to the Provisions of the Act; and the Capital purchased therewith, and (landing in the Name of the Lord High Treasurer of England, is at present Forty thousand £ 4°>5 Pounds.

Faversham A PETITION of several of the Company of oyster Fishery ftee Fishermen and Dredgermen of the Manor p«m»n. and Hundred of Faversham, in the County of Kent, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That there is a considerable Oyster Fishery within the said Manor and Hundred, limited by well known Marks and Bounds, wherein all Persons who have been duly admitted Freemen of the said Fishery at a Water Court of the Lord of the said Manor andHundred, and none others, have, and from Time immemorial have had, the Right to breed, lay, dredge for, catch, have, and take, Oysters and Oyster Brood; and that the Petitioners whole Dependance for themselves and Families is on the said Oyster Fishery, and the same is maintained and preserved at the foie Costs and Charges of the Petitioners, who Yearly expend £. 7,000, and upwards, in purchasing Oyster Brood, and laying the same in the Waters and Creeks within the Limits thereof; and that the Petitioners regularly supply the London Market during the Oyster Season with Oyster* from the said Fishery, and a considerable Quantity of Oysters is Yearly exported therefrom to Foreign Parts, which are paid for in Money, and by Means thereof the saidFisheryis a Source of National Benefit; and that the said Oyster Fishery hath been for some Time past, and now is, greatly prejudiced by Strangers, and Persons not being Freemen or Members of the said Company, dredging for, and taking and carrying away the

A. 1788.

Oysters, and destroying the Oyster Brood, in tho Waters and Creeks within the Limits thereof, and the Continuance of the said Depredations will very much tend to the Destruction of the said Fishery, which hath always been considered as a Nursery of Seamen for the Royal Navy: And therefore praying. That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for more effectually securing the said Oyster Fishery, by such Ways and Means as the House shall think fit.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Marsham, Mr. Hcnywood,

&c.: And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to fend for Persons, Papers, and Records.

Mr. Marsham reported from the Committee, to Dwtford whom the Bill for continuing the Term, and varying R0*1*®*11 the Powers, of an \&, of the Sixth Year of His pre- wp*rt sent Majesty, for repairing and widening several Roads leading to the Town of Dartford, in the County of Kent, was committed; That the Committee had examined the Allegations of the Bill, and found the same to be true} and that the Committee had gone through the Bill, and made several Amendments thereunto, which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered the Bill, with the Amendments, in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the Amendments were Once read throughout; and then a Second Time, One by One; and, upon the Question severally put thereupon, were agreed to by the House.

Ordered, That the Bill, with the Amendments, be ingfoffed.

A Petition of Peter John/on, of the City of York, Knapt#* Esquire, and of the several other Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed, on the Behalf of themselves and others. Owners of Estates within the Manor or Lordship and Township of Knapton, in the County of the City of York, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That there are, within the said Manor or Lordship and Township, Five small Common Arable Fields, containing 230 Acres, or thereabouts, and the Lands of the Proprietors therein lie dispersed, and distant from each other, and, for Want of being divided and inclosed, cannot at present be cultivated to the best Advantage; and that the said Peter JobnJon, and several other Persons, are Owners

of Lands, Rights, and Interests, in the said Common Arable Fields, and other Common Grounds, or some of them, or in some Tenements.

<c Act to difiolve the present, and prevent the future, Combination of Coal Owners, Lightermen, Maf- ters of Ships, and others, to advance the Price of “ Coals, in Prejudice of the Navigation, Trade, and " Manufactures of this Kingdom, and for the further Encouragement of the Coal Trade,” it was enacted, That if any Lighterman, Master of Ship, Crimp, Coal Factor, or other Person buying or selling or dealing in Coals, or otherwise concerned in the Coal Trade, by himself or his Agent, should, at any Time after the Day therein mentioned, receive or take for the Ule of such Lighterman, Master of Ship, Crimp, Coal Fadlor, or other Person, any Salary, Gratuity, Reward, Allowance, or Sum of Money from any Coal Owner, Fitter, Master of Ship, or other Person, for contracting, buying, vending, felling, or disposing of any particular Sorts of Coals in Preference of any other Sorts of Coals, every Person offending Should, for every such Offence, forfeit 50; . and that, by another Act, passed in the Third Year of the Reign of King George the Second, intituled,

“ An Act for the better Regulation of the Coal Trade,” it was enacted, That every Person who Should take or receive any Premium, Gratuity, Reward, Sum of Money, or Allowance in Coals, or in Account, or otherwise, from any Coal Owner, Fitter, or Master of a Ship, or any of their Agents, or Servants, for contradling, buying, vending, or disposing of any particular Sorts of Coals, or should otherwise - offend contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of the said Act of Queen Anne, should, over and above the Vol. XLIII.

Penalty inflicted by that Act for such Offence, forfeit and pay the [Sum of £. 500; and that every Coal Owner or Fitter, who should, by himself, or his Agent, or Servant, give, or agree to give, to any Ship Master, Lighterman, Crimp, or Buyer of Coals, or to any of their Agents or Servants, any Premium, Salary, Gratuity, Reward, Sum of Money, or any Allowance in Coals, or in Account, or otherwise, for contradling, buying, vending, felling, or disposing of any particular Sort of Coals, every such Coal Owner; Fitter, or Person so offending, should for every such Offence forfeit £. 500; and that Actions have lately been commenced against the Petitioners, and moll, if not all, of the other Coal Buyers at the Coal Exchange, by a Person who was formerly a Coal Buyer, but who has Twice failed in Trade, to recover Penalties to a very large Amount, under Pretence of their having been guilty of an Infringement of the said Acts, by receiving certain Allowances from the Coal Owners; and that the Petitioners conceive themselves to be greatly aggrieved by such Proceedings, inasmuch as they have never (as far as they are able to judge) acted in Violation of the Law, and although they should be able to defend themselves against such Actions, yet the Expences which they will necessarily and unavoidably be put to by upwards of a Hundred Actions, brought by a common Informer, who is a Bankrupt, and not able to pay the Costs which may be awarded to the Petitioners, form a very serious Object for Consideration, and may be a heavy Loss to the Petitioners; and that it has been customary for the Owners of Coals consigned to the Port of London to make certain Allowances to the Purchasers of those Coals in London, but such Allowances are not made by an Individual, or by a small Number of Coal Owners, by Way of Premium to the Coal Buyers for purchasing the Coals of such Individual, or small Number of Coal Owners in Preference to all others (which the Petitioners conceive to have been the Offence in the Contemplation of the Legislature at the Time of passing the Acts before mentioned) nor are such Allowances made by Stipulation at or previous to the Sale of the Coals, but they are voluntary Payments made long after the Sale by all the Owners of Collieries (but one, by whomalfo they have been made, though that one Owner has for feme Time ceased to make such Payments) and these Payments are also founded on long Usage existing before any of the Petitioners embarked their Fortunes in the Trade; and that such Allowances were neither given with a View to secure the Sale of any particular Sort of Coals in Preference to another, nor have they, in Point of Fadl, produced the Effect of securing such a Preference?, for the Petitioners are ready to prove that there is an equal Sale for all Coals which come to the London Market, according to the Quality of each Species of Coal, at the fair Market Price, so that the Trade is upon an exact Equality, and no Coal Owner has complained, or has any just Cause of Complaint, on the Ground of any Preference; and that the Petitioners can with Truth affirm that the Allowances before mentioned have no Tendency whatever to increase the Price of Coals to the Consumer, neither have they produced such an Effect, because these Allowances have been considered by the Coal Buyers, ever since the Petitioners have been in the Trade, and long before, as a Part of their fair and reasonable Profits of Trade, and, in Fadl, they constitute the chief Part of such Profit, and consequently, if thele Allowances had not been made, the Petitioners must have had, and Should they cease to be made, must in future have, an equivalent Advantage by an Addition to the Price paid at Market; and that the Petitioners are prepared to prove, to the . Satisfaction of the House, that the Profit of their Trade (including the Allowances before mentioned)

T t amounted

A. 1788*

amounted only to a fair and reasonable Profit, not more than equal to the Interest of their Money, the Risque of their Capitals in Trade, and a moderate Compensation for their Time and Trouble employed in the Business, and consequently that, if the Trade is not put upon such a Footing as to enable the Petitioners, and the other London Coal Buyers, to acquire a Profic equal to what they have hitherto enjoyed, they must all quit the Trade; and that the Penalties alledged to have been incurred by the Petitioners, and the other Coal Buyers, amount to many Hundred thousand Pounds, and Should the Informer obtain Verdicts for the fame, moll of those concerned in the Trade must be totally ruined, although it appears manifestly, that if the Coal Buyers have acted contrary to the strict Letter of the Law, yet they did it innocently, and without Injury either to the Public, or to any Individual whatever: And therefore praying, That Leave'may be given to bring in a Bill to explain and amend the said Acts of the Ninth of Anne and Third of George the Second, and to indemnify the Petitioners, and all others, from all Penalties which are alledged to have been incurred thereby, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief as to the House shall seem meet.

to be appointed by the Governor, and, after Payment of the Debts so to be liquidated, together with the Expences of Surveying, and Means of Protection to the Persons settling the fame, be subject to such Payments, upon Warrants of the Governor, for the Service of the Province, as His Majesty should approve, and direct , and that, in Consequence of the above Representation, His Majesty was graciously pleased

ants, when the Disturbances in America, and particularly in Georgia, prevented any further Proceedings therein, and the Petitioners were, on their own Accounts, and those of their Correspondents, interested in those Claims, either liquidated, or to be liquidated, to a very considerable Amount, and without any Dependance for Reimbursements, but on the Produce of the Lands so ceded -, and that, prior to the unhappy Disputes in America, several Allotments of the said ceded Lands were fold, but, as they are given to understand, that the Charge of Surveying, the raising, and maintaining a Troop of Rangers, and other Expences, whether necessary or not, the Petitioners will not take upon themselves to determine, have amounted to more than the Sums received, no Part of the Sums due to the Petitioners, or their Correspondents, upon such of their Claims as have been settled, liquidated, and certified as aforesaid, has ever been paid; and that, in the Month of May 1782, the Petitioners, having Reason to presume that some Accommodation would soon take Place with the revolted Colonies, did, on the 3d of that Month, by a Memorial to the Marquis of Lanjdoivn, then Earl of Shelburne, and One of His Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, fully state their Situation, and the Manner in which the Lands in Question were bound

to

to the Payment of the Debts, for which Purpose they were ceded, and their Reliance that, in every Event of Negociation which might happen, those Lands Should be deemed as charged with, and made liable to, the Payment of those Debts, or that some other Mode of Payment might be adopted to the Satisfaction of the Petitioners, and the Parties interested; and that the Petitioners finding that, by the Provisional Articles of Peace concluded between the Commissioners named by His Majesty and the United States of America, no Stipulation was made in Favour of the Petitioners, and that the Lands vetted in Trust in the Crown, as before stated, were ceded to, and acknowledged to belong to, the said United States, without any Condition whatever respetting them, did, on the nth of February 1783, in a Memorial to the Right honourable James ,

then One of His Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, briefly represent the Fasts as they flood, and prayed, that, as it appeared no Satisfaction had been . obtained, or Attention paid to their former Application, some Mode of Payment might be adopted, or other Expedient proposed for their Relief, and that, taking the Merits of their same into Consideration, he would be pleased to lay their humble Representation before His Majesty, for His Gracious Pleasure thereon; and that the Definitive Treaty with the United States of America being signed, and, to the Petitioners great Surprize and Disappointment, no Regard being paid therein to their repeated Representations, they, in the Month of May 1784, presented a Memorial to His Majesty in Council, stating the foregoing Tran-factions, and praying that, as they stood precluded from every Possibility of Satisfaction from the Produce of the Lands, His Majesty would be graciously pleased to direct some Mode of Satisfaction, or other Relief, adequate to the Discharge of their respective Claims upon the said Lands; which Memorial having been referred to the Lords of the Privy Council, when, after waiting near Twelve Months, in a State of the most anxious Suspence, the Lord President, and other Lords present, were pleased to advise them to apply to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, the Petitioners accordingly applied to the Lords of the Treasury, by a Memorial, dated the 2 2d of April 178c, stating the foregoing FaCts, and praying for Relief; and that the Petitioners, having stated as briefly as possible the Steps taken by them, to inform His Majesty’s Ministers of the real Situation in which the Lands so ceded stood, had well-grounded Hope that they Should have received immediate Compensation for the Property in those Lands which they bad so long before paid for; but, to their great Grief and Disappointment, after a long and ineffectual Application to the Lords of the Treasury, the Petitioners now find they have no Recourse left but to throw themselves upon the Justice, Equity , and Humanity of the House for Redress, and should it be urged that the Application they now make ought to have been brought forward at an earlier Period, considering the Time that has elapsed since the Conclusion of the Peace of , they hope it will appear that, as they gave timely Information to His Majesty’s Ministers of the Condition on which the Lands ceded were vetted in the Crown, they might have had their Claims satisfied out of the fame, had it been thought expedient to make that a Stipulation when the Cession was made to the United States of America; and they have also, since they found that their former Reprclentations were not attended with that Success they had so much Reason to hope for and expect, loft no Time in making what they deemed the proper Applications to obtain Redress in some other Mode, as before set forth, but, those Applications having all failed, their only Hope is, that the House, taking the Hardfnip of their Cafe, and the singular unhappy and helplcfs Situation in which they stand,

into Consideration, will, with its accustomed Liberality and Justice, afford them that Relief, which they, in their great Distress, pray for, and to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the T able.

fented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Place where Theatrical Exhibitions were formerly held in the said Town being found very inconvenient, and unsuitable for the Reception of the Nobility and Gentry resorting thereto, a commodious Building, fi-tuated in the most principal Street, was erected, and the Petitioner, in the Year 1776, having become foie Proprietor and Manager thereof, fitted up and furnished the same at a very considerable Expence j and that, in the Year 1786, the Petitioner, having been informed that another Theatre was intended to be erected in Opposition to his, which, if carried into Execution, would be of considerable Loss and Detriment to himself and Family, was advised to petition Parliament for a Bill to license his said Theatre, an4 accordingly Two Petitions were prepared, the One signed by him, and the other by the Vicar, Churchwardens, Overseers, and others, being Housekeepers and principal Inhabitants of the said Town, but the Proprietors of the Two Assembly Rooms there, and some other interested Persons, making Objections to such Application as unnecessary, and assuring the Petitioner that, if he would decline making any Application to Parliament, they would always protest and support him against all future Opposition whatever, provided he continued to act with the same Rectitude as h$ had hitherto done, and he then resting fully satisfied with such Assurances, declined at that Time proceeding any further therein; and that about the latter End of August, or Beginning of September last, Proposals were made to the Petitioner by Mr. Elmore, one of the principal Inhabitants of the said Town, on Behalf of Six Persons who were willing to treat for his Property in the said Theatre, which he then refused complying with, but being informed that, should such Proposal not be acceded to, it was their Intention to build a new Theatre, which would meet with the Countenance and Support of several Persons of the first Distinction, and the Petitioner being apprehensive that, should he refuse to comply, it would be of considerable Injury to him in his said Theatre, he accordingly agreed thereto, and delivered written Proposals for such Purpose, to which the said Mr. Elmore made an Offer of a Sum of Money, «n their Behalf, far Short of the Estimate delivered in, and the Petitioner wishing, lfpoffible, to-adjust-the Difference, expressed his Wilh to fee some of the said Persons, but being informed that the Whole Transaction was to be kept secret, and the Names of the Six Persons not to be known, and the said Mr. Elmore not chusing to take any Responsibility on himself, all Negociation on that Subject entirely dropped; and that the Petitioner finds that'a Bill is brought into the House, on the Behalf of Messrs. Morje and Campbell, for licensing a Theatre in the said Town (Two Gentlemen, who, from their different Avocations in Life, cannot have the least Pretensions for such their present Application) which, if passed into a Law, will be of great Loss and Injury to the Petitioner, who for so many Years has been permitted uninterruptedly to enjoy his Property in his said Theatre: And therefore praying the House to take the Hardship of his same into Consideration, and that he may be permitted to be heard, by himself or Counsel, at the Second Reading of the said Bill, what he may have to offer why the same should not pass into a Law, without making him that proper Satisfaction for the great Loss and Injury he will thereby sustain, in depriving him of his said Property, and the Means of supporting himself and a numerous Family,

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill to enable His Majesty to license a Playhouse in the Town of in the

opening Avenues and Passages, and doing other Works for the Purposes of the said Act; and that, towards railing Money for those Purposes, the Trustees were authorized by the said Act to continue the then Toll Gate on the said Temporary Bridge, and to order such Toll Gates or Toll Houses to be erected upon the said new Stone Bridge, which was at that Time building, when finished, as they should think fit, and to take thereat such and the same Tolls, for Che Passage of Cattle, Carriages, and other Things, as, by the said Act of the Twelfth Year of His present Majesty, were authorized to be taken on the said Temporary Bridge, under the same Limitations, Regulations, and Restrictions, subject to the same Provisions, and with the same Remedies for Recovery thereof, as were in the said A ft contained, with respect to the Tolls thereby made payable on the said Temporary Bridge, which said Tolls, at the Expiration of Twelve Years, to be computed from the 24th Pay of June 1779, or at such sooner Time as the several Purposes of the said Act of the Nineteenth Year of His present Majesty should be carried into Execution, and the Money borrowed upon the Credit thereof should be repaid with Interest, were absolutely to cease and determine; and that the PetU

That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for repairing, widening, and keeping in Repair, the said Road, called The Coal Read, by such Ways and Means as the House shall think proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

Fmrftam Mr. Marfieam reported from the Committee, to Petft*onFr^.fr^ whom the Petition of several of the Company of free p«ted. Fishermen and Dredgermen of the Manor and Hundred of Faversham, in the County of Kent, was referred; That the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Mr. Jqbn Monger fisting examined, said. That he is a

Fisherman at Faversham — That there has been an Vol. XLIII.

Oyster Fishery there Time out of Mind, and that he has known it upwards of Thirty Years — That the Fishery is limited in its Extent by well-known Marks and Bounds, wherein all Persons who have been duly admitted Freemen of the said Oyster Fishery, 'at a Water Court of the Lord of the said Manor and Hundred, and none others, have, and from Time immemorial have had, the Right to breed, lay, dredge for, catch, have, and take Oysters and Oyster Brood.

And the Witness produced to your Committee a Plan of the said Fishery,. made in the Reign of King James the First, describing the Bounds and Limits of the said Oyster Fishery, and delivered in the Particulars of those Descriptions in Writing, and said, that the Bounds have invariably been the fame, without anyDispute having arisen concerning the same — That the Bounds are marked out by Buoys and Beacons Boating on the Water, and that no other Persons have ever claimed to exercise a Right of fishing within those Bounds.

And being further examined, he said, That the Families of the Fishermen are at present very numerous, and that their whole Livelihood entirely depends on the said Fishery — That the same is maintained and preserved at the foie Costs and Charges of the said Fishermen, who Annually expend upwards of Two thousand Pounds in purchasing Oyster Brood, and laying the same in the Waters and Creeks of the said Fishery.

That the London Market is regularly supplied with Oysters from the said Fishery, and . a considerable Quantity is Annually exported therefrom to Foreign Parts, which are paid for in Money, and by Means thereof the said Fishery is a Source of National Benefit.

That the said Oyster Fishery hath been for some Time past, and now is, greatly annoyed and prejudiced by Strangers and others, not Freemen or Members of the said Company, who frequently come by Night, as well as in the Day-time, and dredge for, take, and carry away the Oysters, and destroy the Oyster Brood, without pretending to claim any Right lo to do — That the Company of Fishermen are at very great Expence in employing Watchmen to protect the said Fishery, but their Endeavours have not been effectual, for the Thefts are constantly increasing, and that the Continuance thereof will very greatly tend to the Destruction of the said Fishery, which hath always been coiifiderqd as a Nursery of Seamen for the Royal Navy.

Mr. John Hills, a Fisherman, being then examined, said. That he is upwards of Seventy-nine Years of Age, Sixty of which he had known the said Fishery; and he confirmed the whole of the foregoing Evidence y of Mr. Monger.

James Lappenger, Esquire, being then examined,

said. That he resides at Faversham, and knows the said Fishery — That great Doubts have been entertained of the Mode in which Actions should be brought against Persons, not duly entitled, coming upon the said Fishery — That they cannot at present be punished by any Criminal Prosecution, and that it is the Opinion of several eminent Counsel, that the Property cannot be effectually proteCced by any Law now in Force.

Mr. Monger and Mr. Hills being again examined, said. That the Fishery within the Limits well known and marked out as aforesaid, is solely for the Purpose of catching Oysters; and that the Number of floating Fish within those Limits is so small, that it neither is, nor ever was, worth any one’s while to come there for the Purpose of catching the m.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for more effectually securing the Oyster Fishery at Faversham, in the County of Kent:And that Mr. Marfieam

su.Gialgiw. House, and read; Setting forth. That the ancient Constitutions of the Royal Boroughs of Scotland pof-fefifed a very high Degree of Freedom, the whole Magistrates, such as the Mayors, otherwise called Pro-volts, and the BailUes, otherwise called Aldermen, and also the Town Councils, having been erected Annually by the Free Suffrage of the Burgesses, otherwise called the Honest Men of the Borough, but, by several Acts passed in the Parliament of Scotland in and polte-rior to the Year 1469, the ancient Constitution of the Royal Boroughs was fundamentally overturned, the Freedom of the Burgesses invaded, and Systems of Government established in the Boroughs of Scotland, which enabled Men once in Possession of Power to retain it for ever, by repeated Re-elcCtions of themselves or their Friends, and Dependants; local Usages like-wife, altogether inconsistent with the Rights of the Burgesses, have established Institutions, whereby not only Persons thus self-elected, but also Persons without Residence, without Property, without Trade, without Interest of any Kind, in Boroughs, may for any Length of Time enjoy the important Offices of Magistrates, and Councillors; and, to these local Institutions, created by Usage in direct Opposition to the inherent Rights of the Burgesses, the Decisions of the Courts of Justiceeven in the last Resort have given the Force and Authority of Laws: Evident Violations therefore of the Liberties of the Burgesses, created by Statutes, and local Institutions, confiding in nothing but Abuses and Deviations from Law and Right, pervade throughout the Government of Bordughs; those direct Infringements of Liberty, and these gradual Corruptions of Time and of Usage, now matured into Systems, compose those partial and absurd Establishments in Boroughs, which have become not only the Subjects of the belt- founded Complaints, but also the ObjcCts of very general Reproach; they are only veiled and protected by a popular Name, for they are called the Constitutions of the Royal Boroughs of Scotland; of this corrupt Formation, particularly, is the Sett or Constitution of she said Borough of Glasgow, and the

Person and Family of their Sovereign, it is with deep Regret, but with a lively Hope of obtaining Redress of their Grievances, that they find themselves under the Necessity of approaching the House in the Language of Complaint: In conveying their Sentiments on Subjects so important, the Petitioners have deemed it incumbent on them, and becoming the Dignity and Wisdom of the House, to support their Assertions by Authorities derived from the indisputable Evidence of Statutes, the ' Constitution of their Borough, or notorious Usage j from these Authorities the Petitioners conceive themselves entitled to affirm, and to represent to the House, inverted as it is with a Constitutional Power of affording Redress, that they labour under very great and intolerable Grievances, not only in relation to the Election of the Magistrates, and Common Councils of the said Borough, and the Administration of the Property and Annual Revenues of the fame, buc as being materially interested in the Prosperity and Independence of all the other Royal Boroughs of Scotland , and that the Petitioners rely with the firmed Confidence on the Wisdom and Justice of the House, that for these very deep and, intolerable Grievances they shall receive that Redress which their Nature and evil Tendency so loudly demand, and which it is natural for them to expect from the Spirit and Liberality of Men, whose Dignity and Power confessedly originate in the Consent and Authority of the People: And therefore the Petitioners, Burgesses, Heritors, and Traders, or Manufacturers, being Inhabitants of the said Borough of Glasgow, having by fatal Experience, and daily Observation, been impressed with the deep-eft Sense of the pernicious Effects of the present Systems of Borough Government, in relation to the Liberty, Police, Revenue, Trade, and whole Administration of the Affairs of Boroughs, particularly of the said Borough of Glasgow, are thereby impelled to make the- present Application to the House, in order to have these Systems altered, corrected, or amended, in all the Royal Boroughs of Scotland, in such Way and Manner as to the House shall appear proper for removing the Evils complained of, and request that the House do allow Counsel to be heard in Support of the Subject Matter of this I^tition.

Containing the same Allegations, and Prayer, as the last preceding Petition.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table.

A Petition of the Burgesses of the Burgh of , Form, in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That in the said Burgh, where the Number of Inhabitants, and

4 Extent

2o8 8° Februarii. 1788.

Extent of the Territories, are considerable, there are frequent Occurrences which call for the unremitced Attention of Magistrates, and require the immediate Direction and Authority of Council: In such Cafes it would seem highly requisite, that the Magistrates and Members of the Council should be strongly attached to, and connected with, the Interest of the Community, and that their Situation in Life should be such as might admit of diligent Application thereto: This, it is humbly conce’^ed, can only happen where the Magistrates and Councillors are Inhabitants, and where their Election depends on the Voice of the resident BurgelTes: The Petitioners have observed, with serious Regret, that none of these Privileges are enjoyed by the BurgelTes of Forres: The Council con-fifts/>f no less than Seventeen in Number, only One Third of them Inhabitants, and several of the Members live at the Distance of xoo Miles from the Town: These Gentlemen, by a Majority of their Number, without the Concurrence of any other Burgess, Annually choose their Successors, or, rather, re-ele<5t themselves, and, as it is only for the Purpose of an Election that a legal Quorum can be collected, the Consequence is, that no due Attention can be paid to the Administration of Justice, or to the Management of any Part of the public Business: And, the Petitioners conceive, that these, and many Grievances of a more private Nature which they have experienced, have taken their Rife from the unprecedented Mode of electing the Magistrates and Council, which, inllead of'an Election, is merely an Infringement on the Rights of the BurgelTes, and contrary to the Constitution of the Burgh, quite different from what the Convention of the Royal Boroughs had in View at the Time when the Sett of the Burgh was made: And, with the greatest Deference, they beg Leave to represent, that the ancient Practice, as well as the Principles, of the British Conflicution, countenance these Privileges, as veiled in the BurgelTes alone at large: And therefore praying the House take this Petition under Consideration, and grant such Relief as to them may Teem meet.

Edinburgh. A Petition of the BurgelTes and Heritors of the City of Edinburgh, thereto subscribing, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners, impressed with a deep Sense of the present arbitrary Manner of electing the Members of the Common Council of the said City, think it a Duty which they owe to themselves, and the Community at large, to apply to the House for Redress, milling, in humble Confidence, that the Wisdom and Justice of the House wiil devise a proper Remedy for the Correction of those Abuses under which the Petitioners now labour; and, for the Information of the House, it may be necessary here to give a general View of the Internal Constitution of the said City: The City of Edinburgh is under the Government and Direction of a Common Council, consisting of Thirty-three Persons, the Members of which Common Council hold their Offices independent of the great Body of Citizens; they were eletfted by their immediate Predecessors in Office, without either the Consent or Af-i’ent of the Citizens, and will, in their Turn, elect their SuccclTors in Office in the same arbitrary Manner; by which Means any Party of Men, who have once got Possession of the Government, may, by electing themselves, or their Adherents, from Year to Year, become the perpetual Governors of this Community; besides, the said Common Council, being subjeci to no Controul in the Management of the public Business and public Revenues, may adb in any Manner suitable to their Inclinations, they may abuse their Power, they may embezzle or misapply the City Revenue, and, however odious they should render themselves to the Citizens at large, they can, by the present Method of Election, keep Possession of the Go-

vernment of the City, in Spite of every Effort to remove them; and that this is a Short but faithful Representation of the arbitrary Nature of that System of Election and Government which now prevails in the said City, and the Petitioners wish not to trouble the House with any Argument upon the Subject; the pernicious Consequences of such a Syllem mull be obvious to every difeerning Mind, its injurious Effedts in relation to the Liberty of the Citizens, the Police, Revenue, Trade, and Administration of the Affairs of the City, are feverelv felt by the whole Community: And therefore praying the House to take this Petition into Consideration, and to devise a Remedy for altering, amending, and enlarging the present narrow and arbitrary System of Election and Government of the said City, in such Manner and Way as may communicate to the BurgelTes and Heritors thereof, who are the constituent Body of the Community, a Right to elcdl the Magistrates and Counsellors, who are in future to be entrusted with the Direction and Management of the Internal Government, Revenue, and Police of the said City.

A Petition of the BurgelTes and Inhabitants of the Jwlburjk. Burgh of Jedburgh, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Petitioners, feeling in common the bad Consequences resulting from the present Mode of Government and Administration of the public Funds, that obtain in this and the other Royal Burghs of Scotland,think it incumbent upon them to join with their Fellow BurgelTes in the other Towns, in an Application to Parliament for Redress of their Grievances: These are Hated in a Bill prepared to be submitted to the Consideration of Parliament oh that Subject, and in the Memorial and II-lustration with which the Members of the House will be furnished, to which the Petitioners beg Leave to refer: And therefore praying the House to take their same into Consideration, and afford such Redress and Relief of the Grievances complained of, as to them shall seem proper.

A Petition of the Heritors and BurgelTes of His Kimor*. Majesty’s ancient Royal Burgh of , was like-

wife presented to the House, and read; Setting forth.

That, in the said ancient and Royal Burgh, the Elections of Magistrates and Counsellors, and also of the Election of the Representative in Parliament, are so conduced, that the Petitioners are entirely precluded and^ deprived of that Birthright and Constitutional Privilege which, as Heritors and BurgelTes, they might reasonably hope to enjoy; and that the Petitioners beg Leave to inform the House of the Manner in which these Eleflions are conducted, and wherein they are so deeply interested and concerned: The Council of the said Burgh consists of Thirteen Gentlemen, Eleven of whom are BurgelTes, and reside within the Burgh, and Two at the Distance of several Miles:

These Annually elect, by a Majority of their Number, their Successors in Office, or more frequently re-elect themselves, and have the absolute Power in directing everyMatter relating to the Government of the Burgh:

The Council also eletfl the Delegate, who, along with the Four Delegates from the Burghs of , Banff,

Cullen, and Inverurie, appoint the Representative in Parliament for the Five Burghs which compose this Distriift, from whence it appears, that the Petitioners have not the moll indiredl Representation, either in this House, or in the Burgh where they reside, and the Petitioners conceive such Mode of Election to be contrary to the generous Spirit of the British Conllitution, the Rights of Freemen and loyal Subjects: And therefore praying the House to take this Petition into their Consideration, and grant such Relief as will emancipate the Petitioners from their political Slavery, and to restore diem the free Enjoyment of the Right of Suffrage, which their Forefathers possessed, but

whicE

28 Geo* III. 8° Feima 209

which they at present'are precluded the just Exercise of.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table.

A Petition of the Parishioners, Owners, Inhabitants, and Proprietors of Houses, Buildings, Tenements, and Personal Estates, within the Town and Parish of Liverpool, in the County of whole

Names are thereunto subscribed, was presented to the House, and read; Reciting an Act, made in the Twenty-first Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for building a Church in the Town of Liverpool, for enlightening and cleansing the

Streets of the said Town, and for keeping and maintaining a Nightly Watch there; and Setting forth. That, since the making of the said Act, the said Town is exceedingly increased in Extent and Population, in-so much that Sixty Watchmen, by the said Act appointed, are now by no Means adequate to watch and go over the several Districts or Divisions of the said Town, although the Money, which the Commissioners are enabled to raise by virtue of the said Act, is fully sufficient for a much larger Number of Watchmen,1 without laying any greater Tax upon the Inhabitants of the said Town for that Purpose; and that it would also, as the Petitioners conceive, be very conducive to the said Service, if the Commissioners had Power given them Yearly to choose some substantial and fit Inhabitant of the said Town to be a Cashier or Treasurer, and a Clerk under him, with a reasonable Salary, for the Purpose of keeping the Accounts, receiving the several Collections of the Taxes for that Service, paying for Lamps, Oil, and Materials, the Watchmens Wages, and all other Incidents, which Power, by the said former Act, is not, in express Words, given; and that by another Act made in the Twenty-fifth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for opening, making, widening, and altering, certain Streets, Passages, and Places, within the said Town, it is enacted, that no Person shall begin to empty any Boghouse, or take away any Night Soil, Butcher’s Offals, Pig Muck, or other offensive Matter, from any House or Place, within or near to any of the Streets, Lanes, or other Places, in the said Town or Liberties, before the Hour of Twelve in the Night, or continue to take away the same after the Hour of Eight in the Morning, from Michaelmas to Lady Day, or after the Hour of Five in the Morning from Lady Day> or if any Person should put or cast any such out of any Cart, Tub, or otherwise, in or near any of the said Streets, Lanes, Ways, or Places, or convey any such Night Soil, Butcher's Offals, Pig Muck, or other offensive Matter, in any Tub, Cart, or Carriage, along or through any of the Streets, Lanes, Ways, or Passages, at any other Time than within the respective Hours aforesaid, every such Person Should forfeit any Sum not exceeding Ten Shillings; and that the Petitioners have observed that , a strict Adherence to the said Clause hath been attended with much Disturbance in the Night Time, and other Inconveniences to the Inhabitants of the said Town, which the Petitioners conceive might be redressed, if the same was repealed, and the Justices of the Peace for the said Borough were impowered to fix proper Times for the doing and performing such like Business as to them in Sessions met Should, from Time to Time, seem necessary and convenient: And therefore praying. That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for extending and enlarging the Powers of the Commissioners in the first Act mentioned, so as to enable them to appoint such Number of Watchmen as they may, from Time to Time, judge requisite to be a Nightly Watch for the said Town, to repeal the Clause in the said last Act mentioned, and to enable the Justices of the Peace for the said Borough Yql. jCUII.

to appoint seasonable and convenient Times for the Purposes before mentioned, in such Manner, and under such Restrictions, as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be teferrcd to the Confederation of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Gas the Lord rbyn, &c: And they are to meet upon Monday Morning next, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker's Chamber; and have Power to fend for Persons, Papers, and Records.

A Petition of the Commissioners for paving, watch- SoutWuk ing, cleansing, and lighting the East Division of the p*"ng Ptti Borough of Southwark, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That by an Act, passed in thf Sixth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, in* tituled, “ An Act for paving the Streets and Lanes “ within the Town and Borough of Southwark, and ct certain Parts adjacent in the County of Surrey, and “ for cleansing, lighting, and watching the fame, and^

“ also the Courts, Yards, Alleys, and Passages adjoining thereto, and for preventing Annoyances ft therein,” Two Districts or Divisions are thereby appointed, one whereof is, by the said Act, directed to be called the East Division; and by an Act, passed in the Eleventh Year of His present Majesty, to explain and amend so much of the said former Act as relates to the Commissioners of Sewers, and for regulating the Manner of taxing Churches and other public Buildings within the Limits of the said Act, certain Doubts touching the same are explained; and that, since the passing of the said Acts, Doubts have arisen touching the Limits and Boundaries of the East Division, in the said Act mentioned, and also touching the Construction of the said Acts, as to the Sewers intended to be comprized therein; and that the Monies arising by the Rates, made in pursuance of the said Act, have not been found adequate to the Purposes thereof, and a Place called Snow's Fields, the greater Part of the Parish of Saint John, and many other principal Streets and Lanes within the said Division, and by the said first-mentioned Act directed to be paved, dill remain unpaved, dangerous, and almost impassable; and that the principal Streets and Avenues of the said Division are very narrow and incommodious, and many of them without even a Footway, whereby frequent Accidents are occasioned to Foot Passengers, and Traffick is greatly incommoded, and the Petitioners are not impowered to widen any of the Streets within their said Jurisdiction:

And therefore praying. That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill to alter, explain, and amend the said Two several Acts of Parliament, and to reduce the same into One Act, as far as relates to or concerns the East Division in the said Act mentioned, to ascertain the true Limits and Boundaries of the said East Division, for granting further Powers to the Commissioners appointed and to be appointed for putting the said Acts into Execution, to enable the said Commissioners to widen and regulate the several Streets, Lanes, and Passages within the said East Division, and for the Removal of present, and preventing of future. Encroachments, Nuisances, and Annoyances therein.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Norton, Sir Joseph Maw-bey, &c.: And they are to meet upon Monday Morning next, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to fend for Persons, Papers, and Records.

the forfeited Eflatcs in Scotland are granted, towards building Bridges over the Rivers Canon, and

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the fame, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Sir John Sinclair, Sir HeElor Munro, &c.: And they are to meet upon Monday Morning next^ at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to fend for Persons, Papers, and Records.

fu Petition of the Chancellor, Matters, and Scholars,

If Cambridge die University of Cambridge was presented to the

rtfpefking the , House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners, Slue T«de. understanding that Application will soon be made to the House, for the Suppression of the Slave Trade, delire to express their hearty Approbation of so benevolent a Design, and trust, that, in reprobating with just Indignation a Traffick carried on in Violation of every Principle of Humanity and Justice, as well as of the Precepts of the Christian Religion, they aft in perfect Consistency with their Duty as Members of an Establishment dedicated to the Support of Learning and Religion; and that the Petitioners hope, that the Legislature will take this Subject into its most serious Consideration, and adopt such Measures as shall appear most effectual for abolishing a Commerce supported only by Violence and Rapine, and which, by encouraging Treachery, by exciting War, as well as by forcing into Slavery Multitudes of the Inhabitants, desolates a most exrenfive and fertile Country: Commercial Interest can never justify a Crime, nor atone for the Guilt incurred by an Action which Reason and Revelation forbid: But the Petitioners are far from apprehending, that the Abolition of this Traffick will be attended with Consequences detrimental to the State, inasmuch as a firm Belief in the Providence of a Benevolent Creator allures them, that no System, founded on the Oppression of one Part of Mankind, can be beneficial to another: As our excellent Constitution carefully provides for the Happiness, by securing the Freedom, of the rrieaneft Subject, the Petitioners are

?erfuaded, that the Legislature will cease to support a 'raffick replete with Misery and Oppression, and that it will readily extend its Protection to the Africans, the most injured and defenceless of our Fellow Creatures: Thus shall this continued' Outrage against Humanity be no longer the Disgrace of our National Character, and the Reproach of our Christian Profession — thus shall Peace be restored to that afflicted and desolated Country, and a friendly Commercial Intercourse enable us to introduce into it the Comforts of social Life, and the Advantages of true Religion.

QuikmPcti- A Petition of the People called Quakers, was alfopre-

th°" sb^'n8 ^cntc^ to *he House, and read; Representing the pre-Trade. sent State of the African Slave Trade as being totally repugnant to the Principles of Justice, the Common Rights of Men, and the Dictates of the Christian Religion, in the Conduct whereof the Lives and Happiness of unoffending Millions have been sacrificed to Avarice and Cruelty; and requesting the Attention of the House to so enormous an Evil, and the effectual Suppression of the said Trade.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act, passed in the Fifteenth Year of the Reign of King George the Second, intituled, f‘ An Act to prevent the counterfeiting of Gold and Silver Lace, “ and for settling and adjusting the Proportions of fine Silver and Silk, and for the better making of fc Gold and' Silver Thread,” was read; wherein it is enacted, That from and after the ill Day of July 174a, all Copper, Brass, and every other Metal inferior to Silver, shall be spun upon Thread, Yarn, or Inkle only, and not spun, mixed, wove, wrought, or set upon Silk, upon Pain that every Person offending therein shall forfeit the Sum of Five Shillings for every Ounce so spun, mixed, wove, wrought, or set upon Silk.

And Mr. William Combes being examined, said. That notwithstanding the said Act, great Frauds have been, and are daily committed, by Copper or other base Metal being woven or mixed with Silk, and worked up in Imitation of Gold and Silver Lace — That it has also been a Praftice to gild and silver Copper, Brass, or other base Metal, and to spin and weave the same upon Silk, Thread, Yarn, or Inkle, and to work up the same in Imitation of Gold and Silver Lace, Fringe, Cord, Embroidery, and Tambour Work, which have been so exactly counterfeited as to deceive the nicelt Eye, to the great Imposition upon the Public, and Injury to the Gold and Silver Lace Manufactory — That, in Consequence of these fraudulent Practices, various Orders for Gold and Silver Lace have been countermanded. — And he further said.

Scotch Spirits Taking Notice of the Bill for charging an additional

Duty Bill. Duty on Spirits manufactured in Scotland, and imported into England-, and Setting forth. That, after passing of the Act of the Twenty-sixth of His present Majesty, relative to the Scots Distilleries, the first Object to which the Distillers of Scotland diretted their Attention, was to obtain Pofielfion of the Mercat of that Country, by furnishing it with Spirits, as good in Quality, and as low in Price, as those with which it was then supplied by the Smugglers; and that, for that Purpose, some of the most considerable among them took great Pains to bring to Perfection the Ma-, nufacture of Gin, which was the Liquor principally smuggled into Scotland from Foreign Parts, having altered and enlarged their Works at a considerable Expence, and having, by many expensive Experiments, ascertained that they could produce a Liquor in every Respect equal to that which the Smugglers brought from Holland, they made Additions to their Entries of Stills, and consequently became bound to pay an additional Licence Duty to Government} and that the Commissioners of Excise for Scotland, having refused to allow Permits to be granted for the Removal of such Spirits from one Warehouse to another, or from Reftifiers, Compounders, Dealers, or Retailers, to other Distillers, Rectifiers, Compounders, Dealers, or Retailers, who might purchase the fame, agreeable to the Practice in England, the free Sale and Circulation of those Spirits through the Country have been prevented, and the Distillers found it impracticable to carry on that Trade to any Extent, and several among them, having large Stocks on Hand, and having paid a high Licence Duty, were obliged to resort to the only other Mercat that was open to them, and to fend Spirits to London, as the only Method of securing themselves from a total Loss of the Duties they had become engaged to pay, and the Advances and Preparations they had made , and that, having a Prospect of an Accommodation with the Board of Excise, and of being able to carry on the , Home Trade with Freedom, several of the Distillers entered into Bonds to take out, and did actually take out, Licences for the current Year, according to the largest Entries made for any Part of the preceding Year, and they laid in their Grain, engaged their Servants, bought their Cattle, and incurred every other Expence in Proportion to the extensive Scale on which they apprehended they would be enabled to Carry on their Bufinefsj but, to their great Disappointment, and in Spite of their most earnest Remonstrances, the Obstructions thrown in their Way by the Board of Excise never have been removed, so that they have been obliged to continue to fend Spirits to

the London Marker, though they derived less Advantage from that Trade than they would have done from supplanting the Smuggler in the Sale of Gin in the Market,of Scotland -, and that their Spirits come into the London Market charged with a Duty of upwards of Two Shillings and Five Pence ’per Gallon, which, considering the Disadvantage of paying a fixed Licence Duty, whether the Stills do or do not work, is, independencof the Difference of Duties arising from, the Charge on the Gauge in place of the Weight, more than equivalent to a Duty of Two Shillings and Six Pence per Gallon, paid on the Quantity of Spirits actually distilled, which last Duty is all that the London Distillers are obliged by Law to pay j and, the Petitioner is assured that any additional Duty on the Importation of Spirits from Scotland would, in Reality, amount to a Prohibition of such Importation j and that the Distillers took out their Licences for the present Year on the Faith that the Law was to continue unaltered during the Period those Licences were to run, and it is apprehended that if it is at all to be altered, those Distillers who work for the London Market, and are to be immediately affected ' by the Alteration, ought to have an Option to give up their Licences altogether, and be put on the same Footing as the English Distillers, for it would be unjust to compel them to keep their Licences on Terms on which they never agreed to take them; and that some of the Petitioner’s Constituents being detained in Scotland in Expectation of the Trial of a Cause between them and the Commissioners of Excise, and others by their own Affairs, could not conveniently attend, and appointed the Petitioner to appear in their Behalf: And therefore, on Behalf of his Constituents, the Distillers of Scotland, praying, That the said Bill may not be permitted to pass into a Law, and that he may be heard, by Counsel, against the fame.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

Resolved, That this House will, immediately, resolve Trade with itself into a Committee of the whole House, to con- America »ml fider of the Trade between the Subjects of His Ma- ^eftTidi* jesty’s Dominions, and the Inhabitants of the Coun- iflandttobe tries belonging to the United States of and

REMARKS.

Of the Claims before the Commissioners in England, 561 remain unexamined. — But after the repeated Advertisements that have been issued to the Claimants to attend, there are not above 60 now remaining who have given Notice of their Intentions to prosecute their Claims; and the greater Part of those have neglected to attend on being summoned again for that Purpose.

It is to be observed, that sundry Claims have been investigated, in Part, but have not been finally liquidated, on the Prospect of obtaining more satisfactory Evidence or Information, through the Means of Mr. Anjley, employed to make Enquiries in the United States, whose Return to England is expected early in the ensuing Summer.

These, together with the Claims examined since the 25th of December 1787, and the Claims examining in Canada, may, from the best Opinion the Commissioners are able to form, amount to between Two and Three hundred thousand Pounds; which, together with the Sum of One Million Seven hundred and Seventy-nine thousand and Fifty-five Pounds, being the Total Amount already liquidated, will include all the Classes into which the Commissioners have divided them.

By the latest Advices from the Commissioners in North America, it was expected by them, that their Enquiry would be closed, so as to admit of their Departure from Canada, on their Return to England, in the Courle of next Summer.

Petition for re. Sir Matthew White Ridley reported from the Com-oV mittec, to whom the Petition of the Owners and Part

ship* with Owners of Ships using the Coal Trade in the Port of

cattle ami Sun Newcastleupton Tyne,was referred; That the Committee

dctiami re- had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had

pertrd. directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them,

to the House j and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth j

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Three several Acts, passed in the Sixth, Thirteenth, and Twenty-second Years of the Reign of His pre-' lent Majesty, for regulating the Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of and , were

read: And

Mr. Edward Twyzel, a Ship Owner at Newcastle, being examined, said, That he has been in the Coal Trade upwards of 30 Years, and is Owner of Two Ships, now in the Trade — That since passing the First of the said Acts the Coal Trade has much increased, there being more than double the Number of Ships now employed; and that last Year there was the greatest Vend for Coals that was ever known — That the Regulations established by the said Acts have been attended with beneficial Consequences to the Public, and they may still be rendered more beneficial.

And being alked, What Regulations in particular he thought would have the bed: Effeft ? he said. By the Fitters Offices being kept open Day and Night, and by imposing a Penalty on Owners and Mailers of Ships, for coming to give their Ships on for a Turn of Coals, before they arrive within the Limits of the Harbour; which Imposition has, to his Knowledge, been practised on the Fitter- — And that it would be also of Advantage to enable the Mariner, as well as the Mailer or Mate, actually coming from the Ship, to enter with a Fitter for a Turn of Coals.

And being alked, Whether he had occalionally used the Port of Sunderland he said, He had; and that every Ship Owner is at Liberty to carry his Ship there whenever he pleases.

And being ilked. Whether a Ship Owner, using the Port of Sunderland,has an Opportunity of deceiving rhe Fitter there, by putting his Ship upon the Lift before (he is within the Limits of the Port, in the same Manner as the Ship Owner using the Port of Newcastle has, to deceive the Fitter at Newcastle? he said. They can deceive the Fitter at both Places, but they are more easily deceived at Newcastle; and that he really thinks it is equally necessary to regulate the Trade at Sunderland as at Newcastle.

And being alked, Whether the Increase of the Shipping was more owing to the present Act than to the late War? he said, It was owing to the Act which regulates the Turns, and partly to the War. Then

Mr. Robert Lock, an Agent in the Coal Trade, being called, confirmed the Evidence of Mr.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for the better Regulation of the Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of Newcastle and -

land: And that Sir Matthew Ridley, Mr.

Brandling, and Mr. Grey, do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

Sir Robert Lawley reported from the Committee, to Birmmgkim whom the Petition of the several Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed. Inhabitants of the Town and Neighbourhood of Birmingham, was referred; That the Committee had examined, and found that the said Application is not within the Standing Orders of the House, of the 23d of May 1786, relative to Bills for building Bridges, it not being for erecting a Bridge, or for the Renewal or Alteration of any Act of Parliament passed for that Purpose; and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth j viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Mr.

Thomas Sheajby being examined, said, That the Town and Neighbourhood of Birmingham is very much increased in the Number of Inhabitants within the last:

Thirty Years — That the only Road or Passage, from ‘

the Town of Birmingham to the several Turnpike Roads which lead from that Place to the Metropolis, through the Towns of Warwick and Stratford upon Avon, and the City of Coventry, is over a certain Bridge, at the lower End of the said Town of Birmingham, called Deritend Bridge, which is old and very narrow; and, owing to the great Increase of the Passage over it, is become very incommodious and inadequate to the Accommodation and Safety of the Public — That the said Bridge cannot be properly widened, and rendered safe for travelling, without taking down and re-building, nor can the Roads and Avenues thereto be sufficiently widened, unless several Houses, Cottages, and other Buildings, situate in the Hamlets of Deritend and Bordejley, are taken down and removed, and the Scite thereof, or of Part thereof, laid into the said Roads. — And being further examined, he said, That it would be of great Advantage if the Course of the River was varied for the Distance of Seventy Yards, or thereabouts, above the said Bridge, by making a new Channel, in a strait Line, down to the said Bridge j and also, if a new Course was made for conveying Part of the Water, running from a Slitting Mill, the Property of Sir Thomas , into the said River; and also, if the Channel of the River, below the said Bridge, was properly widened.

— And the Witness further added. That the lower Part of the said Town is frequently Overflowed in Times of Flood, and that it would be of great Benefit to the Inhabitants of that Part of the said Town, if a Weir was erected upon the said River, and such other Works done as may be found necessary to secure that Part of the Town from being Overflowed in future.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for re-building the Bridge over the River at the Town of Birmingham, called Deritend Bridge, and widening the Avenues thereto; and for widening and varying the Course of the said River near the said Bridge, and making a Weir, and other necessary Works, to prevent the lower Part of the said Town from being Overflowed: And that Sir Robert Lawley and Sir George Augustus William Shuckburgh do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

peared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the first-mentioned Petition, the said Acts mentioned in the said Petition were read: And

Mr. John Lloyd being examined, said, That the said Acts are near expiring, and that the Money now due and owing upon the Credit thereof (which amounts to about the Sum of £.4,000) cannot be repaid, nor the Roads kept in proper Repair, unless the Terms granted by the said Acts be further continued, and the Powers thereof altered and enlarged. — And the Witness further said. That as the said several Roads directed by the said Acts to be repaired do very much intersect each other, he apprehended that the Repair thereof would be more effectually carried on if the said Acts were consolidated, and the Roads subject only to the Care and Management of Trustees appointed by One Act of Parliament.

And being further examined, he said. That he knows the Roads particularly mentioned and described in the said Petition, that the same are in a ruinous Condition, narrow and incommodious, and cannot be effectually repaired and widened by the present Methods provided by Law.

And to prove the Allegations of the second-mentioned Petition, the Acts mentioned in the said Petition were read: And

Mr. John Lloyd being further examined, said. That so much of the Road leading from Llangollen to Cor-wen, in the County of Merioneth, as lies between Llangollen aforesaid, and the Confines of the County of bigh, Part of the said Roads directed to be repaired by the said Act of the Seventeenth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, being about Three Miles in Length, and on which no Toll hath ever been collected, has always been repaired by the Trustees for putting in Execution the said Act made in the Third Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, in the first Petition mentioned, as being more immediately communicating with the Roads under the last-mentioned Act. — And the Witness added. That the Repair thereof could more conveniently and effectually be carried on if the same were made Part of the Roads to be repaired by the intended Bill, and the Trustees for executing the said Act of the Seventeenth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign discharged from the Care and Management thereof.

And being further examined, he said. That the Passage of a certain Part of the Street called Leg Street, in OJweJlry, is greatly obstructed and rendered dangerous, and that the same might be made safe and convenient if the Trustees were enabled to purchase and take down a certain House in the Possession of Margaret Wikey, and also to remove the Palisadoes opposite to a House in the Possession of Henry Roberts, upon making proper Compensation for thd same to the Owners thereof. — And the Witness further said, That in order to prevent the evading the Payment of the Tolls it will be necessary to Ihut up certain Lanes, Highways, and Passages in the Petition described, except the Right of particular Persons using the same as Occupation Roads to and from their Houses and Lands, and that the Ihutting up the same will not be attended with any Inconvenience to the Public.

Ordered, That the said Report do lie upon the Table.

And

Mr. Sudell being further examined, said. That a strict Adherence to the said Clause hath been attended with much Disturbance in the Night Time, and other Inconveniences to the Inhabitants of the said Town j which might be redressed if the said Clause was repealed, and the Justices of the Peace for the said Town were empowered to fix proper Times for the doing and performing such like Business as to them in Sessions met Should from Time to Time seem necessary and convenient.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for enlarging and varying some of the Powers contained in certain Acts of Parliament relating to the watching, lighting, an'd cleansing the Streets, and other Places, within the Town of Liverpool, and for removing and preventing Nuisances and Annoyances therein: And that the Lord Penrhyn and Mr. do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

carried on Upon the River by the Sale of their Com, and other Commodities in the Markets there, and are greatly connected in Commerce with the Inhabitants of the Port of , and whatever

tends to the Prejudice of the Coal Trade on the said River, and of that Port, must, in a great Measure, affect the Petitioners, and the Owners and Occupiers of Lands, and other Inhabitants of the said City of Durham -, and that the Petitioners observe by a Bill presented to the House for the better Regulation of the Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of castle and Sunderland', it is declared, that nothing in the Ad contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to Ships or Vefiels, not exceeding in Burthen Keels, and carrying Coals Coastways to any Port of Great Britain (except the Port of London) or to any Foreign Port, all which Ships or Vessels the Fitter, Agent, or Vender, shall be at full Liberty to load at any Time, and in any Manner, he shall think proper; and that the Petitioners are much alarmed by the said Clause, as the same appears to them to be partial, and Should the said Bill, as it now Rands, pass into a Law, the same will tend greatly to the Prejudice of the Coal Trade on the said River and of the said Port of the Coals on the

said River being laden in Ships at the said Port, which is adapted for Ships of small Burthen only, and such Ships trade principally in carrying Coals Coastways to the Ports of Great Britain, and to Foreign Ports, but few of them carry Coals to the Port of London, and the Port of Newcastle being adapted for Ships of large

Burthen, which are more calculated for carrying, and do carry. Coals principally to the Port of London, therefore the said Clause would, as the Petitioners conceive, give the Coal Owners of the Port of a Power to load Ships of small Burthen, greatly to the Prejudiceof the Trade of the Port of Sunderland, and also be a great Hindrance to the loading of Ships of large Burthen for the Port of London; and that the Port of Sunderland has been a great Nursery for Seamen in manning His Majesty’s Navy, and the Petitioners are iven to underdand, that upwards o(£. 100,000 have een expended in preserving and improving the said Port, and the Petitioners are also given to understand, that Ships of large Burthen, particularly those above Ten Keels, have greatly decreased in Value since the late War, and they are advised, that, Should the said Bill pass into a Law with such Clause as before mentioned, they will still be further reduced in Value, and tend greatly to decrease that Emulation for building of large Ships, which has been found of such great Service to Government in Times of Emergency, and also greatly injure many Families who have expended large Sums in building Ships of great Burthen: And therefore praying, That the House will reject the said Clause, and give the Petitioners such Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for the better Regulation of the Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of Newcastle and Sunderland, be read a Second Time.

Your

Report froni Committee appointed to consider Law* for preventing the Exportation of Sheep, Wool, &cA’C«

1^6 g Mar tit. 1788.

Your Committee having thought it expedient to esquire, by Examination of Witnesses, how far the Powers of the said Acts have operated to prevent or punish the several Offences therein enumerated, they called John Anfiie, Esquire, Mr. John , Mr. John Cooper, Mr. Charles Clapbam, Mr. Jacob Thomas and Mr. Thomas Barnes, whose rpspective Examinations and Evidence are as follow:

John AnJHe, Esquire, examined.

How long have you acted as Chairman of the Wool Meeting ?

I have acted as Chairman of the General Meeting from Aptil 1786.

Had you any Meeting in the Country previous to the General Meeting in London ?

We had«-the First Meeting was held at Bristol in September 1784.

Did you attend a Wool Meeting in Exeter in 1786 ? No.

Were the RSfolutions of that Meeting printed ?

They were.

Are the Conveniences of smuggling Wool from Scotland equal to those from England?

I am not competent to answer that Question, not being acquainted with that Coast.

On what Grounds did the Manufacturers at first begin their Enquiries ?

They began their Enquiries on the Information of some Manufacturers in the County of Somerset respecting the smuggling of Wool and Live Sheep.

What Steps were taken in consequence of the Information received ?

At the Second Meeting of the Manufacturers, the Evidence respecting the smuggling of Wool and Live Sheep appearing to warrant the Manufacturers Suspicions, they agreed to present a Memorial to the Lords of the Treasury, praying that a ftrid and vigilant Attendance might be given by the Officers of the Customs for preventing the Exportation of Wool and Live Sheep.

What occasioned the General Meeting in London ?

I received Letters from the Manufacturers at Exeter, and also from the Wool Dealers in Kent, proposing a General Meeting in London, in order to apply to Parliament for an Amendment, or a total Repeal, of the present Laws for preventing the smuggling of Wool and Live Sheep.

What were the Dates of the Letters you received from Exeter ?

Some Time about the End of February 1786.

From the Proofs in your Possession, and other Circumstances that have come to your Knowledge, are you persuaded that very considerable Quantities of British Wool are smuggled into France and other Foreign Parts ?

From a ftrid and diligent Enquiry, I am now fully convinced not only of the Existence of the smuggling of Wool and Live Sheep, but also that a very considerable Quantity of Wool, and a great Number of Live Sheep, are constantly sent out of the Kingdom to France and other Foreign Parts.

Are you persuaded that any Wool is smuggled from Scotland to France or other Countries ?

I am not fully persuaded, from any Information that I have received, which will warrant me to give such Information as I would wilh to do upon every Occa-fi«n to this Committee.

Will you give the Committee a particular Account

of the Proofs you ard possessed of respecting the Exportation of Wool from England ?

I would wilh to divide the Information I have to give into Three distinct Parts.

The First Part consists of the Report from the Committee of this House in 1786, to which 1 beg Leave to refer.

The Second consists of a Return of Wool Teired in the Years 1786 and 1787, as delivered to me from the Customs by the Direction of the Treasury j also of a Letter from Penryn, giving an Account of a Seizure of Worsted Yarn; and also an Account of Seizures that I have received in consequence of Letters that have been written to me. An Account of One Seizure I received from Mr. Cooper, Matter of the Clement's Coffee House, in the Strand, in the Year 1785, who told me, that a Vessel which failed from Birnham, on the Coast of Essex, was brought into , and

there condemned: She had on board about 33 Cwr* of Wool, and was in Company with Seven other Vef*-fels, all laden With Wool. This Information was also transmitted to me by Mr. Everitt, a Blackwell Hall Fador.

How were the other Vessels known to te laden with Wool, and why were they not seized ?

The Matter of the Veil'd that was fdzed gave Information to Mr. Cooper, who was then Surveyor of the' Port of Margate, that Seven other Vessels had actually failed in Company with him, at that Time loaded with Wool. — I know this only from the Account received from Mr. Cooper.

Do you know what became of those Seven Vessels upon their Return to this Country, after they had carried their Wool to the Coast of France or else«v. where ?

I cannot say.

Don’t you know, that upon the Information of the Captain who was seized, that those Veil'ds upon their Return were forfeited ?

I do not. — I don’t know that any such Law exists.

Did you make any Enquiry what became of those Vessels ?

No; I did not.

— My Proof of the Third Part consists of an Account, containing the Information which I have obtained respecting the Quantities of Wool im-

ported into France, in consequence of having employed a^Person to pass along the whole Coast of France on those particular Discoveries; and also, of Letters thac I have seen, and which I believe to come from the Persons whose Names they bear — I know the Hand Writing of one of them. The Information they contain is to this Purport: “ They express a strong Desire of

forming a Connection with the Person to whomthey are addressed, respecting the Purchase of " tish Wool made use of in the Manufactures of “ lifax, Leeds, Exeter, and Norwich; and one of them

“ engages to take such Kind of Wool, without any “ Limitation of Quantity, and pointing out Places <c where it may be delivered at in France," — The Letters were written in the Years 1786 and 1787.

The Witness then produced — An Account of the Quantities of Wool-seized in the Years 1786 and 1787, specifying the Places at which the same were seized [Vide , 1.] and

also,

A Letter from Mr. Thomas Harvey, dated Penryn, May the 23d, 1786, to John Esquire,

Devizes, with a Postscript signed by JohnStona [Vide Appendix, N 2.J and also,

A Table of the Importation of Wool in the Town of Saint Malo, from the ift of February 1783 § to

a8 Geo. III. 5° Martii

*77

to the 21st of December 1787 [Vide appendix, N° 3.3 and also,

A Table of the Importation of Wool at Legue Harbour, near Saint Brieue, from the aift of February 1783 to the 12th of "January 1787 [Vide Appendix, N° 4.] and also.

An Account of Wool imported at Granville in the Year 1787, including the Accounts given Monthly to the Receiver of Customs in that Place, by those of Carteret, Guilete, ville, and Agon, small Harbours along the: Coast of Normandy [Vide Appendix, N° 5.] and ftlfo,

An Account of Wool imported at Saint Valery in the Year 1787 [ Vide Appendix, N“ 6.]

.....I beg Leave to date, that the Prices of Wool,

annexed to the Accounts I received from France, and given in by me, do not make any Part of the original Accounts, but were added afterwards by the Person who took the Accounts, and who was perfectly competent to add such Prices.

What is the Nature of your Proof of this being -

tijf}W ool ?

I received these Returns from the Persons I employed to examine the Ports of France, respecting the Quantities of British Wool imported into .

Did they assign any Reason to you, why they supposed it to be British W ool, and what ?

The Reason assigned is, that a small Duty is paid on all "Wool imported into France, excepting the Port of Dunkirk; that regular Entries of all Wool imported into Francs are made at the different Custom Houses, specifying from what Countries such Wool was brought > and that the Person employed by me found Means to prevail on a Custom House Officer to bring him the Books of the Receiver General, in which such Accounts are entered, and to permit him to take Copies of them j which Copies I attest to be in the Hand Writing of the Person l’o employed by me, and that such Accounts came to me regularly, with the French Poll Marks on them. — By the moil rigid Scrutiny that I have been able to make into these TransaCtionsfince the Person’s Arrival in England, and from other collateral Circumstances, I am fully convinced that such Accounts are genuine.

Have you any other similar Accounts to those you

have delivered in ?

No.

Did you rrtean to say, that the Person Voii sent to France found Means to obtain Copies of the Custom House Books in all the Ports from which you have delivered in Returns ?

I mean to state, that the Copies taken from the Books at Saint Malo, and Saint Valery, were taken by himself from the Custom House Books.

Do you speak to any other but those Two?

Not at present.

Can you form any Judgment of the Proportion of Short Clothing Wool contained in the 10,000 Packs supposed to be imported into France ?

I really cannot. '

In what Species of the Woollen Manufacture of France is the British Clothing Wool chiefly em* ployed ?

The coarser Sorts of British Clothing Wool are used principally in forming the Chains of the thicker Cloths that are made at Ellceuf, of different Prices, from 10

Livres to 14 or 15 Livres per French Ell, which are generally dyed Blue and Grey, and used for making large Riding Coats and Cloaks.

Is the British Clothing Wool necessary to the French to mix with any inferior Sorts of their own Wool, which might noc otherwise be adapted to the Manufacture in which they are employed; or is the British Clothing Wool of the same Nature with Cloth-

ing Wool, and employed indiscriminately ?

My Information does not warrant me to assert that any of the Clothing Wool of England is absolutely ne-> ceflary to mix with the Shbrt Wool of France, but ic justifies me in saying, that it is not only particularly useful for the Purpose mentioned in my former Answer, but that the Want of it, when not to be obtained, has been severely felt by their Manufacturers.

What is the Price of French Clothing Wool, equal in Quality to the English Clothing Wool which they employ ?

I have received Samples of the best Sorts of French Clothing Wool from Three Provinces, with the Prices affixed, and by comparing the Quality with our own of similar Prices, there appears to be but little Difference. A Fleece also of the inferior Short Wool

has been sent me, which I do not consider to be dearer than our own, of similar Finenefs in Hair; but the Staple of this Wool is, comparatively speaking, weak, and much better adapted for the Shoot or West than for the Chains.

Can you, from the Proofs in your Possession, and from other Circumstances, combined together, give an Account of the Annual Importation of British) Wool into France ?

I do not attempt to speak precisely as to the Quantity, but from the Accounts now delivered in, which I believe to be genuine, and from the other Information that I have received from the Person T employed to pals all along the French Coast, which Information is drawn up in a regular Journal for my Inspection (Extracts wherefrom, in the Hand Writing of the said Person, 1 am ready to deliver in) and from other Accounts that I have received from different Persons, I am well satisfied, in my Own Mind, that the Quantity is much greater than at first apprehended, and that, at the lowest Computation, I may venture to state it at 10,000 Packs of Wool Annually to France — I speak of Packs of 240 Pounds Weight, what we esteem full Packs — befid^s which, I have good Reason to believe, from other Information, that considerable Quantities of Woollen and Worsted Yarn are imported into France from Great Britain.

Then the Witness produced the Extracts above ' alluded to f Vide Appendix, N° 7.

Vol: XLIII. ’

What is the Price of fine French Clothing Wool at Amiens; and likewise the Price of English' Clothing Wool at that Place, of the same Quality ?

I can’t say.

Do you make any other Distinction in Wool than that of Clothing and Combing Wool ?

I know no other general Distinction in Wool, than that of Clothing and Combed Wool, but there is Clothing Wool, as well as Combing Wool, in different Counties, at different Prices.

Do the Manufacturers conceive that they are materially injured by the Exportation of such large Quantities of Wool ?

The Manufacturers of Worsted, and other light Goods made from Combing Wool, conceive rhemselves in particular to be injured in a very considerable Degree; the other Manufacturers who use English Wool also consider themselves to be injured by the fmug-gling of British Wool, though not to so great a Degree.

What Sort of Wool do the French most covet ?

They are most desirous of Combing Wool; and, from the Information I have obtained, it appears also,

4 B that

that they *.vi(h to poftefs themselves of the lower Sorts of EnglishClothing Wool.

What is the Average Price of the Combing Wool ill England at present ?

I understand, from the belt Information I can acquire, which is immediately from the Manufacturers that purchase the Wool, that the present Average Price may be about i8r. a Tod (28 lb. to the Tod) — I understand I have stated it rather too low, I believe I might have stated that one Sort was worth 20 s. — I may state it to be from 19J. to aor. on the Average*

What is the Price given for British Long or Combing Wool in France ?

I think it may be stated, in its uncombed State, at from 15 d.to 16 d.per lb. which is 35J. a Tod.

Can you inform the Committee of the Quantity of Wool Ihorn Annually in this Country ?

There has been a rough Calculation made, and I believe it has been calculated at about 600,000 Packs.

What is the Calculation of the Expenditure of Wool in the Wool Manufactures of this Country ?

I can’t pretend to answer that.

Can you assign any Reason why the French are induced to give so great a Price for British Long or Combing Wool ?

From the most ftrict and rigid Examination I have been able to make, in consequence of Information obtained, I am now fully convinced, contrary to my first Conception, that British Combing Wool is absolutely necessary for the Support of particular French Fabrics of the lighter Kind, and that without the Af-fiftance of EnglishCombing Wool it would be im-

possible to carry them on.

Whether the Introduction of 10,000 Packs of -lish Wool into France is the l'ole Injury to the Manufacturer ?

I conceive not, because the lighter Fabrics of France that consume British Combing Wool, require it principally, if not solely, for forming the Chains or Warps of such Goods.

Do you conceive that the Manufacturers of Woollen in Great Britain are able to consume all the Wool that is Annually grown in the Kingdom ?

I think I am fully justified in saying that they are.

Why do you suppose so ?

1 judge from the Scarcity of Wool in general, and from its present high Price, and though the smuggling of Wool has been in some Degree prevented by the Exertions of the Manufacturers, yet that the Price of English Wool has been and is now encreasing.

What is the Value of those 10,000 Packs of Wool unmanufactured ?

I should suppose that a fair Average of the Price, taking it for granted that some of the higher priced Combing Wool may be smuggled, and reckoning from the present Average Price of Combing Wool, that the whole Amount rauft be at least £. ico,oooo.

Can you form any Estimate of what its Value would be when manufactured, supposing it to be manufactured in England?

Speaking within Compass, it may be fairly stated to amount to full £. 500,000, supposing the greatest Part of it to be Combing Wool.

Can you form any Judgment what Proportion of l'raubWool can be manufactured, when mixed with a Pack of English Wool, so as to be considerably improved thereby ?

From the Information I have obtained by the Person I employed to go to Fran, who not only passed along the Sea Coast, but also examined the Manufactures at Abbeville, Ellcenf, and and also

from full Information I have obtained by other Sources of the Manufacture at Amiens, as well as some other Places, I am now fully convinced, that the by mixing One Half of their own Combing Wool with ours, will'render it proper for those Manufactures in which it is used. — I beg to add, that thisTeftimony is in direct Contradiction to the original Opinion, that I myself had formed as a Manufacturer of BritiJI) Short Wool, and that nothing but the strictest Examination into those Circumstances that came to my Knowledge, would have led me to believe that this was practicable.

Can you state what would at Amiens be the Value of One Pack of English and One Pack of French Wool, -wrought together in the Manufactures of that Place ?

Valuing the English Wool at its present Price, and the Wool of France at no higher Price, and guiding myself by the Evidence that 1 have delivered in, thac One Half of English Wool is sufficient to render the French Wool proper for manufacturing, and also stating that this is principally necessary for the Warps or Chains of such Goods, and taking the Goods of Amiens at a very moderate Average of Manufactures of a similar Nature in England, I may safely state it to be of the Value of £. 160 Sterling.

Do you mean that the Wool is mixed before it is spun into Yarn, or afterwards?

Before it is spun into Yarn.

Why then did you say it is used in the Chain or Warp ?

The Reason why the Combing Wool of England is necessary to be incorporated with the French Wool to make the Chains or Warps of the Cloths, is owing to the superior Strength of the English Combing Wool; and 1 do conceive, that the Quantities of French Combing Wool are very small that can be used as Warps or Chains for the thin Goods, without the Assistance of Er.glish Wool; but I do not deem the Neceftity of mixing English Wool with French to exist in an equal Degree with respect to the Shoot or West, required in the Manufactures of Goods made from Combing Wool.

Why, if the Mixture of English Wool with French Wool increases the Value of the latter, do not the English import it for the Purpose of making Profit by a similar Mixture ?

There can be no Neceftity for the English Manufacturer importing what 1 state as the comparative inferior Wool of France, as I do not apprehend thac such Wool in France is at a lower Price than the Combing Wool of England; and the only Ground on which I state the Profit to arise to the French Manufacturer, arises from his being able, with the Assistance of the Combing Wool of England, to employ himself in such Manufactures as otherwise it would be impossible for him to carry on.

Will One Pack of English Wool enable a French Manufacturer to work up more than One Pack of French Combing Wool along with it ?

It will. Agreeable to the Statement I have delivered in before, it will enable him ro work up Three Packs of French Combing Wool at the least.

When you said that the Price of the Manufacture at Amiens was worth £. t6o, did you consider the Quantity of the Raw Material to be Two or Three Packs ?

My Calculation was made upon Four Packs.

§ If

If you are right in your Opinion, that io,oso Packs of English Wool are exported to and that One

Pack of English Wool will enable the French Manufacturer to work up Three Packs of his own, and that the Price, even of Three Packs of his own, when manufactured with One Pack of English Wool, will amount to £. 160, will it not then follow that the Competition the French are enabled to hold against the British Manufacturer will amount to Goods of the

Value of J. 1,600,000 at the least, supposing it to be Combing Wool ?

On the lowest Calculation it will, subject to an Abatement in Proportion to the Quantity of Short or Clothing Wool that mult neceiTarily be included in the 10,000 Packs — as I wish always to be underltood, in my Answers to such Questions as relate to the Necessity of the Mixture of English Wool with French Woolj to confine myself solely to Combing Wool.

Then the Witness produced a Paper, containing Information respecting the French Woollen Manufactures, drawn up by the Person employed by the Witness to make such Observa-tiens [Vide Appendix, N° 8.]

Withdrew.

How do you know that Thirty Ton Weight was imported ?

At the Time, One of the French Pafiage Vessels, in the Employment between Dover and , was under Seizure for the illicit Exportation of some Quantity of British Wool , this induced me at the Time to get a Friend of mine, then resident at Calais, to inspect the Books of the Customs of that Port, and he informed me, that Thirty Ton Weight was imported into that Port in 1783.

Is the Wool imported into Calais imported thither by professed Smuggling Velfels, or in what Manner ?

Chiefly by the Passage Vessels employed between Dover and Calais, as very few Smugglers use the Port

of Calais.

Did you ever fee any Wool landed or brought into Boulogne?

I have.

What Number of Boats or Smacks havfc you known come into that Port in a Day with Wool on board ?

From Two to Three — I speak within Compass, because some Days there have been more.

What did you conceive the Quantity to be which each Boat or Smack had on board ?

From One to Three Tons each.

Were these Boats English or not ?

They were EngliJJj.

How do you know that they were English?

By being British built, and conducted by British Seamen.

Did such Boats so freighted frequently arrive at

Boulogne ?

They did.

Was yod at Boulogne at different Times in the Year ?

I was. — In general there was the same Appearance of Boats so freighted the whole Year round.

Was you ever informed at Boulogne of the Number of Smuggling Vessels, with Wool on board, that were supposed to arrive there Daily on the Average ?

I was — -from Two to Three on the Average.

Had such Vessels always more or less Wool on board ? ,

They had.

Have you been informed of any Thing respecting Wool being carried into Dunkirk ?

I have been well informed, that very great Quantities of Wool have been imported into the Port of Dunkirk by Boats, Smacks, or Vessels. — I was informed of this by the Captains of the Passage Vessels between Dover and Dunkirk, who told me that Two or Three arrived there in a Day.

Had you ever any Conversation with Custom House Officers on the Coast of SuJJe of elsewhete, of the smuggling of Wool ?

I had.

Did such Conversation induce you to believe that the Information you had at Boulogne, as to the Quantity smuggled there, was true ?

It was.

Do you believe that the Wool carried from the Sussex Coast is the Whole that is carried into Boulogne ?

I do not.

Do you know of Wool being imported there front any other Coast ?

Yes, from Kent and Essex.

Did you ever hear of Eng Wool being carried into Dieppe ?

Yes.

What Information have you received as to the Port

of Dieppe ?

I received from Captain William Sharpe the Information, that a Sloop, named The Liberty, arrived at the Port of Dieppe, loaded with Wool, for which he was paid the Freight of Forty Guineas.

Have you ever asked in France how far English Wool is necessary for French Manufactures ?

Often.

What Answers have you received ?

That without British Wool they could not possibly manufacture some Sorts of Cloth or Stuffs.

Have you ever observed any English Live Sheep imported into France ?

I have*

Into what Ports ?

In the Port of Boulogne.

What Number ?

From Twenty to Thirty at once.

Do you know of any Sheep bought in England, which you had Repfon to think were for Exportation ?

I know a Person who resides at Boulogne, and comes over and purchases Annually from Three to Five hundred

a8o 5° Martii. . 1788.

dred Sheep, at the Price of from Two to Three Guineas each — he told me of it himself — 1 believe this Conversation was in the Year 1786.

Do you know any Thing respecting a Seizure of Live Sheep I 1

On the 14th of December 1786, Four Men were detected smuggling Live Sheep from in

Kent, and were committed to the Gaol of ,

from whence they afterwards made their Escape.

Are the present Laws such as lead to a ready Detection of Offenders ?

I do not think that they altogether do.

Have you experienced any Inconvenience on that Account ?

I have.

What?

In the Year 1785, I was riding between Rye and

Hajlings, and there met very large Quantities of Wool, t carrying to a Plate called Peebles , in Sussex, at which Place there is a large Warehouse, where this Wool is deposited, and not a Doubt but the greater Part, if not all, is for illicit Exportation — I examined the Men, to obtain the Certificate or Permit, which I found they had, and wished, some Time after, to examine this Warehouse, to observe if the Quantity there lodged (till remained, finding no Sufferances had been applied for for the removing such Wool from the said Warehouse: But the Laws now in Force would not permit my entering the Warehouse to fee what was there lodged. — The Permit I saw, mentioned that it was going to this Warehouse.

What Quantity was it ?

Four or Five Waggons loaded with Wool at One Time.

Did you, at any other Time, meet any Quantity of Wool going to this Warehouse ?

I have several Times met Wool on the same Road, and only alked for the Permit, not finding it necessary or useful to know where it was going.

Do you know any Thing more what became of the Wool, after it was lodged in the Warehouse ?

I do not of myself, but from the Information of the Revenue Officers, who grant Sufferances to remove the said Wool, that no such Sufferances were required.

Did you ever seize any Wool yourself ?

I never did.

What Cutter is stationed off Boulogne ?

There are always Cutters stationed upon our Coast, both in the Customs and Excise.

Did you give Information to the Commanders of Cutters upon our Station, that you knew, of your own Knowledge, that Wool was smuggled into Boulogne in Smacks ?

I have often.

In consequence of that Information, has there been any Quantity of Wool, or any Number of Smacks, seized ?

None that I know of.

To what Amount have the Prosecutions come to ?

I cannot take upon me to say.

Is it your Opinion that many Smacks, loaded with Wool, might have been seized, if proper Attention had been paid ?

If there had been more Activity, more Seizures might have been made.

Have you any other Reason for knowing that the Warehouse was used as a Repository to favour the smuggling of Wool to France than what you have mentioned ?

I have heard the Smugglers themselves say, in Conversation at Boulogne, that it is from Peebles Steps that they export their Wool.

To whom does this Warehouse belong ?

I can’t exadiy fay---- there is such a Warehouse.

Does it belong to any Person concerned in the Wool Manufactory ?

I believe it does nor.

In what Manner was the Wool flowed on board those Vessels going to Boulogne ?

In Open Fleece — that was the Way that I saw them landed.

What Proof have you that any of those Vessels, that you saw arrive at Boulogne with British Wool on board, took in their Wool on the Coast ?

A Seizure was made by Mr. John , then Surveyor of the Customs at M,of a Smack with 33Cwt. of Wool on board, from Rirnbam in; and the Master of the Vessel informed him that he was bound to Boulogne.

If the Wool was seized at , how could thar

infer that the Wool which you law arrive at Boulogne was from Essex ?

From the Information of Mr. John , Surveyor of the Port of Margate, as stated to him by the Master

of the said Smack.

Were all the Sheep that you saw going Abroad, from the Kentish Coast, or from any other Coast ?

I was only at the Port of Boulogne, and saw them come in.

Did you ever fee any Seizure of Wool which was packed in Bales of Goods ?

No.

Have you frequently seen Wool on board Ships or Vessels in loose Fleeces ?

I have seen Two or Three come into Boulogne in a Day — I never saw it in any other Shape.

What do you mean by Wool in Fleece ?

In Rolls of Eight or Nine Pounds Weight.

Can you say whether all the Wool which is Imug-gled from Sussex goes to Boulogne ?

It does not.

What Station was you in when you met the Waggons going to Peebles Steps, and alked for their Permit ?

As a Preventative Officer, by virtue of a Commission from the Commissioners of the Customs.

Is the Place to which Wool is to be removed mentioned in the Permit ?

I will not be positive as to the Fad, but I believe it is.

Can it be removed a Second Time without another Permit ?

No, certainly not.

Did you apply to the Office then, to know whether there was another Permit granted ?

I did.

Had not you it in your Power to know, when you was at Boulogne, from whence those Smacks came that

brought Wool into that Port ?

I had not.

Do you know in what Part of England the Sheep were purchased that you saw arrive at Boulogne ?

The Agent did not tell me where he bought them.

Did the Price given for those Sheep include any Sum for Insurance ?

I cannot take upon me to say.

t Do

Do you imagine that the smuggling of Wool ha$ increased within these Two Years?

Decreased j not, I believe, owing to the Commercial Treaty, but from the Prosecutions that have taken place.

Did you ever fee the Information to Mr. Cooper of the Matter of the Vefiel seized at Margate ?

I did not.

Did you ever hear Mr. Cooper mention of other Vef-leis that failed with that Vessel from , loaded

with Wool, for Boulogne ?

Mr. Cooper told me and Mr. on the 27th of

February 1788, that the Matter of the Sloop that was seized informed him, that Seven Sail of Smacks failed from Birnham in Essex, in Company with him, in Consequence of which he took the Mailer of the Smack on board his Revenue Cutter, with a View to apprehend those Seven Vessels, which they could not effect. — Mr. Cooper now keeps the St. Clement'% Coffee House, in the Strand.

Do you know how the VetTcls carrying Wool to France are usually freighted on their Return to England ?

With Spirits, Tobacco, .

Do you mean that the Seven Vessels escaped through swift Sailing,' or from want of Power in the Revenue Cutter ?

From never getting Sight of them.

Are you of Opinion that preventing the smuggling of Wool would be a great Means towards preventing Smuggling in other Refpects ?

I have no Doubt that the preventing smuggling of Wool will in a great Measure suppress the illicit Importation of Spirits, as the Profit is so great from the smuggling of Wool, that it enables them to purchase Spirits, Tobacco, &V. and in case of a Seizure made on their Return to this Country they are then still Gainers. Withdrew.

John Cooper examined.

— I lived formerly at Margate — I was Surveyor of the Customs there.

Do you know any Thing of any Seizure of Wool?

Yes — On the 30th of O5lober 1782, I made a Seizure of Wool on board of a Pacquet bound to OJlend from Margate; the Quantity was Three small Bales of Combed Wool, containing 421b. and odd — I imagine it to have been Samples. — On the 20th of Oblober 1785, the Greyhound Cutter, under Contract with Government, seized a Vessel. named The Charles Seymour, Maker, from bound to

Boulogne; her Cargo confiked of 27 Cwt. 3 qrs. 41b. of British Wool, taken'on board at Barling Quay, in Birnham River, Essex.

What Species of Wool was it ?

Rather Short; it was in Fleece, in the rough State as it came off the Sheep’s Back — the Fleeces weighed from about 10 to 141b. — Charles ,the Maker,

informed me there were Seven Sail of Vessels, loaded with Wool, in Birnham River, ready to fail {or Boulogne the next Tide.

Do you know of any other Seizure of Wool ?

No, but I have frequently kopped Samples from going on board.

Did you, in the Year 1785, seize a Vessel with 33 Cwt. of Wool on board ?

I did not.

Did you give any Information, when you was informed that there were Seven Vessels loaded with Wool in Birnham River, to the Officers of the Cukoms there, or any where else ?

Vol. XLIII.

I did, I sent the Greyhound Cutter on a Cruize to intercept them.

Had not you Time to inform the Officers, that those Ships might be prevented from lading ?

No other than the Greyhound Cutter.

Was there no more expeditious Way to inform the Officers of the Cukoms than fending a Vessel to intercept them ?

No other.

How did the Maker know, who informed you that those Veflbls were to fail the next Tide ?

By having left the Port so lately in the Morning.

Withdrew.

. John Anjlie, Esquire, again examined.

Have you any Knowledge of any Conviction ?

I have had an Account of Two Convictions of Persons for smuggling Wool and Live Sheep in the County of Sussex, and also of Hull in Yorkshire, and Gojall.

Have you received any further Information respecting the Quantity of Wool imported into France?

From having made an erroneous Calculation of the Quantity imported into the Port of Dunkirk, and also having received Information that there are other considerable Importers of Wool in the Port of be-

fides the one on which I made my Calculation, I now think iriyfelf warranted to say, that the Quantity can by no Means be kated at less than 13,000 Packs in the Whole, and that it may possibly be more.

Have you received this additional Information front the Person who you employed in France to give you an accurate Account of all Wool smuggled into that Country from Time to Time ?

Having Recourse to that Person, I informed him, that I had taken the Calculation for the Port of Dunkirk, on Supposition that considerable Quantities might be sent from thence to bcher Ports in France, at only 600 Packs per Annum, when, on referring to the Notes that had been taken, it appeared, that I might safely kate it at double the Quantity imparted into the Ports of St. Malo and Le Gue.

Are not the present Laws fully adequate to prevent the Exportation of Wool ?

No.

Can you point out wherein they are defective in general ?

Yes. — The Objections which krike me are, that the Laws are multifarious, and in many Inkances difficult to be underkood — That though an Entry or Regiker is directed to be made of Wool (horn within Five Miles of the Sea, to be made by the Grower of Wool in every Part of England, yet such Wool may be removed without any Sufferance, consequently such Regiker or Entry is of little Service — That in the Counties of Kent and Sussex, where Wool within Ten Miles of the Sea is ptit under a more krict Regulation, and cannot be removed without a Certificate* yet the Law does not require any Return of such Certificate, therefore it is not known whether the Wool was duly removed — That Wool may be removed to any Place or Warehouse near the Sea Shore, under certain, but very imperfect, Regulations, and there remain until a convenient Time offers for smuggling it — That I apprehend no Officer can enter such Warehouse, or require any Account of Wool lodged therein — That it appears to me, that no Offender can be apprehended and secured, even in the very Act of exporting Wool, until a Capias can be obtained from One of the Courts at and

then he may be bailed by some of his Accomplices — That it appears to me, in order to convict an Offender under the present Laws, that it should be proved

4 C that

2-8 2.

that the Wool so exported, or designed to be exported, is of the actual Growth of this Kingdom, which can scarcely be done in any oneinstance — That the present Laws do not provide sufficient Rewards for those Persons who shall inform against Offenders, unless such Informers happen to be Officers of the Revenue — That the Mode of recovering the Rewards, and obtaining Condemnation of Seizures, appears to me troublesome, tedious, and oftentimes very expen-five to the Officers — That the Punishments inflicted by the present Laws are not proportionate to the Offences, as the Commission of some Offences under the Wool Laws, which may be merely the Effect of Inattention, are punished with the same Severity as the actual Exportation of Wool — That by the present Laws the rich Offender may escape Corporal Punishment, while, the Poor, in similar Circumstances, muff suffer it.

Are there any Injuries to the Manufacturers, in the present Mode of winding Wool ?

There are.

Are the present Laws sufficient to prevent the Frauds ?

No.

In what are they defective ?

The Defects appear to me to consist in the Penalty being too small, considering the Difference in the Value of Money at the present Time, from what it was when the Act for preventing the false winding of Wool, in the Reign of Henry the VUIth, passed, and all’o in not providing a summary Jurisdiction for the Recovery of the Penalty.

Do you believe that Cloth, or Woollen Goods, may be manufactured in such a Manner that the Frauds cannot be (Jilcovered by the general Run of Purchasers ?

I do not conceive there can be any Difficulty in detecting any Fraud that may be made use of in the manufacturing of Woollen Goods, by Persons competent to judge of such Goods.

Are there any Inspectors of Cloths appointed in any Parts of England ?

There are.

"What Necessity is there for these Inspectors, if the Frauds are so easily discoverable ?

I do not understand that the same Reasons sublist now that did at the Time when the Act passed for the Appointment of Inspectors of Superfine Broad Cloths.

On what Reasons do you ground this Opinion ?

Merely in the Variation of Talte and Fancy in the Cloths now uled. Withdrew.

Charles Clapham examined.

— I reside at Leeds — I am a Merchant, and a Manufacturer of Worsted Stuffs.

Do you know of the Seizure of any Wool ?

I do — it was made at Hull.

What Quantity was seized, and from whom ?

There was only One actual Seizure of Wool — the Quantity was between Three and Four hundred Weight — it was seized on board the a

Vefiel, belonging to the Port of Geff.e in Sweden — it was some Time in the Summer of 1787.

Do you know of any other Wool intended to be fiiipped, besides that which was seized ?

I do, from Information that was taken at from a Mariner on board the said Ship who

gave an Account, that while the Officer was rummaging the Ship, a Boat came along-side the Ship

1788:

with Ten more Sacks of Wool on board; that he called out, “Off’. Off! the Officers are on board;’' upon which that Boat made for the Shore, and got clean off.

From whom did you receive this Information ?

From one Stokell, a Cabinet Maker, who actually fold the Wool to the SwediJIs Captain — Besides that,' another Swedish Vefiel, called Lhe Aurora (in the same Summer) Captain Wc.nnberg, belonging to , was seized at Hull, for having exported Two Bags of Wool, containing 160 lbs. Weight both together, which the same Stokell sold to the said Captain berg. — I was present at Hull when Stokell appeared before Sir Henry Etherington and Mr. Coulfcn (the Magistrates) on this Business — 1 was sent by the Manufacturers at Leeds purposely to be there.

Then the Witness produced — A Copy of an Information laid by William , Excise Tide

Surveyor, on the 4th Day of September 1787, before Sir Henry Etherington, Baronet, and Edward Cculfon, Esquire, Two of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the Town of Kingjlcn upon Hull ( Vide AppendixA7" 9.) and also,

A Copy of the Examination of Charles Rander and Jcjcpb Stokell, taken upon Oath, the 4th Day of September 1787, before the said Sir Henry Etherington and Edward Appendix,

N° 10.]

How was this Wool marked and packed ?

It was packed in Sacks or Bags similar to Hop Bags, and had the Words, “The Ship Mars," in large Letters, wrote upon the Bags. — I saw those Bags in the Custom House, and examined the Wool.

What State was the Wool in ?

It was Raw Wool, in the Fleece, and confided of Hogs and Wethers, or Teggs and Wethers — The Fleeces were not broke, but thrud into the Bag exactly as they had been Ihorn and wound — it appeared to me to be Holderness Wool, and the Cabinet Maker gave that Account of it.

Do you know, or have you heard, how many Ships are employed between Hull and Sweden ?

I have heard from the Mayor of Hull, Mr. OJhorne, who was at Leeds soon after these Transactions at Hull, and mentioned it at a public Meeting of most of the Merchants at Leeds, that there are Twenty Ships employed from Hull to Sweden — I mean Swedish Ships.

How many Voyages do they Yearly make ?

From the same Information I learn, that they make Five Voyages in Two Years.

Do such Ships generally take with them English Wool ?

The same Gentleman informed me, that they rake each Voyage from Five to Six hundred Pounds Weight each Vefiel.

Did he inform you of this as what he knew, or what he had heard ?

He informed the Meeting, that he had taken great Pains to come at that Fadt, and that he believed it to be true.

Did the Mayor of Hull never mention any Design entertained by him of putting a Stop to this illicit Exportation of Wool ?

He certainly did; he said, he would use all his Exertions----1 mean, after this Transaction.

Did the Mayor of Hull mention that he had any Apprehension that this Practice of smuggling Wool prevailed before this Seizure was made ?

He did say that he had no Apprehension of this Practice,

' Don’t

50 Mar

Don’t you believe, that if such a Practice had prevailed, the Mayor of Hull mult have known of it?

I really believe that such a Practice might have prevailed, and the Mayor of Hull not have known it.

Might it have prevailed to that great Extent, and he not have known it?

I can’t say.

Do you know any Thing of Wool being smuggled from the Coast of Lincolnfoire ?

I do, from Go:all or Gojall Haven.

In what Quantity ?

Ninety Tods — For further Particulars 1 beg to refer to the original Information and Warrant, signed by the Justices, whose Hand Writing I am acquainted with.

Then the Witness produced — The Information of John Skirlew, of ‘Thorne, taken before Edmund Barker and John Beckitt, Two of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire, the 24th Day of October 1787 [Vide Appendix, N® 11.] and also,

A Warrant granted by James Jack/on, Mayor, gnd William Rickard, Two of His Majesty’s

Justices of the Peace for the Borough of

caster, for carrying William Bacchus before Two Justices of the Peace for the County of Lincoln, dated 19th October 1787. [Vide Appendix, N* ia.]

’ — I know the Man was convicted and sent to Pri-ifon for that Offence.

Do you know in what Manner this Wool was taken away ?

I am informed by Mr. StanclijJ', who apprehended Skirlew, that these Ninety Tods of Wool were thrown into the Boat in the Fleece, in open Day, about Noontime.

Do you know any Thing of a TransaCtion at -

light in Sussex ?

I do not.

If the Exportation of Wool Should be flopped, have the Wool Growers, in your Opinion, any Reason to fear that the Price of Wool would be greatly lowered.

No — and my Reasons are, that preventing the Exportation would also prevent the Manufacturers of France from producing any Sort of Stuff's, the Warp or Chain whereof is made of a single Thread, that would bear any Competition with the same Species of Goods manufactured in this Country; and therefore the great Consumption of those Articles in France, and of Countries bordering on France, would be demanded from this Country.

Have you ever received any Information of any Wool being smuggled from any Port or Place in the County of Lincoln, except the Ninety Tod you have already mentioned ?

I have known of none being smuggled; but I have heard Reports, which I did not think sufficiently founded to bring forward in this Committee.

From whom have you received even those flight Reports ?

From Mr. Browning, a Gentleman in the Room j and some Evidence is entered in the Books of Mr.

AnJUe.

What Proportion does the Raw Material bear to its Value in its manufactured State in your Manufactory ?

I answer this Question from this Stating the

Wool in the Fleece at the Price I buy it from the Grower, and the Manufacture at the Price I fell it to the Foreign Merchant, it does not bear more than

One Sixth Part of the mean Value of such Manufactures; for I take into my Consideration the coarfdt and the finest Goods manufactured in

What was the Average Price of Wool in 1784 and 1 1785?

I have no Notes, therefore can’t say.

Is the Price of Wool greatly raised within these Two Years ?

It is.

Is the Price of your manufactured Goods risen in the same Proportion ?

It is not.

Is the Price of Wool higher than it was immediately before the last War?

1 believe not.

Were the manufactured Goods at a higher Price, then than they are now ?

They were.

Can you state in what Proportion ?

I cannot.

Was not the Price of Long Wool, during the late War, reduced almost One Half?

It was very considerably reduced.

Were the Manufactures reduced in Price in Proportion to the Reduction of the Price of the Raw Material at that Time ?

They were reduced very considerably; and very considerable Stocks of Goods, manufactured from Wool the Growth of Lincolnshire, remained in the Hands of the Manufacturers, and could not be fold, being a great Part of them such Goods as had been manufactured for the American Market.

Could the Wool Grower at that Time always find a' Market for the Raw Material ?

I believe he could, if he would have taken such a Price as, in Times of such Distress in Trade, the speculative Manufacturer could afford to give.

Is, or is not, the Price of Wool too high to afford you a reasonable Profit upon your Goods ?

It is — upon the Manufacturers of various Denominations, many of whom have failed, and a great many others are now losing Money by the Prices at which they are obliged by Necdfity to fell.

Withdrew.

Jacob Thomas Speidel examined.

— I am a Blackwell Hall FaCtor. — I was in France iri September 1786 — but for a very Short Period, being only Six Days. — I was likewise there in 1787.-10 the Year 1786 1 landed at Calais, and proceeded to Boulogne.

Did you make any Enquiry as to the Quantity of Wool imported into France ?

When I was at Boulogne in 1786, I went one Morning upon the Beach, and saw Sixteen Vessels come in — I enquired what Vessels they were; I was told they were contraband Vessels, or Smugglers coming from England. — My next Enquiry was, what they brought from England? I was told, they generally returned with Wool. — In the Year 1787 I saw the Person who gave me the Information in 1786, which Person was an inferior Officer of the Customs.

Did you fee any English Sheep when you was in France ?

I did — At a Place about Six Miles from Boulogne, called La Capelle, there is a Flock of 8co or 1,000 English Sheep — they are in the Possession of a Family, who, within these Twelve Years, was in a State of Penury — there are Five, Six, or Seven Brothers of § them

v^ocwie

them — they are now living in Opulence, have Letters df Noblesse, and have a very good Domain at pelle.

Do yoti know how he procured these Sheep ?

I was informed, by the Importer at Boulogne, that he himself imported for that Person from Two to Three hundred Sheep in 1786 and 1787, With some Rams among them — I received this Information in 1787.

Did you understand that they were deemed of National Importance ?

I did.

Was you informed that the Owner had any particular Honour conferred on him for importing, smd for his great Attention in preserving these Sheep ?

I undefstood that he had Part of the Wood of La Capelle to his own Use, and that he had Letters of Noblesse given to him.

How do you know that the whole Flock were

lish Sheep ?

They were very perceivable at a Distance, different in their Make, very different in their Wool, and by the Confession of every Person whom I spoke to upon the Subject.

Did you fee the Sheep yourself ?

I was upon a Hill, and saw them in a Valley, at the Distance of a Mile — -the Evening being very clear, and I was assisted by the Help of a Perspective Glass.

Was you requested by any Person in that Country to fend them Wool f

I was.

Did you offer to fend that Person manufactured Goods, and what was his Answer ?

I took over with me Patterns of the bell Manufactures of this Country — Cloths of different Sorts, Coatings, and some Camblets. — On shewing the Cam-blet Patterns, he replied to me, No ! I can’t buy these Goods, but I will buy the Wool to make them.”

Was you informed, when y.ou was in France, that English Wool was absolutely necessary to manufacture some of their Stuffs ?

Indispensably necessary.

Did you fee any French Wool ?

I did.

What was its Quality ?

It was very coarse, very strait, full of Stichill Hairs, and appeared to want Elasticity, being more like Hair.

Did you make any Enquiries of the Wages given in France ?

I did. — In Picardy I learnt that the Wages were very low, particularly at Abbeville. — At Elbeeuf they were rather higher, but at Louviers they were much the famC as in the Wellern Parts of this Kingdom.

What arc the Species of Manufacture made at those Places ?

At Abbeville they manufacture Stuffs of various Sorts, Camblets, Paragons, and various other Sorts, besides Broad Cloths of Wool, and other

Wools; likewise at Elbeeuf they manufacture an infe-

rior Sort of fine Cloth, 1 Should think of Spanish and other Wool mixed. — The Manufactures I saw at Louviers were of the very first Quality; Cloths made entirely of Spanish Wool — I should think there was no English Wool used in those Cloths that I saw at Louviers — I saw the Two belt Manufactories in the Place.

Do you know arty Thing of a TransaCtion at -light in Sussex ?

I do. — In the Year 1786, the Evidence brought before the Committee* of the fmUggling of Wool in the Counties of Kent and Sussex,being so very enormous, the Committee in London being desirous of proving the FaCts, and putting a Stop to such Practices, endeavoured to find a proper Person for that Purpose, and were fortunately recommended to Mr. Robert Rowley, Riding Officer. In the first Conversation with him, and explaining the Nature of the Business, he desired some Time to consider of it: On the Second Interview, he said he had examined the Laws, found them so complex, and the Expence of carrying such a Business into Effect would be so heavy, that he could by no Means think of undertaking it on his own Account. — The Committee then agreed to guarantee and pay him every Expence j in consequence of which Guarantee he determined to pursue it, and immediately placed Four Men to watch the Habitation of John Harman, who smuggled great Quantities of Wool — This watching took Place in AttguJl 1786, in which Month they saw Two large Quantities shipped. — In September they saw great Quantities brought on the Premisses j when they came to London, and informed the Committee, who immediately applied to the Trta-fury — they were referred to the Attorney General, with whom they had Two Conferences (the last attended by the Solicitor of the Customs) when they desired to know if they could by any Means prevent the Wool from going, by entering the House to feixe it. — The Attorney General declared they could not enter. — The Men continued to watch on the 12th and 14th of October — they shipped near One hundred Packages on the First Night, and Thirty the Second. — The Men again came to London, and informed the Committee, who gave Notice to the Commissioners of the Customs; when the Men were ordered to be examined, and the Solicitor to report; who reported, that they might be prosecuted for every Act in the Information. — The Officer bringing the Information is at Liberty to chuse the Mode of Prosecution, and he desired that he might be permitted to prosecute the Acts of the 12th and 14th of October, before Two Justices of the Peace. — Leave was given, and the Information was laid before William and Samuel Boyfes, Two of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the County of Sussex, and a Hearing was appointed at an early Day in November, when the most compleat Evidence of the Fast was given (except proving the Wool to be British Growth, they not knowing from whence

those particular Parcels came.) — The Justices admitted it to be British Wool, but found a Difficulty to convict for the full Penalties laid, as the Men could not positively swear that the Whole was Wool, but admitted such Quantities as they could fee, and for which they gave a Conviction of £. 306, being the Penalty for exporting 2,040 lbs. Weight of Wool. — The Justices ordered the Warrant of Distress to be made; but the Defendant’s Counsel gave Notice that he Should move a Certiorari in the Court of King’s Bench. — The Officer’s Solicitor did not press the Warrant, as he had particular Direction from the Attorney General not to execute the Warrant of Distress, as the Laws would not warrant such an Act. — The Business lay dormant till Easter Term, when they gave Notice of arguing the Writ. — A Confutation was held with Mr. Bearcroft and Mr. Law, when they were of Opinion, that as the Wool was not positively proved to be British Growth, they advised the Cause Should be given up. — No Application has been made since for Costs.

— I was present at the Conviction of the Offenders.

Withdrew.

Thomas Barnes examined.

— I am a Woolftapler.

Have you met with any Deceits in the winding of Wool ?

I have, many.

In what Manner were those Deceits practised ?

Sir, Penry May the 23d, 1786;

I have the Pleasure, at last, to inform you, that I have succeeded in detecting the notorious Smugglers mentioned in my last Letter, though it was attended with serious Consequences, as the Officers are all, but One, sadly cut and wounded. The Crew of the Vessel got on Shore where the Worsted'. was lodged, concealed in an old Barn, within Ten Yards of the Sea Side; and the same Vessel I men-1

What was the Value per Pound of the inferior Wool?

Six Pence.

Did this inferior Wool appear to be (horn from the same Kind of Sheep as the fine Wool ?

What Satisfaction did you receive from the Seller ?

I hope I shall hear from you by the Return of Post how to proceed j the Worsted is safely lodged in Penryn. I applied to the Collector of Falmouth, but he had no Vessel ready, and

to the Captain of an Excise Cutter, but he would not go, what he called, a Wild Goose Chace; so I was determined to take it on the Shore, as I found out where it was lodged j it was concealed under Mats, old Wood, and a large Number of empty Calks in the Room, Brandy Anchors; there was a Variety of other Goods, all of which they refeued. 1

Perseverance in this Business has entitled me to,.and which you will find confirmed by a Letter from Mr; Stona. The Vessel got all the Goods in last Night, and put to Sea with most of the Refcuers, several of whom, together with the Captain, we have got the Names of, so I must desire you to direct me how to proceed: The Officers that attended were Two of the Customs, Two of the Salt, and One of the Excise t the latter greatly exerted himself: I trust they will receive some Mark of your Approbation; and as I have done this contrary to my own Interest, and at the Hazard of my Life, I trust you will consider that Circumftaqce; for I have several Packs of Combing Wool now by me, which I might have sold to the very Tradesmen that fold those Smugglers the Worsted I find it was brought high Thirty Miles at least from this Place.

I hope you have received the Pack of superfine Wool 1 sent you, and I do not doubt but it gave Satisfaction. If it is agreeable, I could wish for a Bill to the Amount by Return of Post j as Shear Time is nigh at Hand, I trust you will not take this Requefll amiss. I remain,

OBSERVATIONS.

"When the Vefiels arrives in the

side of others, EnglishVefiels, if there

is any in the Harbour.

Jersey Boats very seldom puts in the Harbour of St. M;. they advance into the Mouth of River where they unload in the Port of So-lictor.

The French are so fond of English Wool, that they very often grants the Permission of opening the Gates of this Town at Night, in order to receive the Wool when the Boats arrives late, or to conceal them from their Countrymen, if it is known there is some in Town.

The Declarations of Masters are not for Wool, ’tis called by the French Custom House’s Officers de BceuJ (Oxen Hair); and they deliver the Permission of unloading the Vessels accordingly. But the Masters or the Owners of the Poil de Boeuf are obliged to declare how many Pounds they have (withinTen Pounds) and if there is only One Pound more or less, they lose the Whole of it, it’s being seized by the Custom House's Director.

The Duties upon Wool, at the Entrance, is i*. 6. per Pound.

The Duties upon Wool, at the Exportation out of this Place, are H*. 6. per Hundred Weight.

It does not remain here a Tenth Part of the Wool brought in — the greatest Quantity is sent to Rennes; from whence it is exported to Elbceuf , Louviers, Sedan, Vienne, &c. for the Manufacturers of Cloth, which pays it no Doubt at a high Rate, as there is Duties to be paid upon it in each Province it pass through — these Duties, tho’ small, are not so inconsiderable, particularly when the Wool is to pass through many Provinces.

The current Prices of WhiteWool does not varies often; however it has been of late dearer than it was before, because the Quantity imported this Year has not been so considerable as formerly. Wool dyed in several Colours is dearer, and the Price of it is seldom under 55 Sols. The Quantity of dyed Wool don’t make Jx of the Whole.

The town of St. Malo is the chief Place for the Importation of Wool; however there is a certain Quantity imported to Granville j but if. appears, by the current Price, that it is by no Means so considerable as

November. O ST END being a free Port of Importation, it is impossible to determine, what Quantity of Wool is brought into that Place by Smuggler;! — there was a great deal brought in Time of War, when the French Ports were not open.

13 B*- Saw a Smuggler coming from being on

the Pier — Had on board 7 3ales of Wool, about a Hundred Weight each — Wool was 36.' or 18 Pence per Pound.

could never come at the Quantity — Saw 10 Carts

loaded, 6 Bags in each, and delivered to one Mr. G-,

an Agent for some Houses at Wool pays no

Duty here.

Had a long Conversation with Mr. B---- concern-

ing the Necessity of'English Wool in their Cloths; allowed with me that it was true that some of their Eta-mines (a Drift for Women) and Camlets could not bn manufactured without.

November.

Five Smugglers arrived from England-, some had ^Vool in small Bags weighing about 20 lb. each — -The Whole was delivered to Mr. E — , but could not procure art Account of it. The only Thing I was informed of was, that it was sent from England to that Merchant by a Correspondent; that he received vast Quantities every Year for a Manufacturer at Abbeville — that he has paid for Wool, in a scarce Time, 40 Sous a Pound — that once he received in a Week

10 Pence

40 Tons — that he buys Wool wherever he can find any.

A Year or Two ago the Quarttity of Wool brought here was immense; it is (till so> by what I have seen.

i December. Boulogne.-Saw a large English Sloop at the Quay,

about 40 Tons, loaded with Wool, which they were unlading, and carrying to Mr. — Asked Mr.

D---’s Nephew many Questions about Wool, and

why the French gave so much Money to the English for it — Was informed, that several Manufacturers, particularly those at Amiens, could not do without it — That Mr. Delport was Correspondent to Mr. Vanrobais of Abbeville, and to several Manufactu- rers at Amiens — That he had been lately in

Where he had bought 60,000 lb. of Wool, which was to be forwarded to him at sundry Times — Have been on board the Smugglers, . — The Price of English

Wool was 19 d.per Pound. — Besides the Sloops mentioned, there arrived Two small open Boats, loaded with Wool from England, which was fold immediately to Shopkeepers.

y Abbeville — The Manufactory of Mr. Vanrobais em-

ploys 4,000 in the Town — about 40 Looms in the Manufactory — Saw a great deal of English Wool, which was combed, in a small Warehouse — Was shewn through all the Houses. — I a(ked why they bought English Wool, while there was some in France as good and better; was informed, that for their Camlets, Ras-fleuris, Burrucan, they could not do without at lead an Half of English Wool to mix with their own for the Chain; but as for their Broad Cloths, they could do without it — Was told that the EngliJIs Cloth Manufacturers were endeavouring to prevent their Smugglers from bringing any Wool; but it would be impossible, because there would be always some imported, and they Should not mind paying 5 per Pound more for it, if it became scarce.

Workmen 7 3 Livres — — 40

Asked the Clerk of Mr- Vanrobais to dine — he accepted — The Receiver of St. Valery came in — Was liandi}. suspected, and obliged to go to Dieppe-, was asked there by a Clothier, if I would fend him English Wool — Could never tell the Quantity they brought in.

Left Dieppe, came to Rouen, went to Louviers, to fee Mr. Decretoux’Manufactory — Saw a Quantity of Bales

of English Wool, and was told it came from Boulogne

— Mr. Decretoux has sent to England for Sheep alive — have seen 53, for which he has made an Inclosure, to secure them from Wolves, C?r. — Went to Madame

V* R -----; told her 1 came from Paris, had passed

through Rouen in my Return home; that I wilhed to know some Persons which would buy a certain Quantity of English Wool. — She told me, that if I would fend it to her, (he would give 36 Pound, which was the Price ftie had bought above 5001b. at the Havre. — I said it was too cheap — That I would go to Elbxuf, and fell it there to some Manufacturers. — She said I might, but was sure they would not give me more, having lately received a large Supply from Boulogne and St. Valery.

Took a Horse and went to — was admitted

in Mr. P. Grandin's Manufactory, where they employ a great deal of English Wool in their Cloths- — which are chiefly Bays, and Cloths about 18 Livres the Aune, which is sent to them from Dunkirk, Boulogne, St. Valery, and Havre de Grace.

Went to the Havre de Grace,took my Abode at Mr.

B----, whose House is the Retreat of all Smugglers:

To get Admittance to the Matter of Customs was a Thing impossible, (Ac. — thought proper to get all the Intelligence I could in another Way, viz. That English Wool has been brought here, and at Honfleur, constantly since the late War — that sometimes 5 or 6 Boats loaded with are come in a Week — that the Wool is sent to Mr. Grandin, and others, Manufacturers at Elbiruf, See. — that several Luggers come (till regularly, and have brought Sheep alive for a Manufacturer at Louviers.

Went to Cherbourg — paid a Visit to a Mr. M---,

Whom I knew, and which has been always the principal FaCtor for the English, Alderney, Guern/ey, and

Jersey Traders; told me that he bought only in the Course of last Year, no more than lb. 112,000 of English Wool, (Ac. having Orders from Manufacturers at Vire, Elbccuf, Louviers, See.

Took a Horse, and proceeded to Carteret,

Reneville, and Agon; and having been told in all these Places, where I have several Acquaintances, that the Account of the Importation of Wool is given every Month, by the Receivers of the Customs in these little Creeks, to the Receiver General at Granville ;

Went to Granville — paid a Visit to the Receiver of the Customs — got the Account of the English Wool imported to Granville, and its Vicinity, in the Year 1787; — this being all the Intelligence I could gee in this Town, I prepared myself to take a Passage over to Jersey, or England.

The Islands of Jersey, Guern/ey, and Alderney, do not employ all the Wool which is allowed to them; as a certain Proof of it, their exporting Wool so often, and in such Quantities, makes it appear doubtless — formerly the chief Trade of the Inhabitants was Hosiery, but it is come to almost nothing, particularly in Guern/ey; and these of Jer/ey do not actually bring to St. Granville, and

Cherbourg, so many Stockings, at lead by a Third Part, as they used to do — these Stockings were knitted by the Peasants, and most Part of them are grown rich in the War; so that this Branch of Trade, which was extended only by Necessity, is much reduced in Jer/ey, and may be considered as nothing in Guem/ey and Alderney.

Appendix, N* 8.

' At Amiens, in Picardy, the Manufacturers make use of very great Quantities of English Wool, in their Etamines, Duroys, Burracans, and Camlets; and I have been informed, by Manufacturers, that some of these were made entirely with English Wool — To make their Ras-fleuris, Serges, Royales, (Ac. they mix English Wool with Berry Wool in the Chain. — At Abbeville and Elbceufa Sort of Cloth, 6 Quarters wide, about 15 Livres an Aune, which is equal to about 9/6. or 10/. per Yard English -, the Chain or Warp of these Goods is made with English Wool. — There are also other Kinds of Goods, such as Bays and coarse Kersey Cloths, made with Part English and Part French Wool. — At Lille the Manufactures are pretty much similar to those at Amiens. — A Rider of a House at Lille, with whom I met at Rouen, gave me these Informations, and allured me, that much Fjiglish Wool was made use. of in their Manufactory.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, a Member present informed your Committee, That the County Gaol of Carmarthen is greatly out of Repair, ill supplied with Water, and very deficient and circumscribed as to Situation, Size, Extent, and Conveniences; and also, that the Borough Gaol has no Outlet or Airing Ground, and is totally destitute of Water and other Conveniences, which cannot be added thereto, owing to its present confined and limited Situation, which renders the said Gaol very unfit to answer the Purposes of a Common Gaol; and it is therefore necessary that the same should be pulled down and removed from its present Situation — That there is no House of Correction within the Borough or County of the Borough of Carmarthen, and that it is highly expedient that the County Gaol should be repaired and enlarged, and a sufficient House of Correction builc adjoining thereto to serve as one Common Gaol and 8 House

A Petition of the ancient and new Subjects of His Majesty, the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth.

That, after the Conqued of the Province of Canada by the Arms of Great Britain, the Petitioners, in Compliance with His Majesty’s Proclamation, bearing Date the 7th Day of Odiober 1763, settled and became established in the new-acquired Colony of Quebec, in full Reliance on the Faith of the Crown of Great Britain, as expressed in that Proclamation, for the Enjoyment of those Laws, that Freedom and Security in Canada, Tenth Section of the Quebec Bill, which the Principles of the Englith Conditution af- "' ~

forded in every Parr of the British Dominions in America-, and that the Petitioners and the Inhabitants of the Province have chearfully, on every Occasion, obeyed the controuling Powers of the Parliament of Great Britain, and with Patience have differed, during a Period of Anarchy and War, rather than wound His Majesty’s Feelings, or embarrass the Parliament with Remondrances and Petitions, at a Time when the Safety of the Nation made sacred every Moment of public Deliberation: The Actions and Conduct of the Petitioners, when truly represented, will bed express the Sincerity of their Loyalty and Attachment to the

Crown and Government of Great Britain; and that.

the Petitioners look with Concern on the Burthen of Great Britain, and with great Pain and Commiseration they fee the Didreffes of His Majesty’s loyal Subjects, who, driven from their Estates, Wealth, and Possessions, are daily taking Shelter in this British Colony, though their unsettled and didreffed Situation may, for the present, hinder them from bringing forward their Petitions and their Claims: The House will readily perceive that a Government similar, or superior, to that under which they were born, had lived, and were happy, mud be considered, by those His Majesty’s unfortunate Subjects, as an affectionate Proof of His Majesty’s Paternal Care, and of the Parliament’s Regard for them, and as the fird Comfort which, in Relief to their Didreffes, can now be granted to them; and the more so, as it will be a Blelfing not merely granted to them, but extended to their Children and Poderity; and that the Petitioners, fully persuaded that the Welfare and Happiness of all His Majesty’s Subjects are peculiarly Objects of the serious and benign Consideration of the Commons of Great Britain, they therefore beg the Attention of the House to this their Petition, and ardently requed that the House will interpose in their Favour for the Repeal of the Quebec Bill, allowing such Privileges as are already granted to the Roman Catholic Religion, as being inadequate to the Government of this extensive Province, the Caule of much Confusion in our Laws, and fraught with Trouble and Uneasiness to His Majesty’s loyal Subjects here, and that the House will be pleased to concur in establishing His Majesty’s affectionate Subjects of this Province in the full Enjoyment of their Civil Rinhts as British Subjects, and in granting the m

5th. That the Commercial Laws of England be declared to be the Laws of this Province, in all Matters of Trade and Commerce, subject to be changed by the Legislature of Quebec, as in the preceding Article.

6th.' That the Habeas Corpus Act, of the Thirty-fird: of Charles the Second, be made Part of the Conditution of this Country.

7th. That optional Juries be granted on all Trials in Courts of Original Jurisdiction, that they be regularly ballotted for, and a Pannel formed as in England, either in the same of an Ordinary or a Special Jury, at the Option of the Party applying for the fame; and that Nine Members out of the Twelve may in Civil Causes be sufficient ttf return Verdicts, subject to be modified by the Legislature of Quebec, as in the 4th Article.

8th. That the Sheriffs be elected by the House of Assembly, and approved and commissioned by the Governor at the Annual Meeting of the Legislature, that they hold their Appointment during the Period elected for, and their good Behaviour, and that they find reasonable Security for a faithful Difpharge of their Duty.

9th. That no Officer of the Civil Government, Judge, or Minider of Justice, be suspended by the Governor, or Commander in Chief for the Time, from the Honours, Duties, Salaries, or Emoluments of his Appointment, but with the Advice and Consent of His Majesty’s Council for the Affairs of the Province, which Suspension shall not continue after the Annual Sitting of the Council, unless it be approved by the fame; the Cause of Complaint, if approved, to be thereafter reported to His Majesty for Hearing, and Judgment thereon.

10th. That no new Office be created by the Governor or Commander in Chief for the Time, but with the Advice and Consent of His Majesty’s said Council, and to be approved at their Annual Meeting, as in the preceding Article.

1 ith. That all Offices of Trud be executed by the Principal in the Appointment, unless by Leave of Absence from the Governor, with Advice and Consent of his Council, which Leave of Absence shall not extend to more than Twelve Months, or be renewed by the Governor, but with the Approbation of the Council at the Annual Session.

12th. That Judges be appointed to preside in the

Courts

Courts of the Province to hold their Places during Life, or their good Behaviour, and that they be rewarded with sufficient Salaries, so as to confine them to the Functions of administering Justice; that every Cause of Accusation for a Removal, proceeding from the Governor, shall follow the Rule laid down in the 9th Article; and every Cause of Accusation for a Removal, on the Part of the Public, shall proceed from the House of Assembly, and be heard by the Council, which, if well founded, shall operate a Sufpenfioii, and in either same be decided in Appeal and Report to His Majesty.

13th. That Appeals from the Courts of Justide in this Province, to the Crown, be made to a Board of Council, or Court of Appeals, composed of the Right honourable the Lord Chancellor, and the Judges of the Courts of Westminster Hall.

14th. The Petitioners beg Leave to represent to the House, that, from their Proximity to the United States, who from Situation and Climate have many Advantages over them, the internal Regulations for promoting the Trade, Agriculture, and Commerce of this Province, are now become more intricate and difficult, and will require great Care and Attention, on the Part of the Legislature here, to watch over the Interests of this Country, they therefore request that the Assembly may have the Power of laying the Taxes and Duties, necessary for defraying the Expences of the Civil Government of the Province, and for that Purpose, that the Laws now existing, laying Taxes and Duties to be levied in the Province, may be repealed.

Such are the Intreaties and Prayers of the loyal Subjects of this Province, and in full Confidence they trufk that the House will relieve them from the Anarchy and Confusion which at present prevail in the Laws and Courts of Justice of this Province, by which their real Property is rendered insecure. Trade is clogged, and that good Faith which ought and would sublist among the People, and which is the Life and Support of Commerce, is totally destroyed, and be pleased to l'ecure to them a Constitution and Government on l'uch fixed and liberal Principles as may promote the Desire the Inhabitants of this Province have of rendering this mutilated Colony a bright Gem in the Imperial Crown of Great Britain, and that may call on the present Generation for their unceasing Acknowledgments and Gratitude, and upon the future to feel as the present that the Security and Happiness of the People and Province of Quebec depend on an Union with, and Submission to, the Crown and Government of Great Britain.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the

A Petition of the Merchants, trading to the Province of Quebec, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by His Majesty’s Proclamation, bearing Date the 7th of October 1763, the Benefics and Advantages of the E.nglip Laws were promised to the Inhabitants of the above Province; and that, by an Act of the Fourteenth of His present Majesty, commonly called The Quebec Bill, those Laws by which

the Province had been governed Ten Years, the known and approved Wildom of which had greatly promoted that Confidence so essential to the Interests of Trade, by the Protection they afforded to Commercial Rights and Property, were entirely repealed. You XLIII.

and a new System or Code introduced, of which the Petitioners were totally ignorant, from the Administration of which they have sustained Innumerable Inconveniences and immense LolTes, and the general Trade of the Province has suffered greatly in its Credit: Impressed with a Conviction that their real Grievances will always meet with Redress from the British Legislature, His Majesty’s loyal Subjects, both ancient and new, resident in the Province of Quebec, did, in the Month of November 1784, transmit Petitions, addressed to His Majesty, and to both Houses of Parliament, praying for the Enjoyment of the Rights of British Subjects, which Petitions were received in the Year 1785, and, early in the Parliament tary Sessions of 1786, the Petitioners waited on His Majesty’s Ministers therewith, requesting that they would take the same under their Consideration, but being informed that Government wilhed to have more full Information on the Objects contained therein, and that Lord Dorchester, then going out as Governor, would have Orders to report on the State of the Province, the Petitioners, to meet the Wilhes of His Maj^efty's Ministers, did then agree to defer bringing them forward before the House, in Hopes that such Report might be received before the next ensuing Sessions of Parliament; and that the Petitioners, presuming that Government have now received the necessary Information, and feeling by Experience that the Evils arising from the present Constitution of that Province are daily increasing, think they cannot, in Justice to themselves or their Constituents, any longer withhold these Petitions; and, they beg Leave to submit to the House, that the Trade carried on to the Province of Quebec is, at present, an Object of considerable Magnitude to this Country, and that under a proper Constitution and System of Laws it might be rendered much more valuable by Encouragements for extending the Trade with the Savages — the Trade to New* fotmdland and The West Indies, supplying them with Provisions and Lumber — the Fisheries in the Gulph of Saint Lawrence — and, the Agriculture of the Pro-

vince, from which it is probable great Quantities of Hemp might be furnished for the Supply of these Kingdoms: And therefore praying, That the House will take these Petitions into serious Consideration, as containing Objects of the utmost Importance to the Prosperity and Happiness of the Province of Quebec, and the Manufactures of this Kingdom, and adopc such Meafores as will tend effectually to secure to their Fellow Subjects, resident in that Province, the essential Privileges to which they are entitled as ,

Subjects, by giving them the Laws of England in all Commercial Matters — the Bankrupt Laws under such Restrictions as shall be deemed necessary — Trial by Jury — the Habeas Corpus Act — and, by granting to the Province an Elective House of Assembly, establish such a Constitution as will afford Protection to the Property of the Britip Merchant, and convince the Inhabitants of that Province that their Happiness and Prosperity are founded on a solid Union with, and Dependence on, the Imperial Crown and Parliamenc of Great Britain, and that the Petitioners may be heard by their Counsel on the Premises at the Bar of the House.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury are pleased to refer the aforegoing Memorial to the Principal Officers of His Majesty’s Mint; who are to conOder the fame, and report to their Lordships their Opinion what may be proper to be done therein. Whitehall, Treasury Chambers, the 21st Day of March 1788.

'Tho' .

John Vernon, Junior, Memorial referred to Principal Officers of the Mint.

To the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury.

May it please your Lordships.

IN Obedience to your Lordffiips" Order of Reference, signified by Mr. Steele the 21st Instant, direct*-ing us to consider the Memorial thereto annexed of Mr. John , Solicitor to His Majesty’s Mint* craving Payment of Monies due to him for Prosecutions carried on in the several Periods therein stated; W beg Leave to report,

That your Lordships having been pleased to refer to us a Memorial from Mr. Vernon, for Payment of Expences of Prosecutions carried on by him in the Year 1786; and we having examined the Accounts to which it related', reported thereupon to your Lordships, the 13th 1787, that it appeared to us there was then

due to the Memorialist the Sum of £.722. 4. 4. for Expences of extraordinary Prosecutions incurred within that Year, more than this Office was authorized to pay.

And having now carefully examined the Accounts for Prosecutions carried on in the Year 1787, as mentioned in the present Memorial, we find the Charges (none of which are included in former Accounts) conformable to Regulations established by Royal Warrant, dated 29th July 1715 j and that Vouchers have been produced to us for Fees paid to Counsel, and other Diffiurfements, as far as seems practicable to obtain. But as this Office is authorized to pay the Account from gift. December 1786 to 31 1787, amount-

ing to £. 595. 5 s.there will only remain the subsequent Accounts for extraordinary Prosecutions relating to the Gold and Silver Coin, from 31st Augujlto 31st December 1787, amounting to £.474. 12. 2. and £.40 paid to John Beamish, and others,'as directed by your Lordships; — and for Prosecutions relating to the

Copper Coin, from 31st December 1786 to gift December 1787, amounting to 157. 10. 2.; and that upon the Whole we are of Opinion, the several Charges in the said Accounts (which with the £. 40 above-mentioned) amounting to £.672. 2. 11. are such as have been usually allowed. But this Office not being authorized to pay any farther Sums for Prosecutions on the Gold and Silver Coinage for the Year 1787, than the Amount of the Account ending 31st August, and for like Prosecutions in the Year 1786, the Amount of the Account ending at same Period in that Year; and there being no Fund provided for paying the Expences of Prosecutions on the Copper Coinage, the Account of extraordinary Prosecutions in both Years will be as follows:

That in the Preamble to the said Bill it is alledged, that the Regulations for the Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of Newcastle and Sunderland, established by an

Act, passed irt the Sixth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act to regulate the f(Loading of Ships with Coals in the Ports of " castle and Sunderland," may be extended and rendered more effectual to remedy the Inconveniences intended to be prevented thereby, and therefore it is proposed to be enacted, that, from and after a certain Day, the said Act of Parliament, and Two subsequent Acts for continuing the fame, shall be repealed, and certain Regulations, instead of those provided by the said Act, are, by the said Bill, ptoposed to be made respecting the Loading of Coals as Well at the Port of Sunderland, as at the Port of Newcastle and that the Mischiefs and Inconveniences intended to be prevented or remedied by the said Bill happened in the Port of Newcastle only, and not in the Port of Sunderland, and the Regulations established by the said Act of the Sixth Year of the present King are fully adequate to the Purposes thereby intended, so far as they relate to the Port of Sunderland, and there is not any Necessity with respect to that Port to alter or extend the Regulations or Provisions thereby made , and that the said Bill was prepared and presented to the House by the Advice and Direction of the Persons concerned in the Coal Trade in the Port of Newcastle and upon the River Tyne only, and the Persons interested in the Coal Trade in the Port of Sunderland and on the River Wear were not consulted upon, nor made acquainted with, the fame, nor did they know that the Provisions thereby proposed to be made were intended to relate or extend to the Port of Sunderland, until after the said Bill was presented to the House; and that the Petitioners observe, that, by a Proviso or Clause in the said Bill, it is proposed to be enacted,

“ That nothing in the said proposed Act shall extend “ to Ships or Vessels not exceeding the Burthen of “ Keels, and carrying Coals Coastways to any

" Port of Great Britain (except the Port of London)

“ or to any Foreign Port, buc that the Fitters, Agents,

“ or Venders of Coals, shall be at full Liberty to “ load such Ships or Vessels at any Time, and in “ any Manner, they shall think proper,” and the Petitioners have been informed, that the said intended Proviso or Clause is proposed to relate to Ships or Vessels not exceeding the Burthen of Six Keels of Coals j and that the said Proviso or Clause is manifestly calculated and intended, and mull operate, to withdraw from the Port of Sunderland to the Port of Newcastle the chief Part of the Coal Trade now and for many Years past carried on at the Port of Sunderland, by Means of Ships of small Burthen, which alone can with Safety be loaded in that Port, whereas, in the Port of Newcastle, Ships of large Burthen may safely and conveniently be loaded, and the Coal Trade from thence has hitherto been principally carried on by Means of such large Ships, but, if the said Bill Should pass into a Law, with the said Proviso or Clause therein, the Coal Trade of the Port of Sunderland, and on the River Wear, will, in a very great and alarming Degree, be reduced, if not altogether

The Lords have agreed to the Bill, intituled, An Wollaston in-

from greac-

Government do receive a very large Revenue the Duties on Coals exported from thence, the eft Part of which are carried Coastways, or to Foreign Markets, and not to the London Market y and that the Port of Sunderland has long been a great Nursery for Seamen, and extremely beneficial to the Public, in Manning of the Royal Navy upon every Emergency, and, if the said Bill should pass into a Law, with the said recited Proviso or Clause, a great Part of the Coal Trade of the Port of Sunderland will be withdrawn from thence to the Port of Newcastle> which will have the Eficft of a Monopoly of the Coal Trade, and consequently the Public will not be supplied with Coals so well, and at so cheap a Rate, as they are at present, and have been, under the Regulations of the said Act of Parliament now subsisting, and the other Regulations and Provisions, proposed to be made by the said Bill, will, in a very considerable Degree, be frustrated, and rendered useless, even at the Port of Newcastle, — moreover, the Owners of the Collieries upon the River IVear (in the winning and working of which Collieries very large Sums of Money have been expended) will be greatly injured, and their Property considerably lessened in Value, the Benefits derived to the Public from the Port of Sunderland, as well in rtj-speft of the Duties paid, as of the Seamen brought up and employed there, will in a great Measure be taken away, or reduced, and the Port itself, in Process of Time, be annihilated: And therefore praying,

Thamei md Mr. Call reported from the Committee, to whom l(is Navigation the Petition of the Commissioners appointed by and ported.0 r*" for putting into Execution an Act of Parliament, made in the Eleventh Year of the Reign of His present Majesty King George the Third, intituled, “ An “ Act for improving and compleating the Navigatien of the Rivers ’Thames and IJts, from the City “ of London to the Town of in the County

“ of Wilts," and another Act, made in the Fifteenth Year of His said Majesty’s Reign, for amending the aforesaid Act, was referred i That the Committee had examined, and found that the said Application is not within the Standing Orders of the House, of the 25th of April 1774, relative to Navigation Bills, it not being intended to extend the Navigation, or to purchase any Lands without the Consent of the Owners thereof, or Persons interested therein; and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and be read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read* and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, the said Acts were read: And

Mr. Henry Allnutt, Clerk to the said Commissioners, being examined, said. That they have borrowed £.28,900, and applied the same in carrying the said Acts into Execution — That Assignments of the Tolls are given for the said Sum — That the Commissioners have adverdfed for £. to,000 more, £.8,300 of which is actually lent, and the Remainder is ready, and will be advanced when required — That all the Money so borrowed, together with the Tolls received, have been duly applied in improving the Navigation of the River Thames from Staines to Cleve — That a further Sum of Money is required, so as to make the Whole -£70,000, or thereabouts, in order to enable the Commissioners effectually to improve the Navigation of the said Rivers.

And being further examined, he said. That the Price of Carriage of Goods on the Thames is lessened at Marlow about One-fifth; the Carriage of a Chaldron of Coals from London to the above Town being now Eight Shillings, which, before the passing of the said Acts, was from Nine Shillings to Half a Guinea — That the Freight of Coals is lessened throughout the whole Navigation, and of other Goods in nearly the same Proportion, the Navigation being more safe, certain, and expeditious, and the Boats consequently making more Voyages in the Year than they formerly did.

And being further examined, he said, That the Commissioners would be better enabled to continue and compleat the Navigation of the said Rivers if

16° Ap.

they were impowered to collect Tolls on the Towing Paths for the Use of the fame, and also at the Weirs,

Flalh Locks, or Turnpikes, as well as at the Pound Locks — That Power is also wanting to purtchafe Lands for compleating the Navigation, by making Cuts, Pound Locks, and other Devices, at other Places besides those where thereare Flalh Locks at pre* sent, and that the Restraint the Commissioners are now under with respect to the Depth of Water is inexpedient, as it tends to prevent the Improvement of the Navigation.

Then an Act, passed in the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, ««An Act “ more effectually to improve and compleat the Navigation of the River Thames Westward of London “ Bridge, within the Liberties of the City of ,

“ and to prevent any Vessel or Barge from being “ moored in Taplow Mill Stream, in the County of “ Bucks," was read, whereby it appeared. That the Power of the Commissioners, under the said Act of the Eleventh Year of His present Majesty, was limited to so much of the said Rivers as is above the Boundary of the City of London's Jurisdiction at Staines, in the County of Middlesex.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill to explain, amend, and enlarge the Powers of so much of Two Acts, passed in the Eleventh and Fifteenth Years of the Reign of His present Majesty, for improving and compleating the Navigation of the Rivers Thames and Ifts, from the City of London to the Town of Cricklade, in the County of Wilts, as relates to the Navigation of the said Rivers, from the Boundary of the Jurisdiction of the City of London near Staines, in the County of Middlesex, to the said Town of Crick-, lade: And that Mr, Call, Mr. Vanjittart, and Mr. Pye, do prepare, and bring in, the fame.

Sir John Eden reported from the Committee, to south shields whom the Bill for supplying with Water the Town of Water Bin South Shields, and Parts adjacent, and the Shipping re- reported' sorting to the said Town, was committed; That the Committee had examined the Allegations of the Bill, and found the same to be true; and that the Committee had gone through the Bill, and made several Amendments thereunto, which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered the Bill, with the Amendments, in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the Amendments were Once read throughout; and then a Second Time, One by One j and, upon the Ques-tien severally put thereupon, were agreed to by th?

House.

Ordered, That the Bill, with the Amendments, be ingrossed.

Ordered, That the Order of the Day, for the House jtojvjr *-to resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, erre to consider further of the Supply granted to His Majesty, be now read.

a Practice as that of smuggling Wool, as much as any Laws whatever can prevent it, when the Object of such Practice is so extremely depressed in its Price in one Kingdom, and left to find its fair and equal Market Value in every other Country} and that the effectual Means of preventing such clandestine Trade is, not to increase Restriction, but to lelTen the Temptation, which the Petitioners conceive would not be effected by a Bill, whose only Tendency is to lower the Price of a Product so important to them as that of Wool: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves, or their Counsel, against the said Bill passing into a Law.

A Petition of the Freeholders and Occupiers of Lands in the East Riding of the County of , was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth. That the same contains such Restrictions and Regulations, enforced by severe Penalties, as will be extremely of-preflive to the Growers of Wool, and, operating to the Discouragement of the Breed of Sheep, will be injurious to the Landed Interest: And therefore praying, That the same may not pass into a Law.

A Petition of the Merchants, and others, interested in the Trade to Africay from the Port of Liverpool was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That the Supply of the European, Settlements in America with Negro Slaves, purchased upon the Coast of

Africay is a Branch of Traffic which has been carried

... on for more than Two Centuries by various Nations,

and has hitherto met with uninterrupted Protection, Supporr, and Encouragement, from the Legislature of this Kingdom in particular; and that an advantageous Situation, amidst many principal Branches of Manufacture, which form a necessary Part of the Cargoes lent out in this extensive Trade, and some other adventitious Circumstances, have given a decided Superiority to the Port of Liverpool in this important Line of Commerce; and, the rapid Growth of the Town, and its amazing Increase in Wealth, Population, and Shipping, are convincing Proofs of the numerous National Benefits resulting from this

Trade with Africa and thfe West Indian Islands, which holds the first Rank in the Commerce of the said Port; and that the Petitioners find, by the Votes of the House, that a Bill is depending for the Establishment of certain new Restrictions in the Transporta-tien of Negro Slaves from Africa to , and

have well-grounded Cause to fear, that a Law of this Kind may throw such superior Advantages into the Hands of Foreign Nations, our Rivals in that ,

Branch of Commerce, as would eventually deprive the British Ports of all Advantage from that Trade j and that, should the Traffic in Negro Slaves be foundj upon a fair and dispassionate Enquiry, to, be incompatible with the Laws of Religion, Humanity, and found Policy, the total and avowed Abolition of it ought certainly to be adopted; but till that leading Question be decided, the Petitioners did not expect any Interruption in the established Practice of their Trade, nor can they, in the ffiort Interval between the present Day and the expected Prorogation of Parliament, have sufficient Time duly to consider, set forth, and prove, by sufficient WitnessTes, the probable Disadvantages that might attend the R eftridtions proposed: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves or Counsel, against any Innovations or immediate restrictions in the Trade to and Fhe West Indies.

A Petition of the Merchants, Traders, and others, of the City of London, trading to, or interested in, the Trade to Africa, and the British West India Islands, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth.

That the Petitioners are seriously alarmed at the Motion made in the House for Leave to bring in a Bill for the Purpose of making temporary Regulations in the African Trade, and that Leave has been granted for bringing in the fame; and that the Petitioners with Confidence have relied that no Innovations or Restrictions would have been attempted to be imposed on the said Trade, till the whole Business, irt all its Branches, had been thoroughly investigated and clearly understood; and that the Petitioners are very apprehensive the present meditated Regulations may totally ruin the Trade to Africa, annihilate the large Property embarked therein, render the Plantations in the Colonies belonging to Great Britain of little Value, and do an irreparable Injury to this Country: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by Counsel, against the said Bill.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the Bill for providing certain Temporary Regulations respecting the Transportation of the Natives of Africa, in Britifta Ships, to 7 be IVcftIndies, and cllewhere,

be read a Second Time; and the Petitioners are to be then heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petitions, if they think fit.

Ordered', That the said Bill be read a Second Time upon Friday Morning next. SiaveBiilap-

late Majesty, as relates to the licencing of Alehouse Keepers and Victuallers; and for regulating the Manner of granting such Licences in future, and also Licences to Persons selling Spirituous Liquors: And the same was received; and read the First Time.

Rcjolved, That the Bill be read a Second Time.

Ordered, That the said Bill be printed.

Sir Herbert Mackworth reported from the Committee, tb whom the Petition of the Right honourable Anthony James, Earl of Newburgh, Viscount Kinnaird, Baron Levingston, of Flacraig,in the Kingdom of

Scotland, was referred; That the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition; and had directed him to report the fame, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place*; and afterwards delivered the fame, together , with an Appendix thereunto, in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the Report was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, An Act, passed in the First Year of the Reign of King George the First, intituled, “ An Act for appointing “ Commissioners to esquire of the Estates of certain “ Traitors and PopiCh Recusants, and of Estates given “ to superstitious Uses, in order to raise Money out “ of them severally for the Use of the Public,” was first read, in order to shew to your Committee that of all the Estates forfeited for the Rebellion in the Year 1715, the DerwentwaterEstates alone still re-

main vested in the Trustees of the Public; and by that Act it appeared that all the Estates in Great Britain, Ireland, or elsewhere, of Persons who, between the 24th Day of June 1715, and the 24th Day of June 1718, were attainted by any Law or Statute of the Realm, for High Treason, were forfeited to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, without any Office or Inquisition found, according to the several and respective Estates and Interests which the Persons attainted had respectively therein, except where any such Person was seised of an Estate Tail in Possession, in which same it was enacted, that the same should be vested in his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, in Fee Simple, to the End that the same might be absolutely fold, disposed, or applied, according to such Acts of Parliament as might thereafter be made in that Behalf.

It appeared also to your Committee, by an Act: passed in the Twenty-second Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, “ An ” Act for vesting the several Estates of James late “ Earl of Derwentwater, and Charles de-

“ ceased, comprized in several Settlements therein mentioned, in Trustees, for an absolute Estate of “ Inheritance for the Benefit of the Royal Hospital “ at Greenwich, and for raising certain Sums of Mo-

“ ney out of Part of the said Estates, for the Relief “ of the Children of the said Charles Radcliffe," That the said Charles Radcliffe, the Petitioner’s Grandfather, "was attainted of High Treason on the 18th Day of May 1716; and on the 8th Day of December 1746 he was executed for the Treason by him committed as aforesaid.

Then an Act passed in the Fourth Year of the Reign of King George the First, intituled, «« An Act for vesting the Forfeited Estates in Great Britain and Ire-« land in Trustees, to be sold for the Use of the Pub-11 lie, and for giving Relief to lawful Creditors, by *determining the Claims, and for the more effectual “ bringing into the respective Exchequers the Rents “ and Profits of the said Estates to be sold,” was tead, by which it appeared. That all the Estates vested in his Majesty by the aforesaid Act, passed in the f irft Year of King George the First, were vested and settled in certain Commissioners therein named, to the

End that the same might be fold, disposed of, and applied for the Purposes therein mentioned.

Then an Act, passed in the Seventh Year of the Reign of King George the First, was read, by which it appeared, That the greatest Part of the said Forfeited Estates had been sold by the said Commissioners to the Governor and Company of Undertakers for raising the Thames Water in York Buildings.

Then an Act passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of King George the First, was read, by which it appeared, that the Forfeited Estates in England, vested in the said Commissioners, which should remain unfold after the 29th September 1723, and such of the Forfeited Estates in Scotland (which had likewise, by former Acts, been vested in certain Commissioners) that should remain unfold on the 26th Day of June 1724, should be divested out of the said respective Commissioners, and vested in his Majesty, his Heir$ and Successors, for the Use of the Public.

Your Committee then read an Act. passed in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of King George the First, intituled, “ An Act for Sale of such of the Forfeited Estates in that Part of Great Britain called “ Scotland, as remain unfold, and for determining such ft Claims on the said Estates as, having been dulyentered, remain undetermined,” by which it was enacted, That any Three or more of his Majesty’s Barons of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland were required to fell, to the highest Bidder, the said For- feited Estates, and every Part of them.

And then, in order to Ihew that none of the Estates forfeited for the Rebellion in 1745 still remain in the Trustees of the Public, another Act passed in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act to enable His Majesty “ to grant to the Heirs of the former Proprietors,

“ upon certain Terms and Conditions, the Forfeited <c Estates in Scotland, which were put under the Management of a Board of Trustees by an Act passed “ in the Twenty-fifth Year of the Reign of his late “ Majesty King George the Second, and to repeal the “ said Act,” was also read; and the said several Acts were produced to your Committee, in order1 to authenticate that Allegation of the Petition which states* that of all the Estates forfeited, either for the Rebels, lion in 1715 or 1745, the Derwentwater Estates alone now remain vested in the Trustees of the Public.

Your Committee then proceeded to examine the other Allegations of the said Petition; and in order to prove that the Petitioner, with better Pretensions, asses less Favour than any of the Persons to whom Forfeited Estates have been lately restored, and that his same differs from the Cafes of all other Sufferers for the same Cause, in the Instances specified in the Petition, so much of the Recitals of the aforesaid Act of the Twenty-second of George the Second, was read, as (hews the Non-age of Mr. Charles Radcliffe at the Time of his Attainder; his Consanguinity with the House of Stuart, by his Grandmother Lady Mary Tudor-, and that in or about the Year 1731, by the Death of his Nephew Mr. John Radcliffe, under Age, and unmarried, he became, by virtue of a Settlement' made in the Year 1691, seised in Tail Male in Possession of the Manor of Alston Moor and Garrigill, and several other Lands and Hereditaments therein mentioned, which, by virtue of the aforesaid Forfeiting Act, became vested in his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, in pee Simple — That the said Charles Radcliffe at the same Time, by the Death of his said Nephew, became Tenant for Life of feverah Lands and Hereditaments in the said Act mentioned, under a Settlement made in the Year 1712, with Remainder to his First and other Sons, ip Tail Male — That James late Earl of Derwentwater, the elder Brother of the said Charles Radcliffe, had been, in like Manner,

Tenant

18 Geo. III. 30° Mail. 521

Tenant for Life of all the said Estates comprized In borh the said Settlements, with the like Remainder to his First and other Sons, in Tail Male; and that after his Attainder and Execution, his Son, the before-named John Radcliffe, was admitted into the Possession, and actually enjoyed the said Estates for Sixteen Years, until the Day of his Death; and that upon the Death of the said Charles Radcliffe, who had forfeited the said last-mentioned Estates only for his Life, great Doubts and Difficulties (which were left open and undecided by the said Act) were entertained, whether the eldest Son of the said Charles Radcliffe, the Petitioner’s late Father, could or could not, by virtue of the Limitation to the First and other Sons of the Body of the said Charles Radcliffe, take the Estates so limited, in the same Manner as his Cousin German, the aforesaid Jchn Radcliffe, had taken the fame, not only on Account of his having been born within the Dominions of the French King, after the Attainder of his Father, although he was born of natural-born Subjects, but also on Account of no Claim having been put in within the Time limited by the Acts for that Purpose, on Behalf of the unborn Children of the said Charles Radcliffe, by the Trustees, to preserve contingent Remainders, which was neither directed nor provided for by the Act, as it was for the Claims of Infants, Femes Covert, and Idiots. — And it appeared to your Committee, from the said Act, That the Title of His Majesty, and consequently of the Commissioners of the said Royal Hospital at Greenwich, to the Estates comprized in the said Settlement of 1712, must arise either from Escheat, on Account of the real or supposed Alienage of the Petitioner’s late Father, or from the Defect of the Entry of Claims under the said Act, and not from the forfeiting Effefts of the Attainder; and inasmuch as the Title of the Crown to all the other Estates forfeited either in the Year 1715 or 1745, for the same Cause (except those comprized in the said Settlement of 1712) appears to have been undoubted and indefeasible, and that his Majesty’s Right and Title to the said Estates, settled in the Year 1712, depended upon Two very doubtful and important Points of Law, which the Act admits, but does not ascertain nor determine; and that the Petitioner does not pray to be restored absolutely to any of the Estates that were unquestionably forfeited by his Ancestors: Your Committee is satisfied that the Petitioner asks less Favour, with better Pretensions, than any of the Persons to whom Estates forfeited for the same Cause have been lately restored.

It also appeared, from a Report from the Committee of the H ouse of Commons, to whom all the Books, Instrumenrs, and Papers, relating to the Sale of the Estate of James late Earl of Derwentwater, were referred, on the 22d Day of March, in the Year 1731, That his hnded Estates^ upon the Rental in the Year

1723, amounted to the Yearly Sum of/. 5,012. 17*. or thereabouts, and from Accounts produced to yot\t Committee, the Rental of the said Estates for this present Year amounted to the Sum of /, 17,612, or thereabouts.

And it appeared unto your Committee, from the Accounts delivered in of the Rents and Profits of the whole Estates of the Derwentwater Family, since the Time of their having been vested in the Commissioners of the Royal Hospital at Greenwich, That the Public have received from the said Estates, in the Whole, the clear and nett Sum of /. 622,152, and upwards.

And it also further appeared, by the said Act of the Twenty-second of King George the Second, That the Commissioners or Governors of the said Royal Hospital at Greenwich had, in the Year 1749, soon after the Life Estate of the said Charles Radcliffe had determined, paid off several Sums of Money which were admitted Claims upon the said Estates, settled in the Year 1712, amounting, in the Whole, to the Sum of /. 28,900, over and above the Sum of /. 30,000* which, by the said Act, was given to or settled upon the Family of the Petitioner, for their Relief and Support, they being at that Time in absolute Want and Penury.

Then Twenty-five several Acts, passed in the Reign9 of King George the First, King George the Second, and His present Majesty (with the Titles and Dates of which your Committee ‘do not t[fink it necessary to trouble the House) were produced and read, by which it appeared, that the Legislature had, in a Variety of Instances, liberally extended their Favour and Mercy, either to Persons attainted or to their Defendants, or to the Children of Aliens, by restoring or granting the Estates forfeited or efeheated, by removing the Disabilities incurred by the Attainders, or by granting Sums of Money, which would otherwise have been the Property of the Crown.

Mr, IFalton, One of the Receivers of the Rents and Profits of the ’Derwentwater Estates, attended the Committee, and was examined as to the Receipt and Expenditure of the Rents and Profits of the said Estates, from the Time they have been appropriated to the Benefit of Greenwich Hospital; and he delivered in Three several Accounts, setting forth the Annual Amount of the Rents of each Year, from 1735 to 1788 — Secondly, the Gross Receipt of Cash from the Rents and Profits, with every Expenditure thereupon, and the Nett Balances remaining, applicable to the Use of the Governors of Greenwich Hospital — And lastly, the Receipts and Expences for the first and last: Five Years during which the said Estates have belonged to Greenwich Hospital; and which said Accounts are annexed to this Report, as Appendix, N° 1, N° 2, and N° 3.

f\RDERED, That the Committee who are ap- pointed to inspect the several Houses and other Buildings immediately adjoining to and the Two Houses of Parliament, and the Offices thereto belonging, and to report to the House- their Opinion how far the said Hall, and other Public Offices, may be secured from the Danger of Fire arising from the Contiguity of such Houses and private Buildings, have Power to report their Proceedings, from Time to Time, to the House.

Sir Peter Burrell reported from the said Committee, That the Committee had made a Progress in the Matter to them referred, and had agreed upon a Report, which they had directed him to make to the House and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth viz.

Your Committee having proceeded in Part to fulfil the Object of their Institution, and having inspected the Judges Room and Treasury of the Court of King’s Bench, and the Passage leading thereto, the Judges Room, Treasury, and Office of CustosBrevium of the Court of Common Pleas, the Offices and Buildings belonging to the Chief Ulhcr of the Court of Exchequer, the Tally Office, the Court of Exchequer, and the Offices and Apartments belonging thereto, the several Buildings in Old Palace Tardt lying West and North of the said Buildings, and of Hally the Clerk of the Pells Office, the Office of the Tellers of the Exchequer, the Office of the Usher of the Exchequer, the Tally Court, the Office of Auditor of the Exchequer, the Houses of the Tellers and Auditor, the Lottery Office, the Annuity Office, and the Buildings and Apartments adjoining and belonging thereto; upon Examination of the said Buildings, and the various Offices contained therein, and upon Enquiry into the Nature and Duties of the said Offices, and the Value and Consequence of the different Papers and Records therein deposited, think themselves called upon by the Magnitude of the Subject, to report as speedily as possible to the House the Situation of the said Buildings; and your Committee could not think themselves justified if at this Period of the Session they did not sacrifice the Advantages of a more particular and detailed Account, to the embracing the first Opportunity of calling the immediate Attention of the House to a Matter in which they conceive the Public Interest so deeply concerned.

The Importance of the various Records and Papers disposed of in the several Offices, to the transacting of the Public Business, and to the general Safety and particular Concerns of so many Individuals, is too well known, and too universally admitted, to make it at all necessary for this Report to state it in Detail.

Your Committee have, with minute Attention, examined all the above-mentioned Offices: To describe the Danger from Fire to which in their Minds they appear to be constantly exposed, furpafies any Language of which they are Matters; the Fad of these Buildings being now in Existence, speaks more forcibly in Favour of the extreme Caution which must have been invariably used by those to whose Care they have been entrusted, than any Praise which your Committee could bestow upon the Gentlemen under whose Charge these Buildings are at present placed.

S3*

Your Committee conceive the Safety of the Public Should not entirely depend upon such precarious Exertions, and they feel themselves the more justified in that Opinion, from reflecting that all that Attention and Caution might be rendered ineffectual by the . Negligence or Design of any One Inhabitant of the Buildings which immediately surround, and in many Instances adjoin to several of the Offices containing Papers of the last Importance to this Nation. These private Buildings, in the Opinion of your Committee,

should, at all Events be removed: But your Committee, understanding that the Claims of Individuals interfere with any general Plan for the Public Safety, conclude that this Honourable House will take such Measures as may be found necessary to remove such Difficulties. Your Committee conceive the present Situation of these Offices requires new Buildings and new Arrangements, so contrived as to afford that Safety which their present Construction entirely deprives them of Your Committee find it difficult to decide whether the Inconvenience attending the Transaction of Public Business, the Danger arising from Fire, or of Destruction from Want of Repair, is the most to be complained of.

CroWn, and to furnish the necessary Information to those who may be appointed to carry into Execution any System that may be adopted for the future Management of the Forests.

Although our Enquiry concerning the Forests has been general, yet so much do the Rights of the Crown, and oflndividuals, vary in the different Forests, and such Diversity is there in the Grants, Fees, Perquisites, Claims, and Reservations in them, that, to avoid Confusion, we shall find it necessary to report the State of

crease, and Supply of Timber thereon for the Use each Forest separately: The Underwood, the Timber,

“ of the Royal Navy,” appearing to us to be by far the most important, our first Attention was directed to the Means of acquiring the necessary Information for enabling us to execute this Part of our Commission; and, having Reason to believe that the Complaints of Waste and Spoil in His Majesty’s Forests were too well founded, we anxiously wished to lay before the Legislature, as soon as possible, the fulleft Statement of a Matter of so great National Importance.

General of His Majesty’s Woods and Forests, request ing that he would fend us an exact Lift of all the Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chaces, under his Charge, with such Plans, or descriptive Surveys of them, as he might have in his Possession.

The Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests being the only Officer who has a general Superinten-dance of the Woods belonging to the Crown in the Forests, no Survey being made, or Warrant issued, for any Work to be done in any Forest, nor any Fail of Timber directed, either for the Navy or for Sale, without a previous Reference to him, it was natural to expect that the best Information of the State of the Forests, and the most Compleat Descriptions, Plans, or Surveys of them, would be obtained from his Office; but the Answer returned by Mr. was, “ That not “ having received from his Predecessors any Maps, “ Surveys, or other Accounts of His Majesty’s Woods “ and Forests, except a few old Surveys of Woods “ and Coppices which had been formerly*inclosed,

it necessary to mention, in general, in order to shew how much the Subject calls for the Public Attention, that, according to the Information which we have received from very able Surveyors, employed in almost every Part of England, there is a general and alarming Decrease in the Quantity of Naval Timber, both in the Forests, and on private Eftares: That there is less Ground new planted than of Wood Land turned into Tillage; and, that the Plantations now made are, in general, more for Ornament than Use; That the Annual Demand for the Dock Yards cannot, from the Accounts which we have received from the Navy Board, be reckoned at less than 25,000 Tons or Loads, of which Quantity not more than One Twelfth Parc has been furtiished from the Whole of the Forests of the Crown during His Majesty’s Reign; and yet fa wasteful and tteftruftive is the present System of Management in those Forests, that the general Quantity of Timber in them lessens every Year.

ber, in every Age,from very early Times; and it may therefore probably be ftipposed, that the Danger is not more real now than it has formerly been: It may be imagined that if there be an increased Demand for Naval Timber, as that Demand must necessarily add to the Price, and thereby give greater Encouragement to Importation and Planting, there can be no Reason to apprehend that where Industry is so general, and Property so secure, as they are in this Country, an ample Supply will not always be obtained from private Property, or from general Commerce.

It will be found, however, that this Principle does not hold in the same of Naval Timber: The great Addition to the Navy and Commerce of Great ,

with the rapid InCreafe of the valuable Business of Ship Building in this Country, since the Close of the last War, and since the Employment of built

Ships in our Trade has been restrictfed, are Circumstances which render any other Evidence of an immense additional Demand for Naval Timber unnecessary; and our Information, as to the Reality of the general Decrease of Timber, is too certain to admit of any Doubt. The Commissioners of the Navy having, One Year with another, been furnished with no more than 2,000 Loads of Timber from His Majesty’s Forests, have purchased all the rest, being about Twenty-three thousand Loads, from Individuals in this Country; no Part of the rough Timber being now imported. A Board which has such ample Means of acquiring Information, by its numerous and extensive Transactions in the Purchase of Timber, and whose Attention is peculiarly directed to that Object, cannot be deceived in this Particular; and our Information from that Board is corroborated, not only by the Reports of our Surveyors from every Part of ,

and by the Answers to all our Enquiries, but also'by the Opinions of the best Authors who have written on the Subject.

It is found, therefore, from Experience, that an Addition to the Demand for Naval Timber does not produce a proportional Supply from private Property; and the Reason is obvious: An Oak must grow an Hundred Years, or more, before it comes to Maturity; but the Profits arising from Tillage or Paftureare more certain and immediate, and perhaps as great: It cannot, therefore, be expedited that many private Individuals will lay out Money on the Expe<itation of Advantages which they themselves can have no Chance to enjoy: Commerce and Industry seek for, and are supported by, speedy Returns of Gain, however final]; and the more generally the Commercial Spirit shall prevail in this Country, the less Probability is there that planting of Woods, for the Advantage of Poste-ricy, will be preferred to the immediate Profits of Agriculture.

It is accordingly in the Northern, or mountainous Parts of the Kingdom chiefly, and on Land unfit for Tillage, where any great Plantations have lately been made; and thele are mostly of Fir: But the Oak, to become great Timber, requires the strongest and deepest Soil, which being also the most profitable for Agriculture, is the leaf! likely to be employed by Individuals in railing Timber.

For the Remedy or Prevention of this Scarcity, which has so long been apprehended, various Plans have, at different Periods, been adopted, or recommended. In early Times, Recourse was had to the narrow System of putting Restraints on the Use and Management of Private Property: In the Reign of Henry VIII. a Law was made, by which it is Enacted,

“ That Twelve Standils or Scorers, likely to become “ Timber Trees, shall be left on every Acre of Wood f< or Underwood that shall be felled at or under 24 «« Years Growth; the turning Wood Land into Til-« lage is prohibited; and whenever any Wood is cut

4

“ it must be immediately inclosed, and the young “Spring of Wood protected for Seven Years; and “ Penalties are appointed for every Transgression “ against this Law.” And in the 13th of , ijEliz.C.

there were further Provisions relative to the Management of Woods on private F.states.

But these Regulations have proved altogether ineffectual. The Management of private Property canrtot v anywhere be placed, with more Safety and Advantage to the Public, than with the Proprietors: The Interference of Government, farther than in the Protection of Property, is always fi emitted to with Reluctance, often evaded, and seldom productive of any Benefit to the Public.

It is true, that there is no Kind of Property that requires the Protection of Laws more than Timber, which may easily, and in very little Time, be hurt or destroyed, but requires a Century to come to Perfection. The Penal Laws relative to the Destruction of Trees should, for that Reason, be rigidly enforced, and the Punishments perhaps increased; yet, as all the Expectation of Advantage which the freest Use and the most entire Command of the Property can give, is found insufficient to induce Men to plant, with a View to so distanc a Return, so much as the Demand requires, Government should certainly not Icflen that Expectation by Restraints on the Use, or Interference in the Management, of the Woods oflndividuals; and any Laws which hold out such Discouragementt should, perhaps, be repealed.

But though the leaving to every Man the entire and uncontrouled Use and Management of his own Woods, is the most likely Way to encourage planting on private Estates, yet we are very far from agreeing with those who think that Government may safely trust 10 the Supply of Timber which private Estates and Commerce will afford.

Holland is an Example, and perhaps the only one that can be given, of a Country which, without Fo-rests of its own, belonging either to Individuals or to the State, has been regularly supplied with Naval Timber through the Medium of Commerce: But the Situation of Holland is very different from that of Great Britain: A State with little Territory can have no other Means of Supply; and the great Rivers which, after passing through an extensive Continent in which there are many Forests, fall into the Sea in Holland% added to its Vicinity to those Northern Countries which abound the most in Wood, give Holland Advantages in procuring Timber by Commerce, which no other Country possesses in the same Degree: But in this Kingdom there are large TraCts of Land be-r longing to the Crown which cannot be applied to better Uses; the British Oak is of a superior Quality to any that grows in those Northern Parts of ,

from whence only we can be supplied without enormous Expence. It is said too that Timber is becom- CampMI’i’ ing scarce in those Countries; and we certainly Should Political$u» not depend on other States for what is essential to our yeJ' own Defence.

But if Government cannot with Safety depend on the Supplies from private Estates in this Kingdom, nor on what may be imported from Abroad, neither ought it to trust to a sufficient Supply for our Navy, from the Royal Forests, circumstanced as they now are, and while they remain under the present System of Management.

The improvident and ofeen ill-defined Grants made by the Crown in many of the Forests, and the confused Mixture of Rights created by them, have the worst Effect upon the Property itself. The Proprietor of the Underwood must wilh to prevent the Growth of Timber, by which his Crop is diminished: and it is for the Advantage of those to whom the Herbage has been granted, that no Wood should grow up of any

Kind:

28 Geo. III.

Kind: The Whole is a perpetual Struggle of jarring Interests, in which no Party can improve his owtl Share without hurting that of another.

But the Contest is very unequal: At a Distance from the Seat of Government, the Inhabitants and Borderers on those extensive Forests have the greatest Temptations, as well as the belt Opportunities, to injure and encroach on the Property reserved by the Crown; and the Crown must find it extremely difficult to protect its remaining Rights.

Formerly, when the Crown Lands afforded the chief Revenue by which the Expence of Government was supported, when, to avoid the Demand of Aids from the People, which a Failure in that Revenue gave Occasion for, Resumptions of Grants were not only common but popular; and when the Forest Laws were carried into full Execution, there was little Danger that the Crown would suffer a permanent Loss of its Landed Property: For though the Encroachments, Devastation, and Spoil in the Forests were perhaps more rapid, in Times of public Disturbance, and during the Reigns of weak or improvident Princes, than they even now are, yet such was the Power exercised by the Crown, that what was loft or granted away during a relaxed or profuse Administration, was resumed, or amply compensated by the first Monarch who gave Attention to that Part of his Property: Savenant. And whoever considers the Resumption of Grants, and S'John, on the the oppressive Extensions of the Forests in early Times, Charts de Fo-.* or n ^ds the Reports of Sir William , of the Pro-retu. ceedings before the Earl of , as Chief Justice in

Jones’s Re- Eyre, in the Reign of Charles I. will fee that there P°i^Vai^oAP- was formerly more Danger to private Property fron f*n ,x> °s* t}je violent Exertions of Power, than to the Pro pertyofthe Crown by the Encroachments of Indivi duals.

The Situation now is very different: Private Property, happily for this Country, is in perfect Security j but the Property of the Crown in the Forests is open to daily Encroachments; and unless a Stop shall soon be put to the Progress of existing Abuses, and some Interruption given to intrusive Polfdfion, the greatest Part of the Timber now growing in the Forests will be destroyed; and those Rights which are at present retrievable, will be gradually loft.

To these general Observations, tending to Ihew the Necessity there is for Attention being speedily given to the Improvement of the Forests, in order to provide a Supply of Oak Timber from them for the Use of the Navy, we think it necessary to add a very brief Sketch of the general Government of the Forests under the ancient Forest Laws, to which some Reference is unavoidable, those Law’s being still in Force in such of the Forests as have not been disafforested, and being, in Dean Forest, particularly confirmed by the Act of 20th Charles II.; but we mean to go no further into that Subject, than may be sufficient to render such occasional References intelligible.

The Origin of none of the Forests belonging to the Crown is to be found mentioned in any History or Record, the New Forest in excepted, which,

Manwood on though made by William the Conqueror, is called by Koi-eft Laws, Manwood, the <c newest Forest in England.”

ase 35" The Bounds of many of the Forests were enlarged

by Henry II. Richard I. and King but they were

reduced to their ancient Limits in the Reign of it Edward I. ward I. agreeable to the Provisions of the Charta de

rejl a; and, in order to ascertain those Limits, Perambulations were then made, and afterwards confirmed CapH^.arJ 111 by Act of Parliament.

The Origin of the Laws and Regulations for the Management of Forests seems to be involved in equal 9Henry in Obscurity with that of the Forests themselves. Since the Charta de Forejla,there have usually been Two

Justices in Eyre, One for the North, and the other for Vol. XLIII.

the South of 'Trent: Each of those Officers has Jurisdiction over all the Forests within his District; and there was no other Officer who had any general Superin tendance Of the Forests before the Reign of Henry VIII. But in each Forest there was a distinct Set of Officers j namely,

i ft, Verderors, who are Judges of the Swanimote Court, and Directors of all the other Officers in the Forest: There were usually Four Verderors in every Forest of the King.

2dly, Retarders, who were to go through the whole Forest, and make their Regard every Third Year; to esquire of all Offences in the Forest, and Purvey all Affarts, Wastes, and Purpreftures: There Should be Twelve Regardersin every Forest.

3dly, Foresters, whose Duty was to preserve the Vert and Venison in the Forests, to attach Offenders, and present Offences at the Forest Courts: The Number was determined by the Occasion for. them in each Forest, according to the Discretion of the Regarders.

4thly, Agiftors, whose Office Was to receive and account for the Agistment or Profits arising from the Herbage and Pannage of the King’s Woods and Lands in the Forests: There Should be Four in every Forest in which the King hath Woods to Agift.

jthly. Woodwards, whose Charge was to look after the Woods, and to present Offences therein at the Forest Courts: Their Number does not seem to have been determined.

6thly, A Steward, whose Duty is to attend the Courts, and assist the Verderors.

Besides these Officers, there have been usually a Lord Warden, Lieutenant, or Matter Forester, appointed by the King in each Forest; and there may be other Officers in a Forest, by local Custom.

There were Three Courts appertaining to the Forests, namely, the Court of Attachments or Woodmote, the Court of Swanimote, and the Justice Seat, or Court of the Chief Justice in Eyre.

The Two First of these Courts were composed of the Officers in each Forest. The Court of Attachment or Wqodmote ought to be held every Forty Days, at which Court every Officer in the Forest Should attend: This Court was to enquire into all Offences of every Kind done in the Forest, and to present them at the Swanimote Court, and to the Lord Chief Justice in Eyre.

The Court of Swanimote, in which the Verderors were the Judges, Should be held Three Times in every Year. The First Court Should be held Fifteen Days before Midsummer, for the Purpose of clearing

the Forest of all Animals (except Deer) for the next Month, called the Fence Month, which is the Fawning Season, during which the Deer ought to be left undisturbed; and a severe Penalty is incurred by introducing any other Bead into the Forest at that Time.

The, next Swanimote Court Should be held Fifteen Days before Michaelmas, when the Herbage Money for Cattle Should be received, and the Swine Should be admitted into the Forest, to feed on Acorns and Beech Mast, called Pannage, which Should be paid for at the Third Court, to be held Forty Days after Michaelmas, videlicet, on the Feast of St. Martin: At that Time the Forest Should again be cleared, and no Animal (except Deer) admitted, from the nth Day of November until the 23d Day of Hpril(Old Stile) which c° 3. Period is called the Winter Haining.

At this Court the Presentments of the Court of Attachments ought to be received, and enrolled, the smaller Offences tried, and those of more Importance presented to the Justice in Eyre, to whom the Rolls of this Court ought to be certified at the next Sessions of 7 D Eyre;

Though many of these ancient Regulations appear to be well calculated for the Preservation of the Fo-Cap. J. rests, insomuch that the Act of the aoth Charles II. for the Increase and Preservation of Timber in Dean Fo-rest, takes Notice, that it had been found, by former “ Experience, that nothing did more contribute to “ the Raising, Increase, and Preservation of Timber, “ than the Forest Laws,” yet even so early as in the Reign of Henry VIII. some other Regulations were 35 HtnryViii, deemed necessary. In the 33d Year of that King’s Cap. 39. Reign an Act was passed, establishing a Court, called the Court of General Surveyors of the King’s Lands, which was to consist of the King’s General Surveyors, a Treasurer, an Attorney, the Master of the Woods, Auditors, Receivers, a Clerk of the Court, an Usher, and Messenger. This Court had a general' Superintendance of the Lands belonging to the Crown: The Master of the Woods was impowered, with the Af-sent of the Court, to make Sales of Wood, &c. in the Forests; and none could be cut without his Warrant, and the Assent of the said Court: But in the HenryVIII. 38th Year of the same Reign, that Court was dissolved by Letters Patent, and a new Court, called the Court of Augmentations, was erected, and inverted with all the Powers of the former Court. One Master, and One Surveyor of the Woods, for the South, and One of each for the North of Trent, were Members of it, and in each District Wood Sales were ordained to be made, by the Certificate of the Surveyor, and by the Commission of the Master of the Woods, with the Consent of the Justice in Eyre.

Both those Courts seem to have been very well constituted for the Remedy of what was defective, as to the Preservation of Timber, in the Administration and Management of the Forests, under the Forest Laws. 1 From the Account which has been given of the Courts

f of Attachments and Swanimote, of the Duty of the

different Officers within each Forest, and of the Power of the Justice in Eyre, it appears that ample Means 1 were provided for the Care and Preservation of the

Forests, for guarding against Intrusions, and for the Punishment of Offences, while the Funftions of those Sir Julius Cae* Offices were properly executed: But the Power verted Mss^oi °i *n c^e Chief Justice in Eyre himself was often abused, in Sumyor and that Officer irregularly disposed of Timber in the General’s of- Forests for his own Advantage. This Abuse the Au-Landi.< rown thority given to those Courts was well calculated to prevent: By uniting the different Officers, the Surveyors General, the Masters of the Woods, the Receivers, and the Auditors, in One Court, they would have been a Check upon each other} and if either of these Courts had been continued, and had acted in Conjunction with the Forest Officers, as was intended, the Landed Property of the Crown, and the Forests in particular, which remain undisposed of, would at this Time, in all Probability, have been of very great Value: But the last of those Courts being established only by Letters Parent, it had, perhaps on that Ac-D.ikcofSuf- count, the less Weight} and the Justices in Eyre, who of^uiTc^Ti.o! had usually, but improperly, taken upon them to make E»rl of s'ultex! Wood Sales, and who happened, during thac and the succeeding Reign, to be Men of great Power, counteracted the Measures of the Court of Augmentations, and made great Waste of the Timber for their own Profit: And although that Court was afterwards con-

made, “ without a Commission from the Lord Treasurer, and Two such other of the Court as he should “ call to him at that Time, or, in his Absence, by the *c Under Treasurer, calling to him Two of the said *c Court and another Article gave Power to the Lord Treasurer, and the Court of Exchequer, to amend, reform, and correct any Clause or Article therein contained, and to make such further Order as the Court Should think expedient.

The Court of Augmentations was thus dissolved, and its Powers transferred to the Court of Exchequer; but the System of Management, under the Officers of the Forest only, being still found to be defective, a Surveyor General of the Woods was afterwards appointed, to whom a general Superintendance was given over all the Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chaces, belonging to the Crown; since which Time little Alteration has taken Place in the Form of conducting the Business of that Department. What Share that Officer now has in the Administration and Management of the Forests, will be more particularly Ihewn in the subsequent Part of this Report.

Finding it necessary, for the Reasons which we have given, to report the State of each Forest separately, we propose, in the present Report, to give a State of the Forest of Dean.

We are induced to bring this Forest first under the Public Attention, because, in Proportion to its Extent, it is by far the most valuable, and the mort proper for a Nursery of Naval Timber: because the Rights of the Crown and of the neighbouring Inhabitants and Officers of the Forest, were distinctly ascertained by an Act of Parliament in the 20th Charles Cap.-,. II. a Period not so dirtant as to render it difficult to support those Rights against ill-founded Claims or usurped Possession } and because, notwithstanding the falurary Provisions of that Act of Parliament, the Encroachments *here are perhaps more numerous, the Perquisites ancf undue Advantages taken by the Officers more exorbitant and destructive, and the Waste and Depredation more rapid, than in any other Forest belonging to the Crown.

bor the Sake of Perspicuity, we shall divide the Remainder of this Report into Three Parts:

In the First, we propose to cake Notice of some Grants relative to the Forest of Dean, prior to the Act of 20th Charles II. as well as of the Circumstances which led to the Introduction of that Law; to ftace the Regulations established by it; and to give some Account of the Forest during the I ime that those Regulations were carefully observed.

Secondly, we mean to state the Errors and Abuses which afterwards crepe into Practice, and the Effect which they have had upon the Forest; to explain the present Course of Management, and the Condition to which this Forest is now reduced.

And lastly, we propose to suggest the Heads of such an Arrangement with those who have Rights of Common, or other Claims on that Forest, and of such a System of future Management, as we think would be the most likely to guard against such Evils hereafter, and to render that Forest a very valuable Nursery of Timber for His Majesty’s Navy.

THE Forest of Dean is situated in the West Part of the County of Gloucesterbetween the Rivers Severn and kPye, both of which are Navigable. The

relating to this Forest, for Terms of Years, or in Per petuity, made in almost every Reign, we do not find it necessary to mention any of them particularly in this Report, prior to the Reign of James I.

In the 9th Year of that King, a Grant was made to William Earl of Pembroke, of the Lordship, Manor, Town, and Castle of Saint Briavel's, and all the Forest of Dean, with the Appurtenances, in the County of Gloucester, and all Lands, Adines, and Quarries, to the said Lordship, (Ac. belongings except all great Trees, Wood, and Underwood, to hold for 40 Years, at the Yearly Relit of J-Sj. 18 s. 4 and 60s. 8 d. Increase Relit: And in the same Year the said Earl obtained a Grant of 12,000 Cords of Wood Yearly, for 21 Years, at 4 s.per Cord, being 2,400, and

reserving a Relit besides, of £.33. 6s. 8d. per ,

with Liberty to dig for and take, within any Part of the said Forest, or the P thereof, such and so much Mine Ore, Cinders, Earth, Sand, Stone, Breaks, Moss, S.ea Coal, and Marie, as should be necessary for carrying on the Iron Works let to him, or which he should erect; no Person or Persons whatsoever, other than the said Earl, to be permitted, during the said Term, to take or carry out of the said Forest any Wood, Timber, Mine Ore, or Cinders, without Consent of the said Earl, except such Timber as should be used for his Majesty’s Shipping.

Soon after those Leases were granted, the Miners1 who had been employed in the Forest having begun to dig for Ore, without Consent of the Lessee, an Information was filed by the Attorney General against sonne of them; and in Hilary Term, 10th James an Order was made by the Court, That those Miners,

“ and such others as had been accustomed to dig Ore “ in the Forest (upon their humble SubmifTion for “ their Offences, and Acknowledgment that the Soil “ was the King’s, and that they had no Interest (t in, and upon their Motion by Counsel that they “ were poor, and had no other Means of Support, and praying to be continued in their Employment)

“fhould be permitted, out of Charity and Grace, and “ not of Right, to dig for Mine Ore, and Cinders, To be carried to his Majesty’s Iron Works, and nor to “any other Place, at the accustomed Races; and if “ the Farmers of the King’s Iron Works Should * fu/e to give those Rates (which, as well as the “ ber of Diggers, were to be ascertained by <( fmners to be named by the Court) then that they “ might fell thp Ore to others;but no new Diggers

dred, and other Persons bordering on the Forest, put in their Claims: Among those is the Claim of Philip Earl of Pembroke, to be Constable of the Castle of Saint Briavel's, and Warden of the Forest, under a Grant of that King during Pleasure, and in virtue of *5 July* f Cha*I. that Appointment to be Chief Judge of a Court, called The Mine Law Court, held for the Regulation of the Mines of Iron and Coal, and of the Miners.

This is the first mention which we have any where found of a Mine Law Court. The Claims which were made and admitted on this Occasion remain on Record in the Tower: Such of those Claims as have since been extinguished by the before-mentioned Acct of 20th Charles II.and where no Attempt is now made to establish them, it is unnecessary to cake Notice of; but as the Colliers and Miners who have Works in the Forest have been, for a considerable Time past, supplied with Wood, and of late Years with Timber, for the Use of their Works, and now claim both as a Matter of Righr, and as this is by far the most considerable, as well as the most dedruc-tive Claim, now existing in this Forest, it may be proper to remark, that no Claim of the Miners or Colliers is found among those which were allowed at this or at any former Justice Scat, On the contrary, we find it expredly mentioned, in the Return to a Commission of Enquiry concerning this Forest, dated 5 March 1671, that the Claims of the Miners had

been rejected at this Justice Sear, they not being a

Corporation; and there has been no Justice Seat held for this Fored since that 7 ime. If the Miners had been difiarisfied with the Rejection of their Claims, or had thought them well-founded, it was in their Power to have sued our a Writ of Allowance, by which they would have been restored to the of their Rights,if the Deciliun of the Court had been

illegal; but this docs not appear to have been done.

At this Justice Seat the Perambulation of the Fored, which had been enlarged, as hath been already mentioned, and was afterwards reduced to its ancient Limits in the Reign of Edward I. and confirmed by j Act of Parliament, ia Edward III. was again extend- 4 j C. 3.

This Act redored the Boundaries of the Forest as they were ascertained by the Perambulation

tien of Edward L and these were afterwards declared *0 Charles II. to be the Meets and Bounds of it by the Act 20

CharlesII*

Appendix, N° 4. We have given in the Appendix the Perambulation

of this Forest, confined to its ancient and legal Bounds, but that Perambulation comprehends many Estates and Manors which are now private Property j and we have not thought it necessary to have a Survey taken of any other Parts of the Forest, than those in which the Soil, the Timber, or the Herbage belong to the Crown. These are described in the Plan delivered with this Report, and appear to contain 23,888 Acres, including a Tract of Land, called *8 M»y> ♦» Hen- Abbots Wood, containing 872 Acres, which is granted

during the active and vigilant Administration of Cromwell, for the Prevention of the Waste and Abuses in this Forest, and for the general Preservation of Timber, as may appear on Reference to the Journals.

And in 1656, an Act or Ordinance was pasted, by Scobeli’s CoM;< which the Grant to Sir John Wintourwas declared to be void; and it was enacted, that the Forest should remain in the Possession of the Protestor and his Successors, for ever, for the Use of the Commonwealth.

The Acts pasted during the Usurpation having been declared void o’-» the Restoration, Sir John tour'% Grant came aga.. to be in Force: He entered anew into Possession, and began to repair his Inclosures j but he met with great Opposition from the

King’s Deer and Wild Beasts, and of all Mines and Quarries, and with a Power to the Grantee to inclose One-Tenth Part thereof, and to hold the same inclosed against all Animals, except the King’s Deer and Wild Beasts, leaving Nine-Tenth Parts always open.

In the 12th Charles I. a Grant was made to Edward Ferringham, of all the Mines of Coal and Quarries of Grindftone within the Forest of Dean, and in all Places within the Limits and Perambulations thereof, as well those within his Majesty’s Demesne Lands, and the Waste and Soil there, as also all such as lay within the Lands of any of his Majesty’s Subjects, within the Perambulation of the said Forest, to his Majesty reserved, or lawfully belonging, to hold for Thirty-one Years, at the Yearly Relit of £.30.

In 1638 a Commission was issued to divers Persons to make a Survey of the Wood and Timber, and Soil of the Forest of Dean; by which Survey it appeared that there were then within the Forest (besides the Woodwardship of the Lea Baily, containing about 1,000 Acres) 105,557 Trees, containing 61,928 Tons of Timber, and 153,209 Cords of Wood. And upon this Survey an entire Sale was made to Sir John Win-tour, of all his Majesty’s Coppices, Wood Ground, and Waste Soil of the said Forest (except the Lea Baily) with the Wood and Timber, and all his Mines of Iron and Coal, and Quarries of Millstones and Grindstones, and all Mines of Iron, Cinders, Tin, Lead, and Coal, and Quarries of Millstones and Grindstones, lying and being in the Lands of any of his Majesty’s Subjects, within the Perambulation of the said Forest, in 27th Edward I. reserved or lawfully belonging to the Crown, inConfiderationof£.106,000, to be paid by Installments, and a Fee Farm’ Relit of £.1,950. 12j. 8 d.forever.

In order to ascertain what Quantity of Land, in the said Forest, the Crown might dispose of for Cultivation, a Commission was issued to Sir Charles Harbord, and others, previous to the Sale to Sir John Wintour, to enquire into the Rights, both of the Crown and the Country in the Forest; and after a full Discussion, an Agreement was entered into between the Commissioners and the Commoners, in Consequence of which 18,000 Acres were set out for Inclosure and Improvement. Those 18,000 Acres were afterwards disaffo-rested, and the Right of Pasturage was reserved to the Commoners on 4,000 Acres, which were parcelled out in convenient Situations for the respective Parishes having Right of Common. It does not appear that any Claim was made by the Miners and Colliers on this Occasion.

Sir John Wintour entered into Possession, made Inclosures, and grubbed up great Quantities of Timber and Underwood; but at the breaking out of the Civil War, which quickly followed, the Inclosures were thrown down, Sir John Wintour was deprived of the Benefit of his Patent, and the whole Forest was journals 164.8, in Danger of being destroyed. Measures were, in-

49, and 50. deed, very soon adopted, and very steadily pursued.

ment that the Continuance of that Grant would be hurtful both to them and to the Public; and in Consequence of those Representations, a Commission jMar. »4Ch»»ii. issued from the Exchequer to Lord Herbert, Constable of the Castle of SaintBriavel’s, and Warden of the Forest, and others, to enquire into the State and Condition of the Forest; and upon a minute Survey then made, there were found 25,929 Oaks, and 4,204 Beeches, in all 30,233 Trees, containing 121,572 Cords of Wood, and 11,335 Tons of Ship Timber, fit for the Navy.

The Purpose for which this Commission was issued is well described by Sir Charles Harbord, in a Memorial or Representation, dated 28 December 1661, in which he fays, His Majesty hath been pleased to be present with my Lord Chancellor, and Lord Treasurer,

&ca. at the Hearing of this Business, and hath given

Order that a Commission shall be forthwith issued <c out of the Exchequer, to enquire into the State of <c the Forest; intending, upon the Return of the said <l Commission, to acquaint the Parliament with the “ true State of the Business; and to recommend it to ” their Wisdom to provide that the said Forest may be restored to his Majesty’s Demesne, and re- afforefted, and improved by Inclosures, for a future Supply of Wood, for a constant Support of the “ Iron Works there, producing the best Iron of “ Europe for many Years, and for the Produce of <c Timber for the Navy, and other Uses, in Time to “ come; which might be of great Use for Defence “ of this Nation, the old Trees there {landing being “ of above 300 Years Growth, and yet as good Timber as any in the World; and the Ground so apt " to produce, and so strong to nourish and preserve tc Timber, especially Oaks, that within an Hundred “ Years there may be sufficient Provision there found to maintain the Navy Royal forever.”

In the same Paper Sir Charles Harbord fays,tc Crom-" well in his Military Parliament resumed this Forest, and re-afforefted the said i8,oco Acres, and so preserved the same by the Forest Law, with all the Wood and Trees; and expelled near 400 Cabins of beggarly People, living upon the Waste and De-« strudtion of the Wood and Timber, and great Nurabers of Goats, Sheep, and Swine, that destroyed the «« young Wood and Soil thereof; all which (said he)

“ now begin to invade the same as formerly.”

Upon the Return to this Commission, a new Treaty 5 Mar> >4clu‘ was entered into with Sir John Wintour, in Consequence of which his former Patent was surrendered, and a Grant was made to Francis Fynchand Robert Clayton, at the Nomination of Sir John Wintour, of all the

above-mentioned Trees then growing in the Forest, except the 11,335 Tons of Ship Timber; together with the Use and Occupation of the King’s Iron Works, and Liberty to dig for and use Iron Ore and Cinders in the said Forest.

But this new Grant was rapidly followed with Consequences so destructive to the Forest, and detrimental to the Public, that Complaints were very soon 2 “ made

Various other Circumstances were stated to Parliament, by the Freeholders, Inhabitants, and Commoners, to shew the Neceflicy there was to put an immediate Stop to the Waste committed by Sir John tour 1 and their own Willingness to comply with whatever Should be thought best for the Service of the King, and of the Public; and, to the End that a Nursery might be made for a future Growth of Ship Timber in the Forest, they presented to the Committee the following Propofols.

“ amounting to 91; which Money was

expended in buying in Cannopp, &ea. of Maynard, Esquire, at Fifteen hundred Pounds; in “ setting up his Majesty’s Inciofures in the said Forest, of 8,400 Acres, with Gates, Stiles, &V’. and “ Tome Reparations of them; in employing a sworn “ Surveyor to admeasure them j in building Part of the Speech House; in divers Repairs at Briavel’s Castle; in the Charge of executing Two “ several Commissions, and other Services in the said “ Forest, as are contained in my Account for the “ said Money, passed before his Majesty’s Auditor, “ and controlled by the Lord Treasurer and Chan-u cetlor of the Exchequer feme Years since.” From this Answet it appears, that immediately after the passing of this A ft, the Colliers, who it is said now. pretend to have a Right to whatever Timber they find necessary for carrying on their Works in the Forest, without paying any Thing for it, then purchased it from the Crown.

The greatest Attention appears to have been given by the Ministers of State of that Time, by Sir Charles Harbord, Surveyor General of the Crown Lands, and by his Son and Successor Mr. William Harbord, to the Protection of the young Woods and the Inciofures; and it is chiefly in those Parts of the Forest which were then inclosed,. that the Timber with which the Dock Yards have been since furnished from this Forest has been felled, and in which any considerable Quantity of useful Timber is now to be found.

By the Advice of Sir Charles Harbord, the Forest was divided into Six Walks or Districts, and for each Walk a Keeper was appointed; and Six Lodges, in convenient Situations, were built, and 30 Acres of Land inclosed, and laid to each of the said Lodges, “ for the better Encouragement and enabling of the “ said Keepers to attend and watch over the said In- dofures within their several Walks, and to preferye “ the fame, and the young Springs of Wood and <c Trees thereon growing and to grow, from Time to “ Time, from Spoil and Harm.”

In the same Year several Gentlemen and Freeholders of the Parish of Newland, within the Forest, presented a Petition to the Treasury, in which they let forth, “ That there had been, and then was, great Store of Coal in several Men’s Lands in the said “ Parish, and in the adjoining Waste; that the Free “ Miners opened and dug Pits at their Pleasure, as well in his Majesty’s Waste, as in the Lands of “ private Men; and did then take considerable Quantities of his Mfijesty’s Wood, for Support of their “ Coal Works, as of Right appertaining to their “ Custom , that the Inhabitants of the adjacent Coun- try were supplied from thence with Coal for Firing, “ without which great Spoils would be inevitably committed in his Majesty’s Woods, and also for “ Lime Coal, without which there would be little " Tillage} that the Petitioners finding the Free Miners to abuse the Country, by lessening the former “ Measures of Coal, and to make Daily Consumption “ of his Majesty’s Woods, had, without the least *c Prospect of Gain, in Hopes of putting a Stop to those Mischiefs, and for the better Accommodation “ of themselves and Neighbours, agreed together to “ try for, and carry on, digging of Coal for both “ Uses, at a Place called Milk-wall, near to the Works of those Free Miners in his Majesty’s Waste, “ but not within’the Inciofures, for the Support of “ which they did not intend to claim or use any of "his Majesty's Woods, but to buy in the Country, although they had equal Pretence of Right, as well <« to Wood, as to the Liberty of digging j but that having been obliged to make the End of their Level for draining their Pits a little within the In-« closure of the Forest (without the least Prejudice “ thereto) they found that by the extreme Hardncft

3

“ of the Rock they could not, without excessive “ Charge, compass their Level, unless they might “ have Leave to turn into the Hill within the Inclosures, not exceeding 5 or 6 Acres at most (wherein there was no Wood) to carry through the said Level.

Praying, therefore, that for a Work of such pub- lie Advantage they might be allowed to alter that “ Part of the Inclosure, and to carry in the Ditch so *« much farther as to exclude the said 6 Acres, doing “ the same at their own Cost.”

This Petition was referred to Sir Charles Harbord, Idem, Lib. who in his Report thereon fays, “ That he had fe- riously considered the Petition, and perused the Act “ of Parliament, wherein it is expressly provided that “ the said Inciofures should remain in Severalty, in the “ actual Possession of the Crown, for ever, freed and “ discharged from all Right, Title, and Pretence'

“ whatsoever, and should be made and reputed a “ Nursery for Wood and Timber only; in Confideration whereof, and of the 7th Clause in the said Act, he could not advise any Warrant for breaking “ into the said Inciofures, without Mr. Attorney’s “ Opinion; and that the Claims, as to the Mines and Quarries, did not seem to be legal or justifiable in “ Point of Right, though they had been long permitted j and as to the Coal Works, there never was “ any such Claim to his Remembrance, much less to any Liberty of cutting his Majesty’s Woods for the Support thereof j and the same ought to be totally *c suppressed, and would be so by a good Officer, as “ Colonel Wade was in the Time of the Usurpation,

and that only by the Forest Law, and the ordinary Authority of a Justice of Peace; and that nothing “ was more necessary than the Preservation of the “ said Inciofures from Spoil and Harm, and the rest “ of the growing Wood upon the said Wastes without the Inclosures from unlawful Pretences and Destruftion, which might well be done by the Forest Law, if the same were duly executed, as it ought to be.”

And so strictly were the Provisions of the Act of Parliament with regard to this Forest then attended to, that though Sir Baynbam Throgmorton, who had been One of the Commissioners first appointed for carrying it into Execution, gave it as his Opinion that the agreeing to the Prayer of the Petition would tend to the Preservation of the Woods in the Forest, and the Convenience and Advantage of the Country, yet ic was rejected, for the Reasons suggested by Sir Charles Harbord.

In the Return to a Commission directed to the Marquis of Worcester, and others, with Instructions concerning the Forest, there is a very minute Description of the Inciofures which had been made in Consequence of the Act, and of the State in which they found the Fences and the Woods, both within and without the Inciofures. In representing the Injury done to the Forest, they say, “ That the Colliers and Miners have had Tome Birch and Orle delivered to them for the “ Support of their Pits, of the Value of £. 6, or “ L- 7* ar,d without paying for the same of late Years, <*, which they pretend an ancient Right to by Prefeription.

“ That they were of Opinion that the most likely Way to render the Forest Courts effectual, and to “ compel the Officers of Inheritance to be diligent «« and faithful in the Discharge of their several Duties, for the Preservation of the Forest, would be to “ procure a Justice Seat once a Year, for Six or Seven “ Years, to be held in the Long Vacation, within the “ said Forest, or not remote from it; which might be “ so done at a small Charge, by a Deputation front the "Lord Chief Justice in Eyre, and by Adjournment thereof from Time to Time.

the Forest, and never lived out of it; and that they had taken Care to demolish the said Cabins, and the Inclosures about them; but that it would require some little longer Time for the effectual Removal and legal Settlement of them in other Places: They mention several Parts of the Inclosures in which the

Swine would be prevented by the Inclosure from getting the Acorns and Beech Mali: And in Opposition to this we find another Petition from a Number of poor Inhabitants employed in the Service of the Iron Manufacturers, praying that the Plan of Inclosure might be persisted in, for the Increase of Underwood,

his Advice to the Attorney General, Sir Simon Bar-court, who gave it as his Opinion, t( That no Claim or “ Right of Common of Eftovers, Herbage, or Pannage, could prevent the inclosing, keeping in Se-ft veralty, or improving, as her Majesty should direst, the 11,000 Acres mentioned in the Act, and prelerving the same inclosed in Severalty for ever, as a Nursery of Wood and Timber only.”

These Petitions afford a strong Proof, even in the History of this Forest (in which the Rights of all Par-

In 1705, Edward Wilcox, Esquire, Surveyor General of the Woods, represented, in a Memorial to the Treasury, that he had carefully surveyed the Woods in the Forest of Dean, and found them very full of young Trees, Two-third Parts whereof were Beech, which overtopped the Oaks, and'would prevent them

from evergrowing up to be Ship Timber, so as to an- Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer, into which fwer the Purposes intended by the Act of Parliament; the Answers to most of the Commissions relative to Set Appendix, N*t. and setting forth, that 11,000 Acres had formerly been ' this Forest were returned, his Authority on this Sub-inclosed; and that if the same Should be divided into jest is unquestionable.

Sixteen Parts, and One Sixteenth Part, being near 700 It is probable that the Forest was about that Time Acres, should be cut down each Year, and inclosed, in its best State; for though the Forest Courts had leaving Standards of Oak or Beech, each Cutting not been so regularly held as before the Resolution, would yield £.3,500, and Rpom would be given for yet the greatest Attention had been given by the Mi-the Standards to grow and come to Perfection. To nifters, Surveyors General, and inferior Servants of this Proposal Lord Godolphin consented, and granted a Warrant for carrying it into Execution.

Against this Proposal a Petition was presented to the

the Crown. Different Commissioners had been font by the Treasury to view the Forest, who had made the most minute Returns; and as the Cottages had been pulled down,\it is probable that every Encroachment was re-claimed: But here all Care of the Forest ting forth, that the inclosing and incoppicing, accord- appears to have ceased; and the Account which we ing to the Plan suggested by Mr. Wilcox, would be arc to give in the next Part of this Report, will be

PART IP.

In the Books or the Surveyor General of the Crown Lands, which, during the preceding Century, furnish numerous Documents, and much useful Information, the Forest of Dean is hardly ever mentioned from that Time to the present; and the Books of the Auditor, in which numerous Commissions of Enquiry, with the Returns to them, and other Papers of Consequence relative to Dean Forest, prior to that Period, were en-

rolled or entered, contain only Warrants for felling Timber for the Navy, or for Sale; the Produce of which is for the most Part directed to be applied towards the repairing of Lodges, Roads, or Fences, or the Payment of Salaries to Officers, or Free Gifts from the Crown.

In one of those Warrants, in the Year 1735, ‘c's observed, “ That whereas it has been represented by *

“ the Surveyor General, that a Practice has prevailed AudW^ofe*

“ among the Colliers of boring large Holes in Trees,

“ that they may become dotard and decayed, and as “ such may be delivered to them for the Use of their “ Collieries; in order to prevent such pernicious and u destructive Practices, Directions are given that such bored Trees as appear to be dead and spoiled shall be felled, taking Care that none be cut down that may be of Use to the NavyBut not a Word is

of the Forest Laws. During the 17th Century, the Landed Property of the Crown still contributed considerably towards the Support of Government; and was, in every Reign, the great Resource for gratifying the Favourites of the Monarch, or rewarding those who had distinguished themselves in the Service of the Public. As Occasions of this Kind often occurred, and the Crown had then the uncontrouled Power of Alienation, and as Resumptions were become less common, and less popular, by far the greatest Part of the Forests and Landed Estates of the Crown were, in that Period, fold, or granted away. The Attention then given by the Servants of the Crown to this Part of the public Property, was perhaps owing to the Circumftance of its affording the readied Means of Supply; and it is one Consequence of that Attention, that though the Books and Papers formerly kept in the Office of the Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests have not been regularly preserved in that Office, we have elsewhere found numerous Documents to assist us in tracing the Management of what was then under the Charge of that Department.

Sir Julius Cafar, Chancellor of the Exchequer to James the I*, left many Books and detached Writings, relative to the State of the Landed Property of the Crown, with his Plans of Management: Great Num- said about endeavouring to discover the Offenders, bers of Papers and Letters on the same Subject were that they might be punished, or recommending more written by Manwtod, one of the Judges in that Reign, Attention and Care to the Officers of the Forest. Our and Author of the Treatise on the Forest Laws; by chief Reason for stating this last Circumstance so fully Nor den, a Surveyor of great Eminence; by Taverner, is, because it not only shews the flight Attention then Trefwell, and Agar, Surveyors GeneraTof the Woods; paid by Government to this Subject, when it could by Sir Charles Harhord, and Mr. William Harbord, his not be altogether avoided, but because, in such a

Son, Surveyors General of the Crown Lands; and by some who held the First Offices in Administration. Many of these are still preserved, and are now, or authentic Copies of them, in our Possession; and there are extant, in the Books of the Auditor and Surveyor General of the Crown Lands, and in other Offices, numerous Commissions of Enquiry into the State of the Woods and Forests during that Period, with the Returns to those Commissions; all which are so many

Want of Documents for tracing the first Beginnings and Progrefsof the Abuses, since carried to so great.a Height, it is necessary to mark, that from this Paper it appears that the Colliers, who now frequently obtain from the Keepers the best Trees in the Forest, did not at that Time think themselves entitled to have any that were not dotard and decayed.

The first Representation that we have found of any Thing like the present Abuses, is in a Memorial of

Proofs of the Attention then given to these Subjects Christopher Bond, Esq; Conservator and Supervisor of by the Servants of the Crown. —

But when the Alarm occasioned by the extensive Grants made towards the Close of that Century had x Anne, Ch»p.>. produced the Act of 1701, by which the Crown was restrained from alienating any Part of its Landed Property, the Attention given to that Subject by Ministers very soon ceased 5 and though it is probably owing to that Act of Parliament that the Forests and Lands which still belong to the Crown have been preserved, yet that Restriction certainly does not appear to have had any good Effect upon the Care and Management of what was retained; and we have met with very little relative to the Forest which is the immediate Object of Consideration, either in the Books of

the Forest of Dean, to the Treasury, in 1736, stating. That after the Act aoth Charles II. 11,000 Acres had been inclosed; that the Officers were duly elected, Forest Courts held, and Offenders prosecuted and punished, by which Means were raised a great Quantity of Timber Trees; but that within the last Thirty Years those Elections had been negr lested, the Courts discontinued, and Offenders left unpunished; the Officers of Inheritance, and others, were grown remiss and negligent; so that a few In-dofures, and those of a few Acres only, of the said 11,000 Acres, were kept up, and these not carefully repaired; a great Number of Cottages were erected upon the Borders of the Forest, the Inhabitants 8 “ whereof

*' whereof lived by Rapine and Theft* that there were besides many other Offences committed, such *f as intercommoning of Foreigners, Surcharges of “ Commoners, Tref'paiTes in the Fence Month and ct Winter Haining, and in the Inclosures; keeping Hogs, Sheep, Goats, and Geese, being uncommon- able Animals, in the Forest; cutting and burning “ the Nether Vert, Furze, and Fern; gathering and of taking away the Crabs, Acorns, and Malt* and “ other Purprcfhires and Offences; carrying away “ such Timber Trees as were covertly cut down in “ the N ight Time; by which Practices several Hundred fine Oaks were Yearly destroyed, and the Growth of others prevented; and that it was feared “ that some of the inferior Officers of the Forest, find- ing Offenders to go on with Impunity, were not “ only grown negligent, but also connived at, if not r‘ partook, in the Spoil daily committed; and recoinmending that there Should be a new Law to explain “ that of Charles II, to enforce Officers to do their “ Duty; and that the Forest Laws, though formerly “ odious to the People, by Reason of the unlimited “ Power and arbitrary Proceedings of former Chief Justices in Eyre, would cease to be so for the fu-ft tore, provided all former Offences Should be remit-f ted, and a Method found out for tfying by a Jury,

“ and convicting before the Verderors at their Swanimote Court, and a Power lodged in the Verderors “ to fine, under a certain Sum, all Offenders save *c such as Should be punishable by the Statute then “ proposed) without Appeal, as no Offences come *f under the Cognizance of the Forest Courts, by the '* Atft of the 10th Charles II. but what are committed “ in the Wades of the said Forest.”

This was referred to the Surveyor General of the Woods, who was directed to attend the Attorney and Solicitor General, Sir John hVilles and Sir Dudley Ryder, to take their Opinion thereon; and their Opinion was, i( that the Offences were chiefly owing to the Neglect of platting the Stat. icth Charles II. in Execution; and they recommended therefore, that the “ several vacant Offices of the Forest Should be filled “ up, that the Forest Courts Should be regularly held)

,{ and that the Officers Should be strictly enjoined to <c do their Duty, to fee what Effect that Method would “ have before trying a new Law But we have met with no Proof that any Thing was done in Consequence of this Opinion.

About the Year 1758, a Proposal was made by John Pitt, Esquire, then Surveyor General of the Woods, for inclosing 2,000 Acres in Dean which was

agreed to by the Treatury, and ordered accordingly.

In 1763, Mr. Pitt was removed from that Office, and Sir Edmund Thomas appointed to succeed him. In 1767, Mr. Pitt was re-appointed Surveyor General; and in 1770, he represented to the Treasury, that going lately into Dean Forest, he found that great Spoil had been committed there, and great Quantities of Wood and Timber cut by Order of Sir Edmund Thomas, the late Surveyor General, without Warrant, amounting in Value to ft. 3,135.

In 1771, Mr. Pitt presented a Memorial to the Treasury, proposing another Inclosure of 2,000 Acres in this Forest, the Expence of which was estimated to Woods, &c. amount to ft.2,077. 18 10 and a Warrant was

AutUtoi’s'giftce'n illucd for authorizing him to inclose that Quantity, and

e’ to raise the Money by Wood Sales in the Forest.

In the same Year, 1771, a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to consider how His Ma- jesty’s Navy might be better supplied with Timber,

Commons Reports, and to report their Opinion thereon. That Commit-. a I-Pa. 15. tcc made a very minute Report of the Information which they had received but, at their Request, that Part of the Order which required that they Should re-' port an Opinion, was discharged; and though they

the fulleft Proofs of the Scarcity and Decrease Of Naval Timber, it does not appear that any Thing wps done in Consequence of it, for promoting the Objerir for which the Committee was appointed. In the Appendix to that Report, N° 16, a summary View is gitfen of the Judgment of the Dealers in the different Counties, respecting the proportionate Decrease of Oak Timber: We have thought it right to inlert that Paper in our Appendix, in Confirmation of the Reports Appendix, N»jii of our Surveyors, and the Opinion we have ventured to give on the Subject of the general Decrease of Timber.

It appears from the Examination of Mr. Surveyor General Pitt, before that Committee, that a Survey had been made of the Timber in this Forest in 1764; when it was computed that there were 27,302 Loads fit for the Navy, 16,851 Loads of about 60 Years Growth, and 20,066 Loads dotard and decaying; and

in pursuance of an Order of the House of Com- j<wnai«,

mens, a fresh Survey of the Timber was made in 1783, *oJunei7»i#

in the Return to which Order it is stated, that there

were then in this Forest 90,382 Oak Trees, computed

to contain 95,043 Loads; and 17,982 Beech Trees,

computed to contain 16,492 Loads, both of Square

Measure.

Various Representations were made to the Treasury, by the same Surveyor General, between the Years 1771 and 1786, relative to Abuses and Depredations committed in this Forest by the Miners and Colliers,

Timber Stealers, and others; and a Variety of Expedients were proposed by him for preventing them, by introducing Checks on the Delivery of Timber to the Miners, and establishing Rewards to be paid on the Discovery and Conviction of Offenders: But the little Success which followed those well-intended Measures, shews how useless it is to attempt an Improvement of this Forest, while the resident Officers derive Advantages from the Continuance of the Abuses. In Spite Appendix, H»t*. of the Endeavours of the Surveyor General, the Quantity of Timber delivered to the Miners has encreased every Year; and the Inclosures which were made on his Recommendation, were very soon buffered, by those who had the Charge of them, to go to Ruin.

Having stated the Substance of all the Proceedings which we have met with, so far as appeared to us to be necessary for enabling the Legislature to judge of the Attention given to this Forest during the last Century, and the beneficial Effects which resulted from it, as well as of the destructive Consequences which ensued from the subsequent Neglect; we shall now state the Course of proceeding on Falls of Timber for the Navy, and also on Wood Sales, and on the Execution of Works done in the Forest.

When Timber is wanted from the Forests for the Dock Yards, the Commissioners of the Navy order their Purveyors to esquire from what Forest such Timber can be supplied; the Return of the Purveyor is transmitted by the Navy Board to the Treasury, with a Request that a certain Quantity may be felled for their. Use; the Matter is then referred from the Treasury to the Surveyor General of the Woods; and if the Report of the Surveyor General recommends the Fall proposed, a Warrant is issued under His Majesty’s Sign Manual, and countersigned by the Lords of the Treasury, directing the Timber to be felled and delivered accordingly: Or, when it appears to the Surveyor General of the Woods, that Timber may be spared from any Forest, fit for the Navy, he represents the Matter to the Treasury, or to the Navy Board; and if there be Occasion for the Timber, a Warrant is issued in like Manner to the Surveyor General, authorizing the Fall proposed: And the Value of all the Timber supplied to the Navy from the Forests is paid

for in Navy Bills to the Surveyor General, at a stated Price of ft. 1. 18 s. per Ton or Load.

the Building or Reparation of Lodges, the making or repairing Fences or Roads, or for any other Purpose,-a Petition or Memorial is presented to the Treasury, by some Officer of the Forest'where the Work is required to be done; or the Matter is I'epresented to the Treasury by the Surveyor General. In the former Cafe, the Petition or Memorial is referred from the Treasury to the Surveyor General, who returns it with his Report, and an Estimate of the Expence of the Work, and suggesting out of what Fund it may be defrayed; and limilar Directions are given to estimate and report, if the Proposal comes from the Surveyor General himself, in case an Estimate has not been sent in the first Instance. A Warrant from the Treasury is then issued to the same Surveyor General to execute the Work, if it be approved of; and to cut or fell so much Timber or Wood as will raise the Sum required, if the Expence is to be defrayed in that Manner — or Warrants are issued for paying the same out of the Rents or Fines arising from the Land Revenue. The Surveyor General fends the Warrants for performing the Work and felling the Timber, to be executed by his Deputy in the Forest, under whose Direction the previous Estimates are usually made; and those Warrants are entered in the Office of the Auditor to whom the Accounts of the Surveyor General are rendered. A separate Account is made up for each Warrant; and the Surveyor General charges himself, in his Accounts of Timber felled for the Navy, and delivered to the Dock Yards, with the Money which he receives for the Navy Bills issued to him for the Value of that Timber, after felling the Navy Bills at the Current Price, and with the Money arising by Sale of the Lops, Tops, and Bark; and in his Accounts for the Execution of any Work done by Warrant, he charges himself with the Money received for the Timber, Lops, Tops, and Bark fold, or imprefted to him from Rents or Fines out of the Land Revenue, and he takes Credit for what he has expended in the Execution of the Works directed to be performed; and those Accounts are examined and stated by the Auditor, in whose Office they finally remain, after having been declared before the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

This Syltem has an Appearance of Regularity and Order; but though it may have the Eflect of keeping the Public Accounts, in those Particulars, distinct, and free from Confusion, there is nothing in the System that tends in any Degree to prevent or correct the Abuses that exist.

In the whole Course of the Business which has been described, the ancient Officers of the F’oreft are never once called upon to report an Opinion, or to act in any Manner, until the Warrant comes to the Deputy Surveyor to be executed, when it is his Duty to call upon Two of the Verderors, or Two Justices of the Peace, to fee such a Number of Trees marked to be felled as may contain by Computation as much as is required by the Warrant; but it cannot be expected that the Deputy Surveyor will be anxious for their Attendance, which could only serve as a Check on his own Proceedings, and in some Degree prevent those undue Advantages which have for many Years been too generally taken in the Execution of all Business done in the Forests.

Most of the ancient Forest Offices are become merely nominal, and are bellowed rather as Marks of Favour and Distinction, on Gentlemen of Considera-' tien in the Neighbourhood of the Forests, than as Appointments of real Life or Responsibility; and the Surveyor General and his Deputies, instead of coming in Aid of the ancient System of Management, have ingrofttd the Whole, and acquired the foie and almost uncontrolled Management of this valuable and important Part of the Public Property.

And not only is this uncontrouled Power placed in

the Surveyor General and his Deputies while they continue in Office, but no Record remains of their Proceedings when they go out, nor of the System of Management which they had pursued: Every one carries with him all the Books and Papers concerning his Official Transactions, as his private Property; and each new Surveyor begins without Direction or Pre- ,

cedent, and adopts such new Plan as suits his Fancy or Convenience.

In the Course of our Enquiry we have seen Proof, that in former Times there were in that Office many and voluminous Books and Papers, probably well worthy of being preserved, and which, at the Death or Removal of one Surveyor, were delivered over to his Successor. By what Means those Books and Papers were loft, or why the Practice of preserving and delivering over the Official Documents (which is still invariably observed in the Office of Surveyor General of the Crown Lands) ceased in that of Surveyor General of the Woods, we have not been able to discover: It is certainly much to be regretted that it ever was discontinued; for, from the great Extent of the Forests, and the confided Mixture of Property in them; from the numerous Claims of the neighbouring Inhabitants, and the Shares of the Produce un-wifely granted by the Crown, as Perquisites to hereditary as well as temporary Officers; there is no Part of the public Property so liable to Waste, Depredation, and Encroachment, or in which all the Checks and Information of Books accurately kept, and Papers or Records carefully preserved, could possibly be more useful.

We have given in the Appendix Two Examples of Appendix, n#xi,i2,

the Delivery of Official Books and Papers to Surveyors *

General of the Woods, by the Representatives of their Predecessors, with a List of all the Surveyors General since the Date of those Examples, in Hopes that if this Report Should come into the Flands of any of their Defendants, who may still have preserved those Books and Papers which once belonged to the Office, they may be influenced by the same Motives which induced Mr. Merton Pitt to fend for our Perusal the Books and Papers left by his late Father, which appear to have been collected by him with great Industry, and at no inconsiderable Expence to himself, and from which we have derived much useful Information.

We shall in the next Place give a List of the Officers of the Forest of Dean, and of the Fees, Perquisites, and Advantages which they receive; pointing out, as distinctly as we can, the Effect which those Fees, Perquisites, and Advantages, have on the Forest itself.

The present Officers of Dean Forest, according to a List made up at a Court of Swanimote, held at the Speech House in that Forest, on the 25th September 1787, and sent to us by Mr, John Mathews, Steward of that Court, and inserted in the Appendix, are — A Appendix, N* 14* Lord Warden — Six Deputy Wardens — Four Verderors — a Steward of the Swanimote Court — Nine Fo-refters in Fee, of whom One is Chief Forester and

Bow-bearer — Nine Woodwards — Regarders, there ought to be Twelve in every Forest, but at present there is not One in this Forest — Six Keepers.

There are no other Officers mentioned in the Lift received from Mr. Mathews-, and these are all who can properly be calleft Forest Officers.

But besides these there are — The Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests, whose Jurisdiction extends to all the Forests; with a Deputy resident in Londony and an itinerant Deputy — A Deputy Surveyor for this Forest, resident in it — A Conservator — A Gaveller — and a Watchman.

The Office of Lord Warden of the Forest of Dean, and Constable of the Castle of Saint BriaveVs within that Forest, is held by Frederick Jlugujius Earl of 5 . Berkeley,

The Lord Warden being Judge of the Court called The Mine Law Court, formerly held in this for

than efficient; and as the Officers receive no Salaries or other Perqui fires,except Fee Deer, it is unnecessary in this Place to say any Thing concerning them, mor£ than to refer to their AnAvers to our Enquiries, which are inferred in the Appendix.

The whole Management of the in every

ticular, except the Mines and Coal, has for many Years been in the Hands of the Surveyor General, his Deputies, and the Six Under Keepers; we shall therefore be more particular in dating the Fees, Perquix fires, or Emoluments taken by them: But the Surveyor General of the Woods and Forests, having a general Superintendance and of all the Fo-

(reds. Parks, and Chaces belonging to the Crown, and the Advantages of his Office being derived from the Works done, and the Woods and Timber cut or disposed of in each of them, and those Advantages, according to our Information, varying in each Pored, we Should be liable to Error in attempting to date the

Amount of the Profits derived by that Officer from each Forcll separately; more especially as it frequently happens that the Produce of the Timber or Wood fold from One Fored is expended on another. We propose, therefore, in our Reports on the different Forests, to describe the Nature of the Emoluments

The Six Keepers have each a Salary of 22 per Appendix, N° 24.

To render the Terms Top and Lop, Cordwood, Offal neighbouring great Cyder Country, or for the Use of

Wood, and Kibbles, intelligible to those who may not be accustomed to them, it may be proper to explain the Signification they bear in the preceding Account of the Perquisites of the Deputy Surveyor and Keepers.

The Top is that Part of the Stem or Body of the Tree, dripped of the Branches, which in Navy Timber is cut off by Direction of the Purveyor, as unfit for Naval Use; and in stolen Timber, that Part which the Thief either voluntarily leaves behind him, or has not an Opportunity of conveying aWay. It frequently happens that these Tops contain Timber fit for Carpenters or Coopers Uses, and sometimes Knees and crooked Timbers fit for small Vessels, but very rarely

Wheelwrights, the stolen Trees are usually cut in Pieces of suitable Length for those Purposes, and of convenient Weight for being conveyed away, which Pieces are called Kibbles.

The Conservator is an Officer whose Duty, by his Appendix, n* *t. own Account, is to take Care of the Lands inclosed in pursuance of the Act of 20th Charles II. and of the Woods and Underwoods there growing. The Salary of this Officer is £. 100 per Annum, which is issued from the Exchequer, through the Hands of the Lord Warden, as before mentioned, and is reduced by Fees and Taxes to £. 64. 16 j. Whacever may have been the original Purpose of this Appointment, or the Du y performed on the First Institution of it, we do not

for King’s Ships: When they are unfit for any of these find that any Advantage to the Forest has arisen from

Uses they are cut into Cordwood.

Cordwood consists of the Lop, or Boughs and Branches of Trees, cut into Pieces a little above Two Feet in Length, and generally about the Thickness of a Man’s Arm. Where the Branches happen to exceed that Thickness, they are cleft into Two or more Pieces, to reduce them to that Size, in order to be made into Charcoal. A Cord of Wood is a Pile of

Ft. In.

these Pieces, of the exact Dimensions of 8 8 long.

Ft. In. F;. In. *

4 4 high, and 2 2 thick, which last is the Length of each Piece. The common Fuel of the Country being Coal got from the Forest, the Whole of this Cordwood is made into Charcoal in the Forest, for the Ule of the Iron furnaces, Forges, and Manufactories, of which there are many in the Neighbourhood.

Lop, Crop, and Offal Wood, mean the same Thing, viz*, the Boughs and Branches of Trees, and are all made into Cordwood 5 but the Cordwood of Naval Timber is made from the whole Lops or Branches of Navy Trees; and that arising from Miners, and stolen Timber, only from the Boughs and Branches left by the Colliers or Timber Stealers; and the Wood so left is termed Offal Wood.

Mod of the Timber stolen from the Forest being intended cither for making Casks for supplying the

it of late Years. When any new Inclosures have been made, additional Salaries have been paid to the Keepers or others, to take Care of them. In the Course of Twenty-six Years no less a Sum than ^.723. 10 s.has been expended in this Manner, of Appendix, N’J4< which £.688. ior. has been paid to the Keepers, in

Addition to their ordinary Salaries, and yet the Fences of most of the Modern Inclosures were destroyed in a very Ihort Time after they were made; and the Materials differed to be carried away publicly by the Appendix, N' 39. Country People in Carts and Waggons.

The Duty of the Gaveller, or, as he is called in his Appendix, N* *$. Patent, “ Keeper of the Gawles within the Forest of “ Dean," is to preserve the Rights of the Crown in the Mines within the Forest, and to collect the King’s Share of the Iron Ore and Coal, or the Compofirions paid by the Miners or Colliers in lieu of that Share.

From the Extracts of Grants and other Documents stated in the former Part of this Report, we trust it will appear that the Crown has the l'ole Property of the Mines. The Gaveller Hates the Crown’s Share of the Produce to be One Fifth Part of the Ore and Coal, or a Right to put a Sixth Man into every Pit or Work, and to receive a proportionable Share of the Produce, free from all F.xpence; and that these Dues were formerly taken in Kind, but that for many Years past the Colliers have paid an Annual Relit, or Compofuion x in

The next Article in Amount is the Expence of Inclosures, on which, during the same Time, about

Coal raised in the Forest, according to that Weekly Quantity, is about £. 17,706 per Annum. The Timber of all Kinds delivered to the Miners for their Works, has of late Years been from 1,000 to 1,500 Loads Annually; of which the Deputy Surveyor states

1,000 Loads to have been Oak Timber, and One £.4,730. has been laid out. With this Mo- £.4,7:0.

The Place of Watchman of the Forest was instituted a few Years since, on the Recommendation of the late Surveyor General, Mr. Pitt. His Annual Salary is £. 10, with a Dwelling House, and a small Quantity

ney it appears, from what has been stated, that about 4,000 Acres have been inclosed; but of all those Inclosures there remain now only Three, containing 323 Acres, of which the Fences are in tolerable Repair. It appears, by the Evidence of the same Deputy, that on all those Works which are paid for by the Sale of Wood or Timber, the Surveyor General has Three different Poundages, amounting together to 15 per Cent. There are many Objections to the Payment of

of Land; and his Perquisites arise from the Fines and any Officer by a Poundage; but in no Instance what-

Rewards on Conviction of Timber Stealers, of which he receives a Share in common with others concerned with him in detecting and convicting Offenders.

The Accbunts of the late Surveyor General of the Woods not being all passed before the Auditor, we have it not yet in our Power to state the Application of the Whole of the Money which has arisen from the Produce of this Forest. We are however enabled to state, from the Accounts which have been passed or delivered into the Auditor’s Office, that the Amount of the Wood Sales in this Forest, from the Commencement of Flis Majesty’s Reign to the End of the Year 1786, has been£.27,715. js. ;and the Aggregate of the Disbursements stated in the Accounts of Wood Sales is £.28,037. 15J. So that the Surveyor General appears to be in Surplus on these Accounts the Sum of £.322. in That the

Quantity of Timber supplied from this Forest to the Dock Yards, during the same Period, has been 671 Loads': That the Sums received for that Timber, and for the Cordwood and Bark arising from it, have amounted to £.41,339. or.; and the Disbursements charged in the Accounts of the Naval Timber to £.13,619. 135.7//.: The general Balance on these Two Accounts is therefore £. 27,396. 155. 5 But that Balance must not be considered as a clear Sum to be paid into the Exchequer; we know, from the Information of the same Surveyor General, that the Whole is expended in this, or some other Forest or Park. His Expressions, in a Letter dated 5th Fe-Iruary 1783, to Mefirs. Call and who were

then engaged in an Enquiry concerning the Forests, are, <c There has not any Revenue arisen from the King’s Woods and Forests, the Repairs and Works ft in several Forests and Parks having always amounted “ to so large a Sum as to require a Supply of Money “ from His Majesty’s Land Revenue.” And on Re-

ever can this Mode of Payment be more obvioufiy injudicious and objeftionable, than in that of the Surveyor of the Woods, to whom every Proposal for any Work to be done in the Parks and Forests is referred, as well as the Estimate of the Expence attending it, and to whom the Execution of those Works, upon the Estimates so formed, is afterwards solely intrusted.

But the Gratuities and Perquisites which have been taken by the Deputy Surveyor re/ident.in the Forest, and the Advantages which, in Consequence of those Gratuities, he has suffered others to take, have been far more destructive in their Effects. We have already enumerated such of them as are taken openly, and are avowed to be Perquisites of Office; we shall now mention some other Advantages enjoyed by that Officer. The present Deputy Surveyor states, “ That Appendix, N° *j. “ after having been Two Years in Office, he made an Alteration in the Measurement of Timber, very “ much for the Advantage of the Public, and by “ which a great Quantity was Annually saved.”

What he fays on this Subject, in his Examination on Oath, is more fully explained in the Answer which he returned to our First Enquiries concerning his Emoluments: — “ On my first coming into Office (he fays)

“ I adopted the Plan of my Predecessor in the Sale of “ Timber, that is, I received such Fees or Presents “ as the several Purchasers thought proper to give “ me; and consequently allowed them, in Measurement of Timber or Bark, sufficient to compensate them for their Favours; in the Measurement of “ Naval Timber I like wife received considerable Prcfents. — The present Regulations in the Delivery of “ the Naval Timber now save to the Crown at least “ One thousand Loads Annually. I stated to Mr.

Pitt, on my first settling my Accounts, after being " about Two Years in Office, every Abuse in my Department; since which Time I have never re-

ference to the Auditor, and the Surveyor General of “ ceived any Fee or Present whatever for the Sale

The Quantity of Timber fold in the Forest is about equal to, or indeed rather exceeds, that which, in the same Period, has been furnished to the Dock Yards; and as there was the same Temptation, and the same Opportunity if the same Advantages were taken or 1 n G . allowed

to point out the Advantages which the different Officers of the Forest derive from this Waste of Timber, and to explain the Division made between them and the Colliers and Miners of the Trees cut for this Pur-, pose. The Colliers and Miners themselves admit that the Consent of the Officer of the Crown, called the Gaveller, is necessary, before they can break the King’s Soil, in his Demesne Lands, or begin to dig for Ore or Coal, where they are the Property of the Crown. When, therefore, a Collier or Miner proposes to open a new Work in the Forest, he applies to the Gaveller for his Permission; for which, as we have before observed, he pays a Fee of 5 s. and he enters, at the same Time, into an Agreement with the Gaveller, to pay a certain Sum Annually, in Proportion to the Number of Men he is to employ in such Works, as a Composition for the Share of the Coal or Ore due to the Crown, which was formerly taken in Kind. Having paid the Gaveller his Fee, made an Agreement for the Annual Composition, and obtained his Permission to begin the Work, he applies to the Keeper of the Walk, and represents to him the Occasion he has for Timber for the Work he proposes to carry on; which the Keeper certifies to the Clerk of . the Swanimotc Court; and upon receiving that Certificate, with a Fee of One Shilling, the Clerk gives a Warrant to the Collier for delivering the Timber required, but without specifying any Quantity or Number of Trees: This Warrant the Collier carries back to the Keeper, who, with the Deputy Surveyor, or his Agent, mark such Trees as they think proper for the Purpose. — No Verderor or Justice of the Peace ever attends on such Occasions j and even the Ap-earance of their viewing the Trees is not thought to e necessary. The Keeper receives a Fee of 1 s. on every Warrant j and the Trees being then cut down arc divided in the following MannerThe Miner has the Body of the Tree; the Deputy Surveyor One Half of the Cordwood, and or 6d. for every Tree felled { The Keeper gets the other Half of the Cord-wood, together with the Bark; and if the Collier be detected in misapplying the Timber, the Keeper seizes it for his own Benefit. In sinking a Pit, Oak Timber is deemed necessary; for other Uses within the Pits it is admitted that other Wood may answerj bur, as the Bark is now one of the Perquisites of the Keeper, and as the Bark of no Tree, except the Oak, is of any Value for Sale, it is not surprizing that though formerly only a few Beech or Orle Trees were given to the Colliers and Miners, they now get chiefly Oak, especially in the Spring and Summer , and, as the Deputy Surveyor and Keepers receive so great a Share of the Value of the Tree, it cannot be Matter of Wonder that the Colliers are most liberally supplied.

It appears from the Evidence of several of those who have been examined, that at least 1,000 Loads of Oak Timber have been, One Year with another, delivered to the Colliers j and as the Country improves, and the Demand for Coal increases, unless the System of Management shall be altered in this Particular, and a Stop put to this profuse Disposition of the Timber, at present left to the Direction of those who derive a Profit from it in Proportion to the Waste, the Property of the Coal and Ore, inltead of producing a Revenue, as it formerly did, and ought now to do, will in a very few Years occasion the Canfumption of all the remaining Timber, and compleat the Destruction of the Forest.

The Timber stolen in the Forest has been another Source of considerable Emolument to the Officers, which wc shall also endeavour to explain: The Wood Stealer generally fells the Tree in the Night Time, cuts off the Top, Boughs, and Branches, which being of little Value to him, are always left; he then, if not disturbed, divides the Body of the Tree into Pieces of convenient Weight for being conveyed away, and of

suitable Length for the Use of Coopers or Wheelwrights, which Pieces are there called Kibbles.

Thefts of Timber in this Forest became so frequent, and the Thieves £t length so desperate and daring, according to the Representation of the Deputy Surveyor, as to bid Defiance to him and the other refid- ' ing Officers; and in the Years 1779, 1780, 81, and 85, the Circumstances were represented to the Trea- Appendix, N* 37. fury by the late Surveyor General, and Authority was given to him to offer different Rewards for the Detection of Offenders, from £. 5 to £. 50 each, to be paid on Conviction. Many such Premiums or Rewards have been paid to the Keepers, and other Officers of the Forest, who have always been the Disco- . verers of the Wood Stealers; and various Fines have been imposed and levied on the Offenders, which have also been given to the Informers. In this Situation a very distinct Arrangement has been made among the Officers for the Distribution of the Advantages arising from this Source:

ift. The Top of the Tree, with the Boughs and Branches, being always left behind, are thus divided: The Deputy Surveyor takes the Top, with One Half of the Cordwood; the Keepers take the other Half of the Cordwood, and the Bark.

idly. If the Tree be found -whole, after it is cut down, the Body of it becomes the Perquisite of the Deputy Surveyor.

3dly. If it be found cut into Kibbles, it becomes in that State the Perquisite of the Keepers; and in both these Cafes the Top, Cordwood, and Bark, arc distributed as before.

4thly. The Rewards for detecting and convicting Offenders, which are paid by the Deputy Surveyor out of Wood Sales, and also the Fines imposed by the Justices, are given to the Informers, who are always the Resident Officers of the Forest, and their Assistants. The Amount of the Rewards paid since the Appendix, n» 34-Year 1780, together with the Expences of Profecu-tien, is £. 647. 15/. 7 d.We have not been able to obtain a compleat Account of the Fines levied on Offenders, but those which we have an Account of amount to £. 57a. os. 6d. for Seven Years, ending Appendix, n» 3*. at Michaelmas 1787.

Wc have already stated the Expence of the Roads, during Twenty-six Years, from 1761 to 1786, to have been about £.11,631. js. \od.-, and the System of £.11,631. 3. 10. Management adopted for this important Part of the Expenditure will be belt explained by a Reference to the Deputy’s Examination; in which he fays, “ That Appendix, n»34. “ the Roads which have been made and repaired in “ the Forest since his Appointment, have, in general,

“ been done by Persons immediately employed by himself, an Estimate having been first made by Two “ Persons appointed by him to measure and value the tc Works intended to be done; which, if approved of “ by the Surveyor General, the Work was then undertaken by him (the Deputy) at the Rate or Price “ fixed on by such Two Persons j and the Works,

“ when compleated, were surveyed by Two Justices “ of the Peace, who certified the same to be executed “ agreeable to the Contract.”

In this System it is obvious that there is nothing which bears even the Appearance of any Check on the Conduct of the Deputy Surveyor, excepting the View or Survey of the Two Justices of the Peace, who certify only, " that the Work is executed agreeable to “ the Contract,” but to whom no Reference is made as to the Reasonableness of the Terms. — A striking Example of the Advantages which the Officers redding in the Forest have in the Execution of such Works appears from the Information of Charles Edwin, Esquire, before mentioned, who having been called upon, as a Justice of Peace, to view some Roads which had bc?n made in the Surveyorship of

the

$7<S

the late Sir Edmund Thomas, and which, in the usual Form, he certified to be executed agreeable to the Appendix, N° n. Contract, he fays, “ That having enquired of the “ Labourers working on the Road what Price they were allowed, they informed him, that they were “ paid after the Rate of 18 Yard; and know-l ing that jj. per Yard was charged to Government “ for the same Works, he quettioned Mr. Jo/efh “ Mabbot, the then Deputy Surveyor, who admitted the Fad.”

On the Subject of the Inclosures in the Forest, the Deputy Surveyor states, in his Examination, that “ he “ hath also made and repaired the Fences in the Fo- rest, and employed Labourers, either by Contract <c or Day Work, in those Bufinefies; and that when “ the Works were compleated, a Receipt was taken “ for the total Amount of the Monies, either from “ the Contrador or some One of the Workmen,

“ which was a Voucher for the Allowance thereof to " the Examinant, in his Accounts with the Surveyor “ General.” To this Account given by the Deputy Surveyor of the making and repairing the Inclosures,

£ *,710. i. *. on which £.4,730. is. has been expended. We

shall subjoin what is said by our Surveyors, in their Appendix, n«+i. Report of the present State of the Inclosures in this Forest.

A similar Account is given on Oath by Miles Hart- Appendix, n« jj. land, Assistant to the Deputy Surveyor, of the flourishing State of the Buckholt Indojure, and the Condition of the Three small Inclosures lately made. And with respect to the Six Inclosures first mentioned, he fays,

“ The Fences of most of them were destroyed soon “ after they were made, and such Parts of them as “ conlifted of Pales, Posts, and Rails, were carried “ away publicly by the Country People, in Carts and “ Waggons j they have not since been repaired; and he believes that none of them have contributed in any Degree to the.Increase of Timber, or Advantage of the Forest.”

We shall also insert the Observations of our Surveyors on the present State of the Timber in this Forest $ premising only that a particular Survey of it having been made in the Year 1764, and another in the Year 1783, and both those Surveys reported to the House of Commons, as we have already noticed, we did not think it necessary to incur the additional Expence of having a very minute Survey of the Timber made on this Occasion. The Surveyors say:

“ Not having been instructed to make a particular “ Survey of the Timber now growing upon the Fo-" rest, we have only taken it by general Observation,

“ and have computed it to be as follows; 24,000

“ Oak Trees, which will measure upon an Average “ One Load and a Quarter each. Girt Measure, and “ 22,000 Oak Trees, which will measure upon an “ Average Half a Load each: This Calculation is “ exclusive of unfound Trees, of which there are “ many: There is also a considerable Number of “ fine large Beech, as well as young growing Trees,

“ in several Parts of the Forest. The principal Stock “ of young Timber, from which any Expectation can “ be formed at present, is in the Lea Bally and Lining “ Woods, which in general are well stocked, and “ would produce a considerable Quantity of fine “ Timber, if properly fenced, and protected from the “ Depredations of Plunderers.

“ We have examined the Survey of the Timber “ made in 1783, and compared it with our own Obfervations; and we shall only fav, upon the Subject

We have already observed, that in Consequence of “ increasing; and that great Spoil, Waste, and De-the Act of 20th Charles II. 11,000 Acres were in- “ struftion have been committed of the Wood and

closed } and, by the Provisions of that Act, the same Number of Acres were to be kept inclosed at all Times, for the Growth of Timber only j no Cattle of any Kind were to be admitted into the Inclosures, and in the uninclosed Waste, the Cattle only of those who have Right of Common j and even their Cattle were not to be admitted during the Fence Month, and Time of Winter Haining.

These Provisions were well contrived for the Preservation of the Timber and of the Deer j and the Keepers, to whom the Care of the Forest in these Particulars was intrusted, had an additional Allowance of a House and Thirty Acres of Land to each of them, 4< for the better Encouragement and enabling of them “ to attend, and watch over the said Inclosures, with-ft in their respective Walks, and to preserve the young ,c Springs of Wood and Trees therein growing and <c to grow, from Time to Time, from Spoil and " Harm.”

But these Limitations and Restrictions of the Use of the Herbage, instead of promoting the Objects for which they were designed, have for many Years past answered no other Purpose than to increase the Profits of the Keepers. Trespafies on the Forest, during the Fence Month and Winter Haining, being punishable by Fines, the Keepers have very ingeniously turned the Whole to their own Advantage j they have

c< Timber in the Forest, is manifest to every Person “ who has had the least Knowledge of it, as the “ greatest Part of the fine Timber, this Forest has been “ so famous for, has been cut down, and the large and extensive Trad of Land, formerly covered with the noblest of Timber, is now become a barren Waste “ and Heath. How. this has been from Time to “ Time effected, I do not presume to assert, but the *f Fad of disafforefting is too melancholy a Truth to “ be denied. With regard to Abuses in the Forest*

I think too many cxift 5 but as the Timber and tc Deer are almost all destroyed, which were formerly “ the Ornament and Pleasure of the Forest, to set “ about remedying the Abuses when all the Injury is “ done, seems to me to be of little or no Confequence.”

The great Want of Information, from Official Books, Papers, and Documents, during the present Century, has made it impossible to ascertain at what Time, or under what Administration, the present Abuses were first introduced 5 but it is not to be supposed that a System of Management so absurd and ruinous was the Contrivance of any Administration. Errors and Abuses have, without Observation, crept gradually into Practice; and all that can be justly imputed to Government is the having so long differed them to prevail, without that Kind of Check or En-

allowed the Inclosures to go to Ruin, by which the quiry which could lead to an effectual Remedy* nei-

Extent of the Pasturage for Cattle nearly doubled; they admit all Cattle into the Forest, without knowing or enquiring whether they belong to Commoners or not; and drive the Forest Four or Five Times'during the forbidden Seasons, impounding the Cattle, and taking at each Driving the Fines before specified.

In Consequence of the general Relaxation in the Management of the Forest, which has prevailed during the greater Part of the present Century, other very destructive Effcds have ensued: Many Encroachments have been made, which it may not be easy to reclaim; and though, when Sir Robert At

ther must it be understood that such destructive Practices have been introduced by those who now hold, or have lately held, Offices in this Forest: Many of them we know to be of an older Date, and the late or present Officers have, perhaps, only continued to take those Advantages which were received by their Predecessors,

Under such Circumstances, where so many were doing the same Thing, and where Government interposed no Check, it was not to be expected that the Temptation would be refilled, or that the resident Officers of the Forest would point out the true Causes of kins’s History was written, there was not One Cottage the Devastation from which their Advantages arose.

in the Forest, there are now, by the Report of our Surveyors, no less than 589 Cottages, and 1,798 Patches or small Inclosures of Land, containing 1,385 Acres, encroached from the Forest and, from the Want of Presentment of those Offences at the Forest Courts, the regular Holding of which has been long discontinued (no Court of Attachment having been heldfor many Years, and the Court of Swanimotc only Once in each Year, on' the 25th of ,

when it seems to be held merely for the Sake of Form) it may now perhaps be found very difficult to ascertain the Time when some of the Cottages were builr, or the Inclosures made.

In almost every Forest belonging to the Crown, as well as in this, we have found Circumstances to Iheftr the Necessity there was for such an Enquiry as that in which we have been employed j and have seen many strong Proofs that the Public has suffered by its having been so long delayed.

PART IIId.

Having given such Extrads of ancient Grants from the Crown, and such Instances of the Exercise of Ownership, as weffiave thought necessary to enable the

It is obvious that the different Fees, Perquisites, Legislature to judge what Rights the Crown is pof-

and Emoluments, which we have enumerated, are so many Premiums for the Encouragement of Waste in the Felling, Measurement, and Sale of the Timber, of Extravagance in the Expenditure of the Produce, and of Profusion in the Delivery of Timber to the Miners, while they tend to the Destruction of the Inclosures, and the Prevention of the Growth of Wood in Succelfion; and the Neglect of the Officers adds Force, on the Ground of Prescription, to the Claims of those who work the Mines, or have made Encroachments; nor can it be Matter of Wonder if all these Circumstances have had their full Effect in the general Devastation of the Forest; which cannot be more

sessed of in this Forest; having given Examples of the Waste and Destruction committed during the Grant to Sir John Wintour; and shewn, from the Care and Attention of Parliament to put a Stop to those Abuses, and re-purchase that Grant, of what great National Importance our Ancestors considered this Forest; having dated the salutary Provisions fug-gefted by the Country, and adopted by Parliament, in the Ad made for restoring it as a Nursery for Timber; the careful Execution of those Provisions for about Forty Years after passing that Ad, and the beneficial Effects which resulted from them; having given the fulled Account in our Power of the Abuses since introduced; and, having explained the present

emphatically described than in the Words of the late Maynard Colchester% Esquire, Verdcror, Deputy War- Condition of this Forest, and pointed out the Defects Vol. XLIII. 7 H ia

in the System of Management; — it remains for us now to suggest such a Plan as we think should be adopted, to prevent similar Abuses in future, and to render this Forest of the greatest Value it is capable of to the State.

It appears from the Act 20th Charles II. that n,oooo Acres of the Forest are for ever fee apart as a Nursery for Timber, freed and discharged from all Rights of Common, and other Rights whatever. Thole 11,000 Acres should be at all Times kept inclosed; and, as there is no Mixture of Property in this Portion of the Forest, it can be the Subject of no Division. The Quantity of 11,000 Acres, therefore, is to be de-dufted from the whole Quantity in the Forest, being

Acres. R. P. '

33,888 2 9, including Abbots Wood before mentioned.

p. In the remaining Quantity of 12,888 Acres the 9’ Crown has different Interests; it has the Property of the Soil, and of all the Wood and Timber, in the Quantity of 10,816 Acres, with a Power to inclose any Fart thereof for the Growth of Timber, on throwing 'Open an equal Quantity of the 11,000 Acres first inclosed: In Abbots Wood, containing 872 Acres, the Herbage and the Mines are reserved to the Crown; and in a detached Part of the Forest called containing 1,205 Acres, Act of 20th Charles II. has reserved to the Inhabitants of the Parish of Saint Briavel’s “ their lawful Rights and Privileges for the taking, cutting, and enjoying the Wood growing “ thereon."

The Herbage only of the 12,888 Acres remaining uninclosed, and on which the neighbouring Parishes have Right of Common, can be considered as the Subject of any Division or Arrangement.

In this Quantity the Crown has, by the Act of Parliament before mentioned, a Right to keep at all Times 800 Deer.

The Parishes which are entitled tlo Common in the Forest have a Right to fend their Commonable Cattle into this Part of it only from the 4th May to the 20th June, and again from the 20th July to 22d November (New Stile) being somewhat less than Six Months in the Year: The Fence Month and Winter Haining fill up the Remainder of the Year, during which no Animal except Deer ought to abide in the Forest.

The Crown may grant Leases, in the uninclosed Part of the Forest only, of Mines of Ore or Coal, for Terms not exceeding 31 Years; but no such Lease now exists, or has been granted during the present Century.

The Forest Officers have a Right to certain Fee Deer.

And these are the only clear and undisputed Rights in the Forest.

But besides these Rights, admitted and ascertained by the Act 20th Charles II. the Free Miners claim a Right not only to dig for Ore or Coal, with the Consent of the Gavellar, but to be supplied with Wood and Timber for their Works, in the Manner that has been explained.

And there are, in the different Parts of the Forest, no less than 589 Cottages, containing about 2,000 People, and 1,798 small Inclosures, amounting to 1,385 Acres, belonging to the Forest, but in the Possession of those Cottagers.

Lord Gage has made a Claim to the Bark of all Trees cut in the Bailiwicks of Staunton and Bicknor, as Woodward in Fee of those Bailiwicks; but that Claim being, in our humble Opinion, inconsistent with the Terms of the Act of the 20th Charles II. and with the Proposals on which that Act was founded, which were signed by Henry Hall, the Ancestor of Lord Gage himself; being likewise unsupported by long uninterrupted Pofu ffion, and the present Attorney and So-

licitor General having given an Opinion against admitting it, as Sir Dudley Ryder and Lord Mansfield also did when they held those Offices, we shall not think it necessary to make farther Mention of that Claim.

A similar Claim is made by Maynard Colchcfier, and Edmund Probyn, Esquires, Two other of the Woodwards in Fee, to the Bark, and to Windfall Trees, in the Bailiwicks of Abenhall and Bail) but these Claims appear to us to be equally unfounded with that of Lord Gage, and their Ancestors also signed the Proposals on which the Act of aoth Charles II. was made, by which all Rights to Fees or Perquisites arising from Wood and Timber were abolilbed.

In order to bring about a final Arrangement and Settlement between the Crown and these differen. Parties, we would humbly propose, that an Act of Parliament should pass for appointing Commissioners to treat and agree with the Freeholders, and all others who have Rights of Common, or other Rights or Claims, on the before-mentioned Quantity of 12,883 Acres, for a Division of that Part of the Forest, upon just and equitable Conditions, in Proportion to the Value of their respective Rights, giving a fair Price for such as the Parties shall think proper to fell, or making Compensation to them by adequate Allotments in Land; and we will here humbly offer our Idea of the general Principles and Terms on which such Settlement should proceed.

In the first Place, the Commissioners should be empowered, in Conjunction with the Freeholders, to name fit Persons to estimate what Proportion, of the

12.888 Acres should be allotted to the Crown in Severalty, in Consequence of the Right to keep there in all Seasons 800 Deer; and what Proportion Should be allotred to the several Parishes, in Consequence of their Right to keep their Commonable Cattle on those

12.888 Acres, during the Part of the Year before mentioned.

The Deer should be disposed of or destroyed; from which no great Inconvenience can arise to the Crown, as this Forest has supplied only Four Bucks and Four Does Annually, for the last Seven Years, to the Orders of the Cofferer or Clerk of the Venison Warrants; and as it is propoled to make a Recompence to the Forest Officers for the Loss of their Deer, no Injury will be done to them. It will also take away from the Deer Stealers, and other disorderly People, a great Temptation for breaking into the Inclosures; and prevent the Destruction of the young Timber, by the Browze of the Deer.

The Allotment to the Crown, in lieu of the Right to keep the 800 Deer, Should be added to the 11,000 Acres, which are at present the sole Property of the Crown, so as to increase the Quantity to be set apart for ever as a Nursery for Timber.

The Part of the 12,888 Acres to be allotted for the Commoners, being thus freed from the Deer, the Commoners will then have the foie Right to the Herbage, and that Quantity will afterwards be open to their Cattle only for the whole Year; but the Crown will still have the Property of the Soil, and the Wood and Timber growing and to grow on the Quantity of 10,816 Acres, and the Right to inclose any Part of them for the Growth of Timber, on throwing open an equal Quantity of the first 11,000 Acres, with such Interests in the remaining Parts as we have already described; and as this Mixture of Rights may give Occasion to future Complaints and Disputes, it may perhaps be proper to impower the Commissioners to agree with the Commoners, subject to the Approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, for a Separation of those Rights also, giving to the Crown an Equivalent in Land to be added to the Nursery of Timber, in Consideration of

the

the parting with the Right to the Soil and Timber in the Lands to be allotted to the Commoners.

Powers should be given to the same Commissioners to enquire into the Claims of the Miners and Colliers, and to make a final Arrangement and Settlement with them; and we apprehend it will not be found to be very difficult: For supposing that they could succeed in establishing their Right to dig for Ore and Coal, and to be supplied with such Wood or Timber as may really be necessary for their Works, yet even on that Supposition it appears, from the Collection of Laws of the Free Miners, or Constitutions of their Mi ne Law Court, as well as by the Information of the Gaveller, and late Deputy Gaveller, that the Crown is entitled to, and it is laid did formerly take, so considerable a Share of the Ore or Coal dug up, as would pay well for any Quantity of Wood or Timber that they could possibly have Occasion for in carrying on their Works.

Wc will not presume to point out the Particulars of the Arrangement that Should be made with the Miners and Colliers }but, in our humble Opinion, all the Fees paid to the Steward of the Swanimote Court, and Keepers, should be abolished, and such moderate Compositions only should be paid by the Colliers and Miners as the Comnlissioners shall think fit to establish, for the Purpose of preserving the Right of the Crown to the Mines; and the Colliers and Miners should not, afterwards, be allowed to have Wood or Timber from the Forest, but by fair Purchase; and although, from being obliged to pay for the Wood and Timber which they are at present supplied with gratuitously, it may become necessary for them to make some small Advance in the Price of Coal, yet / this will prove no real Loss to the Colliers, nor will they be in any Danger of losing the Market in Consequence of it.

From the Accounts of the Quantity of Coal raised in the Forest, given by the Gaveller; from the Accounts of the Steward of the Swanimote Court, Deputy Surveyor, and others, of the Quantity of Timber and Wood delivered to the Colliers; and, from the Information which we have received respecting the Price of Coal dug in the Forest, and of Coal brought into that Country from other Parts, we have all the Circumstances before us which are necessary to enable us to form an Opinion on this Subject. The Quantity of Coal raised in the Forest, according to the Weekly Average stated by the Gaveller, is about 94,432 Tons in the Year; the Average Price of the different Kinds is 3J. 3d Ton at the Pit: From the Price of imported Coal, which is Ton

' at Newnbatn, in the Neighbourhood of the Forest, and from all the Information we have been able to procure, it appears certain that no Coal, imported from other Parts, can be supplied in that Neighbourhood at near so low a Rate as from the Forest. The Timber delivered to the Colliers has been from 1,000 to 1,500 Tons Annually, of which much has been mif- applied by them; and the Value of the Kinds which they have been supplied with is about 25J.

Supposing, therefore, this whole Quantity to be really necessary for their Use, it would cost them only £.1,875. £. 1,875 » but> as the Fees they now pay to the Steward and Keepers are proposed to be abolished, a Deri uClion mult be made on that Account from the Value of the Timber to be purchased by the Colliers, which would probably reduce the Expence to leis than £.1,500. 1>5°o, and that Sum would be amply compensated

by an Addition of not more than per Ton on the Quantity Annually fold from the Forest, which would £ *>573* raise 1,573; so that the Colliers could suffer no Detriment by purchasing the Timber necessary for their Works, nor incur any Danger of losing the Market; and, as the Country round the Forest would, even then, be furnished with Coal at a very cheap

Rate, and free from any Tax, it cannot surely be thought reasonable that Government should furnish Timber to the Colliers from the Forest for nothing, solely to enable them to supply that Part of the Country with Coal on still lower Terms.

We directed the Surveyors employed by us in making a Map of the Forest, to endeavour to form such, a Plan of Inclosure as would include the Land on which there is most Wood and Timber, and in which the Soil is most fit for the Production of it, leaving out the great Fields of Coal on which the Works are at present carried on, and such,great public Roads, or Roads for the Carriage of Coal, as in their Opinion must be continued; and also leaving out those Parts of the Waste which, being near the Extremities of the Forest, and least covered with Timber or Underwood, are most conveniently situated, and afford the bell Pasture for the Cattle of the Commoners; and the Surveyors have reported to us, that there are about

18.000 Acres peculiarly fitted for the Production of Timber, which, according to the Plan they have formed, may be so inclosed as to correlpond with the Objects which we recommended to their Attention.

It is not possible at present to ascertain the exaCt Quantity that may be kept inclosed, because that must depend on the Share to be allotted to the Crown on the proposed Division; but it deserves Notice, that when the Grant was made to Sir John Montour,

18.000 Acres were disafforested j the Lea containing about t,ioo Acres, was retained by the Crown j and the remaining Quantity, containing about 4,000 Acres, was left open to the Cattle of the neighbouring Parishes entitled to Common of Herbage; and-that this Arrangement took Place with the Consent of the Freeholders, afrer mature and deliberate Treaty, and without any Violence or Injustice to the Rights or Property of Individuals; so that there is perhaps some Reason to expect that the Quantity of i8,oqo Acres, stated by our Surveyors to be most fit for Timber, may be set apart for the Crown, upon a fair Division.

But whatever the Part allotted to the Crown, or ac-. quired by Purchase, may be, we apprehend that the Object and Principle which we have suggested should. be followed; and if it be found that any Coal Work or Pit, already made by the Authority of the Gaveller, falls within the Limits of any of those Inclosures, Powers should be given to the same Commissioners to-make a reasonable Allowance to the Undertakers for depriving them of every such Pit or Work, and to allot another Place in the open Part of the Forest, instead of that which it may be necessary to comprehend within the Inclosures.

This Settlement would probably be of Advantage to all Parties.

The Public would obtain a valuable Addition to the Nursery of Timber for the Use of the Navy; and that Nursery would be protected from the pernicious Effects of the Browze of the Deer and Cattle, and the Pannage of Swine.

Those who have the Right of Common of Herbage would have a clear, full, unmixed, and undif-puted Right to the Parts allotted to them for the whole Year, instead of a Right to a Share of the Pasture, in Common with the Deer, for Six Months only; they would be freed from the Extortion of the Keepers; and, having their Property in less Compals, though of equal Value, it would be more easily guarded against the Intrusions of Strangers, who now fend their Cattle there as freely as those who have the Right of Common in the Forest j and the Parts so allotted might be more easily subdivided and inclosed, if the Freeholders should afterwards desire it.

The Arrangement and Settlement with the Colliers and Miners would also be of great Benefit to the Pub-

% lie.

lie, and prbbably in the End of no Disadvantage to she Miners and Colliers themselves: At present they are Ibpplicd with Timber by Means of fraudulent and collusive Practices, in Conjunction with j:he relidenc Forest Officers; they are liable to Punishment on Detection, and at all Times to Demands for Fees or Gratuities; they probably make but a small Profit of the Wood and Timber improperly allotted to them,

' and keep but for a lhort Time the little they so acquire. Upon a regular Settlement with them, they would be altogether independant of the Forest Officers; they would buy such Wood and Timber only as their Works should really require; and, as that would be chiefly what is dotard or decayed, and of Kinds unfit for Ship-building, they would be supplied with it on moderate Terms; and, there being no other Place from which the neighbouring Country can be supplied with Coal at so cheap a Rate as from the Forest, the Demand for the Forest Coal would continue, and the Colliers would obtain from the Con-fumer a fair Price, to make up for the additional Expence occasioned by the Purchase of Wood and Timber for their Works.

The Benefit to the Public is obvious: — It would put an End to the greatest Source of Waste and Destruction of useful Timber, and of Temptation to Corruption in the Officers, that exists in the Forest; it would create a Demand for such Trees as are dotard or decayed, and of Kinds unfit for Ship-building, lo as to derive from them some Revenue; and at the same Time thin the Woods, and gradually give Room to the best Trees to grow and become Timber.

Those who have built Cottages, and inclosed small Pieces of Land (which are distinguished in the Plan of the Forest by the Red Colour) are the next about whom it is necessary to form some Determination. Different Examples have been given in this Report of the Expulsion of similar Intruders from the Forest; — Once in the Time of the Protestor , when

400 Cottages were pulled down, and the Inclosures destroyed; again, after passing the Act 20th Charles II. when about Thirty, the Remains of a greater Number, were in the same Manner demolished, and the Forest cleared; and we have shewn, on the Authority of Sir Robert Atkins, whoseBook was published in 171a, that when he wrote there were no Houses in the Forest, except the Six Lodges of the Keepers.

In general, those Cottagers are represented to us as living on the Spoil of the Forest; and the Conservator and all the Keepers declare, that the Encroachments have been made in Defiance of all the Opposition they could give, and have been supported and renewed, in Spite of all their Endeavours to destroy them. There are, indeed, so many Inducements to build there, and the Intrusions have of late increased so rapidly, that, for the Preservation of the Forest, some vigorous Measures must be speedily taken.

The Forest being Extra-parochial, the Inhabitants are free from all Kinds of Rates or Taxes; and they have the Advantage of unlimited Pasture for Horses, Cows, or Sheep, and of Acorns and Beech Mali for their Swine, besides the Access to the Wood and Timber; for all which they pay nothing, unless per-- haps some Gratuities to the Keepers, to prevent them from disturbing their Possession.

The same Commissioners should have Powers and Instructions similar to those which were given to the Marquis of Worcester and others, after the passing of the Act of the 20th Charles II. to remove the Cottagers, and reclaim the Encroachments: But discretionary Powers should at the same Time be given to them, to Ihew Indulgence to any of those Intruders who have been born in the Forest, and had long uninterrupted Possession, and whose Cottages are not so situated as to interrupt the Plan of Inclosure; or to make some Allowance to fu#h of them as have been long ella-

blished, under the like Circumstances, within the Parts necessary to be inclosed.

We would humbly propose that Powers should also be given to the same Commissioners, to determine what Roads are necessary to be made and kept in Repair at the Expence of the Forest, and what Roads are to be considered as public Roads, necessary for the Country, to be afterwards made and kept in Repair by Turnpikes or otherwise, but not at the foie Expence of the Forest. If any Timber shall be carried through the Gates oti the public'Roads, Toll must be paid for it; and Checks might be easily formed, by Means of such Turnpikes, which would prove a great Security against the Healing of Timber; and at the same Time put an End to a great and fruitful Source of unnecessary Expence, and lhameful Imposition.

As the Execution of all that has been proposed will be attended with considerable Expence, the following is humbly suggested as the best Mode that occurs to us for providing an adequate Fund to defray.it.

There are several detached Pieces of Land belonging to the Forest, containing about 440 Acres: The Commissioners should be impowered to fell all or any of those detached Parts, under such Restrictions as the Legislature may judge it proper to appoint, or to exchange or allot any of them, as an Equivalent for any of the Rights admitted and enjoyed in the Fore'll, by the Parishes having Right of Common, or by the Officers of Inheritance; and in case further Sums should be necessary for defraying the Expence that may be incurred in the Execution of what is proposed, the same Commissioners should be empowered to fell, or direct the Sale, of such dotard and decayed Trees, or Trees not fit or likely to become fit for Naval Use, as they shall think proper to be felled, in order to supply the Deficiency.

No Prejudice to the Public Interest will attend either of thele Measures. The detached Pieces of Land last-mentioned are of so small Extent, that the Inclosure and Protection of them would be very expensive if kept by the Crown; and the clearing the Forest of dotard and decayed Trees at the Time of inclosing, would not only be of Use in giving Room for the young Spring of Wood to grow, but would prevent for some Time the Damage to the Inclosures and young Wood, by frequent Cuttings.

Here would end the Business of the Commissioners; and when the different Objects already mentioned shall have been accomplished, the Forest will then be in the best State for providing, under proper Management, a future Supply of Timber for the Navy, and for producing a considerable and increasing Revenue.

Our Surveyors have made an Estimate of the whole Expence which would attend the Plan of Inclosure proposed, and the Improvement and future Care of the Forest, as well as of the Advantages which would arise from it in the Course of an Hundred Years, supposing the Quantity of Land allotted to the Crown to be 18,000 Acres. To the Charges of Improvement and Management they have added a Relit of /. 4,500 a Year, which they consider as the Annual Value of the Land in its present State, with a View to Cultivation; and they have placed on the opposite Side the Returns of every Kind to be Annually expected from the Forest; and, according to their Computation, the Forest would, during the First Seventy Years, produce Annually the Quantity of 1,500 Loads, Girt Measure, or 2,150 Loads, Square Measure, for the Use of the Navy; and after Seventy Years, when many Trees to be planted in the proposed Inclosures will be grown fit for Naval Use, the Quantity to be furnished from this Forest will gradually increase, till the Period of an Hundred Years after the proposed Improvement, producing, during that Period, a Gross

Annual

Appendix; N"4 i.

Annual Revenue of £. 26,300, or £. 20,665 Nett, over and above a Relit of £. 4,500 for the Land, and all Expences of Improvement and Management; and after the Period of an Hundred Years, by their Computation, 14,400 Loads of Oak, Girt Measure, or 21,600 Loads, Square Measure, may be Annually cut for the Dock Yards; and this Quantity, under a Continuance of careful Management, may be for ever afterwards expected from this Forest, yielding, according to the present Prices of Timber, an Annual Gross Revenue of £. 57,600, or £.52,052 Nett, after making the Annual Deductions for Relit and Expence of Management.

The Part of the Report of our Surveyors which explains this Plan, with a Statement of the Annual Expences and Returns expected, are giyen in the Appendix to this Report; and we have received fimi-lar Computations from other Surveyors of Eminence, and there is no very material Difference in the Value which they put on the Produce of the Forest, in its improved State.

Though we might, perhaps, be too sanguine in our Expeditions, if we Should estimate at so high a Rate the Benefits to be derived from the Plan of Improvement which we have suggested, yet we. are decidedly of Opinion, that under proper Management it would be productive of the most solid National Advantages, without injuring the Rights of any Individual.

If, however, the Freeholders and others who are entitled to Common of Pasture, or have other Rights in the Forest, Should not agree to a Settlement and Separation of those Rights on the Principles proposed, we would then recommend that the Provisions of the Act of 20th Charles II. Should be carried into Effect as speedily as possible; that the full Quantity of 11,000 Acres Should be forthwith inclosed, in the Parts of the Forest best adapted to the Growth of Timber; that the Principle of that Ad Should be strictly pursued, by keeping that Quantity of Land at all Times inclosed, and by making fresh Inclosures, in other Parts of the Forest, so soon as the Wood and Timber in any Part of the Land first inclosed Should be out of Danger of Spoil by Cattle; that a Law Should be enacted to make it highly penal to destroy the Fences of those Inclosures; that the existing Laws for preventing the Healing and destroying of Timber Should be duly enforced; that the strictest Attention Should be given to keep the Forest clear of Cattle of all Kinds during the Fence Month and Whiter Haining, and of uncommonable Cattle at all other Seasons; that the Claims of the Miners and Colliers to Timber and Wood from the Forest Should be enquired into, and brought to a speedy Determination; that no Timber or Wood Should be allowed to them hereafter, but by fair Purchase, qnlefs they prove that they have a legal Right to it; and that in calk they Should succeed in establishing such Right, the most effectual Checks Should then be instituted to prevent the Delivery of a greater Quantity, or of better Quality, than is absolutely necessary for the Use of their Works; and a Law Should be made, that no Miner or Collier convicted of felling, or converting to other Uses, any Timber or Wood so delivered, Should ever afterwards have any more Timber or Wood delivered to him from the Forest on any Account.

Effectual Means Should also be used for protecting the Forest from the Depredations of the Cottagers, for resuming all Encroachments, and expelling all Intruders whatever from those Parts of the Forest which are to be inclosed; and if there be any of the Cottagers who, from Length of Possession, or other Circumstances, Should be thought deserving of Consideration, some Allowance may be made to them, upon their Removal, or small Portions of Land allotted to them in other Parts of the Forest, remote Vol. XLIII.

' ' ' r.

from the Inclosures, on paying a small Annual Relit of Acknowledgment to the Crown. Nb Roads Should in future be repaired at the Charge Of the Forest, but such as arc necessary for the Carriage of Timber s ahd every superfluous Expence Should be prevented.

But whether the Proposal which we have suggested shall be adopted, or it shall be found necessary to enforce the Provisions of the Act of aoth Charles II. in either same the greatest Difficulty will still remain* and all that is here recommended will avail little, unless a proper System shall be adopted for the future Preservation and Management of this Forest.

The first Step to be taken with that View, we apprehend, Should be, to have a compleat Survey made of the Trees growing in each Inclosure in the Forest, distinguishing, in separate Columns, what Trees are fit for the Navy, and pointing out such of those as contain principal Pieces, or Knee Timber; and whac Trees not yet fit for the Navy, arc likely to become so. These Should be all classed, numbered, and deferred, as to Situation in the Inclosure, and as to the Quantity of Timber they are supposed to contain: For each Inclosure there Should be a Keeper, who Should keep a Forest Book, in which a Duplicate of such Survey Should be inserted; and as the Trees in some of the Inclosures may be so very numerous as to endanger Confusion from having the Whole in One Account, and One Series of Numbers, different Divisions Should be made in each Inclosure, described by distinct Names and Boundaries; and for each Division there Should be separate Accounts and Numerations. A Duplicate of this Book, with the original Survey, Should be kept by the Officer or Officers who shall have the general Superintendance of the Forests; and an Account of the Totals of each Class Should be transmitted Annually to the Treasury, and to the Commissioners of the Navy, that each of those Boards may at all Times know the Quantity of Timber in each Forest, fit or likely to become fit for the Navy.

A Purveyor of the Navy Should assist in taking such Survey, which Should be verified on Oath; and when a Fall for the Navy, or for Sale, is directed, the Purveyor and Keeper Should both certify the Numbers of the particular Trees proposed to be cut in each Division; and after the Fall has been made, the Number of Trees felled Should be checked with the Certificate of the Purveyor and Keeper, and entered in the Keeper’s Forest Book; and the Certificates returned to the General Office, where they Should remain. The Trees proposed to be cut Should be viewed by Two Justices of the Peace, or Verderors of the Forest, as required by the Act of 20th Charles II.; and the Purveyor and Keepers Should not only be sworn to the Truth of their Certificates, but the Justices or Verderors Should also certify that they have viewed the Trees proposed to be taken down, so as to be a real Check on the Purveyor and Keeper.

The Duplicate of the Forest Book, kept in the General Office, ought certainly to belong to and remain in that Office, and not be considered as the Property of the Officers; and every Survey, or Document of any Kind, relative to the Forests, Should there be entered and preserved; so that the succeeding Officer or Officers, who may be intrusted with this important Charge, may find in the Office the fulleft Information of every preceding Circumstance, as well as of the actual State of every Forest.

In the Examinations of the different Officers, and the Remarks we have made upon them, the Salaries, Fees* Gratuities, Emoluments, and Advantages of every Kind, which we have discovered to be taken, are fully stated; and the destructive Effects which they have upon the Forest are pointed out. We havefhewn that those Advantages increase, in Proportion to the Waftc and Destruction committed; and that the1 Interest of

the Officers in the Forest, and that of the Public, are direCHy opposite to each other. If ftrict Regularity should be introduced into the Expenditure in the Fo-rest, and the Inclosures be carefully'preserved; if Waste Should be prevented in the felling of Timber for the Navy, or for Sale; and a Stop be put to the Advantages which the resident Officers derive from the Delivery of Timber to the Colliers, as well as from Timber stolen, and from the Trespasses on the Herbage, their Offices would be worth little. It is obvious that to attempt any Improvement of the Forest while this absurd System remains mult be ineffectual; and it cannot be necessary to use any additional Arguments to shew that the first Step that ought to be taken is to put an End to the present, and to adopt a different Plan of Payment, of every efficient Officer connected with the Forests.

We will on this Subject adopt Two Sentences from a Report of the Commissioners of Public Accounts, which are as applicable to the Department under our immediate Consideration, as to any Establishment in this Country.

“ Having thus ffated the Mischiefs attending the ,f present Establishment, both to the Public and Individuals, and the Reasons for abolishing the multi-ct farious Emoluments by which these Offices are now “ supported, it remains for us to propose such a Re-" gularion as appears belt calculated to avoid the “ like Mischiefs, and nooft beneficial to the Public “ Service.

“ We are of Opinion, that in the Place of all these tc Salaries, Fees, and Gratuities, there Should be sub- stituted and annexed to each of these Offices, of “ whatever Rank or Denomination, one certain Salary, paid to the Officer by the Public, Quarterly, * and free of all Deductions. This Salary Should be “ an ample Compensation for the Service required, and the Quantum estimatedby the various Quali-<f fications and Circumstances necessary for the Execurion, and which, together, form the Title to “ Reward.”

We have in this Report, as we proposed, confined our more minute Investigation to what relates to the Forest of Dean: Our chief Objects have been to give a distinct View of the Rights appertaining to the Crown in this Forest, and of the Claims made upon it by Individuals, as well as to explain the Abuses which prevail; in order that a Settlement and Separation of those Rights may take Place on just Principles, and that Measures may be speedily taken to put an End to those Abuses; and we propole, One by One, to report on the other Forests belonging to the Crown, and to endeavour to state the Condition of each, imthe same Manner, to the Legislature.

We have only so far entered into the general Subject of Enquiry, as to shew, that under the present Syf-tem of Management, the Woods and Forests, Parks and Chaces, belonging to the Crown, inllead of yielding any Revenue whatever to the State, have had the Value of all they have produced, from the Year 1761 to 1786 inclusive, expended on them, and nolefs than £.‘144,882. j6j. 7 d.more, taken from the Produce of the demised Estates; that no more has been Annu-

ally furnished from them to the Dock Yards than 2>oooo Loads of Oak Timber, and yet that the Forests are in a State of Decay; that the Annual Demand for Oak Timber for jthe Navy is no less than 25,000 Loads; that no Dependance can with Safety be had on other Countries for any Part of that Quantity; that

23,000 Loads are Annually purchased From private Estates in this Country; and that as there is a rapid Decrease in the Stock of Oak Timber growing in this Kingdom, that Source of Supply becomes every Year more precarious and uncertain.

We have shewn also, that as long as the Landed Property of the Crown was thought deserving of the Attention of Ministers, and the Surveyors General of the Crown Lands, and of the Woods and Forests, were connected in the Superintendance and Management with other Officers of the Crown, the Provisions of the Act of 20th Charles II. were carried into regular Execution, and the Forests were well preserved; but as soon as that joint Care and Co-operation ceased, and the Woods and Forests came to be under the foie and uncontrouled Direction of a single Officer, a general Relaxation took Place, and those Abuses were gradually suffered to prevail, which have brought the Forests to their present wafted Condition.

We have suggested a Plan of Arrangement and Improvement, by which, in our humble Apprehension, the Forest of Dean may be made a very valuable Nur-fery of Timber for the Navy, and productive of a considerable Revenue; and we hope that we shall be able to propose Plans equally practicable and effectual for the Improvement and Management of the other Forests of the Crown. By these Means we trust that those great National Objects may be attained, of providing a full and constant Supply of Timber for the Royal Navy, without any Dependance whatever on other Countries, and without trusting much for great Timber to Supplies from private Property in this Kingdom; and of deriving, at the same Time, a very considerable Revenue from a Part of the Public Property which has for many Years bfien the Source only of Expence.

But these great Public Benefits can only be rendered permanent by an uniform Perseverance in one regular established System of Management, and by an unremitted Attention on the Part of those who shall be intruded with the Care and Superintendance of this great National Concern.

Todevifethe Means of securing the Continuance of this necessary Attention and Care, and to guard against: the Danger of future Relaxation and Neglect, are fit Subjects for the Exercise of the Wisdom of the Legislature. We have thought it our Duty, in this Report, only to bring the Subject under Observation; and rather to point out every Circumstance, from past Experience, that can assist in forming a Judgment upon it, than, without still farther Consideration, to suggest an Opinion of our own, on a Matter of so much Difficulty and Importance.

A Note of the Froceedings at the Justice Scat held for the Forest of Deane at Gloucester Ca file, the iothof7«/y 1634, before the Right Honble.

Henry Earle of Holland, Lord Chief Justice in Eyre, afiifted by Mr. Justice Jones, Mr. Baron Trevor, and Sir John Bridgem Chiefe Justice of Chester, as it was delivered to the King by

S' John Finch.

On Saturday the Twelfth Day of July 1634, in the Presence of the Grand Jury, being XV, the Twelve Jury Regarders, all the Officers of the Forreft, and the Regarder* Fairemen and Reeve of the several Townelhipps within the Forreft: The Matter concerning the Perambulation of the Forreft was solemnly debated.

The King’s Council produced Two ancient Perambulations, One in the i ith of Hen. the III", and the »*th Henry in other in the 10th of Edward the Ift. both agreeing that ,0,hE(lwdi« the Bounds of the Forreft began at Gloucester Bridge, and so went to Monmouth Bridge, and Bridge,

and came round again by the Severne to Gloucester, taking in all those Seventeen Towns.

TheCouncell for the Towns produced aPerambula-tien in 26th Edwd Ift. and another in 28th Ift. ^£^1* both agreeing that the Seventeen Towns were not anciently Forreft, but were afforefted by King John, and so by the Statute of Charta de Forrefta ought to be dif-afforefted; and produced also Letters Patents in 29th sjth Ed^ 1. EdwdIft. whereby that Perambulation of 28th ifhEdw1*!.

Ift. was confirmed j and lastly, infilled upon an Act of Parliament in 10th Edwd 11111, whereby the Perambu- 10th Edw* in lation made in the Time of EdzvJ the Ift. were confirmed: And they urged also the long and constant Usage ever since, agreeing with the Perambulation of 28th Edwd Ift, concluding that by the Lawe the Meetes *sth Edw<i I. and Boundes ought not to be questioned contrary to that Perambulation, confirmed by Letters Patent, and an Act of Parliament.

The King’s Councell replied that the Perambulation of 28th Edwd Ift. and so consequently that of the iSthEdw1!. 26th EdwdIft. were false and erronious Perambula- *6thEdwJi. tiens, prejudiciall to the King, and contrary to the Charter of the Forest; and whereas by that Charter of the Forreft no Difaftoreftacon should be of any Lands that were afforefted before Henry the Second’s Time, Henry'll. nor any of the King’s Demesne Lands, though afforefted after th£ Beginning of the Reign of Henry the Second.

Yet this Perambulation did disafforeft those Seventeen Towns aforesaid by King John;whereas the Truth

was, they were Forrefto" long before, and divers of them were of the King’s own Demeafne Lands, and for that Cause the Proclamation of the 28th Edwd Ift. was afterwards revoked, as a void and erroneous Perambulation; and to prove if, produced an old Re- Record fn Town-cord in the Tower which had no Date, but by the w'thout

Body of the Recoid it appeared to be after the 28th a*‘

Edwd Ift. reciting it as a void and revoken Thing.

For the long Usage it was answered that non Iter in Eyre had been there since 10th Edwd Ift. and no lothEdw1!. Man could say what was the Usage: But divers of

those Towns had firtce claimed Comon in the Forreft, which shewed they took themselves to the Forreft, and not to the Purliewe; because, by

t*, 33d Edwd Ift. no Perlieu Man can have Comon

within the Forreft.

For the Confirmation in the 29th Ift. it was answered. That the Perambulation being void and er-ronyous, the Letters Patent confirming it were also void, the King doing it upon false Informations; and for the Act of Parliament in the 10th III4, that did not confirm the Perambulation of 28th Ift, by Name, but tho Perambulations throughout England, of all the Forreftsmade in the Time of Edward the First, generally.

And therefore that of 28th Edwd Ift. being a void Perambulation, the Act of Parliament wrought not upon that, but had his Operation upon the Perambulation of 10th Edwd 1ft. which was within the Words of that Act, as well as the 28th Ift. and was within the Meaning, being a true Perambulation, apd demanded Judgment of the Court, whether this Ques-tien of the Boundes wtere not, for all the Reasons aforesaid, agreeable to Lawe.

To which the said Judges Assistant answered. That it was legall, and not contrary to the Act of Parliament in 10th Edwd Ift. and left it to the Country to consider of the Record of the Tower produced by the King’s Councell, as an Evidence to overthrowe the Perambulations of 26th and 28th Edwd lft.; and if those Perambulacon were void, it must follow that the Perambulations of 12th HenryIIId. and 10th Edwd In. were true ones.

The Grand Jury and the rest went together; and the Afternoon of that Day being called, but not agreed, they desired further Time of the Court, as a Matter of great Waight, which was granted.

On Monday the Grand Jury and the rest brought in their Verdict touching the Perambulation, which was to this Effect:

Wee agree that the Meetes and Bounds of the Forreft of Deane ought to be according to the Perambulacon made in the j2th Henry IIId. and 10th Edwd Ift. i but because we find the Perambulacon of 28th Edwd I*, to be granted by Patent of 29th Edwd Ift. and because of the Act of Parliament in 10th Edwd IIId. and a Possession of Three hundred and odd Years, concurring the rewithal: Wee therefore refer it to the Judgement of this Honble. Court, whether the Perambulation of 28th Edwd I*, ought to (land in Force.

Whereupon the King’s Councell moved the Judges to deliver their Opinion for the Matter in Law, which they all agreed on as before; and then the King’s Councell moved the Jury, since when their Verdict in Law was satisfied by the Judges, that they would agree to leave out the latter Part of their Verdict, and let the First Part only (land for their Verdict j viz1.

We agree that the Meetes and Boundes of the Fo-rest of Deane ought to be according to the Perambulation made 12th of Henry IIId. and 10th Ift.; to which the Grand Jury, the Twelve Regarders, the Officers of the Forreft, and the Fairemen and Reeve, subscribed their Names thereunto.

By this the King hath much enlarged the Forreft of Deane, and all within the XVII Townes aforesaid were fearfull they lliould have been questioned for many Things done contrary to the Forreft Law , but the King’s Counccll, in Regard of their being but new brought in, and long Ul'age, thought it not fitt to proceed with any of them at that Justice Seat.

To the Right honourable Sir Robert Atkins, Kn* of the Bath, Lord Chief Baron of their Majesties Court of

Exchequer, and to the rest of the Barons there.

May it please your Lordftnps,

In pursuance of their Majestys Commission, under the Seal of their Majestys Court of Exchequer, to us and others directed, and of certain Articles of Instruction thereunto annexed, we whose Names are hereunto subscribed do humbly certify your Lordships,

That we have repaired to the said Forest, and carefully viewed and perambulated the several Parts and Places thereof, as well- inclosed as uninclosed; and find that there are great and valuable Quantities of Scrubbed Beech and Birch, with some Holly, Hazle, andOrle, fit to be cut anddisposed of; and, provided due Care be taken to preserve alj Oak whatsoever, the strait Beech, with the principal Shoot of such Beech as grow upon old Stools, and sufficient Shelter about them, in such Places where either the Thinness of their Growth, or being exposed to Weather, shall make it necessary, we conceive it will be confident with the Intent of the A<5t of Parliament, 20th Car. II4, for Increase and Preservation of Timber in this Forest.

The Quantities and Growth of the said Woods fit to be cut, the Places where situate, the Number of Acres, and Quantity of Cords on each Acre, according to our belt Computation and Judgment, together with the Values for which the same may be fold per Cord, all Charges of cutting and cording being deduced, as also the Quantity of Wood (besides Oak) that will be left (landing on each Acre, after the Fellets proposed have been made, are contained in the following Particulars:

By the Account aforesaid, if the Underwbods (certified as fit to be cut) which may be sold at to Cord, clear of cutting and cording, be cut in Seven Years, the same will yield the Sum of £. 6,628. 1 5. per

Annum during that Term; and if the whole called Underwoods (Oak excepted) be disposed of to any Person, with Liberty to cut the same in 21 Years Time, upon a Covenant of repairing and keeping up the Inclosures (as mentioned in the First Article) the Stock which such Person may take off in that Time (as appears by the Account aforesaid) is wo.rth, upon a moderate Computation, the Sum of £. 148,745. 16. 8.: And it does not >4*>74j. appear but that such Person may cut some Parts of the said Woods Twice in the said Term of 21 Years, by which the Value will be proportionably augmented, tho’ cannot be ascertained by us; but we suppose such Second Fellet may amount to-the Sum of £.60,000 more, or thereabouts. 60,000

The Repairs of the Inclosures will be inconsiderable, and may be done for about £. 100 per Ann.

IV” Cooke. J. Viney. Reginald Pyndar, ~~ '

Jo. Kyrle. . Pb. Ryley,

It is very difficult to determine how mifeheivous and fatal the Consequences of such a Grant will be, not only in respect of this Forest but of the Nation in general, especially when the Consumption of our Naval Timber is so very great, and our Occasions for it not inconsiderable. Doubtless, besides the cutting down many Thousands of streight Beech that will be fit for their Majestys Naval Service, such a Grant would utterly destroy the Forest, which is now perhaps the bed Nursery for a Navy in the World, and has been of that Esteem as to havejuftified the Labours of our Enemies for its Destruction, and the Care and Endeavours of several Parliaments, since the Year 1660, for its Preservation: And so very tender of this Forest was the Parliament Anno 1663, that when a Grant, like what is now proposed, had almost ruined it, that Honourable House thought it worthy their Care to refeue it, and re-aftumed many Grants that had been made to private Persons, and compounded for others at a great Charge, and did then, by a particular A(ft of Parliament for that Purpose, endeavour to prevent any Lease or Grant to be made of any Part thereof, or the Woods growing the rein, to any Person whatsoever, as by the said Statute does appear in these following Words: “ And, that the said Forest and Premifies may be perpetually preserved and *c estated in the Crown for public Use as aforesaid, *c and may not be granted or disposed to any private «r Use or Benefit, Be it further Enacted, That in case any Person or Persons whatsoever shall presume to “ take, or shall obtain any Gift, Grant, Estate, or Interest, of or in the said Inclosures or Wastes, or any Wood or Trees growing thereon, or of or in any of “ the Mines or Quarries of or within the said Inclo-tl sures, or any Part thereof, every such Gift, Grant, “ Estate, and Interest shall, ipso be null and

“ void, and the Person or Persons so taking or obtaining the same shall be, and is hereby made and “ declared utterly disable and uncapable to have, hold, or enjoy any such Gift, Grant, Estate, or Interest."

Anno 1674 (as had been in 1662) it was proposed that if'his then Majesty would repair the old Iron Works in this Forest, and make an Addition of One Furnace and Two Forges (which might be done for £. 1,000) and cause the spareable Woods to be cut and converted into those Works, that then every Eight thousand long Cords of Wood so converted Should yield a Profit, over and above the Value of 8 s. per long Cord, and clear of all Charges, the Sum of

£.2,190.

Yet upon Consideration that the eretting such Works, and supplying the same with the Quantities of Wood necessary for that Purpose, migh/ endanger a great Waste in this Forest, if not the Destruction thereof, it was advised rather to pull down the old Iron Works, than erect new; and the old Iron Works were pulled down, and the Materials fold accordingly; and the same Reasons do still remain against any new Works, and have this Addition, that their Majestys Woods are now fold for One Shilling

and Eight Pence each long Cord more than the same was at that Time valued.

It may be taken Notice of also, the great Difficulty with which the many Freeholders that had Right of Common, and other Privileges, in this Forest, were prevailed with in the Year 1665 to submit the same to the Crown for inclosing the said Forest, according to the Statute 20th Car. IP; many of the same Persons are yet living, and would doubtless be concerned to fee the Profit of it in any private Hands, when they have freely parted with theirs for the public Utility; and we are credibly informed, that if any such Grant pass, the Freeholders do intend to prefer a Petition to be restored to the Rights of Eftovers enjoyed by them before the making the said Statute 20th II*.

And altho* we do certify that fomcWoods mentioned in our foregoing Particular may be cut, yet, considering the great Care and Caution that hath hitherto been had to make this Forest useful to the Navy (as appears by what has been before recited) and the flourishing Condition to which it is now arrived; and add to this, how natural it is, and certain will be, for any Person who can obtain such a Grant (as is mentioned in the First Article) to consult his own Advantage, not the Preservation of the Forest; and that Experience acquaints every Woodman that it is hard to preserve in Coppice Woods what ought and is intended to be left by those that design an Increase of Timber; we can by no Means (if the Act of Parliament would admit thereof) think it adviseable to make a Grant so certainly destruttive to the Forest as this proposed, nor that the making the said Fellets should be entrusted in any other Hands than thepre-sent Officers, who have, in those Places whereinto they have brought their Majestys Axe, given sufficient Testimony of their Care in observing the Rules afore prescribed for making the said Fellets, and preparing every Thing fit to be left for the Increase and Preservation of Timber, according to the Statute 20th Chai IP. in that Behalf made.

The Lea Bayly is now a Spring of Oak and Beech of 4, 5, and 6 Years Growth, but much cropped and spoiled by Cattle, by Reason the Inclosures made for the Preservation thereof have, in the Night, been several Times pulled down and destroyed by Persons unknown. The other Places particularly mentioned in the Act of Parliament as Part of the 11,000 Acres, are geiTerally very well grown with Oak and Beech of 50, 40, and 30 Years Growth and under, many Thousands of them being 40 Foot and upwards, without a Bough to hurt them, but their Number cannot well be known by Reason of the Thickness of their Growth, and of great Quantities of other Sort of Wood that will never be fit for the Navy, and is proposed to be cut in Part as aforesaid.

To the 2d. — We have also enquired what the Charge of supplying and maintaining the Inclosures heretofore and lately made, with all needful and necessary Reparations, may amount unto; and find, that the Fences necessarily to be repaired are only the Lea 3 ,

5q6 i8C Junti. A. 1788*

Bayly, Chejnutts Coppice, Edghills and Ruardeane Inclojures, and ‘The Fence, which contain about 2,400 Acres, and may be repaired for the Sum of £. 137. ior. The other Parts and Places formerly

inclosed are not necessary to be repaired, being grown pad Danger of Prejudice from Deer or Cattle; and the Fences of the said 2,400 Acres, when repaired, may be so kept by the Annual Allowance of L 30 made the Keepers for that Purpose, unless in case of some Accident, or pulling down by the Rabble, as hath been sometimes done.

To the 3d. — There are but Six Coal Pits within all or any their Majestys Inclosures, and of those Places, the Inclosures being generally down, and not necessary to be repaired, the Wood therein being of a Growth pad Danger, the Country are not incommoded or prejudiced in that Refpett.

To the 4th. — The Salaries of the Conservators, and Six Keepers of this Forest, do amount to the Sum of £210 per Ann.and are usuallypaid at their Majesties Exchequer out of the Monies arising by Wood Sales in this Forest. — The Castle of St. Briavells, mentioned in this Article, hath been a very great and antient Building, but the greatest Part is ruined and fallen down, and only some Part kept up for a Place to hold the Courts in for the King’s Manor and Hundred of St. Briavells, and also for a Prison for Debtors attached by Process out of the said Courts, and for Offenders and Trespasses within the Forest. The same is very necessary to be repaired; and for mending the Roof and Tyling, and in glazing, plaister-ing, repairing the Prison Windows, and building a new Pound, &c. will cost the Sum of 10. 14. 2. There are Two Keepers Lodges, namely, Worcester Lodge, and York Lodge, that were pulled down by the Rabble in January 1688, arc absolutely necessary to be re-built, and will both require the Sum of 90, besides Twelve Tons of Timber, which we advise Should be rather bought than cut in the Forest, and will cost more, brought to the several Lodges, the Sum of £. 18. — The Speech House (the Place where the Courts are held for the Forest, and being the principal Lodge also) having been much defaced and spoiled by the Rabble at the same Time, will, over and above the Monies already laid out for Repairs of the Roof, cost the Sum of 109, besides Two Tons of Timber, and Carriage 50/.

To the 5th. — We have also taken an Account upon Oath from Charles Morgan, Deputy to the Surveyor of the Woods, of what Quantity of Wood hath been cut in this Forest pursuant to their Majesties Letters of Privy Seal, bearing Date the 28th April 1690, and find the same to be 6,186 ftiort Cords of Wood sold to Paul Foley, Esquire, at the Rate of 6 s. per Cord clear of Cording, which Rate of 6s. per Cord is equal if not exceeding the Value for which the Woods are fold in the County of Clouc; and we have also viewed the Places where the said Cordwood hath been cut, and find there is a very great Stock left upon the Ground for Timber, and all imaginable Care taken by the Officers employed in making the said Fellets, and preserving all the Stores and Saplings, with the principal Shoots of such Beech as grow upon old Stools, well Iheltered by other Woods, for the Improvement thereof.

We have also, according to the 5th Article of our Instructions, inquired what Offences have been committed in the said Forest since the 13th of February 1688; and, having received upon Oath the Present-.ments of several Woodwards, Keepers, and other Officers of the said Forest, concerning the fame, have returned to your Lordships the Particulars thereof; ( viz'.)

The Preferments of the several Foresters, Keep-

ers, and other Officers of the saidForest of Dean, hereafter named, made, and delivered upon Oath to their Majesties Commissioners appointed to esquire of certain Articles of In-strudtion as aforesaid.

William Cough, Gentleman, One of the Keepers of the said Forest, doth present John Simons, of for cutting green Orle Wood in the said Forest about the Beginning of July last, 1692.

George Glajeyard and Joseph Bijell, Two of the Keepers of the said Forest, do present Edward Rocke apd James Drew, both of Little Dean, for cutting and carrying away a young Oak out of the said Forest, on the 28th Day of May 1689.

The same Edward Rooke, for building some Part of his House with Wood out of the said Forest, about the same Time.

Cum multis alijs.

And we humbly observe to your Lordships, that if some of the principal Offenders aforesaid be not made Examples to others, we have great Reason to believe, that whatsoever Inclosures are made or repaired for Increase and Preservation of the Woods or Lodges eretted for the Keepers to inhabit, the same will be demolished, as were those formerly. But as we have humbly represented to your Lordships that some of the principal Offenders at least Should be punished, so we hold ourselves obliged to represent also, that the Colliers of this Forest have. Time out of Mind, had an Allowance of Wood for Support of their Pitts, which Allowance hath been usually made unto them by Order of the Verderers, and taken by View of a Woodward or Keeper; but the said Allowance having been stopt for some Time, upon a Question of their Rights thereunto, they have taken the same without such Order or View, by which great Waftes are daily committed: For Prevention whereof, and that the said Colliers may be duly supplied, as we are humbly of Opinion they ought, we propose it as expedient, that: the said Allowance may be made to them by the Order of the Verderers at the Attachment or Swanimoot Courts, and taken by the View of a Woodward or Keeper, as formerly.

We have also enquired how duly the Forest Courts have been kept; and do humbly certify your Lordships that the same have been regularly held. But by Reason that the Attachment and Swanimoot Courts can only convieft, but not punish, the.Proceedings in either of them are ineffectual to the Preservation of the Forest without a Justice Seat; and the great Negligence of several of the Foresters and Woodwards in Fee, does much contribute to the Spoils committed in this Forest; but how far the Lands which are held and enjoyed by the said several Foresters and Woodwards for the Execution of those Offices, are inseperable from them, or forfeitable upon such Neglect of their Duties, is humbly submitted to your Lordships. We are informed by Mr. Rowley, Steward of the said Courts, that the Monies that have been paid at the Forest Courts by Trespafiers, since their Majestys happy Accession to the Crown, does not exceed the Sum of Five Shillings.

We have endeavoured with all Exactness, according to the best of our Judgment, to answer all the foregoing Articles of our Instructions, and have con-fulted with such Persons as we thought, by any Advice or Information, might conduce to their Majesties Service therein: And, this last Article commanding our Opinion upon the whole State of this Forest, for the better governing thereof, according to the Act of Parliament 20th Cha‘ IIJ. we do further humbly certify your Lordships, that the most likely Way to render the Forest Courts effectual for Punishment of Offenders (which for Want thereof are here grown numerous and insolent) and to oblige the Officers of § Inheritance

i^-

28 Geo. III.

Inheritance to be diligent and faithful in the Discharge of their several Duties for the Preservation of the Fo-rest, were to procure a Justice Seat Once a Year, for Six or Seven Years, to be held in the long Vacation, within the said Forest, or not very remote from it, which might be done by Deputation from the Lord Chief Justice in Eyre to some of their Majesties Justices of Assize going in their ordinary Circuits from Gloutefter to Monmouth, by which Means all the dili-

gent Officers will be encouraged in their Endeavours j

59 7

the negligent reproved j the vain Hopes that some Persons have given to many and daring Offenders about this Forest, that the same shall be made a free Chace, and consequently be destroyed, and they exempted from Punishment, will be utterly defeated and disappointed.

Which we humbly submit to your Lordships.

The Answer of Frederick Earl of Berkeley,

Lord Warden of the Forest of Dean, and Constable of the Castle of Saint Briavals, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue j dated 7th June 1787.

Lord Berkeley holds the Office of Lord Warden of the Forest of Dean, and Constable of the Castle of Saint

Briavals, by Patent, during His Majesty’s Pleasure; he appoints the Keepers of the said Forest, and is to take Care that they do their Duty, in regard to the Deer only. He receives no Salary, Fees, or Emoluments whatever, for his own Use, as Lord Warden or Constable, but an Annual Sum of a 10 is issued to him from the Treasury for paying the Wages of the Conservator and Keepers of the Forest; and he is authorized, by a Clause in his Lease from the Crown of the Manor and Hundred of Saint Briavals, to retain out of the Relit

' reserved by that Lease a Sum of £. 40 per Annum for Wages of the Keepers; and out of those Two Sums his Agent pays the Salaries or Wages of the Conservator and Keepers, after deducting the Fees and Taxes charged thereon: He has nothing to do with the Timber or Woods, the Keepers receiving their Orders on that Head from the Deputy Surveyor; and as to Intrusions or Encroachments, the Keepers report those Matters to the Conservator and to the Surveyor.

The Answer of Sir John Guise, Baronet, One of the Verderors of DeForejl, and also One of the Deputy Wardens of the said Forest. and Deputy Constables of the Castle of Saint Briavals, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue -, dated 7 th June 1787.

Sir John Guise is One of the Verderors of the Forest of Dean, and One of the Deputy Wardens of the said

Forest, and Deputy Constables of the Castle of Sf Briavel’s, in the County of Gloucester. To the Office of Verderor he was elected by the Freeholders at large, which Office is for Life; and he was appointed One of the Deputy Wardens and Deputy Constables by the Lord Warden and Constable, during his Pleasure. The Duty of the Office of Verderor is to preserve the Vert and Venison of the Forest; and of the Office of Deputy Warden or Deputy Constable, to preside as Judge at the Miners Court in the said Forest, and at the Hundred Court of S‘ Briavels, for the Recovery of Debts, and other Purposes. There is no Salary, that he knows of, annexed to either of those Offices; the only Emolument as Verderor is a Fee Buck and Doe in the Season, delivered by the Keeper under Warrant from the Verderor j as Deputy Warden or Deputy Constable, no Fee or Emolument. It seems, from the general Appearance of the Forest of Dean, that great Spoil, Waste, and Deft ruftion, have been committed there: Petitions or Representations, signed by the Verderors and others, were some Years since presented to the Treasury, letting forth several Grievances to the Prejudice of the said Forest, but no Notice was ever taken of them.

Land formerly covered with the noblell of Timber, is now become a barren Waste and Heath. How this has been from Time to Time effected, I do not presume to assert; but the Fast of disafforefting is too melancholy a Truth to be denied. With regard to Abuses in the Forest, I think too many exist; but as the Timber and Deer are almost all destroyed, which were formerly the Ornament and Pleasure of the Forest, to set about remedying the Abuses when all the Injury is done, seems to me to be of little or no Consequence.

The Answer of Edmund Probyn, Esquire, One of the Verderors, Deputy Wardens, and Woodwards, in Fee, of the Forest of Dean, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated 7th 1787.

The said Edmund Probyn is One of the Verderors and Deputy Wardens of Dean The Duty of his Of-

The Answer of Maynard Colthester, Esquire, One of the Verderors, Deputy Wardens, and Woodwards of the Forest of Dean, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue j dated 7th June 1787.

t hold Three Offices in the Forest of Dean, viz1. tft. That of Verderor; the Natu're and Duty of whose Office is to preserve the Vert and Venison of the Forest, to preside as Judge of the Courts of Attachment and Swanimote, to receive Presentments from the Keepers and other Officers of all Offences committed respecting the Timber and Deer in the Forest, to inquire into Encroachments, and inspect into the Conduct of the Keepers and other Officers of the Forest; but have no Power to punish Abuses therein.

ad. That of Deputy Warden, whose Office is to preside as Judge at the Miners or Mine Law Court, to try all Offences committed against the Miners Laws, and to enforce due Obedience to them by all those who are amenable thereto; to preside allb at the Hundred Court of S' Briavels, for 1 Recovery of Debts, and Trials of Trespasses, and other Matters arising within the Hundred.

3d. That of Woodward of the several Bailiwicks within the Forclb called Great Dean, and Lea whose particular Office is, by himself or Deputy, to be very watchful and vigilant in preserving the Timber, Woods, and Underwoods, within the respective Bailiwicks, to present all (C{fences arising therein at the Forest Courts.

To the Office of Verderor I am elected by the Suf-

by me by virtue of either of the Offices I hold in the Forest.

There is no Salary whatever annexed tp either of the Offices, or received by me in respect thereof.

The only Emoluments annexed to the Office of Verderor, are a Fee Buck, and a Fee Doe, out of the Forest, which are delivered by the Keeper on Warrants from the Verderor.

. There are no Fees or Emolument? whatsoever due to or received by me, as Deputy Warden, or annexed to that Office.

There are certain and casual Emoluments annexed tp and belonging to the Office of Woodward, viz'.

Lops and Tops of all Timber and other Trees, felled within the respective Bailiwicks. ..!

- All Windfall and Dotard Trees within the lame, and House Bote for repairing the Woodward’s Mansion House. v

' I occupy no Messuages or Tenements belonging to the Crown, nor are there any annexed or belonging to either of the Offices I hold in the Forest.

There have been for a vast Number of Years innumerable Encroachments made upon the Forest, which are (till increasing; and that great Spoil, Waste, and Destruction, has been committed of the Wood and Timber in the Forest, is manifest to every Person who has had the lead Knowledge of it, as the greatest Part of the fine Timber this Forest has been so famous for has been cut down, and the large and extensive Tract of Righc of his Office,

Annually by the Keepers on Oath, at Swanimote Court, and recorded by the Steward. As to Intrusions or Encroachments on the Forest, he refers to the Keepers. Many Trespasses are committed in the Vert and Venison of the said Forest, and the Offenders are punished according to the Laws and Statutes in that same made hnd provided. There is not so much; Timber stolen as used to be, owing to,the Care of the Deputy Surveyor, and the Rewards given for conyifting Offenders. ’

The Answer of Thomas Crawley Boevey, Esquire, One of the Deputy Wardens of the Forest of Dean, and Deputy Constables of the Castle of S' Brtavils, to the Precept of the . Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated 7th June

The said Thomas Crawley Boevey was appointed One of the Deputy Wardens of Dean Forest, and Deputy Constable of the Castle of S' Briavels, by the Earl of Berkeley, the Lord Warden and Constable, during his Pleasure.

Three Years past, for the Use of the Navy, the Quantity of Two thousand Loads of Timber by Estimate. The Quantity for Wood Sales cannot be ascertained in Loads, as the same hath been sold by public Auction in Lots j but the Number of Trees may be known by referring to the Justices Certificates on the Treasury Warrants, for the Use of the Navy, and Wood Sales. There is no Fuel Wood allowed to any one, nor any Claims except those of the Miners, who claim Timber for the Use of their Works, but he hath heard that great Abuses exist by converting the Timber to other Purposes. There have been for many Years numerous Intrusions and Encroachments made, and many do now exist, and are Daily making, by building of Cottages, inclosing Ground for Gardens, Orchards, and other Uses, by many poor Persons. And he hath been informed, and is well allured, by some of the Keepers themselves in the Forest of Dean, that great Spoil, Waste, and Destruction, hath been committed of the Wood and Timber, in his Opinion greatly owing to the numerous Intrusions and Encroachments, which cannot be made without destroying the Wood; and he also apprehends there hath been very great Neglect in the Deputy Keepers.

The Answer of Joseph Esquire, One of the Deputy Wardens of Dean to the Precept

of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated 7th June 1787.

Gentlemen,

In Compliance with your Request, in the First Place I inform you that the Place of Deputy Constable of the Forest of Dean was, in the First Institution, to hold Courts, in order to settle Disputes between the Miners; but no Act of Parliament having ever pa/Ted to render the Decisions valid, they are seldom adhered to; and of late Years the Courts have been discontinued. The Place has no Perquisite, Fee, or Salary, no Tenement belonging to it, or any Walk; it is held at Pleasure under Lord Berkeley.. The Bucks that ever came to my Share, have been Three or Four, by Warrant under Lord Berkeley's Hand; for, each of which I paid the Keeper One Guinea as his Fee. Hay or Corn being purchased for the Deer, is what never came to my Knowledge j and I may safely say never was. The Number of Deer it is impossible to ascertain, they are every Year diminished; great Quantities of Timber are felled Annually for the Navy, immense used and abused for the Coal Works. As to the Ipecific Number of Trees felled for the Navy, I must refer you to the Deputy Surveyor j those used for the Coal Works to the Clerk of the Swanimote. Encroachments numberless, by building small Tenements, inclosing Gardens to the fame. One, Two, or Three Acres, by the idle Poor; and many large Inclosures by People in good Circumstances. Deftruftions shameful, of the Wood and Timber, in a great Measure owing to the Inattention of the Keepers in general. I wilh it lay in my Power to render you any Information, tending to the Preservation of the Timber remaining; nothing Ihort of a Capital Offence would, I believe, ever preserve it.

I remain, Gentlemen,

Your obedient Servant,

Little Dean, J. Pyrke.

The Answer of Roynon Esquire, Conservator, and One of the Vei derors of Dean Forest, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated 7 th June 1787.

The Paid Roynon Jones holds the Office of Conservator of His Majesty’s Forest of Dean, in the County of Glcu-

cester, and also the Office of One of the Verderors of the said Forest. As Conservator, he is to take Care of th6 Waste Lands inclosed in pursuance of the Statute 20th Ch‘IId. and of the Woods and Underwoods there

growing; and, as One of the Verderors, he is to attend the Forest Courts, and take the Presentments of the Keepers. To the Office of Conservator he was appointed by the Lords of the Treasury during Pleasure, and to the Office of Verderor he was elected in pursuance of His Majesty’s Writ, in open County, for Life; as Conservator, he receives a clear Annual Salary of £. 64, 16. which is paid by the Lord Warden; as Verderor, no Salary, Fees, or Emoluments, except One Buck and One Doe, Annually. As to Encroachments, Waste, and Spoil, within the said Forest, he hath from Time to Time caused Inclosures to be thrown open, and Cottages to be pulled down, and endeavoured to the utmost of his Power to prevent many other Spoils and Wastes committed within the Forest.

The Answer of Charles Edwin, Esquire, Chief Fo-rester in Fee, and Bowbearer, and One of the Woodwards of the Forest of Dean, in the County of Gloucester, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue; dated the 6th of September 1787.

The said Charles Edwin holds, by Inheritance, the Office of Principal and Matter Forester in Chief, or Chief Forester of His Majesty’s Forest of Dean, in the County of Gloucester; and also the Office of Bowbearer; and an Office intituled The Woodwardship of the Bearje, within the same Forest. He receives no Salary, Fee, or Emolument for the Exercise of either of the said Offices; but, by virtue of his Office of Chief Forester, he claims to be entitled to the Right Shoulder of all Bucks and Does killed within the said Forest, and also to Ten Fee Bucks and Ten Fee Does, Annually, to be there killed and taken at his own free Will and Pleasure, with Licence to hawk, hunt, fiffi, and fowl within and upon the Forest aforesaid. As Bowbearer, it is his Duty to attend His Majesty with a Bow and Arrow, and Six Men cloathed in Green, whenever His Majesty shall be pleased to hunt within the said Forest. He cannot set forth the Number of Deer therein, and does not know what Ve-nifon Warrants are executed within the Forest for the Use of His Majesty.

The marking and felling of Wood and Timber within the said Forest, under Warrants from the Treasury, is required to be done in the Presence and with the Approbation of Two or more Justices of the Peace for the County of Gloucester, and the proper Officers of the said Forest, and (as One of the Justices of the said County) he hath heretofore frequently attended the marking of Timber directed to be felled as aforesaid, and on such Occasions always objected to the marking of Timber in an improving State; but, his Objections being often over-ruled, and at length wholly disregarded, by the Deputy Surveyor and Keepers of the said Forest, he discontinued such Attendance, as he found it of no Use to attempt the Correction of an Abuse which it was not in his Power to prevent. By such and the like Abuses, and the general Waste, Spoil, and Destruction, the Wood and Timber within the Forest aforesaid lessens very much in Quantity every Year.

The Encroachments within the Forest are exceedingly numerous, and he believes many of them have been made by the Keepers themselves, as well as others; besides which, and the Destruction of Wood and Timber, many other Abuses have been, and dill continue to be committed within the Forest, to the great Injury of the Crown, and Destruction of the Forest; and, in particular, he remembers One Instance of Abuse, in the making and repairing of the Roads across the Forest, in the Time

6o± 18° Junii. A. 1788.

of the Surveyorship of the late Sir Edmund Thomas, as he was informed, by the Labourers then working on the Roads, that they were paid after the Rate of Eighteen Pence per Yard only for the making and repairing of such Roads 5 and, knowing that 3 per Yard was charged to Government for the same Works, he quelHoned Mr. Joseph Mc.bbatt,the then Deputy Surveyor, thereon, who admitted the Faff.

The Examination of Thomas Blunt, Deputy Surveyor of the Forest of Dean, in the County of Gloucester; taken upon Oath, the 29th Day Of March 1788.

This Examinant faith, That in the Month of September 1780 he was appointed Deputy Surveyor of Dean Forest, by John Pitt, Esquire, then Surveyor General of His Majesty’8 Woods, during Pleasure, at a Salary of Fifty Pounds per Annum:KThat the Duty of his Office, as Deputy Surveyor, was to execute such Warrants and Orders as were Officially sent to him from the Surveyor General, to whom he rendered an Account Annually of the Wood and Timber fold, and also of the Disbursements made in the Execution of Treasury Warrants, Rewards on the Conviction of Wood Stealers, and other incidental Outgoings: That the customary Fees or Perquisites of Office received by him, exclusive of his Salary, are as follows; (that is to say) Three Pence for every Cord of Wood made from the Wood and Timber felled under and by virtue of Treasury Warrants; the Tops of such Part of the Timber refused by the Purveyor of the Navy as unfit for Naval Use; the Tops of all Stolen Wood, and One Half Part of the Cordwood made from the Offal Wood of the Miners; and Four Pence or Six Pence for every Tree felled for the Use of the Miners; the Annual. Amount of which Fees and Perquisites he cannot ascertain, having never kept any Account thereof, but believes that for the First Two or Three Years of his Appointment he received from 3 to £. $00 per Annum, but is well allured that for the last Year he hath not received more than 250, his Salary included, out of which Sum he has paid many Charges and Outgoings which neither are or can be charged in his Accounts with the Surveyor General: That the Mode of Admeasurement of Timber felled for the Use of the Navy, according to the Practice used at the Time he first came into Office, was, for a certain Number of Trees to be marked, on the Spur of each Tree, by the Keeper or Keepers, in the Presence of the Contractor and Deputy Surveyor, which Trees were felected as fit for Naval Use by the Purveyor of the Navy, and a sufficient Number of Trees were set out as by their Computation would answer the Number of Loads ordered to be felled by the Warrant from the Treasury, and the Trees when felled were admeasured by the Contractor and Deputy Surveyor, who, from the accustomed Mode of Admeasurement, gave much greater Allowances than would have been done in the Admeasurement of Timber the private Property of Individuals, and as a Fee for such Admeasurement, the Deputy Surveyor received of the Contractor the Sum of One Shilling per Load, but all other Advantage arising from this Mode of Admeasurement was solely enjoyed by the Con traitor; but that, in the Admeasurement of Timber felled for the Use of the Navy in the Year 1782, there was, on the calling up of the Quantity of Timber so felled, a Surplus, which was divided between the Contractor and this Examinant, as Deputy Surveyor, which he was informed and believed had been the customary Practice of his Predecessors in Office, and on the D vision of such surplus Timber he received of the then Contractor the Sum of Fifty Pounds for his Share thereof, over and besides the usual Allowance of One Shilling per Load for the Admeasurement: That, conceiving this Pratice to be a growing Evil,

he acquainted Mr. Pitt, die then Surveyor General, therewith, who expressed his Disapprobation thereof, and he hath not, to the best of his Recolletion or Belief, at any Time since received any Fee or Present whatsoever on the Sale of any Timber felled for the Use of the Navy, but the Admeasurement of Timber felled subsequent to the said Year 1782, hath been always made at the respective Dock Yards whereat such Tinri-ber was delivered; That, during the Time he hath acted as Deputy Surveyor, he believes that about 5,500 Loads of Naval Timber hath been directed to be felled on Dean Forest, but the Timber actually delivered into His Majesty’s several Yards hath by Admeasurement greatly exceeded that Quantity, as the Examinant himself, since the Year 1783, to the 31st Day of last, hath delivered into Plymouth Dock Yard 3,024 Loads and 37 Feet of Naval Timber, and at Deptford and Woolwich Yards 2,783 Loads and Twenty-nine Feet, making together 5,808 Loads and 16 Feet, exclusive of the computed Quantity of 1,000 Loads delivered to Mr. Henry Mills (as Contractor for the Navy) in the Year 1781 and X782; That he cannot ascertain the Quantity, in Loads of Timber, felled for Wood Sales, a great Part thereof- having been sold by Auction un-measured, and in Lots of Trees frequently ferubbed and unthrifty: That no Fuel hath been cur, nor the Claim of any Person admitted or established for an Allowance of Wood or Timber, the Miners excepted: That no Justice of the Peace was ever present at the Time the Timber was marked for the Use of the Navy, but previous to the felling thereof it was viewed by Two Justices, who took a general View by riding through the Walk in which the Timber was marked, and afterwards certified the Number of Trees marked to be felled: That in the same of Wood Sales, in order to judge of the computed Quantity of Timber in the Trees marked to be felled, he always took with him a Person whom he thought of competent Knowledge as to the Quantity of Timber in a growing Tree, and with his Assistance made the Computation, and the Trees were marked by the Keeper, and viewed by the Justices before they were felled, in like Manner as the Timber felled for the Use of the Navy; That Sales by Public AuCtion were advertised in the Gloucester Paper only, on the Monday preceding the Day of Sale; and, for the Information of Persons wishing to become Purchasers, they were by such Advertisements referred to the Keeper or Keepers who marked the Trees; and the Timber, when sold by Public Auiftion, was put up to Sale in distinct Lots of a certain Number of Trees in each Lot; but Sales by Private Contract were not at all advertised, and the Timber so contracted for was measured and sold by the Load, and on such Sales, and until the End of the Year 1782, he in general received from the respective Purchasers certain Presents or Gratuities, but no fixed Rate or Price per Load; since which Period, he hath not received any Present or^ Gratuity for the Admeasurement of Timber, but such Admeasurement hath been true, just, and fair, to the best of his Knowledge, Recollection, and Belief: That, by virtue of several Treasury Warrants, and in pursuance of the Orders and Directions he from Time to Time received from the Surveyor General, he hath cut down many Trees which were growing on several of the Encroachments made on the Forest, and the Timber lb cut down was fold for the Benefit of the Crown, in the same Manner as Trees cut on any other Part of the Forest, and the Monies arising by the Sale thereof hath always been duly accounted for to the Surveyor General: That he hath never cut down any Tree on either of those Encroachments as a Fee or Perquisite to himself, but there have been many Instances of Trees growing on such Encroachments being cut down by those Persons who made the Encroachments, and converted to their own U fe; That he never received any Fee or Gratuity from any Person or Persons whomsoever, who 5 had

28 Geo* III* i8° Junii.

had made or attempted to make ariy Inclosure or Encroachment on the Forest, but he hath heard it reported, that Gratuities have been received by other Officers of the Forest, though he knows not the same of his own Knowledge, and hath only heard such Reports since the issuing of the Precepts from the Honourable the Commissioners of Land Revenue to the relpective Officers of this Forest: That he hath pulled down and destroyed many Cottages, Fences, and Inclosures, which have been made, or attempted to be made, during the Time he hath acted as Deputy Surveyor, and continued so to do . until within these Three Years last past, or thereabouts, when his Life and . Property were endangered by the repeated Threats and Insults of the En-croachers and their Party, which at Length compelled him to desist therefrom: That, upon every Application for Timber by the Miners, for the Use of their Works, the Keeper of the Walk in which the Mine is situated informs the Steward of the Swanimote Court, that Timber is wanted for such a Work, who issues his Order for the Allowance thereof, directed to the Keeper, which Timber is then delivered to the Applicant; and he believes that within the Time of his Knowledge there has been about 1,000 Loads of Oak Timber Annually felled for the Use of the Miners, of which at least One-fifth Part has been fit for Naval Purposes; and that the great Waste, Spoil, and Destruction of the Timber and Wood on the Forest is and hath been occasioned by an improper Application of the Timber delivered to the Miners for the Use of their Works, as he apprehends and believes that One Moiety or Half Part of the Timber which they have had delivered to them would have been more than sufficient to have answered every needful Purpose to which it ought to have been appropriated; and the Abuses which have existed, and do now exist, in the Forest, are principally owing to the great Increase of the Coal Works, the not holding regular Courts at the Speech House as usual for the Trial of Offenders, the depaftur-ing a greater Number of Horses, Sheep, and Swine on the Forest than were formerly permitted, the Officers of the Forest being suffered to accept Fees and Perquisites, the Insufficiency of the Forest Laws, and the Lenity Ihewn by the Justices to Wood Stealers, by a Mitigation of their Penalties when convicted: That, under the Authority and Direction of the Surveyor General, he hath frequently seized large Quantities of Offal Timber, and such other Timber as the Miners could not use in their Works; and in particular, that on or about the 28th Day of January 1783, he seized and took 586 Feet of Oak Timber, and morfc than 200 Cleft Pieces of Oak, called Kibbles, which were found on the Grounds of one George Martin, who, after such Seizure, acknowledged that the same had been unlawfully taken and hauled away from off the said Forest, and that the same was the Property of His Majesty: He also seized, at the Fire Engine on the Forest, between Two and Three Waggon Loads of Timber, hewn up and converted by the Colliers into Coopers Wares for Market: That he divided and applied such Seizures agreeable to the Instructions he received from Mr. Pitt; and, by the Sale of 96 Loads and 19 Feet of Timber so seized, he caused a House to be built in Staplidge Inclosure, for the Preservation of that Inclosure, which colt Forty-three Pounds, or thereabouts, and the Balance of the Timber fold still remains to be accounted for by this Examinant: That for preventing, as much as possible, the like Abuse in future, he hath taken divers Bonds and other Securities, in large Penalties, to be forfeited by the Obligors, in case they Should ever after be detected in the stealing of Wood and Timber from the Forest, or misapplying the Timber delivered to them for the Use of their Works: That the Roads which have been made and repaired in the Forest since his Appointment, have in general been so done by Persons immediately employed by himftlf, an Ellimate having been first made by Two Vol. XLIII.

Persons appointed by him to measure and value the Works intended to be done, which, if approved of by the Surveyor General, the Examinant then undertook the Works, at the Rate or Price fixed on by such Two Persons; and the Works, when compleated, were fur-Veyed by Two Justices of the Peace, who certified the same to be executed agreeable to the Contraft: Thac there are Two Great Roads leading across the Forest; which have been made and kept in Repair by the Produce of Timber felled and fold for that Purpose, and ori which by far the greater Part of the Expence for Roads has been bellowed; the one enters the Forest at Michel Dean, and proceeds quite across the Forest to ,

the other Road leads from Little Dean to Colford: These Two Roads have been made chiefly with a View to the Convenience of the Public, being the principal Roads from Gloucester to South Wales; neither of which Roads, nor others which have been made and amended at a considerable F.xpence to the Crown, are any Way conducive to the Preservation of the Forest, as they are but of little Use in the Conveyance of Timber felled for the Use of the Navy, the Navy Timber in general being carried by a distinct Road, leading from the Forest towards BLakeny, which induces him to believe that

the Roads lately made are disadvantageous to the Forest, more Carts and Waggons having been used since the making of the Roads, in the fetching and carrying away of Coal, greater Quantities of Timber used in the Coal Works, and much more Timber secretly conveyed away under the Coal, than heretofore; which Practice he believes might in a great Measure be prevented, by the erecting of Turnpike Gates on the Roads, the Tolls whereof would be fully sufficient to keep the Roads in necessary Repair: That he hath also made and repaired the Fences in the Forest, and employed Labourers, either by Contract or Day Work, in those Businesses; and when the Works were compleated, a Receipt was taken for the Total Amount of the Monies paid, either from the Contractor, or from some One of the Workmen, which was a Voucher for the Allowance thereof to him in his Account with the Surveyor General: That out of the Monies by him charged for making and repairing the Roads and Fences aforesaid, he always paid to the Surveyor General the Sum of One Shilling in the Pound: That from the Time of his Appointment to the Office of Deputy Surveyor, until about Midfammer 1783, he retained, for the Use of the Surveyor General, the Ctiftomary Fee of One Shilling in the Pound, out of the Monies by him received for all Wood and Timber felled by virtue of Warrants ififued from the Treasury for Wood Sales within the Forest; but that, since the said Year 1783, it has been the Practice (as the more eligible Mode of collecting such Poundage) to calculate or receive from the relpective Purchasers of such Wood and Timber so felled as aforesaid, the Purchase Money for the same in Guineas, and account to the Crown only for so many Pounds, by which the additional Shilling was retained without Account; so that, in FaCt, the Surveyor General received £.5 per Cent, out of such Purchase Monies, over and besides the Sum of One Shilling in the Pound, which this Examinant is informed and believes is allowed by the Auditor on the same Monies, on passing his Account, which together made a Fee or Perquilite to the Surveyor General of Ten Pounds per Cent, on the Produce of all Wood Sales, exclusive of the Sum of One Shilling in the Pound paid to the Surveyor General by the Examinant, out of the Monies by him charged for making and repairing the Roads and Fences as aforesaid.

That when the Miners supplied from his Walk are in Want of Timber for the Use of their Works, they apply to the per, who thereupon views such Works; and when satisfied that Timber wanted for such Works, he certifies the same to the Steward of the Swanimote Court, who issues an Order for the Deli very of such Timber. That the Orders are brought by the respective Miners to the Keeper, who, with the Deputy Sur veyor, or his Agent, attended by the Miners, mark and deliver the Timber accordingly.

That none are delivered fit for the Navy, excepting when the Miners are sinking new Pits, and taking up old Pits, when it is necessary for them to have good cleft Timber; and that the Trees for cleft Stuff might be applied to Naval Purposes.

Misapplication of Timber by Colliers.

That he hath had frequent Reason to believe that Part of the Timber delivered to the Miners for the Use of their Works hath often been misapplied, and Informations have been exhibited against some of them, and the Offenders punched for such Abuse; and in particular, about 3 Years since he delivered Oak. Timber to one Ja‘ Tingle, a Free Miner, and his Verns (or Partners) at a Coal Work called The Fire ,

and a Suspicion arising that Part of such Timber was converted and secreted by such Miners, an Information was made, and a Search Warrant obtained, when a large Quantity of Vessel Heading and Staves for Calks, containing about Tons, was found in the Possession of the said Tingle, but for Want of sufficient Evidence of the Conversion of such Timber the Miners were only compelled to pay the Cods of the Proceedings, and enter into Bond for their future good Conduct; which Heading and Staves were divided between himself, the Deputy Surveyor, and his Assistants, as Perquisites of Office,

That he hath at Times had great Reason to fuf-pedt the Colliers mifap-plying Part of the Timber delivered to them, by having found Vessel Timber for Coopers Ware hid near their Works, which he hath taken away; but as -he could not prove that it was from such Timber, he hath never been able to convict any Miner for such Offence.

Does not remember any Knees or Bends to have ever been cut out of the Timber delivered to the Miners within his Walk.

Thar he hath had frequent Reason to believe that the Miners have misapplied Part of the Timber delivered to them for the Use of their Works, and particularly, about g Years since, he saw one Wm Wheatjhne load Horses with Part of the Timber by him delivered, for the Use of a Coal Work called The Tail Levell, for which an Indictment was preferred against IVhcatstone, who was convicted, and fined £. 5 for such Abuse.

That, about £ or 6 OO Years since. One Knee and 3 Crooks or Bends (7) were taken out of Miners [rj Timber in his Walk, by Q Order of the Deputy Sur- veyor* but whether the hh same was fit for Naval Use, or how disposed of afterwards, he cannot fee forth.

That he hath heard, and believes, the Miners have frequently misapplied a Part of their Tirrr-aer, by disposing of the same for Board, Quarter, and other Purposes for Tuilding, and he hath OO taken from divers Per- ° ions at different Times a Quantity of Vessel Staves 5^ aewn up for the Purpose of making Casks, which is now in his Poflfeflion.

That Timber is delivered from his Walk to 2 Pits, called Trut Blue and IVin dr ells, out of the limits of the Forest, but within the Hundred of S' Briavells, paying Gale to the Gaveller of the oreft.

Believes Part of the Timber hath been frequently misapplied, he having several Times found fresh Oak Timber converted into Spokes for Wheels and Staves for Veflftls, hid and (ecreted in and about several Coal Works within his Walk, and for such Misapplication the Miners so offending have been refused Timber for a considerable Time afterwards j which Spokes and Staves, when found, he hath taken to his own Use as a Per-quifite of Office, and the Quantity he hath so taken within the last io Years may have amounted in the Whole to One Ton, or F thereabouts.

REPORT of the Solicitor of the T reafury, relative to Depredations committed in Dean Forest; with an Order to the Surveyor General of the Woods, to offer Rewards for the Discovery of Offenders.

To the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury.

My Lords,

In Obedience to your Lordships Orders, signified to me by Mr. Secretary Robinson, transmitting to me a Report of the Surveyor General of His Majesty’s Woods, on a Letter from Mr. Stephens, withlnclosures from the Commissioners of the Navy, respecting Abuses committed in Dean Forest, in cutting down the King’s Timber, and directing me to report to your Lordships what Steps may be proper to be taken to prevent such Abuses in future; 1 humbly certify to your Lordships, That on looking into a Copy of a Letter from Mr. Slade, Purveyor to the Commissioners of the Navy, which is One of the Inclosures in Mr. Letter, I find he mentions,1 that in the Course of his Survey in Dean Forest,he had discovered and was informed of most lhameful Depredations of the Oak Timber, which was cut every Day by Persons living round the Forest; and that for some Years it had been a Custom to ftcal the Body of the Tree in the Night, and cut it into Coopers Ware, leaving the Top Part on the Spot, which the Keepers take as their Perquisite j and that at that Time whole Trees Wert conveyed every Spring Tide to Bristol; and that when he Was at Gat comb, in One Day there were 5 or 6 T earns came with Timber Planks and Knees Winter-felled, and other Timber, among which were several useful Pieces.' for Ships of 64 and 50 Guns: And I further certify to your Lordships, that the Surveyor General of His Majesty’s Woods, to whom the said Information was referred, in his Report thereon, confirming the Purveyor’s Account of Abuses committed in the Forest, and that every Thing in his Power had been done to put a Stop to them, but that the Offenders were become so desperate and daring, as to bid Defiance to his Deputies, and render every Attempt of his, in a summary Way, totally ineffectual j and he referred to a former Report of his, made in October last, when he stated, that, in the preceding Month, a Number of Persons in Disguise had openly cut down Two large Timber Trees at Torkley, in Dean Forest, and wounded several Keepers who attempted to of-pose them , and that, as the Offenders could not be found, he proposed that a Reward of £. 50 should be

$ offered

18 Geo. III. i8° Junii. 625

Offered to any Person making a Discovery whereby any of the Offenders could be sonvifted i and likewise the famd Reward, or any other your Lordships Should think proper, and His Majesty’s Pardon, to any Person concerned* making the like Discovery of Two or more of his Accomplices: And 1 further humbly certify to your Lordships, that I am humbly of Opinion, that it is much to be lamented that Mr. Slade, the Purveyor, when he saw the 5 of 6 Teams with Timber at Gatcomb, did not endeavour to trace from whence they came, and to whom they belonged,

as an Enquiry of that Sort might have led to the Offenders, and who then might have been prosecuted; but as the Name of every Offender is unknown, and Informations only go to the Commission of the Offences, I am humbly of Opinion that the Surveyor General of His Majesty’s Woods has pointed out the only Method that can be pursued in the present Cafe; and that by offering a Reward of ^.50, or such other Reward as your Lordships may think proper, to be paid by the Surveyor out of Monies arising by Wood Sales in the Forest, to any Person making Discovery whereby any of the Offenders who cut down the Two Trees at Torkley, on the 23d of September last, may be convicted; and likewise the same Reward, and His Majesty’s Pardon, to an Accomplice making such Discovery, so as Two or more may be convicted; and also a Reward of £. 20, or such other Reward as your Lordships may judge proper, to any Person who shall hereafter discover any Person who shall be guilty of unlawfully cutting, down an Oak Tree in the said Forest, it may tend not only to procure a Conviction of some of the Offenders guilty of the Outrage at Torkley, but to deter others from cutting down the Timber in future, for fear of a Discovery.

All which is submitted,

The Examination of Miles Hartland, Afiiftaht to the Deputy Surveyor in Dean Forest taken on Oath, the 15th May 1788.

This Examinaht 'was born at Newent, within Six Miles of the Forest of Dean. He is now about Fifty-one Years of Age, and has known the Forest from a Boy j but has been better acquainted with the State of it for about Twenty Years past.

He has been employed in the said Forest for about Six Years past, under Mr. ’Thomas the Deputy to the Surveyor General, from whom he has a Deputation to assist him in the Execution of his Office. His chief Employment has been to superintend the Falls of Timber for the Navy, or for Sale; to mark proper Timber for the Colliers, for the Use of their Works; and to prevent them, as far as he is able, from misapplying it. His Salary is £.20 a Year, paid by Mr. Blunt-, is. a Day for attending the Fellers, Strippers, and Wood Cutters, while they are at Work; and he receives a Share of the Fines and Rewards paid on Conviction of such Timber Stealers as are detected and apprehended by him, or with his Assistance.

The State of the Forest, with respect to Inclosures, at the Time of his Appointment, was as follows: Before his Appointment there had been several Inclosures made in the Forest, namely, the Buckholt, which was made many Years before his Remembrance; the Great Inclo/ure, Stone edge, Coverham, The Perch, Serridge, East Haywood, and West Haywood, which were made within his Remembrance, and since the Commencement of His present Majesty’s Reign. All these Inclosures were open at the Time of his Appointment. The Buckholt Inclosure was repaired soon afterwards, hath ever since been kept in Repair, and is now well {locked with young Oak and Beech, but chiefly the latter, which requires thinning, and would produce great Quantities of Cordwood, besides leaving a full Stock of growing Timber. The Fences of most of the other Inclosures were broke and destroyed soon after they were made; and such Parts of them as consisted of Pales, Posts, and Rails, were carried away publickly by the Country People, in Carts and Waggons. They have not since been repaired; and he believes that none of the Inclosures he has mentioned, except the Buckholt, has contributed in any Degree to the Increase of Timber, or Advantage of the Forest.

There have been Three Indolures made since he has held his present Employment; viz. Inclo/ure,

and a small Inclosure near the -Speech Hou/e, both of which were Part of the Great Inclo/ure; and Birch Wood

Inclo/ure, which was Part of Serridge Inclo/ure before mentioned. All these were made in One Season, about Five or Six Years ago, and set with Acorns; and there are a great Number of young Oak Plants now growing in them, many of which are in a thriving Condition; but the small Inclosure near the Speech Hou/e having been ploughed, the Ground lying hollow, harbours Mice and other Vermin, which eat the Acorns, and destroy the young Plants.

The Parts of the Forest where the best Timber is now growing, are fqme Parts of the Speech Hou/e Walk, and Park End and Worcester Walks. There is very little Timber in Ruardean Walk, except in the Lea Bailey, where it is mostly small. Some Timber of good Size, and a great Deal of small Timber, in William Stephens’s Walk. In Little Dean Walk, there is now a-very small Quantity; but this Examinant remembers a great Quantity of Timber Handing upon Edgehills, and the Che/-nutts, and East and West Haywood. The greatest Part of the Timber upon the Che/nutts was cut for building the Infirmary at Gloucester, upwards of Twenty-five Year* ago. The Soil of the Che/nutts is particularly x

Well suited for the Growth of Oak, arid would be well (locked in a little Time, if it were not cut> as it now constantly is, by the neighbouring Inhabitants, for Fuel and other Purposes. He believes that the Stock of Timber in the Forest is less now than it was Twenty Years ago, but cannot say how much left; and he believes that it lessens every Year, by Reason that there has not been an Increase by Inclosure proportionate to the Quantity felled within that Time.

The Parts of the Forest now bare of Timber; which he thinks fitted to be inclosed for the Growth of Timber; are the followings — In John Brett’s Walk — Hazle Hill, and Edge Hills (including Tanner’s Hill, Green Bottom, and Green Hill) which lie together, and might be made One Inclosure: Badeock’s Bailey, and the Che/-nutts, which, if inclosed, rnuft be separate; as there is a Road between them: East Haywood and West ,

between which is also a Road frdm Little Dean ahd other Places to the Fire Engine Coal Works.

In William Stephens’s Walk — That Part of Great St a* pleage which is not already inclosed; -

beach, and Putmage; all these might come into One Inclosure: Buckhall Moor, Bradley Hill, and several Parj eels near them, might be included in another Inclo-» sure.

In Robert East'sWa!k — Birehen Dingles and Ma/ort's

Tump, which lie together; Bla, separate; Breames Eves and Howell Hill,together.

In Richard Bennett's Walk — The Perch and Ccverhatn, between which runs the main Road to Cole/ord-, and Great and Little Bonrts, which lie together.

In Richard Bradley's Walk — The Lea Bailey, Bailey Hill, and Lining IVcod, which might belaid together; Great and Little Berry together; and Finds and thers Tump together.

In Thomas Harvey’s Walk — Blackthorn T and Serridge together; Salleys separate; Ridge fepa-

rate; Daniel Moor and Beecbenbta together. These Places are now very bare of Timber, but are of a very proper Soil, ancf would produce great Store of good Timber, if inclosed and taken Care of.

The Kinds of Fencing which he thinks best adapted for Inclosures in the Forest, are a Ditch about Three Feet deep, and about Three Feet and a Half wide, with a Quick Hedge planted upon the Bank, and fenced with a Dead Hedge until the Quick becomes a sufficient Fence. He cannot recommend Posts, Rails, or Pales in any Cafe, as they consume a great deal of Timber, and are liable to be soon stolen. Where the Rock lies near the Surface, the Fence mult be made of Stone, which may be dug on the Spot, and the Wall built up Batterywife, fb as to leave a Ditch on the Outside.

He conceives the most likely Method to produce Timber in the Inclosures is, to fow Acorns, Beech Mad, and Hawberries, Hazle Nuts, Holly Berries, and the Seeds of most other Kinds of Wood at once, as they thrive best together, destroy the Fern, and produce the quickest Crop of Underwood, which trains up and protects the Oaks, and would in Time amply pay the Expence of Fencing, by producing Stuff for Cordwood, &c. of which the Buckholt is an Example: Buc if Oak. only is to be produced, the best Way of planting the Acorn is, either by turning up a Turf, and putting an Acorn or Two uoder it, or making a Hole with a sharp Instrument to put in the Acorns. He thinks that the young Oaks would be out of the Reach of cropping by Cattle in about Twenty-five Years; but the Timber, even when grown to a good Size, as well as the Succession of young Wood, would at all Times thrive better, if kept continually inclosed, and protected from Cattle of all Sorts.

The Parts of the Forest in which the principal Collieries are situate, are these: The I-evel of the Fire Engine Colliery, which is One of the principal Works, is in the Bottom between Na Bridge and Cinder/ord Bridge, and there are Pits aft along the Bottom." There.

are

$.8 Geo. III. i&6 Junk.

are several Levels in the feottom from Beechenhurfi along the Helves quite up to Nail Bridge. Another large Field of Coal from Whit ecr oft Bridge (at the Back of White Mead Park) along the Helves to Great Mojeley

Green, and from thence through Pallet Tuft and Aures Glow, almost up to Little Sjapleage. These are the Works which do the greatest Mischief to the Forest; There are some others on the Coleford Side, frorh which a great Deal of Coal is raised. Very little Timber is growing in any of these Helve; and Inclosures might be made in the Forest, so as to exclude all the principal Coal Works.

The Coal Works in the Forest supply with Fuel the lower Parts of Gloucestershire beyond Severn, and some Parts across the Severn about Berkeley; the greatest Part of llercfordshire, the Town of , and Part of the

County of Monmouth. There are Three Sorts of Coal dug in the Forest, which are sold at different Prices: The Hdufe Coal, at about Four Shillings, or Four Shillings and Six Pence per Ton; Smith Coal, about Two Shillings and Six Pence per Ton; and Lime Coal fof "Manure, about Eighteen Pence per Ton; all at the Pit. If the working of the Collieries in the Forest were to be Hopped, the Country could be supplied with Coal brought down the Severn from Shropshire, br brought from Wales. The Price of the Severn Coal at Nezvn-ham is about Fourteen or Fifteen Shillings per Ton. He does not know at what Price the Coal imported by the Severn could be supplied to the Counties of Monmouth and Hereford, \(conveyed by the River Wye. A great deal of Forest Coal is now sent by the Wye, but he cannot say at what Expence. The Distance from the House Coal Pits to the Wye is about Four Miles, and the Expence of Carriage to the Wye about Five Shillings per Ton. He does not think that an Advance of One Shilling per Ton on the Forest Coal would be likely to induce those who are now supplied with Coal from the Forest, to purchase Coal from the Severn in Preference. The Expence of conveying the Coal by the'

Wye into Herefordshire, he thinks, would be greater th/lft. the Expence of fending the Forest Coal in the -lame Manner. He does not apprehend that if' the working the Collieries in the Forest were to be flopped, very considerable Dimage would be done to the Timber in the Forest, by taking Wood for Fuel; but thinks, if the Coal Works were flopped, the Colliers mull starve, not being able: to get a Livelihood in any other Way.

" He does not know, nor ever made any Calculation, what Quantity of Timber is Annually delivered tof the Miners. The Sorts of Wood or Timber delivered to them are Oak and Beech, and none other; chiefly Oak in the Summer, more Pits being funk in the Summer than in the Winter, and the Keepers having the Bark; more Beech is allowed in the Winter than Oak: But Oak Timber is necessary, and is always allowed for sinking the Pits, and for making what the Miners call the Gateway or Gangway from the Body of Coal to the Pit, and also for the Gutters in the Levels for draining off the Water; but Beech, Birch, Orle, Holly, or any other Kind of Wood, would serve for the Purpose of getting Coal, and supporting the Earth after the Coal is taken away, but none is ever delivered to them but Oak and Beech. He believes that much of the Timber delivered to the Miners for their Works is misapplied. He has frequently found Oak Timber in the Possession of the Colliers, converted into Stave* and Spokes for Coopers and Wheelwrights: And it is extremely difficult to prevent such Misapplication; for if the Colliers are detected in doing it, the Justices will uot fine them.

or take Cognizance of it as an Offence, iirilefs the Officer will swear that the Timber is the King’s Property; which ic is very difficult to ascertain, after it has beert cut up and converted by the Colliers. The only Method of punishing them for such Misapplication, at pre-ferlt, is by refusing to deliver any more Timber to them, which has frequently been done after such Detedion. If Timber were to be refused entirely, he believes the Colliers would take it by Force.

The principal Roads in the Forest are, the Road from Michel Hean to Colford, which is the High Road from London to Monmouth and South Wales; and the Road from Little Hean to Colford. These Two are public High Koads, not necessary or useful to the Forest, but rather detrimental to it, by affording the readier Means to convey away the Coal in Waggons and Cam, iti which Timber has sometimes been found concealed; Besides the above, there are several Roads leading front the Forest to Newland, Colford, and St. Briavel’s, which

have been kept in Repair at the Charge of the Forest; but are of no Use to it, rather the contrary. The only Road now used for conveying the Navy Timber is the Burton Road, which is the most convenient for Carriage to the Waterside from all Parts of the Forest, except the Chefnutts and Edge Hills, in Brett's Walk, and the Bailey in Bradley's Walk; but there is no Navy Timber, now in either of these Places, except the Lea Bailey. If the repairing of the public Roads at the Charge of the Forest were to be discontinued, the Public would be obliged to put up Turnpike Gates on the Roads, and collect Tolls for repairing them, as in other Parts of the Country.

The Number of the Cottages and Encroachments in the Forest, he believes, is nearly doubled flnee he ha* known it. The Persons who inhabit the Cottages are chiefly poor labouring People, who are induced to seek Habitations in the Forest, for the Advantages of living -Relit-free, and having the Benefit of Pafturagefor a Cow o or a few Sheep, and of keeping Pigs in the Woods; but many Encroachments have been made by People of Substance. The Cattle of the Cottagers are impounded when the Forest is driven by the Keepers, as all other Cattle are; and when the Owners take them from the Pound (paying the usual Fees to the Keepers) they turn, them again into the Forest, having no other Means of maintaining the m. The greater umber of the Cottagers are from the neighbouring Parishes; but there are also a great many from Wales, and from various Parts of England remote from the Forest: They are detrimental to the Forest, by cutting Wood for Fuel, and for building Huts, and making Fences to the Patches which they inclose from the Forest; by keeping Pigs, 'Sheep, &c. in the Forest all the Year; and by stealing Timber.

The Inhabitants in general in the Neighbourhood arc benefited by the Common of Pasturage in the Forest,. but chiefly the Farmers, who keep great Numbers of Cattle anti Sheep in the Forest in the Summer, and taka them out in the Fence Month and Winter Haining. He does not know that any Distinction is made by the Keepers between the Cattle of Commoners and Foreigners. If a Division of the Forest were to take Place, he apprehends that sufficient Allotments might be set out, in convenient Situations, for the Use of the Parishes having Right of Common, so as to admit of an Inclosure for the Cultivation of Timber of the Parts best adapted for that Purpose; but he cannot form any Judgment of the Disposition of the Country to agree tot such a Division or not.

The Forest of Dean is divided into Six Walks, called by the several Names of Worcester Walk, Ruerdean Walk, Little Dean Walk, Blakeney Walk, and Park End Walk which are under the Care of Six Keepers, each of whom has a Lodge, and other Buildings, with a Garden, and from 30 to 50

Acres of Land, inclosed from the Forest, as particularly described in the Plan thereof.-In Three of these

Walks the Whole of the Lands belong to the Crown. In the other Three, there are some Parcels of Land belonging to or claimed by Individuals, as Freehold. And in all the Walks (except The Speech Walk) there are numerous Cottages built, and Encroachments made, on the Lands belonging to the Crown.

The Names and Quantities of the Inclosures which have been made in this Forest for the Cultivation of Timber, and the present Condition of each, ap-e as follows:

A, R. 1*.

The Great Inclo/ure, which contained 743. o. 25, was begun to be made about Twelve Years ago with

Poll and Rails, but before the Whole was compleated, a great Part was taken away, and nothing now remains but the Bank; there are no young Trees of any Kind.

A. R. P«

Stonedge Inclo/urewas made about Twelve Years ago; it contained 125. I. 10, and was fenced with a dry Stone Wall, which is for the most Part destroyed; there are a great many Thorns and Hollies, with some very fine latge Oak. but no young Timber of any Kind coming up.

A. R. P.

Coverbam Inclo/ure, which contained 350. 2. 34, was made about Fifteen Years ago, Part with dry Stone Wall, and Part Post and Rails; nothing now remains of this Inclosure but the Bank, notwithstanding which there is a great Quantity of young Timber, for the moll Part Beech, with a few Oaks.

A. R. P.

The Perch Inclo/ure contained 198. 2. 26, and was also made about Fifteen Years ago, Part with dry Stone Wall, and Part Poll and Rails; nothing but the Bank now remains. — There was a great Quantity of young Timber, particularly Beech, in this Inclosure, which is nearly all destroyed in Consequence of the Fences being pulled down.

A. R. P-

Serridge Inclo/ure was made about Twelve Years ago, it contained 409. 3. 20, and was fenced with a dry Stone Wall, of which but little remains, being quite open in many Parts; there are no young Trees of any Sort, and but few old Trees.

a. ' r. r.

IleyiDood Inclo/ure contained 715. 3. 38, and was made about Ten Years ago, Part with a dry Stone Wall, and Part Pales, very few Traces of which now remain, and in some Parts none at all. We have been informed that great Part of the Wall was pulled down, or fell, before the Whole was compleated, and the Pales carried away by Waggons, See. soon after they were put up, and from its present Appearance, it is evident no Advantage has been derived from this Inclosure, as there are no young Trees in any Part of it.

A. K. P.

The Three following Inclosures, containing together 323. 1. 33, are all that remain inclosed and in good Repair (except the Buckbolt Inclo/ure after mentioned.)

A. X. V.

Stapleage Inclo/ure, containing 183. 1. 3, has been made about Five Years, Part with dry Stone Wall, and Part dead Hedge; in general in good Repair. — In some Parts of it there are some small Oak and Beech Plants, and also a few large Oaks and Beeches.

A. R. P.

Speech Hou/e Inclo/ure, containing 5. o. 6, was made about Four Years ago by the Deputy Surveyor, and planted with Acorns, which have produced some young Oaks.

A. R. P.

Birch Wood Inclo/ure, containing 135. o. 24, has been made about Five Years, Part with dead Hedge, and Part dry Stone W all, which in general is in good Repair; there are but few young Oaks coming up.

A. R P-

Buckbolt Inclo/ure,which contains 352. 3. 20, has been made about Eighty Years, the greatest Part with a Stone Wall, the rest Hedge and Ditch. The Fences of this Inclosure have of late Years been kept in good Repair. — There are some very fine large Oaks in it, but in general it contains a great Quantity of fine young Beech, — There are also some Oak Trees of about Ten or Fifteen Years Growth, and young Oaks are coming up from Acorns which have been set in vacant Places. A few Weymouth Pines have also been planted in this Inclosure. which grow very well.

With respect to the Timber now growing in the said Forest, not having been instructed to make a particular Survey thereof, we have only taken it by general Observation, and have computed it to be as follows; viz'.

24.000 Oak Trees, which will measure upon an Average One Load and a Quarter each. Girt Measure; and

22.000 Oak Trees, which will measure upon an Average Half a Load each.

This Calculation is exclusive of unfound Trees, of which there are many. There is also a considerable Number of fine large Beech, as well as young growing Trees, in several Parts of the Forest. The principal Stock of young Timber, from which any Expectation can be formed at present, is in the Lea Bailey and Lining , which in general are well {locked, and would produce a considerable Quantity of fine Timber, if properly fenced and protected from the Depredations of Plunderers.

We have examined the Survey of the Timber made in 1783, and compared it with our own Observations; and we shall only say, upon the Subject of that Survey, that if it was accurately and justly taken at the Time, an im-menle Quantity of Timber must have been in one Way or other taken down in the Forest since that Period.

PROPOSAL for new Inclosures.

From the particular Situation of the Forest of Dean with respect to Coal Pits and other Circumstances, we should recommend that Six Inclosures be made in the Forest, to contain in the Whole about 18,000 Acres. By this Method the principal Roads, Coal Mines, and open Parts of the Forest, may be left out of the Inclosures, which is absolutely necessary to be attended to, as it would otherwise be altnoft impossible to prevent the Destruction of the Timber and young Trees.

The next Thing to be considered is the Expence of inclosing and planting them; and, as the Forest of Dean is in general of a good Soil, and very proper for the Produce of Oak Timber, we have confined ourselves to that in particular, and formed the following Estimate accordingly.

EXPLANATION of the preceding Estimate.

Having computed that there are now growing in the Forest 24,000 Oak Trees, containing on an Average about a Load and a Quarter each, amounting to 30,000 Loads, we estimate that at the lowest Calculation

1.500 Loads, Girt Measure, may be Annually cut, for 25 Years, from this Stock. We have likewise computed that there are about 22,000 Oak Trees, measuring on an Average Half a Load each: During the first 25 Years those 22,000 Trees will have encreased in Proportion, and will no Doubt keep up the Supply of

1.500 Loads Annually, for 20 Years longer, by which Time there will be a Succession of Timber from the Tillers now growing in the Lea Bailey, Edge Hills, Che/nuts, &c. and which we apprehend may afford a Supply of 1,500 Load per Annum for 25 Years more; so that we estimate there may be a constant Fall of 1,500 Loads per Annum for 70 Years, from the present Stock: At the End of which Time the new Plantations which we have proposed will be coming to Maturity.

Having before recommended the Inclosure of 18,000 Acres in Six Divisions, we propose that the Whole Should be planted as soon as possible, in the following Manner:

A sufficient Number of Men to be employed in the Autumn, to turn Sofls upside down, at 3 Foot apart, or as near that Distance as the present Cover will admit, and that others be employed to plant One or Two Acorns in each of the Sods, with a Dibber. This Work may be continued from the Beginning of November to the Middle of March, except in frosty Weather.

At the End of the first Ten Years after planting, every other Tree will require to be taken out, which will leave them at 6 Foot apart; the Faggots produced from this Thinning will do little more than pay for the Labour.

At 15 Years Growth it will again be necessary to have every other Tree taken out, which will leave them at 12 Foot apart; and the Faggots produced from this Cutting will be worth ioi. Acre more than the Expence of Cutting.

At 25 Years Growth, 132’Trees Should be cut down upon each Acre, and the Whole of the Underwood, which will leave the Trees at 16 Foot apart. In this Cutting Attention Should be paid to leave those Trees which are the most thrifty, and likely to produce the best Timber, even if they Should not be exattly at the proper Distances. The Underwood will be worth 50 s.per Acre more than the Expence of Cutting, and the Tillers yd. each.

At 35 Years the Underwood Should be again cut, and the Oaks thinned, so as to leave them at 20 Foot apart. The Tillers will then be worth is. 6 d.each, and the Underwood 40 per Acre.

At 45 Years the Underwood Should be again cut, and the Oaks thinned, so as to leave 75 Trees upon each Acre, the 34 Trees then to be cut will be worth, upon an Average, 10 each, and the Underwood 30 per Acre.

At 55 Years, 5 Trees upon each Acre Should be cut, which will be worth 15 each.

At 60 Years, 5 Trees on each Acre, which will be worth 18 each.

At 65 Years, 5 Trees on each Acre, worth 24*. each; at 70 Years 5 Trees more, worth 1. 12. o. each. At 75 Years 5 Trees more, worth £.2. 7. o. each. At 80 Years, we suppose that many of the Trees will be come to Maturity, and therefore, instead of cutting those Trees which are the worst, as it will be adviseable to do till this Period, those Trees that have done growing Should then be chosen; and as they will probably be large, we compute that 5 Trees may be then cut on each Acre, worth £. 3. 3 each.

At 85 Years, a Trees on each Acre may be cut, worth £. 5 each. At 90 Years, One Tree, worth 6. At 95 Years, One Tree, worth £.7. And at 100 Years, One Tree may be cut, worth £. 8, upon each Acre.

There will then remain 40 Trees upon each Acre, which, upon i8,oco Acres, is 7^20,000 Trees; but as many Parts of the Forest are at present covered with Timber, which cannot be immediately cleared, the Whole of the 720,000 Trees will not be of 100 Years Growth; but they will nevertheless supply a constant Fall of 7,200 Trees per Annum for ever, provided Acorns shall be planted to supply the Place of every Tree felled, and only One of those Acorns shall come to Maturity; by which Means a constant Succession will be kept up, and those 7,200 Trees may be expected to contain 14,400 Loads of Timber, Girt Measure, or si,600 Loads Square Measure, and will be worth £. 57,600.

And although we have before recommended the Annual Fall of 1,500 Loads from the Timber now growing upon the Forest, yet we think it more adviseable to have the Whole of the Timber in the Forest examined, and all those Trees marked to be cut down which have done growing, and will not improve, by which Method the Forest will be better cleared for the new Plantations.

African slave Sir William Dolben presented to the House, accord-Bili prkicnted. ing to Order, a Bill to regulate, for a limited Time, the shipping and carrying Slaves, in British Vessels, from the Coast of Africa: And the same was received; and read the First Time.

Resolved, That the Bill be read a Second Time.

Petition from A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are gainrtuL thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves and all African slave other Persons, of the Town of carrying on

Bill. or concerned in the Trade, was presented to

the House, and read j Setting forth, That the Petitioners are informed, that a Bill has lately been brought into the House, for the Purpose of regulating the shipping and carrying of Slaves, in British Vessels, from the Coast of Africa to His Majesty's Islands and Plantations in ‘The West; and that not only the Principle on which the said Bill is founded, but many if not all of the Clauses and Provisions therein, trench upon, and are injurious to, the Rights of the Petitioners; that the Clause which exempts Persons under Contraft for furnishing Foreign Sovereigns or States with Slaves from the Restrictions and Regulations contained in the said Bill, is a peculiar Hardship upon the British Merchant trading from Africa to the British Colonies, as such Exemption enables the Con-traftor to have an undue Preference upon the Coasts of Africa in the Purchase of Slaves, to the great Prejudice of the other Persons concerned in the said Trade, and, the Petitioners apprehend, such Exemptions are never admitted, but where the Grounds are clearly ascertained in Evidence, which, the Petitioners apprehend, cannot be the same in the present Instance, as the Numbers to be delivered in any one Ship are, from various Causes, so uncertain, as not to become the Subject of Contraft, and therefore this Preference ought not, in Justi Wisdom, or Policy, to given to any.

have been encouraged, by various Acts of Parliament, to expend, and have in Fast laid out, very large Sums of Money in establishing themselves in, and for the Purpose of carrying on, the said Trade, according to the Laws now in Existence, and they are greatly alarmed that the meditated Regulations may totally ruin the said Commerce with , and annihilate

A Petition of Stephen Fuller, Esquire, Agent for Mr. Fuller’* Jamaica, Was presented to the House, and read; Set- Jj1ee“^”rfcgaanr,‘l ting forth, That the Petitioner observes by the Bill slave fiiu! now depending in the House, for providing certain ' Temporary Regulations respecting the Transportation of Slaves in British Ships to The IVefl Indies, and elsewhere, the Limitation of the Number to be transported in Proportion to the Tonnage of the Ship is so narrowed and restrained as to give the other European Powers, concerned in th e African Trade, such a manifest Advantage as will be injurious to his Constituents in the Island of Jamaica, and tend to discourage the present Cultivation of Sugar, and its future Improvement, by throwing it into the Hands of our Rivals, the Petitioner conceiving that whatever Nation shall be restrained from the Slave Trade, will of course be restrained from the Cultivation of Sugar;'and that the Petitioner looks with some Pegrec of Aftonish-ment at the immoderate Restraints that are proposed to be laid upon that Commerce, so valuable to Great Britain herself, and so essential to his Constituents, at such an advanced Period of the Session, especially after it had been solemnly determined by the House to take into Consideration the several Petitions now lying upon the Table, and in Consequence thereof, as the Petitioner imagined, to go into a full and deliberate Investigation of the said Trade, early in the next Session of Parliament, from whence the Petitioner was led to conclude, that the House could never be induced in the first Instance to determine upon a Question, which is, of all others that can possibly arise upon the Subject, the most interesting, and naturally >. ought to be the last Question determined upon, a? comprehending the very Question of Abolition; and that the Petitioner conceiving that immoderate, or even indifereet, Restraint, is, ipso Abolition,

takes the Liberty further to acquaint the House, that on the 25th of last Month he received a Letter from the Committee of Correspondence, dated Spanish Town, the 30th of April 1788, wherein they mention, that “ though the Confederation of this Business in Parlia-tc ment is likely to be postponed, yet the dangerous “ Consequences to this Country have become already “ evident, and there is no saying how far they may extend;” and this Intelligence is further confirmed by a private Letter from the Chief Justice of Jamaica, to the Petitioner, dated the 25th of April, wherein he mentions, “ that the very Suspence is dangerous in “ a Thousand Shapes, but we must encounter them “ with our utmost Efforts;” and that the Petitioner hath also seen a Letter from Jamaica, giving an Account of an “ actual Insurrection of the Slaves in the <c Pafilh of Saint John's, but that they could not ac- complish their WilhesAnd, the Petitioner is apprehensive that the passing this or any Bill, at the present Juncture, will be tantamount to a Declaration in their Favour, that it will add fresh Fuel to the Flame, and when they fee so many great Towns and Corporate Bodies petitioning Parliament for an Abolition of Slavery, and King, Lords, and Commons, coming forward with an unexpected ^.d, the natural Inference they will undoubtedly draw From it will be,

that every Body in this Countr ’ is determined to set them free, that their Matters alone are determined to continue them '.n Slavery, and the sooner they put an End to them the better: And therefore, in the Name of upwards of ao,oooo White Inhabitants in the Ittand of Jamaica, praying, That the said Bill may not pass, and that he may be heard against it, by his Counsel.

A Petition of the Persons whose Names are there- London Peti-under signed, being Manufacturers of Tobacco and tion against Snuff in the Port of London, on Behalf of themselves the Tobac*. and others, was presented to the House, and read; Act*

Setting forth, That, by an Act, made in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act for repealing “ the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting “ new Duties in Lieu thereof,” the Petitioners are subjected to the Laws of Excise; and that the said Act exposes Mysteries in their Trade of inestimable Value, which have been received in Patrimony, purchased, or acquired by long and laborious Application and Experiment, and which have hitherto been considered exclusive Property: That as in those Articles alone which are mysterious, the fair Trader can maintain a Competition with the Smuggler, the Petitioners apprehend it will not only injure them, but eventually prove detrimental to the Revenue — That it imposes Rules and Regulations on the Manufacture of the Article, which, in some Cases, are impracticable, and which, in many, cannot be complied with, without rendering the Goods unfit for their Customers, and, in Consequence, subjects the Petitioners to heavy and inevitable Forfeitures and Penalties — That by directing the Manufacture of a Parcel to be completed before any Part thereof can be sent out or sold, the Petitioners are occasionally, for many Days, prevented supplying their Customers, though all the Time in Possession of the Goods which are wanted — That it debars Manufacturers, who are not in Ports of Importation, from disposing of such Goods as they cannot make use of in their own Manufacture, to the Manufacturers who are in Ports of Importation, and who are, perhaps, the only Persons they can sell them to, without sustaining a considerable Loss — That it obliges many Manufacturers to alter their Modes of Manufacture^ to the great additional Ex pence and Inconvenience of such Manufacturers, as well as imminent Danger of the Loss of their Trade — That it prohibits the Removal of some Articles in less Quantities than 20olbs. Weight, which, in most Cases, are more than the Petitioners, at one Time, can dispone of to their Customers — That, upon Exportation of the Article, it requires a Return of Papers which cannot always be obtained, and otherwise very much discourages our Foreign Commerce of the Commodity —

That it gives, Power to a malicious Officer to almost ruin the Business of any principal Manufacturer —

When executed in the most lenient Manner, occasions Delays and Interruptions quite inconsistent with the Nature of Trade, and, in Consequence, not only affords greater Latitude to the Smuggler, by enhancing the Price of the fair Dealer’s Goods, but has a Tendency to drive the Manufacture of the Article out of this Kingdom — That for these, and many other Reasons of Objection, as well as from a fall Persuasion that no Modification of the Act will, in the End, benefit the Revalue, or relieve the fair Trader firom the Competition of the Smugglers, the Petitioners therefore pray. That the said Act may be repealed; and that, by themselves and Counsel, in Proof of their Allegations, they may be hoard at the Bar of the House.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the

under the Management of the Petitioners; and that Robberies, and other Outrages, are frequently committed upon the said Roads in the Night Time, which the Petitioners apprehend might, in a great Measure, be prevented, if the Whole of the said several Roads were properly lighted and watched, and it would be a great Convenience to Travellers if the said Roads were properly watered; and Representing to the House, That only a small Part of the Term of the said Act is now unexpired, and that the Produce of the Tolls authorized to be collected upon the said Roads is insufficient to enable the Petitioners to pay the said Annual Sum of 1,000l. and the Interest of the Money borrowed and due as aforesaid, and effectually to amend and widen the said Roads and Foot Paths, and keep the same in Repair, and to light, watch, and water the said Roads, and unless the Term of the said Act be enlarged, and some of the Tolls thereby granted increased, and some further Powers are given to the Petitioners, the several Purposes aforesaid cannot be effected; and that a small Part of a certain Lane in Kensington, called Church Lane, is not included in the said Act, and a new Road, called Sloane Street, hath been made from the Great Western Road at Knightsbridge, into the Road adjoining to the Burial Ground belonging to Chelsea Hospital, and it would be of public Benefit and Convenience if such Part of Church Lane as aforesaid, and also the said new Road, called Sloane Street, were put under the Care and Management of the Petitioners for the repairing, lighting, watching, and watering the same, and if Provision was made for repairing the several Foot Paths on the Sides of the said several Roads; and that, in order to widen certain Parts of the said Roads, it will be necessary to take down certain Houses, and other Buildings, situate between the Church Yard of Kensington and the Charity School on the North Side of the Great Western Road in Kensington, and a Public Hotise, called The Half-way House, situate between Knightsbridge and the Town of Kensington, and to take in, and add to, the said Road, such Gardens, Nurseries, Orchard, and other Grounds, as shall be necessary for that Purpose, and the Petitioners apprehend it would tend to the Preservation of the said Roads if some Restriction was laid upon erecting Buildings on new Foundations within a certain Distance thereof; and that frequent Complaints are made of the bad State and Condition of the Pavement in such Part of Piccadilly as aforesaid, and the Petitioners apprehend it would be of public Utility if some Provision was made for better repairing the same, or they were empowered to take the said Road again under their Care and Management; and that frequent Disputes have'arisen from the present Mode of collecting certain Tolls authorized to be received on the said Roads upon Sundays by the said Commissioners for paving the Streets within the pity and Liberty of Westminster, which the Petitioners apprehend might be prevented, if the Collection of such Tolls were put under their Care and Management for the future: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for continuing’ the Term, and altering and enlarging the Powers of the said Act, and for making such Increase in the Tolls payable by virtue of the said Act, and effecting the several other Purposes before-mentioned, in such Manner as the House shall think proper.

To prove the Allegations of the #aid Petitions, the said Acts were read: And,

Vol. 45.

Mr. Thomas DaiMfy being examined, said, That the Trustees have proceeded in the Execution of the said Acts, and that there remains a Debt due of 1,200l. upon the South Division of Roads comprized therein. —

Then,

Mr. George Maule being examined, said, That there is a Debt due of 3,000l. upon the Middle Division of Roads, and 2,925 /. upon the separate District of Roads, also comprized in the said Act — That the said several Sums of Money cannot be repaid, nor the said Road kept in Repair, unless the Term of the said Acts be further continued; and some Amendments and Alterations are necessary to be made therein.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for continuing the Term, and altering and enlarging the Powers, of certain Acts of Parliament, for repairing the Roads from Royston, in the County of Hertford, to Wandesford Bridge, in the County of Huntingdon, and from the Town of Huntingdon to the Causeway at or near the West End of the Town of Somersham, in the County of Huntingdon, so far as relates to the Middle and South Divisions and separate District of the said Roads: And that the Lord Hinchingbrook, the Earl Ludlow, Mr. Yorke, and General Adeane, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Mr. Mainwaring reported from the Committee, to Kensington, whom the Petition of the Trustees for putting in Exe- Chelsea, and cation an Act of Parliament, made in the Seventh Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repairing tion reported, several Roads in the Parishes of Kensington, Chelsea, and Fulham, and other Parishes therein mentioned, in the County of Middlesex, was referred; That the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, of the 25th of April 1774, relative to Turnpike Bills, had been complied with; and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the same, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, the said Act was read: And,

William Bleamire, Esquire (one of the Trustees under the said Act) being examined, said, That the Road leading from Hyde Park Comer to Counter’s Bridge, and several other Roads adjoining or near to the same, are, by the said Act, put under the Care and Management of the Petitioners, with Power to light and watch certain Parts only of the said Roads, and to pave the Carriage Way of the High Street, in the Town of Kensington-, and Provision is made for paving the Foot Paths on the Sides of the said Carriage Way, and for lighting and watching the said High Street, and certain other Parts of the said Town.

That a very considerable Sum of Money hath been borrowed, and the Sum of 11,500l. is now due and owing upon the Credit of the Tolls authorized to be collected upon the said Roads; and the said Tolls are also charged with the Payment of the Sum of 1,000l. per Annum to the Commissioners for paving the Streets within the City and Liberty of Westminster, to enable them to keep in Repair Part of the Street or Road called Piccadilly, from Clarges Street to Hyde Park Comer, and from the South End of Park Lane to the North End of Hertford Street, which were heretofore under the Management of the Trustees of the said Roads.

That great Depredations, and other Outrages, have been of late frequently committed upon the said Roads in the Night Time, which, it is apprehended, might in a great Measure be prevented, if the Whole of the said several Roads were properly lighted and watched, under the Directions of the Trustees, and it would be

a great

a great Convenience to Travellers, if the said Roads were properly watered.

And the Witness further said, That the Produce of the Tolls authorized to be collected upon the said Roads is insufficient to enable the Trustees to pay the said Annual Sum of 1,000l., and the Interest of the Money borrowed and due as aforesaid, and effectually to amend and widen the said Roads and Foot Paths, and keep the same in Repair, and to light, watch, and water the said Roads; and that unless the Term of the said Act be eularged, and some of the Tolls thereby granted increased, and some further Powers are given to the Petitioners, the several Purposes aforesaid capnot be effected.

That a small Part of a certain Lane in Kensington, called Church Lane, is not included in the said Act, and a new Road, called Sloane Street, hath been made from the Great Western Road at Knightsbridge into the Road adjoining to the Burial Ground belonging to Chelsea Hospital, and it would be of public Benefit and Convenience if such Part of Church Lane as aforesaid, and also the said new Road called Sloane Street, were put under the Care and Management of the Petitioners for the repairing, lighting, watching, and watering the same; and if Provision was made for repairing the several Foot Paths oti the Sides of the said several Roads.

That in order to widen certain Parts of the said Roads, it will be necessary to take down certain Houses, and other Buildings, situate between the Church Yard of Kensington and the Charity School on the North Side of the Great Western Road in Kensington, and a certain Public House, called The Half-way House, situate between Knightsbridge and the Town of Kensington, and to take in and add to the said Road such Gardens, Nurseries, Orchard, and other Grounds, as shall be necessary for that Purpose; and it is apprehended, that it would tend to the Preservation of the said Roads, if some Restriction was laid upon erecting Buildings on new Foundations within a certain Distance thereof.

And the Witness further informed your Committee, That frequent Complaints are made of the bad State and Condition of the Pavement in such Past of Piccadilly as aforesaid, and the Trustees are desirous of taking that Part of the Carriage and Foot Road which formerly belonged to the Trust under their own Care and Management, upon certain Terms; or else to be empowered to call upon the Commissioners for Paving to keep the same in proper Repair.

And he added, That frequent Disputes have arisen firom the present Mode of collecting of certain Tolls, authorized by an Act of the Fifth Year of His present Majesty to be received on the said Roads upon Sundays by the said Commissioners for Paving, which Disputes, it is apprehended, might be prevented, if the Collection of such Tolls were’ to be put under the Care and Management of the Petitioners.

Sir Joseph Andrews, Baronet, confirmed the Whole of the foregoing Evidence.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for more effectually repairing the Road from Hyde Park Comer to Counter's Bridge, and certain other Roads, within the Parishes of Saint George Hammer Square, Saint Margaret Westminster, Kensington, Chelsea, and Fulham, in the County of Middlesex, and for lighting, watching, and watering the same; and for several other Purposes therein mentioned: And that Mr. Mainwaring and Mr. Henry Hobart do prepare, and bring in, the same.

A Petition of the Persons thereunder signed, being Manufacturers of, and Dealers in, Tobacco and Snail, in the City of Norwich, in Behalf of themselves and others, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Act, passed in the last Session of Parliament, for repealing the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting new Duties in lieu thereof, is highly injurious to the Petitioners, as it exposes the Mysteries of their Trade, which they had been taught to consider as private Property, and imposes Regulations and Restrictions upon their Manufacture, with which they cannot comply without great Loss to themselves, and a Non-compliance with which exposes them to heavy Penalties; and that the Operation of the said Act, instead of benefiting, will be detrimental to the Revenue. by putting Smugglers in Possession of the Secrets of the Petitioners Trade, and by increasing the Price of their Goods, in consequence of the Delays and Interruptions which the said Act occasions in the Manufacture of them, which Operation has been already sensibly felt by the Petitioners, the Quantity of Tobacco and Snuff sold by them, since the said Act took Effect, having been considerably less than it was during any former Period, and Daily decreasing; and that the Petitioners also perceive, with extreme Regret, that the Penalties inflicted by the said Act are recoverable in a summary Manner, without the Intervention of a Jury, a Mode of Proceeding that tends to undermine an Institution which the Petitioners have been taught to consider as the Bulwark of the British Constitution: And therefore praying, That the said Act may be repealed.

Ordered, That the said Petitioa do lie upon the Table.

A Bill to enlarge the Term and Powers of an Act, passed in the Twenty-eighth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repairing and widening the Road* from the Leicester and Welford Turnpike Road, in the Counties of Leicester and Northampton, near Fosten Lane, to the Turnpike Road leading from Hinckley to Ashby dela Zouch, in the said County of; and

Resolved, That the Bill be committed to Mr. -gerford, Mr. Pochm, &c.: And they are to meet this Afternoon, at Five of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber.

To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament assembled.

The Sixth Report of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the State and Condition of the Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, and to sell or alienate Fee Farm and other Unimproveable Rents.

The Forest of Aliceholt and Woolmer is situated in situation, the East Part of the County of , on the

Borders of the Counties of Surrey and Sussex; and is bounded on one Side by the River TVey, which becomes navigable at Godalming, about Ten Miles from

the Middle of the Forest; and comnhinicates with the River Thames, affording an easy Conveyance of the Forest l imber to the Dock Yards in that River, and at a moderate Ex pence.

The most antient Perambulation we have found of this Forest is dated in the 28th Year of King Edward I. and is preserved among the Records in the Tower. A Copy of that Perambulation is given in the Appendix; from the latter Part of which it appears, that this was one of the Forests enlarged by the Four preceding Kings, and reduced by Edward to its more antient Limits, in consequence of the Provisions in the Charta de Forcsta, and of a Grant from the Commons, of ai Fifteenth Part of all their moveable Property.

Another Perambulation of this Forest was made in the 1J th of Charles I. of which a Copy is also inserted in the Appendix. The Boundaries in' those Two Perambulations, appear to be the same; and they have been traced and followed by the Surveyor employed by us, in making the Plan which is to be delivered with this Report.

The Whole of the Forest within those Boundaries contains about 15,493 Acres, Statute Measure; but

of that Quantity about 6,799 Acres belong to private Number of Proprietors; the Rest, being about 8,694, Acres, are Acres’ Forest Lands belonging to the Crown.

The Forest consists of Two Divisions, the one called The Forest in The Holt, or Aliceholt, and the other JVootmer. The TwoDivi-Two Parts are separated from each other by a consi- ^<’ns*c*1,ed. derable Extent of intervening private Property. Alice-holt was formerly divided into Three Bailiwicks, of Walks, called The North, The South, and The West Bailiwicks; but that Distinction is now laid aside.

Woolmer is divided into Two Walks,. called -borough Walk, and Borden Walk. The Whole, however, forms but One Forest, governed by One Set of Officers, and subject to the same Forest Courts; and the following is a Statement of the Quantities of the inclosed Lands, Open Pasture, and Wood Lands, belonging to the Crown, with the estimated Value of the Wood and Timber growing thereon, and the Annual Value of the Lands, supposing them to be disafforested, and turned into Tillage or Pasture, according to the Survey made under our Direction; viz. n« <j. ’

Some Incroachments, or rather Claims, have been made by the Lords of the adjoining Manors of Mill Land, and Oakhanger, or Chapel Manor, to Parts of the Soil of Woolmer-, but the Lands lie open to and are reputed Part of the Forest, and those Claims do not appear to be of long standing, or very well founded.

In what Manner the Lodges and inclosed Lands are now occupied, will be stated hereafter, when we come to speak of the Forest Officers, and their Emoluments. The uninclosed Lands of the Crown, in Vol. 45.

both Divisions, are subject to certain Rights of Com- Right* of mon, enjoyed by the Proprietors of Estates within or Common, adjacent to the Forest; and that Mixture of Rights has in this, as in other Forests, opened a Door to great Waste and Abuse.

In order to discover what Rights were admitted nr Right* for-enjoyed in this Forest during the last Century, when merlyenjoyed some Care was-taken to confine them within just ^r0*l^0m" Limits, and to protect the Rights of the Crown in the Royal Forests, we examined the Proceedings at a claim* at a Justice Seat held by Lord Holland, Chief Justice' in Justice Seat,

Eyre, in the tiih Charted I. preserved in the Tower, at which Court all Persons claiming Rights in the Forest preferred their Claims in Writing, specifying the Nature and Extent of those Rights. The Claims then made were Thirty in Number, of which Three only are wanting; and in all those Claims no Mention is made of any other Right than that of Common of Pasture, except in One Instance, where a Right is claimed- to cut Peat and Turf in the Division ealled Woolmer; and the Right of Pasture is claimed

only for Commonable Cattle, Levant and on

the LandB of the Claimants (or, in other Words, for such Cattle as the Parties could maintain on their own Lands, during the whole Year) and for those only in Commonable Seasons, according to the Assize of the Forest.

We have also perused the Rolls of Two Courts of Swanimote, held in the i-8th of James I. and nth of Charles I. likewise preserved in the Tower; at which Courts all Offences committed to the Injury of the1 Forest were presented and tried. From those Proy ceedings it appears, that no other Rights than those mentioned in the Claims preferred at the Justice Seat were allowed. The Timber, Wood, and Underwood, were then held to be the sole Property of the Crown; and the cutting or carrying away any Branch of a Tree, or -even Bushes, was punished in the same Maimer as Injuries to the King’s Deer.

In a subsequent Part of this Report we shall , shew the Change which- has since taken Place, the new Claims which have been established, the total Neglect and Relaxation which have prevailed, on the Part of Government, and the Waste, Incroachraent, and Spoil which have been suffered during -the present -Century.

The antient Government of tins Forest, under the Forest Laws, was similar to that in Other Forests, by a Lieutenant, Ranger, or Keeper, Verderors, Woodward, Regarders, Agistors, and Foresters, or Under Keepers; and those Officers held Courts of Swanimote and Attachment, which took Cognizance of all Offences done in the Forest. An Extract from the Swanimote Roll of the nth Charles I. inserted in the Append!*, shews what Officers then belonged to this Forest, and the Towns which sen* Free Suitors to attend at the Forest Courts.

But the Office of Lieutenant or Keeper of this. Forest has, for a long Course of Time, been, granted on Lease for Lives, or Terms of Years, with the Power of appointing a Deputy, and the usual Number of Foresters, or Under Keepers, and of holding, every Six Weeks, the Court of Attachment, or Woodmote; in consequence of which Powers, the whole Care and Protection of the Forest Tame, at length, to depend on the Lieutenant alone. We have given-in the Appendix a List of those Leases, from the Reign of Queen Elizabeth to the present Time; from which it appears that at the Beginning of the present Century that Office was held by Emanuel Scroop Howe, Esquire, under a Grant from lung Wfo» 45- Yearn; and* after his Death, by Mrs. Ruperta Howe, his Widow.

It was afterwards granted to the Honourable John Mordaunt, by whom it was assigned, in 1750, to the late Right honourable Henry Bilson Legge, and has ever since continued in that Family. A Copy of the lost Lease, granted in 1780, to Trustees for Lord Sttnvell, for 31 Years from that Time, is also inserted in the Appendix. The Terms and Conditions in all those Leases are nearly the Same, and the Substance as follows:

The King grants to the Trustees for Lord StawelL,

A Fee Farm. Rent of 31 k 2. 11. out of the

Manor of Wordteham, in Hampshire: v

And the Office of Eieu tenant, os Keeper, of the Forest or Chase of Aliceholt and

To hold and receive the said Rent, without Account; but on Condition' to pay all Fees, Wages; and Salaries, of all- toe Officers of the said Forest;

And to hold the Office of Lieutenant or Keeper; with all Offices, Liberties, Privileges, Wages,

Fees, Rewards; and other Profits and Commodities thereto belonging;

With Power to appoint a Deputy or Deputies, amt so many Foresters and Keepers as heretofore wens appointed, for the safe Custody of the said Forest;

And to have all Beasts or Animals attached, or taken in the said Forest, by any of the Foresters;

And all Manner of Wood blown or thrown dbwn by the Wind, and all dead Woody and the Boughs and Branches of Trees and Wood in the said- Forest, out off or thrown down;

And Housebote and Firebote for bitnseff and the Foresters and Keepers;

And all Waifs, Estrays, Honey and Wax found there;

And separate Pasture within the King’s Lands in the said Forest, for Two Horses for himself, or his Deputies, and sufficient Pasture within the Forest for One , Horae for each Forester or Keeper;

With Liberty -of Fishing within the Kings Waters there, and to keep the Fish to his own Use;

Also Power to hold, every Six Weeks, the Court called the Wood Court, and to take.afr Fines and Amerciaments there to his own Use;

And to have the Entrails, commonly called the Humbles and Suets, of the Deer killed there;

And Liberty to take One Stag and One Buck in the Summer, and One Hmd and One Doo in the Winter, to his own Use.

To hold and exercise all the Offices; Authorities*

Liberties, and Privileges aforesaid, without any Account to be rendered to His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, for the same.

And the Grantee covenants as follows:

To repair all the Lodges, Fences, and Inclosures at his own Expence;

To discharge His Majesty from the Payment of the Salaries, Stipends, or Wages, of the Foresters,

Keepers, and Officers of the Forest;

To preserve and keep the Deer, and other Game, and also the Woods, Timber, and other Trees, from cutting chopping, and Spoil; and, so preserved, to leave the same, at the End of the Term.

It is probable that the Object and Expectation Observations on of Government, in granting a Lease on such Condi- offiS"©?Lieuw-tions, was, that by bestowing on a Person of some nant Distinction, for a Term of \ ears, the Authority and Dignity, with the Patronage and Emoluments annexed to this desirable and respectable Office, supporting it with the Aid of the other Officers of the Forest, and with the Power of the Forest Courts, more Weight might be added to the Situation, ami the Protection of the Deer and Timber be rendered more certain and effectual, than it would have been undo* an Officer holding the Appointment during Pleasure; and that, at the same Time, the Experice to the Crown, in the Management of the Forest might be ascertained and limited: But, by tracing

the Progress and Effect of the different Conditions* separately, down to the present Time, it will appear how. iff. those Expectations have been justified by the Event.

Land Revenue From these Documents it would seem that, in those "Port* Times, the Lieutenant was considered to be entitled

' ' only to the Boughs and Branches which are casually

cut off or thrown down from standing Trees, and not from Trees felled by Warrant; and these Examples should have the more Weight, from the Falls having been made at a Time when the Emoluments and Allowances of the Lieutenant had so recently undergone a full Consideration: But we find, from subsequent Accounts in the same Office, that, in the Year 1729, Mrs. Ruperta Hmce claimed a Right to the Boughs and Branches of all Trees felled by Warrant, or to the Value of them; and she at the same Time set up a Claim to the Bark, but on what Pretence does not appear, no Mention being made of the Bark in the Lease. Unsupported, however, as this Claim was, either by the Lease itself, or, in so far as we can discover, by former Usage, it appears to have been admitted by the then Surveyor General, and allowed in his Accounts, by the Auditor, without any Waf-rant that we can find, and perhaps without examining the Lease; for it appears, that, in the same Year, 1170 dotard and decayed Trees were sold by the Surveyor General, with the Bark, Lops, and Tops, for 980/.; and in the Account of that Sale, we find that 140/. (being One Seventh Part of the Produce) was paid to Mrs. Howe, “ who (it is added) claims a Right “ to the Lop, Top, and .”

This Claim having thus been once admitted, it appears, in one Shape or another, to have been made at every Sale since. In the Accounts of the’next Sales in 1732, and in 1737-8, the Price of the Trees only is accounted for to the Crown, “ clear of the “ Lops, Tops, and Offal Wood of the said Trees, “ the same being claimed, by Mrs. Ruperta Howe, by “ virtue of her Grant of the Office of Ranger of the “ said Forest.1’

In the Accounts of the subsequent Sales, from that Time to 1750, the Accountants are charged only with so many Trees, cut down and sold to divers Persons, for the Sums therein mentioned: and no Notice is taken of the Lops, Tops, or Bark; but from the Vouchers of those Accounts preserved in the same Office', it appears, that the Lops, Tops, and Offal Wood, were taken by the Lieutenant in Kind.

From 1750, when Mr Legge first obtained this Office, to the Year 1756, the Price of the Trees only is accounted for, as before, without mentioning the Lops, Tops, or Bark; but there is a Memorandum in the Vouchers, “ that the Lop, Top, and Offal “ Wood, were granted to the Honourable Mr. Mordaunt, and his Assigns.”

In the Sales from 1756 to 1760, the Price of the Trees and Bark, are accounted for, without taking any Notice of the Lops, Tops, and Offal Wood; but among the Vouchers of those Accounts, we find Certificates, signed by Kemble then Deputy Sur-

veyor, “ that the Timber and Bark were sold by “ Auction, for the Sums stated in the Accounts, and “ that the Lops and Tops were claimed by, and “ delivered to the Right Honourable Henry Bilson Legge, u as Assignee of the Honourable John Mordaunt T The Vouchers for the Account of Sales in 1760 are not to be found; but the Accounts are in the same Terms as those for the Four preceding Years.

In the Accounts of the Sales, from 1760 to 1770, the Price of the Trees, with the Bark, Tops, Lops, and Offal Wood, are accounted for to the Crown; Appendix, N° 10. but in the Year last-mentioned, a Memorial was presented to the Treasury by the Countess of Hillsborough, who then held the Office of Lieutenant, representing that she was entitled, by the Grant of that Office, to One Fifth Part of the Produce of all Timber sold there, by the Surveyor General, in lieu of the Top, Lop, and Bark; and by Several Warrants from the Treasury to the Yearly Sum of 130/. for the Keepers

Salaries; that the 130/. a Year had been regularly paid up to 1761, together with One Fifth Part of the Sales for the preceding Year, after which nothing had been paid; that the Wood Sales, since 1761, amounted to 2,291/.; and that One Fifth Part, being 458/. 4 was due to the Memorialist; and praying their Lordships to order the Surveyor General to pay the same.

The Lords of the Treasury referred this Memorial to the Surveyor General of the Woods, directing him to report a true State of the Premises; and that Officer reported, on the 25th of June 1770, “ That he “ had considered the Memorial, and found, that “ during the Years mentioned in it, the several “ Quantities of Timber were sold in the Forest, and “ for the Sums therein specified; and that a Proportion of One Fifth Part of the said Sums, due (0 “ Lady Hillsborough, in lieu of the Tops, Lop, and “ Bark of the said Timber, and also the Sum of “ 130/. a Year for Keepers Salaries, had not been “ paid;” and recommended that Part of the Arrear should be paid out of Monies in his Hands, and the Remainder raised at the next Fall.

In this Report the Surveyor General does not seem to have examined -whether the Lieutenant was entitled to the Allowance claimed by the Memorial: If he had looked into the Lease itself) he would have seen that the Bark was certainly not a Perquisite of the Lieutenant; and that there was not any Expression in it that warranted a Claim to One Fifth Part of the Produce of the Timber sold, in lieu of the Lop, Top, and Bark. If he had inspected the Accounts in the Auditor’s Office, he would have found no Example of, a Fifth Part having ever, before the Appointment of Mr. Legge, been claimed or allowed; and the Payment of that Proportion of the Price of the Trees sold in the Year 1760 is not stated in the Accounts of the Sales, in that Year.

On the 6th July 1770, the Lords of the Treasury, by Letter from their Secretary, directed the Surveyor General to pay the whole Sums claimed in this Memorial, both for the Fifth Part of all the Timber felled in the Forest since the Year 1760, and for the Allowance of 130/. a Year for the Keepers Salaries; and, in future, to pay the growing Salaries as they became due.

The Accounts of Sir Edmund Thomas and Mr. Pitt, the Surveyors General of the Woods, being brought under the Examination of the Auditor, he very properly declined passing them with those Allowances, which then, for the First Time, appeared in the Surveyor’s Accounts, without a Special Warrant. In consequence of this Refusal, a Memorial was presented to the Lords of the Treasury by the Surveyor General, in January 1777, stating the Substance of that presented by the Lieutenant in 1770, with his Report thereon, and the Directions given to him in consequence of it; and that he had ever since conti-uned to pay the Salaries of 130/. a Year, and the Fifth Part of the Produce of all the Timber cut in the Forest; and he prayed their Lordships to issue their Warrant, directing the Auditor to allow those Payments in his Accounts, and also, from Time to Time, the future Payments thereof. And on the 24th March 1777, the Lords of the Treasury issued a Warrant, authorizing the Auditor to make those Allowances accordingly.

The Lords of the Treasury having been induced, by the Means which have been stated, to admit the Claims made by the Lieutenant, a new Circumstance occurred, which brought the Rights of that Officer again under Examination.

Prior to the Year 1777, no Timber had been, cut in this Forest for the Use of the Navy, during the pre- sent Century, probably owing to the Trees not having, till about that Time, grown to the necessary Size. A Fall of 300 Loads was then, ordered, by Warrant from

the

the Treasury, for the Use of the Navy, and delivered ' at the usual Price allowed for Oak Timber furnished > to the Dock Yards, from other of the Royal Forests, being i/. 18$. per Load.

.Appendix, N° 14. On this Occasion, a new Memorial was presented to the Treasury by Lady , stating, as before,

“ that as Lieutenant she was, by the Grant, entitled “ to the Boughs and Branches ot all Trees cut within “ the said Forest, which used formerly to be taken by “ the Lieutenant; but that Mode was found to be so “ injurious to the Sale of the Timber, that for a great “ Number of Years past, long before the Memorialist, “ or her late Husband Mr. Legge, had the Grant of “ that Office, it had been agreed between His Majesty’s then Surveyor General, and the then Lieutenant, that the Whole of the said Timber Trees , “ should be sold, and that the Lieutenant should have “ One Fifth of the Amount of the Sale, in lieu of “ his Right therein, which had been accordingly paid “ ever since. That it had been always usual to sell “ the Timber by Public Sale, until the last Year, M when the Fall of 300 Loads was ordered for the “ Navy. That if that Timber had been put up to “ Sale, (instead of being taken for the Use of the “ Navy at 11. 18$. per Load) it would have produced “nearly 2,500l., whereas by the Account of the “ Deputy Surveyor, the Gross Amount was only “ L074/. io$. 9 d.,to which was to be added about “ 80/. lor Stack Wood, taken away by the People “ of Frensham, under a pretended Right; and out of “ which was to be deducted 179/. 19$. for the “ Expences of cutting, &c. charged in the Surveyor’s “ Account. That if it had been sold publicly, as “ usual, and had produced 2,500l., the Memorialist’s Fifth would have been 500l.; that had the Memo* “ rialist taken the Offal Wood, it would, by the “ Deputy Surveyor’s Account, have amounted to “ 382 /., exclusive of the Eighty Pound’s Worth of “ Stack Wood, taken away, which would have made " it 462/.; but that if the Memorialist was only to “ have One Fifth Part of the Sale, according to the “ Accounts of the Deputy Surveyor, it would amount “ only to 178/.; and though the Memorialist was willing to take such Sum for her Right as their Lordships should be pleased to order, yet she prayed “ that a Warrant then lately issued, for an additional “ Fall of 500 Loads for the Navy, might be revoked, and that for the future all the Timber might he sold “ by Public Auction, as usual.’’

This Memorial was likewise referred to the Surveyor General, who seems then to have considered the Terms of the Grant with more Attention than he had

Appendix, N° 15, done on the former Reference; and, in his Report thereon, he suggested a Doubt, whether the Clause in the Grant, as to Boughs and Branches, might not be construed to extend only to the Boughs and Branches casually cut off or thrown down, and not to the Branches of all Trees cut for the Use of His Majesty. That it was however necessary to inform their Lordships, that at the Time of his Appointment he understood that the Lieutenant was entitled to the Boughs and Branches of all Timber Trees cut down in the said Forest; and did therefore, as he found his Predecessors had done, agree that the Whole of the Timber cut there should be sold, and that the Lieutenant should be paid One-fifth of the Amount of the Whole, in lieu of the Boughs and Branches; and that all Trees cut in the said Forest to the Year 1776, had been sold by Auction, and One-fifth Part paid to the Lieutenant accordingly; that the Oak Timber lately felled for the Navy had been delivered at the usual Price allowed for the King's Timber in New Forest; and that if the Whole of that Timber had been sold, the Lieutenant would certainly have been entitled to a larger Sum than he thought himself justifiable in paying, without particular Directions from Vol. 45.

their Lordships: And he proposed that, for the fu- Land Revenue ture, the Lops, Tops, and Bark, should be sold by Report.

Auction, and that Two Third Parts of the Net Pro- v — ----- -s/ ——

duce should be paid to the Lieutenant, and the remaining Third for the Use of the Crown, that Proportion being, as nearly as could be competed, the Value of the Bark, to which the Lieutenant had no Right or Claim.

We do not find that any Order was made by the Treasury, in consequence of this Report. It appears, however, that the Lieutenant did not obtain the Allowance of a Fifth Part of the Value of the 300 Loads of Navy Timber felled in 1777, at the Market Price, or any pther Allowance on that Account, but Lord Stawell has not relinquished his Claim to it. And we know that the Warrant issued in 1778, for the Fall of 500 Loads for the Navy was not executed, though strongly recommended by the Surveyor General. '1 his Memorial and Report, which contain various other Particulars concerning the Forest, are inserted at Length in the Appendix. 'I'hey very clearly shew, j |

either that the Memorialist had been grossly misin- an >5’ formed, and that the Surveyor General had admitted the Facts alledged, without due Examination; or that some Agreement, for allowing One-fifth of the Value of the Trees, instead of the Lops and Tops, had been secretly and improperly made between some former Lieutenant and Surveyor, without the Knowledge or Authority of the Treasury; for after a careful Examination of the Books of the Treasury, and those in the Officp of the Auditor of the Land Revenue, relative to Woods and Forests, no Traces can be found of such an Agreement.

Under these Circumstances, we thought it necessary to mention to Lord Stawell our Apprehensions, that Lady Hillsborough might have been misinformed with respect to that supposed Agreement; and to request, that if such an Agreement had been made, we might be informed at what Time it took Place. In Answer to our Enquiry, we received a Letter trom Mr.

Sainsbury, Agent for Lord Staxvell, and who was also Agent for Lady Hillsborough at the Time of preferring that Memorial, in which Letter Mr. Sainsbury states, that he. had been told by a Mr. Ho, who had been Head Keeper in the Forest for upwards of 40 Yeais, that such an Agreement was made many Years before Mr. Legge purchased the Grant; but that he never saw any Agreement; and he has sent Copies of Entries in Mr. Legge's Books, in his own Hand Writing, of Sums received from the Surveyors General for Lop and Top, from 1753 to 1761; but he admits, that it does not thereby appear, that it was in the Proportion of One fifth, though he has no Doubt of its being so. Mr. Sainsburys Letter, and the Account sent

with it, are inserted in the Appendix: And upon the Appendix, N° 16. Whole of this Transaction we must observe, that it does not appear that such an Agreement was ever made, or that the Lords of the Treasury were, ever informed that such a Claim existed, prior to the before-mentioned Memorial and Report in the Year 1770, though, if such an Arrangement had been judged expedient, it was the Duty of the Surveyor General to apply to the Treasury for Permission to agree to it.

A secret Transaction of this Kind, if it had really taken Place, between Two of the Servants of the Crown, One of them entrusted with the general Care of the Timber in all the Royal Forests, and the other with the particular Management -and Protection of this Forest, should not, and we conceive could not, establish a Right for the Advantage of either of them to the Prejudice of the Crown.

But besides this Claim, of One-fifth of the Value of the Trees, another very singular Demand, or rather Request, is made in the Memorial; that in this Forest, maintained by the Public at very considerable Expence, as a Nursery of Timber for the Navy, no

' ----- ----- -- the Grantee might receive a greater Advantage from

it, than he would, if it were sent to the Dock Yards at the ordinary Price.

The Execution of the Warrant for the Fall of 500 Loads remained suspended, till January 1783, when on an Application from the Navy Board, a Warrant was issued for supplying that Quantity to the Dock Yards in the following Season; which was done accordingly. Another Fall of 1,000 Loads was afterwards directed, by WTarrant dated 3d December 1783, and, on that Occasion, Lord presented a Me-

Appendix, v° 17. mortal to the Treasury, stating that the People of Frem/utm, under a pretended Right, took away not only the Stack Wood, but almost the Whole of the Tops of the Trees of the preceding Fall; and that those of the Fall then ordered would also be carried off, if the Timber were to be immediately cut; that as he conceived them to be his absolute Property, he was willing to try the Validity of that pretended Right, if the Crown did not choose to do it; and praying that the Execution of the Order might be suspended, until the Right should be determined by a Court of Justice. The Memorial also stated various Abuses, practised in executing the Warrants for former Falls, which we shall hereafter take No-tie4 of.

After a short Suspension this Warrant was carried into Execution, and the Timber delivered to the Dock Yards; and we are informed by Mr. that Lord Staxcell, in the Year 1784, commenced upwards of Forty Actions against the poor People of the adjoining Parishes, for taking away Parts of the Wood; and that they all entered Appearances, but suffered Judgment to go by Default. It appears likewise, Appendix, N° 18. from Papers in our Possession, that the same Question was tried in the Year 1741, and determined against the Claimants.

It is observable that the Warrants for these Two Falls directed that the Lops, Tops, and Bark should be sold for His Majesty’s Use; but the Accounts in the Auditor’s Office state that the Lops and Tops were delivered to Lord Staxcell, “ in Lieu and Satisfaction of his Right to One-fifth Part of the Produce on the Sale of the said Timber.” And Mr. Briant, the Deputy Surveyor, in his Examination says, Appendix, N° 19. that “ the Lops and Tops, and all the Timber of the “ last-mentioned Fall, unfit for the Navy, was taken “ by Lord Statcell, of which he gave Notice to the “ Surveyor General.”

In February 1788 another Fall of 500 Loads was ordered for the Use of the Navy; but before the Execution of that Warrant, our Enquiries concerning this Forest were begun, and we had judged it necessary to state a Case for the Opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor General upon the Construction of the Grant; we therefore thought it our Duty to propose to the Lords of the Treasury that the felling of that Timber should be suspended, until the Rights of the Grantee should be duly investigated. The Fall was accordingly for some Time delayed; and when the Warrant was afterwards ordered to be carried into Execution, the Surveyor General was directed by the Treasury to sell the Lop, Top, and Offal Wood, by Public Auction, in the Presence of the Officers of the Forest, and of an Agent on the Part of Lord Starvell; and to retain the Produce in his Hands, to await the Decision upon Lord Stawell’s Claim. The Tops of the Trees were accordingly sold, and the Produce paid to the Surveyor General; but the Offal Wood, after "having been made into Faggots, and a Day appointed for the Sale of it, was openly carried off by the People of Frensham, to the Number of 6,365 Faggots, in One Day and Night

Appendix, N° 19. The Account given of this Transaction, upon Oath,

by Mr. Briant, the Surveyor General’s Deputy, is, that he was absent from the Forest on other Business, when the Country People began carrying away the Wood; and that when he returned it was almost all gone; that he detected Two Men loading a Waggon with Part of it, and got a Warrant for apprehending them; but that the Tything Man of where the

Offenders live, has never executed it, though repeatedly pressed to do it, and offered Assistance by him; that on his applying to the Keepers, and enquiring whose Teams had been employed in taking away the Wood, they told him they knew nothing of it; and he could get no Information from them against the Offenders.

This Proceeding of the People of Frensham was the more daring, as the Right claimed by them had been so lately determined; and it is remarkable that Mr. Briant, in his Examination, says, he has observed “ That no Attempt is ever made to take the Offal “ Wood of Trees felled by Lord StarceU's Order, and “ that hardly a Faggot is ever missing.”

The Attorney and Solicitor General having given it as their Opinion, upon the Case laid before them by our Direction, “ that the Grant, by Letters Patent, “ of the Boughs and Branches of Trees and Wood “ w'ithin the Forest, cut off ox thrown down, does not “ appear to them to comprehend more than tire “ Boughs and Branches which may casually be cut or thrown down, from standing Trees, and not from “ Trees which have been felled; but that notwithstanding it appears to them that the Words of the “ Letters Patent ought to be so construed, nevertheless if it can be shewn that for a great Length of “ Time, prior to Lady Hillsborough's First Memorial, “ the Boughs and Branches cut off and thrown down “ from Timber felled, were taken by the Grantee, “ and a Composition given for them, it might establish “ the Construction contended for by Lord Staxcell; ” we have thought it our Duty to make the fullest Investigation, in order to ascertain what has been the Usage with respect to the Disposal of the Lops and Tops, from the earliest Period for which any Accounts of Timber felled in this Forest can be found, down to the present Time; and to state the Result of our Exa mination thus at large for the Information of those whose Province it is to decide upon this Claim.

In case the Lieutenant should establish a Right to the Boughs and Branches of all Trees felled in the Forest, we apprehend it to be extremely necessary that it should be ascertained what Parts of a Timber Tree are comprehended under that Description: It is well known that, in Navy Timber, some of the most valuable Pieces, as Knees, Crooks, &c. are taken from the Limbs or Branches of Trees; and that other Parts of the Branches frequently contain Timber fit for Carpentry Uses. It sometimes happens also, that Trees apparently fit for the Navy prove unfit for that use, from some Defect not discoverable while they are standing; which Trees nevertheless contain good Building Timber; and large Butts of Trees and other Pieces of Timber are frequently cut off, as unfit for the Navy, but which are very useful for other Purposes: So that if the Lieutenant were allowed to take all that is not fit for the Use of the Navy, as was done on the Fall of 1,000 Loads' in 1784, he would upon every Fall made for the Navy have considerable Quantities of useful Timber, which could not be comprized under the Description of - and

Branches. It is equally necessary that this Point should be settled before any farther Wood Sales are made in this Forest, as few Persons would choose to become Purchasers subject to such a Claim, before it is determined what Parts they would be obliged to leave for the Grantee: To us it seems that the Mean-; ing of the Clause relative to Boughs and Branches could only be, to give such Boughs and Branches as might

Consequence appears to have arisen from granting the Office of Lieutenant in Lease; and the Forest was then well stored with Timber. It appears by a Sur-QuantUyofTim- vey, taken in the Year 1608, that there were at that 1608^ Survey *u Time 13,031 Trees fit for the Navy growing in this 1 See Appendix to Forest, and so many dotard and decayed Trees as 5th Report, N# 31. were computed to contain 23,934 Loads. Another And in 1635. Survey was taken in the Year 1635, in which the Appendix, N#2. Number of the Trees is not specified; but the Timber and Wood were valued at 10,247/. which, considering that the Price of Timber was then only about Ten Shillings per Load, must have comprized a very considerable Quantity. The Underwood and Thorns are included in this Valuation.

after the PR*stora- Crown in this Department, by Means of which a lion. great Stock of young Timber was speedily nursed up,

and well protected. This appears by the Privy Seal x* 7. and Warrants issued in 1704, for continuing the Allowance for the Under Keepers Salaries, and is con» firmed by the present State of the Timber in the Forest: But from the Reign of Queen Anne, when the Civil List Act had lessened the Influence which Ministers formerly derived from the Power of granting away the Estates of the Crown, and their Attention was withdrawn from this Part of the public Property. the Interest of the Crown, in this Forest has been little regarded; the thinning of the young Trees, Effects of N«j which had grown up during the preceding Forty or p e

Fifty Years, was neglected, so that few of them have had Room to grow to a great Size, and have stood too long in that State to be now capable of Benefit from thinning; the Appointment of Verderors and Re-garders, which till then had been regularly chosen, was discontinued, and none have been appointed for more than Forty Years past; the driving of the Fo- 26. rest, either for clearing it of Cattle dunng the Fence Month and Winter Haining, or preventing the surcharging of the Common, or the Admission of the Cattle of Strangers, is entirely laid aside; and no Courts of Attachment or Swarumote have been held within Memory. None of the Keepers are sworn to do their Duty; the Inhabitants of the neighbouring

Villages are suffered to lop and top the Trees, and to 19. dig up the Roots of them as fast as any are felled; 33‘ and the greatest Depredations are committed with Impunity.

It appears from the Survey taken in 1635, as well as from the Claims preferred at the last Justice Seat, and the Proceedings at the Courts of Swanimote, mentioned in the former Part of this Report, that the Timber, Wood, Underwood, and Thoms or Bushes, were the sole Property of the Crown, and that the neighbouring Inhabitants were not then understood or admitted to have any Right whatever in the Forest, except that of Pasture, under the Restrictions there mentioned; but, early in the present Century, the Abuses had risen to a great Height, and in the Reign of the UKightUto^cut Queen Annt, an Information was filed by Sir Edward, Bushes. Northey, Attorney General, against one John Hammond, the Owner of a small Estate in Kingsley, within the Bounds of the Forest, for cutting and taking away Bushes to repair his Fences; and a Bill was also filed against him in the Exchequer, for the same Offence. The Defendant justified the cutting of Bushes for Repairs of his Hedges and Fences, claiming it as a Right appurtenant to his Estate; and the Cause was tried at Winchester, at the Lent Assizes in 1713, -when Hammond v 5°^ bjr obtained a Verdict on the Information, and in

eCre* mas Term following a Decree in the Exchequer, esta-/ Wishing the Right claimed, by him. We have looked

into that Decree, and the Depositions of the Witnesses; and it does not appear to us that either the Claims preferred at the Justice Seat, in which no Right to cut Bushes was pretended, or the Proceedings at the Swanimote Courts, in which the cutting of Bushes was

punished as an Offence against the Rights of the Crown, LaDd Reventf<? or the Survey in 1635, in which the Bushes were Report.

comprised, and valued as the Property of the Crown, - ——

were adverted to on that Occasion; and though a Right so acquired, and so long exercised, is now unquestionably established, we shall venture to observe, that the Proceedings in that Suit afford the strongest Reason to believe that the Practice of cutting Bushes took its Rise from the improper Indulgence allowed by former Keepers to the Occupiers of Lands adjacent to the Forest, to cut them for outside Fences, to keep out the Deer. The Witnesses on both Sides, who were questioned concerning the State of the Forest, all concurred in saying that there was a great Quantity of young Timber then growing in it, of 30, 40, and 50 Years old, which they believed could not have been raised there without the Protection of the Bushes; and that there could not have been a sufficient Quantity of Bushes left, to nurse up such a Stock of young Timber, if the Inhabitants had formerly had the Liberty of cutting them, in the Manner then claimed.

The present Condition of the Forest is a melancholy Effects of that Proof of the Truth of that Declaration, and of the Decision.

Effects which have ensued from that Decision; for the State of the Forest is now so changed in that Respect, that there are hardly any Bushes, and very few young Trees remaining.

On a Survey of the Timber in this Forest, taken by survey of the Order of the House of Commons, in the Year 1783, Timber in 1783. the Oak Timber growing the re was found to be as follows:

Appendix, N° 19. the Whole to 50,399 I. 13 9 Mr. Briant, the

Woodward and Deputy Surveyor, by whom that Survey was taken, is of Opinion that the Quantity of the Timber fit for the Navy, deducting what has been felled, and allowing for the Increase in Growth since that Time, is now about 1,100 Loads less than when that Survey was taken; which reduces the Amount of his Valuation to 45,862/. 8 s. 9 d.;and both he and the Purveyor of N# *<» Portsmouth Dock Yard, who viewed the Forest at our Desire, are of Opinion that most of the Trees are The Trees all nearly-of the same Age, being from 100 to 120 Years; nearly of the same which also agrees with the Opinion of the Surveyor AKe- employed by us, and with our own Observations on

viewing the Forest, as well as with the Evidence on the Trial in 1713; and is a clear Proof that the present Stock of Timber may be almost wholly attributed to

that Care and Attention which was bestowed on it, from the Restoration to the End of the last Century, and for a few Years afterwards. The small Number of T^eb^r |lttle younS Saplings, compared with the Number of Grown Trees, 1 er ’ shews how little young Timber has been suffered to And no Prospect get up for many Years past: And it is the Opinion of of any more coming every. Person acquainted with the Forest, whom we “P* have conversed with respecting it, that unless some Regulations shall take Place, and some other Means be provided for raising young Timber,. for which the Bushes were formerly sufficient, no farther Succession of Trees can come up; and, consequently, that the present Stock of Timber is the last that the Forest can ever produce.

Among the Effects of that Inattention to the Incroachments on Rights of the Crown in this Forest which has pre- Woolmer. vailed for several Years past, may be mentioned the Incroachments or Claims made by the Lords of adjoining Manors, to Parts of the Soil of Woolmer.

The most material of these is a Claim of the Lord of the Manor of Mill Land,- to about 220 Acres of the

Survey; The Difference arises partly from the Quantities in that Account being stated in Square Measure, which gives the Number of Loads One Third more than in Girt Measure; (Two Loads of Timber Measure being equal to Three Loads Squart) but was principally occasioned by an Error of the Person employed to make that Abstract, who appears to have taken the Timber in Holt Forest twice into the Account, as is explained more fully in an Abstract taken from the original Survey, and inserted in the Appendix, No. 3t.

v Woolmer.

Commons Jour- Within the Perambulation of Dean Forest there were nals, Vol. ix. p. 45 considerable Estates which had Right of Common of *8' Pasture and Pannage, and claimed Estovers in the King’s

Waste: There were no Deer in the Forest at the Time of passing the Act; but the Crown had a Right to keep Deer, as in other Forests, without Limitation: The private Estates were subject to the Forest Laws, and to the ' Range of the Deer.

The King’s Waste contained about 23,000 Acres; and after the fullest Discussion in Parliament, the Act which we have refereed to was passed, by which the Crown was empowered to inclose it,000 Acres, being nearly One Half of the Waste of the Forest, freed from all Manner of Right, Title, or Pretence whatever; with Power to make new Inclosures in the Residue, on throwing open an equal Quantity of the Land first inclosed. All Claim to Estovers was given up; and all Trees and Wood growing, or to grow, on the whole 23,000 Acres, were declared to be the Property of the Crown: The Right to Common of Pasture, which formerly extended over all the Forest, was confined to the Part left uninclesedK and the Right of the Crown to keep Deer without Stint, was limited to Eight hundred in the open Part of the Forest; “ and to the End that some Recompence might be “ made to those Persons whose Right of Common, “ within the Inclosures, was taken from them, for “ the necessary Preservation of the Timber,” their Estates within the Perambulation were freed and exonerated from the Range of the Deer, and from those Restrictions on the Use of their Property which the Forest Laws imposed.

An Act propoted The Account which we have given of the Rights for this Forest simi- of the Crown, and of the private Proprietors, and Forest! dt neighbouring Inhabitants in Aliceholt and ,

will be found so similar to those in Dean Forest, the Rights in the latter were so deliberately considered, when the Act for its Improvement was passed, and the Effects which resulted from that Act were so beneficial to the Crown as well as to the Country, that we are induced humbly to propose that a similar Act should now be passed for the Improvement of this Forest; with this Difference only, that in order that a greater Proportion may be set apart for the Growth of Timber, no Deer whatever should be kept on any Part of this Forest; and as the neighbouring Inhabitants have acquired a Right to cut Bushes in the Forest, that when the Trees in the Inclosures shall be past Danger from Cattle, and it shall be judged proper to lay open a Part, on inclosing an equal Quantity of the Residue, they shall then be entitled to cut Bushes in the Parts so laid open.

In forming a Plan for the Improvement of Forest, where the Claims are so numerous and the Rights of the Crown over the different private Estates within the Perambulation so various, and where there would probably be a Necessity for the Examination of many Witnesses, to ascertain the Rights of Parties, preparatory to a Settlement with them, it appeared to us to be proper to recommend the Appointment of Commissioners for making those necessary Investigations, and to treat with the Claimants for bringing about the Settlement there proposed: But the Forest of Aliceholt and Woolmer being much less extensive, the Claims on it less numerous, and the Rights which the Crown has over the different private Estates less various; the Case of Dean Forest being also so similar and the Act for the Improvement of that Forest affording so good a Precedent, we have not supposed that the Appointment of Commissioners would be found essentially necessary in this Instance, previous to the passing of an Act, but that any farther Information that might be deemed requisite, for enabling Par-

liament to determine on the Propriety of the Measures to be adopted, and the exact Proportion of this Forest which should be inclosed for the Cultivation of Timber, might be obtained during the Progress of a Bill, as was done in the Two Instances of Dean and New Forests.

If, however, the Mode of Settlement by Commissioners should be thought more proper or expedient, we would, in that Case, humbly propose that Powers should be given to the Commissioners, similar to what we have recommended in our Report on New Forest; and that they should be instructed and empowered, either to make such an Arrangement and Settlement as we have proposed in this Report, or to purchase the just Claims on the Forest, giving to the Claimants the Price or Value of them, either in Money, or in an adequate Share of Land; so as to effect an entire Separation of Rights, and Division of the Soil; and such a complete Divi- Oran entireDi.l sion would be by far the most likely Means to prevent future Intrusion, or Waste, and to raise the Property, 1

whether in Wood or in Tillage, to the highest State of Improvement.

After a Settlement shall be made between the Crown Proposed Mod* and those having Rights of Common, a similar System of future Manage-of Management to that which we have proposed in our ment*

Report on New Forest should take place here, proportioning the Number of Officers to the Extent, and other Circumstances; and as the Trees, in general, at present A general Sale growing in this Forest, are found to he past Improve- of the Timber, ment, and suffer daily from the Depredations of the neighbouring Inhabitants, we are of Opinion that the Timber should be cut, and disposed of, in Annual public Sales, in such Quantities as may be brought to Market, without depressing the Price, reserving only such Trees Reaming onljj as are in the most thriving State, or may be proper to »l»riving Trees; i be left to drop their Acorns, and render the future Sue- I

cession more certain; and such likewise as should be “dbe [e7te'forP$^ left for Ornament, among which we cannot avoid par- or Ornament.: ticularly mentioning one antient and decayed Tree, called The Grindstone Oak, which being one of the largest Trees in England, measuring about 34 Feet and a Half in Circumference, at Five Feet from the Ground, and computed to contain 27 Loads of Timber, is a Proof what this Forest is capable of producing, if properly taken Care of.

The alarming Decrease of Oak Timber in this Kingdom, still confirmed to us on every Enquiry, and the grow ing Demand for private Shipping, as well as for the Navy, call for the Improvement of the Forests; and our Duty requires that we should suggest Plans and Regulations conducive to that End, though they may lessen the Advantages and Emoluments of those employed under the present System of Management: But it would, perhaps, be hard on those who may have been led, by the former Practice of Government, to consider their Residence in the Forests as permanent, and would not, in our Opinion, be consistent with the Dignity of the Crown, to strip away all Trees that are conducive only to Ornament, and reckon the Beauty of the Forests as not deserving of any Care.

Previous to the proposed Sale of Timber, the Forest propo*ed Mod should be divided into so many Parts, as that each of telling the Tin Division shall contain no more than may be sold in *>"

One Year; and each Part should be fenced in as soon as the Trees are removed, until the Whole of the Ground set apart for Inclosure shall be inclosed.

The Deputy Surveyor, and the Purveyor of Portsmouth Yard, are of Opinion, that the whole of the Timber may be sold in Eight or Ten Years, without bringing down the Price; and they think that it would be the most advantageous Way of disposing of it, to sell the Navy Timber along with the rest. In that Case, such as is fit for the Navy may be secured for the Dock Yards, by making it a Condition, at the Sale, that the Navy Board shall have the Liberty of taking it at the usual Prices given to Contractors for Naval Timber delivered at the Dock Yards under similar Circumstances:

This Mode would dot only preserve the proper Timber for the Navy, but by making the Purchaser sure of the best Price for those Kinds, prevent the Value of the rest from being depreciated, by any Suggestion of the Timber to be sold being only the Refuse of the Forest.

If either of the Plans we have suggested for the Improvement of this Forest shall take Place, we are satisfied that the whole Property will be rendered more valuable, and that the Crown and the Commoners will receive mutual Advantage from the Change.

The Public will, in the first Place, receive, probably, from Forty to Fifty thousand Pounds for the Timber growing the re; and the Part of the Forest allotted for Inclosure will, in Time, become a valuable Nursery of Timber, the Soil of Aliceholt being very fit lor the Growth of Oak, and that of for the Larch and Fir Trees, of which latter Sort there are some small Plantations, made for Ornament, about 25 Years since, which are now in a very thriving State: And the whole Expence of Carriage to the Dock Yards in the River does not exceed,) /. 8$. per Load. And we the more willingly recommend this Plan, because it would furnish an ample Fund, derived from the Forest itself, for the Improvement hot only of this Forest, but also of Dean and New Forests.

The Rights of the Commoners will also become more valuable: The Pasture for their Cattle in The Holt, which is at present of small Value, after the Feeding of the Deer (upwards of 1,900 Acres of the Lands being covered with Wood, and less than 500 Acres open Pasture) will be worth much more to them when the Deer and Timber are removed. The private Property will be freed from the Injuries to which it is now liable from the Deer, and which would be very much increased, if Government should again stock Woolmer with Red Deer, in case it snail not be disafforested; and the making of Inclosures for the Growth of Timber will be the Means of raising Bushes, of which there are hardly any at present in the Forest, and which those who have obtained the Right, will have the Liberty of cutting, for repairing their Fences, when the Inclosure shall be laid open. If the more complete Division before suggested shall take Place, the Commoners will obtain a Share of the Soil, instead of their former Rights, and will, in that Case, reap the Benefits which are commonly derived from the Inclosure and Improvement of Wastes.

We have fully stated what Rights are granted to the Lieutenant by his Lease. The Privilege which we apprehend would be chiefly affected by the Adoption of either of the Plans we have suggested, is that which relates to the Deer: By the Terms of the Grant, the Lieutenant is allowed to take One of each Kind Yearly for his own Use: The Perquisite of a Stag and a Hind ceased, of course, on the Removal of the Red Deer, about Thirty Years ago; and we should apprehend that there must be the same Right to remove the Fallow Deer from Aliceholt, as there was to remove the Red Deer from Woolmer. How far the discontinuing to serve Venison for the Use of His Majesty, or any of His Officers, may constitute an Exemption, or vest the entire Property or Disposal of the Deer in the Lieutenant, contrary to the express Terms of his Grant, is not for us to decide; but however unwise it may have been in Government to make such a Grant, the Rights and Advantages conferred by it must undoubtedly be continued to the Grantee during the Term of his present Lease, unless he shall be disposed to sell it to Government, at a fair Price; or a full Compensation must be given for such of them as he may be deprived of, by the Execution of any Plan for the Improvement of the Forest. This last may perhaps be done by renewing Vol. 45.

the Grant of the Office of Lieutenant, with the Great Lodge, and inclosed Lands round it, on beneficial T erms, but without any of the Conditions which have v-been found prejudicial to the Forest, or that may be liable to Misinterpretation; but it cannot reasonably be desired that a System of Management which is found by Experience to defeat the public Object of raising Timber for the Supply of the Navy, and which is likely to render the Property itself of no Value to the Crown, should be longer continued, if substantial Justice does not require it, and we must give it as our clear and decided Opinion, that no Renewal of the Lease should be granted on the present Conditions, and that none of those Advantages which are hurtful to the Timber, should on any Account be suffered to continue.

In the mean Time, and until the Alteration in Management shall take place, the Annuity of 130/. allowed by Government, during Pleasure, in order to be paid over to the Keepers, for their better Encouragement in protecting the Timber, should (if it shall be his Majesty’s Pleasure to continue it) be paid in such a Manner as to make them subject to the Orders of the Surveyor General of the Woods; and if they shall not be found effectually to protect the Timber, that Annuity should be paid to others, to be hired for that sole Purpose; a Regulation which we judge to be the more necessary, as we are informed that the Abuses of lopping and topping the Trees have already been increased since we viewed the Forest, and because it is probable that those accustomed to commit such Offences will become still more daring and desperate, when they hear of a Proposal to cut the Timber, by which their Profits must cease.

We cannot close this Report without observing, that though this Grant, which has had Effects so prejudicial to the Estate of the Crown, is not a Grant of the Forest, but of an Office to which Duties are annexed, as well as Emoluments, and those Duties have been neglected, while the Emoluments have been increased; yet it ought to be considered that these are the Consequences of the total Relaxation which has so long prevailed in this Department, and the Blame is less to be imputed to the Grantee, than to the System of Management, which affording no effectual Check on those entrusted with, the Care of any Forest, naturally leads to such Abuses.

Under an Office for the Management of the Landed Estates of the Crown, properly constituted, and keeping regular Entries, or Registers, of every Grant, Warrant, or Proceeding, relative to any Part of the Property, Incroachments on the Crown’s Rights would be so easily detected, that they could not long prevail. Without such Guides, it is neither an easy nor a pleasant Part of our Duty to discover what the Crown really intended to grant, or to reserve, and to trace the Steps by which Advantages have been acquired by Individuals, or the Crown deprived of any Part of its Rights.

One of the worst Effects of this Relaxation in the Government is, that the Grantees of Offices, being left so long in the undisturbed Possession of the Profits of what has been entrusted to their Care, are gradually led to look upon the Property itself as their own. To attempt a Reform in the Management, — to revive the Rights of the Crown, — and to endeavour to put a Stop to Emoluments, which, though inconsistent with the Public Interest, have been long enjoyed, may possibly now have the Appearance of Hardship; and where the Abuses have not originated, or been increased, during the Time of the immediate Possessor, perhaps it may be judged proper to give some Recompence for the Loss of Advantages, which, though at first improperly taken, have received a Kind of Sanction from the Inattention

or Forbearance of Government: But whether there should be any such Compensation given in the present Instance, beyond what may be fairly claimed in Return for any of those Emoluments which may be given up during the Term of the subsisting Lease, or what that Compensation onght to be, is not for our Consideration, and must be left to the Wisdom of the Legislature to determine: Our Duty requires only that we should state the Circumstances distinctly, in order that the Means of judging may not be wanting; and that we should suggest such Plans of Improvement, and better Management, of this Part of the Public Property, as we think the most likely to increase the Supply of Timber, so much wanted for the Royal Navy.

If either of the Plans we have suggested for this Forest shall meet with the Approbation of the Legislature, we are of Opinion that an Act should be passed for carrying it into Execution, before the Timber should be felled, lest, by rendering the Pasture more valuable, the Commoners should become more unwilling to agree to the Arrangement proposed and as the present State of the Timber is such that the greatest Part of it must diminish in Value the kmgcr

it continues standing, and no Succession of young Trees can come up, we humbly submit, that in our Opinion the Public Interest requires that the Plan which shall be adopted for the Improvement of thie Forest should be carried into Execution as soon as the Claims of the Lieutenant shall be duly ascertained, or his Lease purchased, and such a Change shall take Place in the System of Management of the Royal Forests, as that the Officers to be employed shall receive adequate Salaries for their Services, free from Deduction, and without any Perquisite, in Lieu of the present numerous and irregular Fees, Poundages, and Emoluments, by which the Produce to the Public, of the proposed Sale of the Timber, would be much impaired.

Sixth Land Revenue Report.

REMARKS:

From the Appearance of the Timber in Aliceholt Forest, and The Straits, it must have been well protected in its early Growth by Underwood, which the Rangers then preserved with Care; but, owing to the Preservation of it being neglected, and the uninterrupted Exercise of a Right, which the Proprietors of neighbouring Estates and Cottages claim, of cutting what Quantity of the Underwood and Bushes they think proper, there is no Prospect of an Increase of Timber; and even that now standing is frequently lopped, topped, and otherwise much injured, by those who, it is conceived, unjustly claim, and put in Force the Right before-mentioned.

The Timber in Aliceholt (on a computed Valuation) I estimate at 60,000l. It would have been of much more Value, had it not been so much lopped, and a great Number of Trees entirely topped; by which it has received considerable Damage. There is a great deal of it very old, and worse for standing.

I recommend a Fall of all Timber that is fit for the Navy, of which there is a great Quantity, and some spoiling.

Those Trees that have been lopped and topped, would serve wrell for Posts and Rails, to fence in, and sub-divide by a Ditch, Four Feet at Top, Three Feet deep, and Two Feet wide at the Bottom. This should be done without Delay, if the Ground is intended for the Produce of Timber, as the Inclosure would prove an excellent Fence for the numerous young Oaks, with which the Forest abounds.

The Deer, which I believe are about Four or Five hundred in Number, do much Prejudice to the Timber.

Aliceholt chiefly consists of Clay and Gravelly Soils, each excellent in its Kind, capable of being converted into Arable, Meadow, or Pasture. The Whole contains 2,427 Acres, and I have Averaged it at ioj. Acre, which amounts to 1,224/. 7 s. 6</. per Annum.

The chief Part of Woolmer consists of a light sandy Soil, interspersed with Peat Moors, as shewn on the Plan. For Sale I average it at 3 s.per Acre. The Land is not fit for the Produce of Oak, but is well adapted for the Growth of the Weymouth Pine, or any Kind of Fir, as proved by the several ornamental Plantations set by the late Ranger, Mr. Legge.

the said Memorial; and I also find, that the Propor-. tion of One Fifth Part of the said Sums due to her Ladyship, in lieu of the Lops, Tops, and Bark of the said Timber, and also the Sum of 130/. per Annum for Keepers Salaries, have not been paid, but remain- in Arrear for the whole Time of Sir Edmund Thomas's holding the said Office of Surveyor.

That at the Time' I last came into His Majesty’s Service, I found that there were several Works and Repairs unfinished, and absolutely necessary to be carried on, to prevent their going to Decay; and, there being no Money in Hand to be delivered over to me, I was under a Necessity of applying the Money raised by the Falls made under my Directions for the Purposes last-mentioned.

That a Fall of Timber has. lately, been made, under my Directions, by the Aid of which I shall be enabled \o discharge the Money due from me to her Ladyship, which shall be done so soon as the Money is received,

To the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury.

The Memorial of the Right honourable Mary Countess of Hillsborough:

Sheweth,

That your Memorialist, as Lieutenant or Ranger of His Majesty’s Forest or Chace of Alice Holt and Woolmer, in the County of Southampton, lately presented a Memorial to your Lordships, praying, for the Reasons therein contained, that your Lordships would be pleased to order that no more Timber might be cut in the said Forest, until the Right therein mentioned, claimed by the People of Frensham, had been determined by a Course of Law; which Memorial your Memorialist is informed hath been referred by your Lordships to the Surveyor General of His Majesty’s Woods.

Your Memorialist begs leave further to state to your Lordships, that your Memorialist, by her Grant from His Majesty, is entitled to the Boughs and Branches of all Trees and Wood within the said Forest, cut or thrown down, which your Memorialist hath been informed used to be taken by the Lieutenants or Rangers of the said Forest; but it was found to be so injurious to the Sale of the Timber therein, that for a great number of Years past, long before your Memorialist, or her late Husband, the Right honourable Bilson Legge, had the Grant of the Lieutenantship thereof, it had been agreed between His Majesty’s then Surveyor General, and the then Lieutenant of the said Forest, that the whole of the said Timber Trees should be sold, and that the Lieutenant should have One Fifth of the Amount of the Sale, in lieu of his or her Right therein; which hath been accordingly paid ever since.

That it hath been always usual to sell the Timber in the said Forest by public Sale or Auction, until last Year, when your Lordships were pleased to order Three hundred Loads of Timber to be cut therein, for the Use of His Majesty’s Navy, as your Memorialist hath been informed.

That, in pursuance of the said Order, Mr. Robert Briant, the Deputy Woodward, attended by a Mr. Slade, a Purveyor, and a Mr. Mills, a Contractor, went to the said Forest, and marked upwards of Six hundred Oak Trees, which were afterwards cut.

That your Memorialist caused a great many Applications to be made to the Deputy Surveyor and Deputy Woodward, for an Account of the said Timber, that your Memorialist might know how much her Fifth Part thereof amounted to; which your Memorialist could not obtain, till after she had presented her last Memorial to your Lordships, when the said Mr. Briant, the Deputy Woodward, gave your Memorialist’s Agent an Account thereof, a Copy of which is annexed.

That your Memorialist's Agent seeing by the Account how much the Quantity therein mentioned, amounting to 364 Loads and upwards, exceeded the Quantity ordered by your Lordships to be cut, asked Mr. Briant the Cause thereof; who told him that Mr. Slade and Mr. Mills (whom he considered as his Masters) would have a great Number of Trees marked, after he had repeatedly told them enough had been marked to fulfil your Lordships Order of 300 Loads.

That your Memorialist’s Agent then asked Mr. Briant why the whole of the 364 Loads had not been served into His Majesty’s Dock Yards; and why Mr. Mills, a Contractor, was suffered to have 42 Loads and 40 Feet of it, at so low a Price as 38 a1. a Load, although the same was bond Jide worth between 3/. and 4/. a Load; to which Mr. Bnant said, that Mr.

02 Slade

30 Geo. III. C2A° Februar 157

Slade, fearing he might be blamed for exceeding the ordered Quantity so much, directed Mr. to let

Mr. Mills have the 42 Loads and 40 Feet at that low Price of 38#. a Load.

That your Memorialist is informed, if the Timber had been put up to Sale in the usual public Manner by Auction, it would have produced nearly 2,500 whereas, by Mr. Briant's Account, the gross Amount is only 1,074/. lor. 9 d.to which is to be added about 80/. for the Stack Wood taken away by the People of Frenskam, under a pretended Right; out of which is to be deducted 179/. 19#. the Expences charged in Mr. Briant's Account

That if the said Timber had been sold publickly, as usual, and bad produced 2,500 /. your Memorialist’s Fifth Part thereof would have been 5001.; that had your Memorialist taken the Offal, it would, by Mr. Briant's Account have amounted to 382/. ex-clusivl of the 80/. worth of Stack Wood taken away, which would have made it amount to 462/. but if your Memorialist is to have only a Fifth Part of the Sale, according to Mr. Brs Account, after deducting the Expences, it will amount to only 178/.; your Memorialist however, is very ready and willing to take such a Sum for her Right as your Lordships shall be pleased to order.

That your Memorialists caused several Applications to be made last Year to the Deputy Surveyor for the Keepers Salaries, amounting to 130/. a Year for the Year 1776; but he told her Agent that he had no Money in his Hands, and therefore could not pay it.

That since Mr. Briant bad given in his Account, your Memorialist hath caused Application to be made to the Deputy Surveyor for the Keepers Salaries for the Years 1776 and 1777, when he offered to pay the Salaries for the Year 1776, but said he had not Money in his Hands to pay for both Years; and your Memorialist, knowing that more than sufficient had been received, either by the Deputy Surveyor or Deputy Woodward, ordered her Agent not to receive One Year’s Salary only; and the Deputy Surveyor refusing to pay both Years Salaries, her Agent received none at all.

That your Memorialist since she delivered her last Memorial is informed, that instead of 500 Trees, therein mentioned to be applied for by the Surveyor General to be cut this Year in the said Forest; the Application is for 500 Loads, which by the Rule of cutting last Year, will require upwards of 800 Trees, which your Memorialist is informed is a greater Number of Trees than there are in the said Forest fit for His Majesty’s Navy, unless a great many very growing Trees are cut.

That since your Memorialist delivered her last Memorial, she hath been informed through the Deputy Surveyor, that your Lordships ordered the 500 Loads to be cut this Year in the said Forest, before her Memorial came before your Lordships.

Your Memorialist therefore, for the Reasons contained in her former and this Memorial, prays your Lordships will be pleased to revoke your Order for the cutting 500 Loads this Year in the said Forest, and that for the future all the Timber may be sold by public Auction as usual; and that your Lordships will also be pleased to order the Surveyor General to pay to your Memorialist the Salaries for the Years 1776 and 1777 (which she hath already paid to the Keepers) and such a Sum in lieu of her Right in the Trees cut last Year, as to your Lordships shall seem right and equitable.

And your Memorialist will pray, &c.

To the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury.

My Lords,

In Obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference, I have considered the Memorial of the Right honourable - Mary Countess of Hillsborough, hereto annexed, and beg Leave to state to your Lordships,

That by Letters Patent, bearing Date the 11th Day of March 1773, all that Yearly Rent of 31 /. 2 11 d.

reserved by Letters Patent of his late Majesty King James the First, for and out of the Manor or Manors of Wordleham, otherwise East Wordleham and West

Wordleham, with the Rights, Members, and Appurtenances, situate in the County of Southampton, and Parcel of the Possession of the Crown, and also the Office of Lieutenant or Keeper of the Forest of Alice, Holt and Woolmer, with the Appurtenances, in the said County of Southampton, and all Officers Liberties, Wages, Fees, Commodities, and Priviledges whatsoever to the said Office belonging, were demised and granted unto the Right honourable William Earl of Dartmouth, Sir William Baggot, Baronet, Charles Townsend, and John Buller, Esquires, Trustees named in the Marriage Settlement of the Right honourable Wills Earl of Hillsborough and the said Countess of Hillsborough, to hold and enjoy the said Annual Rent of 31/. 2 s.nd. unto the said William Earl of

mouth, Sir William Baggqt, Charles Townsend, and Buller, Trustees as aforesaid, their Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, for and during such Term or Number of Years as would fill up and compleat the then existing. Term and Interest to the full Term of 31 Years from the said 11th Day of March, 1773; upon Condition, nevertheless, that the said William Earl of Dartmouth, Sir William Baggot, Charles Townsend, and John Buller, their Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, should pay, or cause to be paid, all and singular Fees, Wages, Salaries, and Stipends of all and singular the Forest Keepers and Officers within the said Forest or Chace: And also to have, hold, exercise, and enjoy the said Office of lieutenant or Keeper of the Forestand Chace aforesaid, with all and singular Offices, Liberties, Priviledges, Wages, Fees, Rewards, and all other Profits thereto belonging, for the like Term or Number of Years; and also to have and take all Beasts and Animals attached or taken within the said Forest or Chace by any of the Foresters

S s there,

158 24° Februarii 1790.

there, and all Manner of Wood blown or thrown Je down by the Wind, and all -dead Wood, and the; Boughs and Branches of Trees and Wood within the said Forest cut or thrown , and House Bote or Fire Bote for themselves and the Foresters and Keepers aforesaid; and several other Priviledges were also granted by the said Letters to the said Earl of

Dartmouth, Sir William Baggot, Charles and

John Bailer; and they did by the said Letters Patent covenant, promise, and agree, at their own proper Costs and Charges, well and sufficiently to repair, amend, support, uphold, and maintain all and singular the Lodges, Fences, and Inclosures of and belonging to the Premises, by and with all and all Manner of needful and necessary Reparations and Amendments whatsoever; and also covenanted that they would from Time to Time, and at all Times thereafter during the said Term thereby granted, discharge, save harmless, and indemnify His Majesty, His Heirs, and Successors, of and from the Payment of all and every the Salaries, Stipends, or Wages which should or might become due or payable to any of the Foresters, Keepers, and Officers of the said Forest or Chace, during the Term granted by the said Letters Patent; and also that they would preserve and keep the Deer and other Game within the said Forest and Chace, and all the Woods, Timber Trees, and other Trees growing in and upon the said Premises, from cutting, chopping, and Spoils, as will more fully appear by Reference to the said Letters Patent.

Upon a Search at the Auditor’s Office I find that in former Leases or Grants of the before-mentioned Offices, and particularly in one granted to John Mordaunt, Esquire, the ist of February, 15th Geo. lid. the Clause similar to that under which Lady Hillsborough founds her Claim to the Lop3 and Tops of all Timber cut down in the said Forest, is worded so as to admit of a different Construction, and is as follows; viz*. “ All and all Manner of Wood thrown down “ by the Wind, and all dead Wood, and the Boughs “ and Branches of Trees and Woods within the said “ Forest cut off or thrown down, and House Bote and “ Fire Bote,”&c.

I therefore submit to your Lordships Judgment, whether the Clause in the Grant to Mr. may

or may not be construed to extend to the Boughs and Branches of Trees and Woods casually cut off or thrown down, and not to the Branches of all Timber cut for the Use of His Majesty. If your Lordships should be of Opinion that this Construction ought to be put upon that Clause, I then submit to your Consideration, whether the different wording of the Two Grants may not have escaped the Notice of the Officers of the Crown at the Time of passing the last Grant. It is however necessary to inform your Lordships, that at the Time I had the Honour to be appointed Surveyor General of His Majesty’s Woods and Forests, I understood that the Lieutenant or Keeper of the said Forest was entitled to the Boughs and Branches of all Timber Trees cut down in the said Forest; and I therefore did, for the Reasons mentioned in her Ladyship’s Mepiorial, as I found my Predecessors had done, agree that the Whole of the Timber cut down in the said Forest should be sold, and that the Lieutenant should be paid One-fifth of the Amount of the Sales of the Whole, in lieu of the Boughs and Branches; and all the Timber cut in the said Forest to the Year 1776 has been sold by Auction, and a Fifth Part paid to the Lieutenant of the said Forest accordingly.

In the said Year 1776 Application was made to your Lordships for a Fall of 300 Loads of Oak Timber for the Use of His Majesty’s Navy, which I waa of Opinion might be supplied from the said Forest; and your Lordships were pleased, in pursuance of His Majesty’s Royal Sign Manual, to issue a War-

rant, dated the 19th Day of July 1776, directing 300 Loads of Oak Timber to be cut in the said Forest,-and delivered for the Use of His Majesty’s Navy at the usual Price of Timber supplied from the New Forest; that is to say, 1/. 18#. per Load. This Warrant was issued so late in the Year 1776, that to avoid the Loss of the Profits of the Bark, the Execution thereof was deferred till the Year 1777, when 321 Loads and 30 Feet of Timber were delivered to the Purveyor of the Navy, and a Bill made out to me for the same at the Price before-mentioned.

As to the 42 Loads and 40 Feet of Timber, mentioned in the annexed Memorial to be delivered to Mr. Mills at the Price of 1/. 18*. per Load, it was done without my Knowledge, and very much contrary to my Inclinations, for which Offence I have discharged my Deputy in the said Forest. All I could then do was to oblige Mr. Mills to pay me the full Market Price, at which, if the whole Quantity of the Timber had been sold, her Ladyship would certainly have been entitled to a larger Sum than I think myself justifiable in paying without particular Directions from your Lordships.

notwithstanding the Covenant in the Letters Patent, for the Lieutenant or Keeper of the said Forest to pay and indemnify the Crown against all Keepers and Officers Salaries within the said Forest, the Lieutenants or Keepers of the said Forest have for many Years past been paid the Sum of 130/. towards defraying the Expence of Under Keepers Salaries, and that Sum is now paid by me in pursuance of a Letter for that Purpose from Your Lordships Secretary, when the same comes in a Course of Payment, and I have Money in my Hands for that Purpose; and I have been informed that Lady Hillsborough is in Possession of a Warrant directing that Sum to be Annually paid out of Wood Sales; but her Ladyship has never thought proper to bring the said Warrant to be entered in my Office.

In pursuance of His Majesty’s Royal Sign Manual, your Lordships were pleased to issue a Warrant, dated the 2d of March 1778, for the Fall of 500 Loads of Timber in the said Forest for the Use of the Navy, which, in consequence of Lady Hillsborough's Memorials, now rests suspended; and the last of these Memorials having stated to your Lordships, that that Quantity could not be spared unless a great many very growing Trees were cut, I have, in Person, examined into the State of the Timber in the said Forest, and I find that 500 Loads of Oak Timber may with great Propriety be supplied from the said Forest; and, in order to avoid for the future all Occasions of Difference with the Lieutenants or Keepers of the said Forest, and to prevent like Delays in supplying the Navy with Timber therefrom, it has been agreed (subject to your Lordships Approbation) that for the future the Timber to be cut down in the said Forest be delivered for the Use of the Navy at the same Price that Timber is delivered from the New Forest, and that the Lops, Tops, and Bark, shall be sold by Two Persons, One whereof to be named by me, and the other by the said Lieutenant or Keeper, by Public Auction, to the best Advantage; and that Two Third Parts of the Net Produce thereof be paid to the said Lieutenant or Keeper, and the remaining Third Part to me, for the Use of the Crown, the same being, as nearly as can be computed, the Value of the Bark, to which the said Lieutenant or Keeper has no Right or Claim. This Agreement I humbly submit to your Lordships; and propose, if your Lordships approve thereof, that, agreeable to the Desire of the Navy Board, the said last-mentioned Warrant, directing the Fall of 500 Loads, be put in Execution so soon as the Season of the Year shall permit

All which is humbly submitted, 8gc.

To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

The Memorial of the Right Honourable Lord Stawell, Lieutenant or Keeper of the Forest or Chase of Alice Halt and ,in the County

of Southampton.

Sheweth,

That your Memorialist, on the 15th Day of April 1783, presented a Memorial to the then Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, stating,

That about Five or Six Years before, an Order was issued from the Treasury, empowering the Surveyor General of His Majesty's Woods to cut Three hundred Loads of Timber in the said Forest or Chase; under Colour whereof a much greater Quantity was cut, of which about Three hundred and Twenty Loads were sent for the Use of His Majesty’s Navy, and about Forty Loads were taken by Mr. a Contractor, at a very low Price.

That, in the succeeding Year, another Order was issued, to empower the Surveyor General to cut another large Quantity of Timber in the said Forest; but your Memorialist’s late Mother, the Countess of Hillsborough, the then Lieutenant or Keeper thereof, presented Two Memorials to the then Lords Commissioners of the Treasury (to which your Memorialist begged their Lordships to refer) in consequence of which the Execution of the last Order was suspended.

That Mr. Robert Briant, the Deputy Woodward of the Forest, attended by Mr. Slade, a Purveyor, and the before-named Mr. Mills, on the 3d and 4th Days of April 1783, went into the Forest; and Mr. Briant, by virtue of an Order supposed to have been then lately obtained from the Treasury, marked Three hundred and Thirty Oak Trees, which, in his Opinion, were sufficient to make up the Quantity of Loads directed by such Order to be cut: But Mr Millssaid he must have more; and with another Hammer, be (Mills) marked about One hundred and Eighty more Oak Trees, which your Memorialist presumed he had no Right to do.

That no Satisfaction was made to your Memorialist’s late Mother for her Right in the Trees so formerly cut, nor had any since her Death been made to your Memorialist for the same, neither had any Prosecution been commenced against certain Offenders mentioned in the said Memorial.

That your Memorialist might be considerably injured, if the Three hundred and Thirty Trees, then marked by Mr. Briant, should be cut before the Offenders referred

to were tyied; and that the Public Revenue would be greatly injured, if the One hundred and Eighty Trees, so marked by Mr. Mills, were permitted to be cut, which jCfjr Memorialist was informed would be immediately done, unless the said Order should be countermanded or suspended.

And your Memorialist therefore prayed their Lordships would be pleased immediately to suspend the Execution of the Order, until their Lordships should have fully enquired into the Facts contained in that, as well as in his Mother’s Memorials.

Your Memorialist now begs Leave to state to your Lordships, that in consequence of his Memorial, the Lords of the Treasury immediately ordered a Stop to be put to the cutting of the One hundred and Eighty Trees, marked by Mr. Mills; and soon afterwards their Lordships also directed, that the Execution of the Order of the Three hundred Loads should be suspended; but before their Lordships Directions came to the Knowledge of Mr. Briant, the Deputy Woodward, almost all the Trees marked by him were cut.

That the People of Freruham, under their pretended Right, immediately took away not only the Stack Wood, but the whole of the Tops of the Trees that were cut, except a very small Part thereof, which Mr. Briant secured.

That your Memorialist, a few Days past, was informed by Mr. Briant, the Deputy Woodward, that he had an Order to cut One thousand Loads of Oak Timber in the said Forest, immediately.

That your Memorialist is informed, that the Value of the Tops of the Timber Trees now ordered to be cut, is about Six Shillings a Load; which would produce to your Memorialist about Three hundred Pounds, in case the pretended Right of the People of was

tried and set aside; but if the One thousand Loads are to be immediately cut, the Whole of the Tops will be carried away by the People of Frensham, to the great Loss of your Memorialist.

That no Magistrate will interfere to prevent their taking it away, as they claim it as a Right; and that no pecuniary Satisfaction can be recovered from them, as they are all very poor.

That your Memorialist conceives the Crown ought to try the Validity of the pretended Right of the People of Frensham; nevertheless, if the Crown does not chuse to do it, your Memorialist, rather than suffer what he conceives (during the Continuance of his Grant) to be his absolute Property to be thus taken from him without a legal Decision, oners to try the Right in the Course of this present Year, as he has no other Wish to procrastinate the cutting the Timber, than to assert his Right to the Tops thereof in a legal Manner.

Your Memorialist therefore prays your Lordships will be pleased immediately to suspend the Execution of the Order for cutting the One thousand Loads of Timber, until the pretended Rights of the People of Frensham shall be determined by a Court of Justice.

And your Memorialist shall pray, &c. January 14th, 1784.

CASE.

Some Time ago several Parcels of Timber were cut down in His Majesty’s Forest of Holt otherwise Alice-holt, in Hants, by Order of His Majesty’s Surveyor of the Woods; and the Wood cut therefrom was sold by Order of the Surveyor for His Majesty’s Use; but before the same was carried away by the Purchasers, several poor Persons living in the neighbouring Parishes to the Forest pretended to have a Right to the Wood, and took Part of it, and carried it away. Application was made to some Justices of the Peace, in order to have the Offenders punished; but as the Persons claimed and insisted upon their Right to the Wood, the Justices declined acting against them, till the Right was determined; whereupon an Action was brought, in the Name of the Persons who bought the Wood, against One of the Offenders, which was tried last Assizes at Winchester, when a Verdict was given for the Plaintiffs.

notwithstanding which, upon more Timber being lately cut down, and the Wood cut therefrom sold Ity the King’s Officers, several of these poor People have como again into the Forest, and brought Carts with them, and carried away the Wood which was sold and corded up.'

Q. Whether the Justices of the Peace in the County may and ought not, upon Information made before them, issue their Warrants against these Offenders, and bind them over to the Assizes, or cpmmk them

for

for Want of Sureties, as the Right has been already tried, and a Verdict obtained; or what other will be the most expeditious Method to punish these People, and put a Stop to their Practices ? .

I think the Justices of Peace for the County may and ought, on such Information* to issue out their Warrants, and bind them over, or commit them for Want of Sureties.

The Examination of Robert Deputy to the

Surveyor General of the Woods in Aticeholt and WoolmerForest; taken on Oath, the Thirty-first.

Day of December 1789.

This Examinant has been about Fifteen Years Deputy to the Surveyor General in the Forest of Aticeholt and Woolmcr. He was appointed by John , Esquire, late Surveyor General. His Salary is Thirty Pounds a Year, paid by the Surveyor General; and he has no Fees or other Emoluments whatever. He understands his Duty to be to endeavour to protect the Wood and Timber; to discover Offenders, and to get them punished; to superintend the Felling and Delivery of the Trees for the Navy; and to execute all Warrants from the Treasury for Wood Sales, or any other Purpose, under the Orders of the Surveyor General. That as there are no Verderors or Regarders now in this Forest, he has little Assistance in the Protection of the Forest. When he detects any Offenders, he carries them before a Justice of the Peace, and endeavours to get them punished; and there is a Man now in Prison at his Instance, for an Offence done in the Forest. That when a Warrant is issued for a Fall of Navy Timber, it is sent to him by the Surveyor General: Sometimes a Purveyor of the Navy is sent to assist him in marking the Timber, and sometimes not; and one or more of the Keepers has always attended at his Desire, on marking the Timber; and he has commonly applied to a Justice of the Peace to be present at the marking, but no one ever attended till the marking of the Trees for the Fall of .500 Loads this Year, when, at his Request, Mr. Sewell, of Headley, attended; but no Purveyor was present on that Occasion, though required by the Warrant.

There have been Four Falls of Timber for the Navy since his Appointment (viz.); One of Three hundred Loads in 1777, One of Five hundred Loads in 1783, One of a Thousand Loads in 1784, and One of Five hundred Loads in this present Year 1789. Upon the first Two Falls the Timber for the Navy was squared and conveyed to the Dock Yard by Mr. Mills, a Contractor with the Navy Board. The Felling of the Timber was paid for, and the Tops and Cast Timber, and Bark, were sold by this Examinant, and accounted for to the Surveyor General; but the Offal Wood, after being cut for Sale, was stolen by the Country People, and carried off into Abbot's Wood, where Carts and Waggons came and carried it away publicly. The Fall of One thousand Loads was Winter-felled, and upon that Occasion the Navy Board agreed with this Examinant for felling, squaring, and superintending the Delivery of it at the Dock Yard, at Three Shillings and Five Pence per Load, exclusive of the Carriage, which was paid for by the Navy Board. The Tops, Lops, and all the Timber of this Fall, unfit for the Navy, was taken by Lord of which this Examinant gave Notice to the Surveyor General, but does not know what was done in Consequence thereof. On the Three Falls above-mentioned, the Tops and Parts unfit for the Navy were rased off Vot. 45.

by this Examinarft. On the last Fall Mr. Slade, a Sixth Purveyor from Deptford Yard, attended for that Pur- Lan^ heveno* pose, and the Timber was hewed, add conveyed to the , L»

Dock Yard, under his Direction. The Tops and Cast Timber, rejected as unfit for the Navy, were sold by Auction, and the Offal Wood cut for Sale by this Examinant, by Order of the Surveyor General, and Notice given of a Day of Sale; but before that Time arrived the neighbouring Inhabitants came with their Teams, and in One Day and Night carried off the Whole, being Six thousand Three hundred and Sixty-five Faggots. This Examinant detected Two of the Offenders loading a Waggon, and warned them to desist; but they refused, saying the y would have some as well as their Neighbours. . He afterwards got a Warrant from a Magistrate for apprehending them, and delivered it to William Harding, Tything Man of Frensham, who has never executed it, though the Examinant has often pressed him to do it, and offered the Assistance of himself, and his Labourers; and nothing has been done in it since, except that he has informed the Surveyor General thereof, who told him that he should lay the Matter before the Attorney General.

This Examinant was absent from the Forest onf other Business, when the Country People began carrying away the Wood; and when he returned it was almost all carried off. On his speaking of it to the Keepers, and asking whose Teams had been employed in taking it away, they declared they knew nothing of it, and he could get no Information from them against the Offenders: But this Examinant has observed that when any Timber is felled by Lord Order, no

Attempt is made by the Country People to steal the Offal Wood, and that hardly a Faggot is ever missing.

There was a much greater Quantity of Timber growing in the Forest when he first knew it, about Forty Years ago, than there is now: The Trees were not then near so much lopped as they now are; there were k great Number of Bushes, and a great many young Trees nursed up and protected by them. It has been falling off every Year since. There are now few Bushes remaining, and hardly any young Trees are suffered to get up. The Bushes which the Inhabitants used to take for Fuel being gone, they now lop the Trees,

.by which many have of late suffered; and they dig up the Roots of the Trees cut, which effectually prevents any young Growth. He believes there have been no Verderors or Regarders chosen for this Forest since he was appointed, and no Courts have been held. A great deal of Timber has been cut for the Use of the Lieutenant, without View or Warrant, under Pretence of Fuel and Repairs; and in One Year a large Opening was made in the Wood, opposite to the Front of the Great Lodge, quite through the Forest, to the North, to give a View of the Country, and the Timber felled to make that Opening was taken by the Lieutenant to his own Use; and this Examinant saw a great Pile of that Timber in the Yard of a Carpenter at Famham, who then did the Work at the Great Lodge.

Of this he also gave Notice at that Time to the Surveyor , Genera], but no Notice was taken of it, that he knows of.

By far the greatest Past of the Timber in this Forest appears to the Examinant to be nearly of the same Age, and of not less than One hundred Years Growth.

The chief Part of that Timber is past improving and a great deal of it in a decaying State. A great many Trees, he thinks about Twenty thousand, were lately marked by him, by cutting off a Square Piece of the Bark, and marking the Number of the Tree,' the Name of the Forest, and the Figure of a Crown on the Timber, with Iron Stamps. This he did in Obedience to Orders, after stating his Objections to the Mode. Another Method of marking was afterwards adopted, by shaving off the Rough Surface only of the Bark, and stamping Marks ana Numbers1

Sixth on it with the same Irons. But he admits, that he Lan<i Revenue would prefer the marking with Paint to either of those . KeP°rn „ Methods; being, in his Opinion, safer than the first, and more durable than the last-mentioned. But the Object of marking and registering the Trees in this Forest is defeated by the Steps taken by Lord who felled last Year, for his own Use, more than Two hundred Beech Trees for Foel, and since, more than Fifty Oak Trees, of those which had been marked and registered by the Direction of the Surveyor General, without the View or Assignment of this Examinant, or of any other Person on Behalf of the Crown.

If any Inclosures are to be made in the Forest for the Growth of Timber, he thinks that the Pruts to be inclosed should, in the first Place, be almost entirely cleared of the Trees now growing the re, leaving only a few, Ten or Twelve, of the young and most thriving on every Acre; he would then recommend ploughing the Ground before sowing the Aoorns, and along with the Acorns be would sow Hips, Haws, and Holly Berries, which would grow up and protect the young Oaks. In selling the Trees now growing, he thinks it would be right to sell those fit for the Navy, as well as the rest: There will, in consequence of that, be more Bidders, and the Navy Board may buy such of the Timber as is fit for the Use of the Navy again from the Merchant He thinks that Two thousand Loads might be sold Annually, without overloading the Demand, or depressing the Price: And, referring to his Survey of the Timber in this Forest, in 1783, he is of Opinion, that the Trees there stated as of a Size fit for the Navy, would probably sell for about Four Pounds Two Shillings and Six Pence per Load; those front Five to Thirty Feet Metings at Two Pounds and Ten Shillings Load; the S for era and Saplings at about One Pound and Ten Shillings per Lend; and the scrubbed and dotard Trees also at about One Pound and Tea Shitting; per Load. The Beech he thinks worth about One Pound and Five ShiUiogs per Load; the Ash, One Pound and Ton Shillings; the EJm, Two Pounds One Shilling and Four Pence; nod the Fir, about One Pound ana Five $hidingg per Load, all Girt Measure: But he Blinks, that owing to the Falls made since 1783, for the Navy, being Fifteen hundred Loads, Girt Measure, «pd at least Three hundred Loads for Lord the Damage done to the Forest by lopping, and the little Improvement which the growing Trees have made, the Quantity first-mentioned, as of a Size for the Navy, is considerably decreased, and that there is now, of Trees of that Size, about Eleven hundred Loads less than the Quantity stated in that Survey. Ho thinks the Soil of the uninclosed Part of A lice holt, if the Trees were removed, would be worth about Ten Shillings' per Acre; the Inclosures near the Great Madge worth about Fifteen Shdfings per Acre, besides the Garden; the Inclosures of Old Close Lodge, about Fiftem Shillings also per Acre; those at Goose Green Ledge worth Thirty Shillings per Acre. The Soil in the Part of the Forest called he thinks worth

Foar Shillings per Acre; and he thinks that a considerable Part, perhaps a Thousand Acres, of would produce good Oak Timber, as he observes that there is Oak Timber growing on the Estates round it, on Soils which appear to be of the same Nature; and that the Soil of Oak Hill, and of the Land about

borough Lodge, in fVoalner Forest, where there is some good Oak Timber now growing, appears to be very poor Laud on the Surface; from which he concludes, that there must be a better Soil below it to nourish the Oaks. And he thinks that the greatest Part of the r#st of Woolmer, except the Bogs or Mosses, would produce good Firs. The inclosed Land at Bourn Lodge he thinks worth about Seven Shillings per Acre; hut be is not so well acquainted with the Nature of the Soil nt Linchborough Lodge as to be able to set a

Value upon it He thinks the new Inclosures should be fenced with a good Bank, and Post and Rail, which might be done at little Ex pence, from the Refuse of the Timber. The medium Distance from Alice Holt to Godalming, where the Timber is shipped, is about Ten Miles; and from fVoolmer to Godalming, about Eleven Miles. The Expence of Land Carriage from Alice Holt is at present Thirteen Shillings per Load: But a Canal is now cutting from Basingstoke to the River Wye, which may, perhaps, come within a less Distance of the Forest than Ten Miles.

The Examination of John Adams, of Headley, in the County of Southampton, heretofore One of the Keepers of fVoolmer Forest; taken on Oath, this Seventh Day of January 1790.

This Examinant saith, That he is now of the Age of 76 Years or thereabouts, was born at Linchborough Lodge, in fVoolmer Forest, his Father, who was also bora there, being then Keeper of Linchborough Walk, as his Grandfather and Great Grandfather also were. That upon his Father’s Death, about 46 Years ago, he was appointed Keeper of the said Walk, by the Honourable Ruperta How, then Ranger of the said Forest, but was removed about Five or Six Years afterwards by

..... Mordaunt, Esquire, then Ranger: That he

was afterwards appointed Keeper of Borden Lodge in Woolmer Forest, by Henry Legge, Esquire, who succeeded Mr. Mordaunt as Ranger, and continued Keeper of that Lodge about Four Years, when he was again removed, at the Instance, as he believes, of one Henry Hoult, then Head Keeper and Steward to Mr. Legge, to make Room for his Son-in-Law Henry ,

the present Keeper there. That himself and his Father were allowed by Lady How, a Salary of 30/. a Year, and they had the Occupation of the Lodge and inclosed Lands about it, then worth about Five or Six Pounds a Year, and now in his Opinion worth about 20/. a Year, having been improved by his Father and himself; that they received Fees for such Deer as were then killed in Woolmer Forest, which were about a Brace or a Brace and a Half of Stags, one Year with another; they also received One Shilling a Thousand for Peat, besides Eighteen Pence a Load for cutting; and Eighteen Pence a Thousand for Turves, and Eighteen Pence for cutting; and Five Shillings a Kiln (containing about. Five or Six Loads) for Heath, or One Shilling per Load by the single Load: That the said Salary of 30/. a Year was first discontinued by Mr. Mordaunt, who allowed the Keepers of Woolmer oDly what they could make out of the Forest, by the Sale of Peat, Turf, and Heath; but no Persons living out of the Perambulation of the Forest were allowed to purchase any Peat, Turf, or Heath, the Regarders not suffering the Keepers to dispose of any, except to those who had Right of Common. That at the Time this Examinant was appointed Keeper, there were about 50 Head of Red Deer, and no Fallow Deer in Woolmer; that between the Time of his Removal from Linchborough Lodge, and Appointment to Borden Lodge, the King’s Hounds were brought into the Forest to hunt the Red Deer, and such as. were caught alive were carried to Windsor, many were driven out into the Country and destroyed, and the Remainder of the Stock, being about Two or Three Brace, were

given by Mr. Legg to.....Bonham, Esquire, of

Fetersfield.

That this Examinant has heard his Father say, that in his Time a Swanimote Court was held Once a Year for the said Forest, and other Courts more frequently, and that there were Verderors and Regarders regularly

chosen;

24° Februariu

163

chosen; and this Examinant himself remembers at one Time Four Regard ers, namely, Mr. Jeffery of Bonham, near Binsted, and his Brother, Mr. Jeffery of

Issington Mill, Mr. Lee of Headley , and Mr.* Ed-

xpaker of Neatham, all of whom used to attend with

the Keepers when any 'limber was assigned to be cut for Repairs, or Wood for Fuel; and this Examinant has often been with them on such Occasions. That the Quantity of Fuel Wood then allowed was, as he believes, ao Cords Yearly for the Great Lodge, and to Cords for each of the other Lodges; and that when any Repairs were to be done, a Survey was firet made by the King’s Officers, to know what Quantity was wanted, before; the Timber was assigned.

That be has often heard his Father say that the Commoners used to give an Account to the Keepers of the Cattle they turned into the Forest; and that each Man’s Cattle used to be marked with an Ear Mark, and the Whole with a general Brand Mark, called The Forest Brand, to distinguish them from the Cattle of Strangers; and that the Forest used to be driven at that Time, to clear it of Cattle during the Fence Monti); and he has in his Possession a Paper, dated the 2d June 1727, being a Notice from George Vernon, Senior, Esquire, and C Vernon, Knt. appointing Monday the 5th of the same Month to drive the Forest, and requiring the Regarders, Keepers, Reeves, and other Officers of the said Forest, to give their Assistance therein; which Paper came to this Examinant among various other Papers belonging to his Father (then Keeper as aforesaid:) — Which Paper is produced by him at the Time of his Examination, and left with the Commissioners of the Land Revenue.

That this Examinant also remembers the Forest being driven in the Fence Month Once white be was Keeper, at which Time all the Cattle ware impounded in the Forest Pound in Woelmer. That one Counsellor Guidot., who, as he believe*, was then Steward of

the Forest Courts, attended at the said Driving, together with an Attorney from Alton, to swear the Claimants to their own Cattle; and that such Cattle as belonged to Commoners were let out of the Pound, an paying ^d.a Head, called a Fee for the Pound Lock; and such Owners as had not Right of Common in the Forest were fined, some 5 and 6ome fit. fid. a Head each lor their Cattle then found treepassing in the Forest; but some refused to pay any Thing, or to redeem their Cattle, and suffered them to remain in the Pound until they broke out, or were let out, without any Thing being paid for them; and the Forest has not been driven, a6 he believes, for Horned Cattle, since that Time, but Sheep have been pounded many Times since.

That the Owners of several Estates near the Forest used formerly to pay Rents, in Money and in Com, to the Ranger of the Forest. He cannot specify the particular Estates, or the Quantities of Com; but he has in his Possession a Receipt, signed Wm Legge, dated 7th N<nf 1675, for 12 Bushels of Oats, expressed to be for Six Years, at Two Bnshete a Year, payable by his Grandfather John Adame, then Keeper of Linobbo-rough Walk, for Land in Kingsley, then belonging to

him. That he remembers, when a Boy, hie Father collecting several Bushels of Rent Oats, and currying them to the Great Lodge’, but that no such Com Rents have been paid, as he believes, for many Years past.

That this Examinant well remembers, when the Quantity of Bushes, Underwood, and Fern, was so great in almost every Part of The Holt, that it was impossible to ride through them. That he has often assisted the Keepers of The in looking for owt-lying Deer which they wanted to kill, and which Deer, after being driven back to The Holt, have lain concealed in the thick Covers there;- and that this Exwnmafrt has . Vol. 45.

sometimes sought for them, and beat thp Covers Four Sixth or Five Days together before they could be found. Land itevaouS That the Bushes in general were very high and strong; . RePort- „ and he remembers that, when one Thomas Grover was once employed by his Father, to cut a Load of Bushes to repair the Fences of the Ground about Lodge, the said Grover cut off a Cord of Wood from the Bottoms of the Bushes for his own Usfe; and that what remained afterwards were as long as the whole Length of the Waggon. That there were at that Time a great many young Trees nursed up and protected by the Bushes and Underwood; and that very few Bushes were then cut in the and none

whatever in The Holt, without Leave erf the Keepers; and he has heard, that the People used to pay the Keepers One Shilling a Load, until a Dispute happened between One of the Keepers of The Holt and one Mr. Hammond of Kingsley, who, as he has heard, refused to pay the Keeper’s Demand of One Shilling a Load for Bushes cut in the Straytes; which Dispute was followed by a Trial at Law, in which Mr. Ham* mond prevailed against the Keeper. That he well remembers hearing of the said Trial while he lived at Linehborough Lodge, but cannot tell exactly how many Years ago. That after the said Trial, the Bushes in the Straytes were cut more frequently, and in greater*

Quantities than before; and at length came to be cut by all the Country People thereabouts, without any Interruption from the Keepers, and without paying any Thing for the same; but no Bushes were cut in The Halt until those in the Straytes were almost all destroyed, when the Bushes iu The Holt were suffered to be cut in like Manner, in consequence of which there are now ao few Bushes, and what remain stand so thin, that they do not afford the least Shelter or Protection to the young Shoots, nor have done for many Years past, and there is now little or no young Timber growing the re.

That there are Three Tracts of Waste Ground lying on the Borders of Woolmer, adjoining to the Manors of Mill Land, Southay, and Oakhanger, otherwise Chapel Manor, and claimed as belonging to those Manors.

As to the First, this Examinant says, that the Bounds Of the Forest next Mill Land Manor were always reputed to be as they are described in the old Perambulation of the Forest, made in the Year 1635; vix. from the Highway leading to Medhurst along by the Fen Path to Old Thorn, and so to ford. That the Bounds were trodden publicly, acJ cording to the said Perambulation, by this Examinant as Keeper, and by many of the neighbouring Inhabitants, by Order of Mr. Legge, then Ranger, after a Week’s previous Notice given to Sir Thomas Ridge, then Lord of the said Manor. That this Examinant; diming all die Time that he was Keeper there, and his Father also, as he well remembers, cut Turf and Heath on the Land so claimed for the Use of the Commoners, and dug Stones there, and sold the same to various Persons, particularly some to Sir Thomas Ridge, then Lord of Mill Land Manor, and to Mr.

Jottiffe of Peter afield, and was paid for them at the same Rates as for Turf and Stones in other Parts of the Forest. That several Years after the Death of Mr. Legge, and after this Examinant was removed from the Office of Keeper, Mr. Richardson, then Lord of Mill Land Manor, cut the greatest Part of the Timber growing on that Land, and sold the same, and since that Time the Lords of Mill Land Manor have claimed an exclusive Right to that Land, mid the Keeper from that Time ceased to cut Turf or dig Stones there,' as before.

As to the Waste Land claimed as lying within Southay Manor, this Examinant says, That when he was first appointed Keeper, and long before, one Mr.

Heroey was Lord of that Minor; that Mr. Legge

purchased

"V RePort‘ That this Examinant's Father, as Keeper of Linc Perambulation of the Forest, and remembers going with borough Walk, as far back as this Examinant can re- his Father, and afterwards when himself was Keeper, member, and himself also during all the Time that during the Fence Month, to look after the Hinds, he was Keeper, always cut Peat and Turf on that which used frequently to Calve there, the Wood be-Land for the Use of the Commoners at the usual ' “

Prices, quite up to the Hedge of Blackmore Estate,

which Hedge is the Boundary of that Part of the Forest, and that no Person ever interrupted them, or ever attempted to take any without paying the Keep-

ing then very full of Timber and Btrong Underwood, affording Shelter and Protection to the Deer and their Young. That at that Time the Wood lay open for the Deer, and for all Cattle commoning on the Forest, to depasture there, and so continued during

ers for the same, during the Life-Time of Mr. Hervey, all his Remembrance, until about Twenty Years ago, or Mr. Legge, the former Lords, nor until after the when Sir Simeon Stuart ordered Gates to be set up in Death of Mr. George Wakeford, late Owner of Black- the Lanes leading into Bins Wood from Short Heath moor Estate, near 20 Years ago, when Mr. Wm Wake- Common on the East Side, and from Green Street on ford, the present Possessor of Blackmoor, and other the North Side, and excluded the Forest Cattle and Owners and Tenants of Estates within Southay Manor, all others, except those belonging to the Inhabitants took upon themselves to cut Peat and Turf there of Wordleham Parish. That Sir Simeon Stuart's Estate without paying for the same, and to prevent the Keeper from so doing; and upon treading the Bounds of Southay Manor have included that Part of the Forest as within the said Manor, to the Amount of about 160 Acres, without any Interruption from the Keeper.

As to the Part of the Forest claimed as belonging to Oaklianger or Chapel Manor, containing about Two hundred Acres, this Examinant says, That the true Boundary between the said Manor and the Forest is a small Stream of Water rising near the Corner of some new inclosed Lands belonging to Thomas Butler,

Esquire, in Temple Manor, and running down through the Peat Moor there into a Pond called Bins Pond, and through the Middle of that Pond, in which, as this

Examinant well remembers, there were formerly Two Term of Thirty-one Years. I receive a Rent of

The Answer of Henry Lord Stawell, Lieutenant or Keeper of the Forest of Aliceholt and Woolmer, to the Precept of the Commissioners of the Land Revenue.

I hold the Office of Lieutenant or Keeper by Lease from the Crown, for the Remainder of a

Sluices, one of which, with One Half of the Pond, belonged to the Forest, and the other to the said Manor; and this Examinant remembers when he was a Boy going the Bounds of the said Manor, according to the Course above described, with the

Steward and Tenants of.....Wilcox, Esquire, then

Lord of that Manor, and Doctor Holmes, then Rector of Headley, who, it was reported, was about purchasing the said Manor, or taking a Mortgage thereof. That' when this Examinant was Keeper of Borden

31/. 2 11 issuing out of the Manors of East and

West Wordleham, in Hants, and 60/. for the Rent of Old Close Lodge, without Account, and no other Rent.

I appoint Five Keepers in Aliceholt and Woolmer, and pay all Wages and Salaries to the Keepers, and for punishing Offenders, and all Expences of repairing the Lodges. No Salary is granted by the Lease, but 130/. a Year by the King’s Warrant, paid by the Surveyor of His Majesty’s Woods. The casual Fees or Emoluments of my Office are Windfalls, Dead Lodge he used to cut Peat on that Land, and dispose Wood, Fire Boot, Lop and Top, Liberty of Fishing, of the same to the Commoners at the usual Prices, and Property of the Fish; the Average Yearly Value until the Tenants of the said Manor claimed a Right of which has been about Ninety or a Hundred Pounds to cut Peat there without paying for it, and prevented a Year, exclusive of the Lop and Top, which I have this Examinant from cutting any more there. That had but once, and then a great Part of it was taken this Examinant remembers hearing Mr. Legge say away by the People of the adjoining Parishes, as a (when the Inhabitants of Kingsley complained to him pretended Right. The Messuages and Lands in my of being prevented by his Tenants in Oakhanger from Possession are the Great Lodge House and Land, within having Peat from that Common where they had the Pale or Rail, containing about 142 Acres, oc-usually been supplied) that he had examined his Writ- cupied by myself, now of the Yearly Value of 100l.; ings, and did not find that ito belonged to his Manor, but about 11 o Acres, Part of it, were only Heath, till That for several Years past the Tenants of Oakhanger divided and improved by my late Father: Goose Green or Chapel Manor have discontinued cutting Peat on Lodge House, occupied by Keepers, and the Land that Moor, and none is now cut there, except for the within the Pale or Rail, containing about 43 Acres, Use of Lord Stawell'& Hot House at the Great Lodge, occupied by myself, of the Yearly Value of 50/.; But the Keeper of Borden Lodge cuts Turf there for Old Close Lodge House, re-built at my own Expence, Sale as in other Parts of his Walk, as this Examinant and the Land within the Pale or Rail, containing

used to do when he was first appointed Keeper of that Walk.

That there is another Piece of Waste Land, Part of the Forest, containing about 30 Acres, near a Place called Rackrcell, adjoining to the Manor of Lysse, and now claimed by the Lord of that Manor. That this Examinant and his Father, while Keepers, used to cut Turf on that Land for Sale, without Interruption

about 95 Acres, in the Occupation of the Widow of the late Thomas Bennett, at the Yearly Rent of 60/. No regular Quantity of Timber is cut in the Forest for the Navy or for Wood Sales, but from about too to 140 Cords of Beech Wood for Fuel for the Great Lodge, about 16 Cords for Goose Green Lodge, and about 16 Cords for Old Close Lodge, and a small Quantity of Oak Timber for Cart Boot; of which, and of Timber

from any Person, and he never heard of its being for Repairs, the Ranger takes what he wants at his claimed as belonging to Lysse Manor until after the own Discretion. No Venison Warrants are served, Death of Charles Cole, Esquire, late Lord of that because there were scarce any Deer in the Forest when Manor, about Seven or Eight Years ago, when the my Father purchased it. He bought a great many Tenants of Lysse going their Bounds included that Head of Deer, and stocked it. The Number killed. Piece of Land within their Circuit, as belonging to on an Average of the last Ten Years, is Nine Brace Lysse Manor. of Bucks, and Five Brace and a Half of Does. No

v Hay

Hay or Com is purchased for the Deer. Several small Encroachments have been made, and much Spoil by the People adjoining, Notice of some of which has been sent to the Surveyor General’s Deputies.

No Verderors, Regarders, or Steward, have been appointed, or Courts held for this Forest in my Memory. No Court Rolls, or Records of Proceedings of Courts held for the Forest at any Time past, are in my Custody. The People of particular Parishes claim, and, I believe, have a Right of cutting Bushes in the Forest. The Parishes or Places which have Right of Common are Bramshot, Liss, Greatham, Part of Selbome, Part of Headley, Dockenfield, Binsted, and Kingsley in Hants. There are no Fences against Farnham Common, so that the Commons are intermixed. All Kinds of Cattle are admitted but Sheep; at all Times there is a Howherd, but not sworn. Pigs found not ringed are pounded. The Forest has never been cleared of Cattle in the Fence Month or Winter Haining, or driven, in my Memory. The Deer and Commonable Cattle depasture on the Commons of Dockenfield and Farnham Manors, adjoining the Holt Forest, and on the Commons of Passfield, Stanford, Mill Land, Oakhanger, Blackmore, Broxhead, Linford Chace, Mill Chace, Priors Luce, Greatham, and Kingsley, adjoining to Woolmer. The Deer do not depasture on the inclosed Lands within the Perambulation. There are no Purlieus belonging to the Forest. None of the Crown Lands in the Forest are extra-parochial. The Lodges in The Holt pay Land

Tax and all Parochial Dues to Binsted Parish, but those in Woolmer pay no Taxes. The Forest not being driven, it is probable that Cattle belonging to Persons not having Right of Common depasture in the Forest No Payments are made to me, or the Keepers in The Holt, for feeding of Cattle or Swine, or cutting Peat or Turf in the Forest ;but Payments are made to the Keepers of Woolmer, of which Accounts are sent herewith. There have not been any Lands inclosed from the Forest, for the Use of the Lieutenant or Keepers, since the Appointment of any of the present Keepers; nor any Licences granted for inclosing Waste Lands belonging to the Forest; nor any Fines, Rents, or other Payments received for any such Inclosures, within Ten Years last past. I keep no Cattle in the Forest in Right of my Office, but I occasionally do turn out Cattle in Right of Freehold Lands in my own Occupation, which have a Right of Common. The Keepers in The Holt do not turn out any. The Keepers in Woolmer have Horses and Cows that they keep in the inclosed Lands, and occasionally in the Forest. Arnett has,' on an Average, Two Mares and Two Colts; and White, Four Cows, Three Horses, and Four Colts.

held, or Verderors or Reorders chosen for this Forest,

This Examinant has been employed in Alice Holt since he has known it. No Inclosures have been made Forest about 31 Years. He was first appointed Ser- there for raising Timber, nor has he ever heard that vant to Mr. Carter, the late Keeper, and so continued there were any. Believes that the Timber now growing about Eighteen Years; at the End of which Time he there must have been raised by Means of the Bushes was appointed Head Keeper by "Lady Hillsborough: and Underwood, of which there were considerable He has never been sworn as a Forest Keeper, but Quantities when he first came into the Forest: But the considers himself as a Servant to Lord Stawell, during Inhabitants round the Forest claim a Right to cut

His Yearly Salary is Eighty-nine Pounds Bushes, and have of late Years cut so many, that there Seven Shillings per Annum, paid by Lord Staioell.He are now hardly any remaining; and he thinks that if occupies a small Lodge and Garden near the Great that Practice is not stopped, no more young Timber Lodge, and is allowed Fuel firom the FireWood cut can ever come of in the Forest. He does not know for the Use of the Great Lodge. He occupies no what Quantity of Timber or Wood is cut for Lord.

The Parishes which, he believes,

He has some Profit from the of Frensham, and of Wrecclesham, in the Parish of Sale of Browse Wood cut for the Deer, which is, One Famham, also claim a Right to intercommon on the Year with another, about Six Cords, worth about Forest, and turn in their Cattle; but whether they have Eight Shillings per Cord, above the Expence of cutting, a Right to do so or not, he does not know. All Kinds And he says, that the Three Under Keepers of Alice of Cattle are turned into the Forest except Sheep, and Holt had formerly One Oak Tree assigned to each of in such Numbers as the Owners chuse to send. They them, by the Surveyor General’s Deputy, which Trees are usually turned into the Forest in the Spring, as soon they commonly sold for their own Use, and frequently as there is Food for them, and taken out when the to the Deputy Surveyor. He remembers One Tree Owners think fit. The Forest is not regularly cleared assigned to the Keepers by Mr Whatley,late Deputy during the Fence Month or Winter Haimng; but when ,

Surveyor, the Timber of which sold for Eighteen this Examinant was Howherd of the Forest, about Pounds, but the Average Yearly Value was about Six Twenty Years ago, he used to fix a Notice on the or Seven Pounds to each Keeper. This Allowance was Church Doers of Binsted, Kingsley, and ,

discontinued about Nine or Ten Years since, by the that no Milch Cows or Working Horses were to be Order (as Mr. Briant, the present Deputy Surveyor, turned into the Forest in the Fence Month, or suffered informs him) of John Pitt, Esquire, late Surveyor Ge- to stray from the Highways in passing through it, the neral. His Disbursements are, for the Wages and Form of w'hich Notice was given to him by the' pre-Board of One Man Servant, Twenty-four Pounds a ceding Howherd; who had usually done the same;

Year, and he keeps One Horse (on Land rented by him but that this Prohibition was not strictly enforced, out of the Forest) and about Two Couple of Hounds Says, that the Forest is frequently driven in Pannage at his own Expence, which together cost him on an Time, to see that the Hogs are duly ringed, and if any Average about Twenty-four Pounds a Year. In regard are found unringed, the Howherd rings them, and takes to the Stock of Deer in the Forest, he has heard, that Four Pence each from the Owners for all that are un-when the late Mr. Legge first became Lieutenant, there ringed. Sheep are also impounded when any are found were not more than Seven 'or Eight Deer there in the in the Forest, which seldom happens, and a Penalty of Whole; and that he bought a great many Deer, and Four Pence a Head imposed on the Owners, which is increased the Stock so much, that there were at One received by the Howherd for his own Use. He does Time near Fifteen hundred Head. The Number of not remember the Forest being driven for Horned Deer has been as low as about Three hundred since Cattle, but about Fifteen Years ago the People of this Examinant has been in the Forest, but is now about Binsted and the Keepers drove the Forest for Horses;

Eight hundred in the Whole. The Number killed and that Two Persons who had not a Right of Common Yearly, on an Average of the last Ten Years, is about were fined for having Horses there, One of whom was Nine Brace of warrantable Bucks, and Five Brace and an Inhabitant of Binsted, but did not occupy any Land an Half of warrantable Does, besides about Two Brace there: Blacknest Lane was used as the Pound on that and an Half of thig Backs, and Seven Brace and an Occasion. No Methods are- now used to prevent sur-Half of thin Does, which are cut into Quarters, and charging the Forest, or to ascertain whether the Cattle given to the neighbouring Farmers. The Whole are turned into it belong to Commoners, or not. He be-killed by this Examinant and his Servants, and are dis- lieves that People who have no Right of Common, and posed of entirely according to Lord Stawells Orders, live in other Parishes, frequently rent small Quantities None are supplied for the Use of His Majesty, nor any of Land in Binsted Parish, and under Colour of that Venison Warrants now served. The Chief Justice in Right send Cattle from their other Farms to depasture Eyre, and occasionally his Secretary, and the Surveyor in the Forest.

The Examination of Hairy Him, one of the Keepers of Abedhalt Foresttaken, on Oath, the 15th Day of January 1790.

This Examinant was appointed Keeper of Old Close Walk,in Aliccholt Forest, about Two Years ago, by the Right honourable Lord during his Plea-

sure. His Salary is Twenty Pounds a Year, and he receives no Fees or Perquisites of any Kind, besides his Salary. He occupies Part of the House called Goose Green ledge, with a small Garden, but no other Lands, and he keeps no Cattle on the Forest The other Part of Goose Green Lodge is occupied by Richard Whorsrd, Game Keeper of Lord s Manors

near the Forest. The inclosed Lands adjoining to that Lodge are in Lord Stawe own Hands; and the Lodge called Old Close Lodge, and the Lands belonging to it are rented as a Farm by William Bennett. He considers it his Duty to take Care of the Deer, and of the Wood and Timber iu that Part of the Forest. When he detects any Persons cutting or lopping Trees in the Forest be endeavours to prevent them, and to take away their Hatchets; and gives Information thereof, and of the Names of the Offenders, to William Moore, Head Keeper of the Forest, that he may acquaint Mr. Briant, the Deputy Surveyor, therewith; and he sometimes acquaints Mr. Briant himself, when he has an Opportunity. The Quantity of Wood cut for Fuel for Goose Green Lodge is about Fifteen Cords for himself, and the said Richard Whorard. He does not know what Timber or Wood is cut in the Forest for any other Purpose. He cannot tell the exact Number of Deer in the Forest, but believes there may be about Five or Six hundred of all Sorts. He does not know how many are killed Annually, having no Concern with the killing of the Deer, which is entirely under the Management of the Head Keeper. There is not any Hay or Com given to the Deer, but sometimes some Ash and Maple Boughs are ent for Browse for the Deer, in very severe Seasons, but this has happened only Once since his Appointment. There has not been any Encroachment made in Old Close Walk since be was appointed, except One, of a few Rods of Ground, by one Thomas Grocer, which was thrown out again by this Examinant.

Hie Examination of Henry White, One of the Keepers in Woolmer taken on Oath,

this Thirteenth Day of December 1789.

This Examinant has been One of the Keepers in Woolmer Forest about Thirty-five Years. He was first appointed by the late Mr. Legge, Father of Lord Stawell, and has always resided in Bourn or Borden Lodge. — He understands that there is a Salary from Government intended for his Office, amounting to Three Pounds and Ten Pence a Year, but no Salary has ever been paid to this Examinant, nor has he any certain Fees, but is allowed to take whatever he can make of the Forest by the Disposal of Peat, Turf, Heath, or Fern cut within his Walk.- — That he is not restrained to any Quantity, nor confined to any particular Parts of the Walk, but may cut as much as be can dispose of in any Part of his Walk, and sell it to any Person whatever, without Distinction, whether living within or without the Perambulation, and without Regard to the Palish in which the Purchaser has his Residanoe. No Persons cut Peat, Vol. 45.

Turf, or Heath, but such as are employed by this Examinant, and the Buyer pays for Peat Twq Shillings per Load to the Labourer for cutting and drying it, and One Shilling per Load to the Keeper. The Load contains, he believes, more than a Thousand Peats, but they are not commonly numbered. For the Turf the Buyer pays One Shilling and Six Pence per Thousand to the Cutter or Labourer, and One Shilling to this Examinant, and the Labourer is paid Six Pence per Thousand more if lie sets up the Turves and dries them; and for Heath, the Labourer is paid Three Shillings per Load for cutting, and the Examinant receives One Shilling. — The Heath is commonly used in burning Lime; Six Loads burn a Kiln, and when he is paid by the Kilo, and not by the Load, he receives only Five Shillings for the Kiln. For the Fern he gets such Price as he can obtain from the Buyers, setting out a certain Quantity of Ground on which the Farmer or Buyer is allowed to cut the Fern, according to the Price agreed on. The Fern is used for littering Horses or Cattle, and the Peat and Turves for Fuel. No Coal is burnt except in Gentlemen’s Houses, and Wood is become scarce and dear, so that the Turf and Peat are the most common Fuel. There are other Parts in the Neighbourhood in which Turves are got, but they are not so good as those in Woolmer, the Soil being inferior, and more sandy. His Profit from the Disposal of all those Articles, Peat, Turf, Heath, and Fern, is, one Year with another, to the best of his Belief, about Forty Pounds a Year. In the Mosses, Roots and Stems of Trees are often dug up, some of which are Oak, and others Fir, but none of great Size. The Soil on the Hills in the Forest is generally sandy, some white, some black, and some red, all poor, but he thinks the red is the best, and the black the woret A Plantation of Scotch Fir was made by Mr. Legge about Twenty or Five-and-Twenty Years ago, of about Two or Three Acres. Some of the Soil is of the red and some of the black Kind, and the Trees on the red thrive much better than the rest Some of those Firs are now about One Foot diameter, and very thriving. The low Grounds are generally mossy, producing Heath and coarse Grass; Peat is got in the greatest Part There were formerly some Red Deer in Woolmer Forest, but there are none now; formerly, as he has been told, Cattle were turned out of the Forest, particularly Milch Cows and Shoed Horses, during the Fence Month, and the Forest was then driven, but no Attention has been paid to that within his Time. All Kinds of Cattle are now admitted, Sheep only excepted, and at every Season; the Forest is never driven. Formerly Cattle put into the Forest by those who had no Right of Common were pounded; but that has also been discontinued, and the Cattle of Strangers are admitted without Challenge. No Fine or Fee is paid for depasturing Catde. Some Rents in Oats, as he has been informed by his Wife’s Father, Henry Holt, who was Keeper in Holt Forest in Lady H<m'% Time, were formerly paid, hut he has never received any Oats, nor any Rent of any Kind; but there are Three Persons, Edward Al-berry, James Farr, and John Chuarlon, who possess Cottages, with small Pieces of Land adjoining to their Houses, and within the Forest, who pay small Quit Rents to Lord Stawell — the First a Pepper Com, the Second Four Pence, and the last he does not exactly know the Rent The Land, in all of these Parts together, may be about Thirteen Acres, and they are said to hove been granted to them for assisting the Keepers when there were Deer in the Forest. The Examinant possesses a House, called Borden Lodge, with about Ten Acres of Land within the Rails, worth together about Four Pounds a Year, the Land being of a poor Quality. He keeps generally Seven Horses, Four of winch are Foresters, which go" always in the

Forest;

Sixth Forest; Three Cows, which go in the Forest all Day, Land Revenue and are put into the House at Night; and generally Report. Two pjg9 or Swine. There have been no Encroach-' ments in his Walk since he has been Keeper, except that Alberry above-mentioned, in making his Hedge straight, took in a few Rods. No Courts of Attachment or Swanimote have been held, nor are there now any Verderors or Regarders, though he remembers, when he was first appointed, there were Two Regarders, the one Mr. and the other Mr.

Jefferey, of Bonham; and he remembers to have been sent by his Father-in-Law to call upon them, to attend in Holt Forest, in order to mark Beech Wood for Fuel for the Great Lodge; and has heard, that they always did attend when any Wood was to be marked for that Purpose. Believes that the Places which have Right of Common in Forest are the

Parish of Kingsley, and Oakhanger, which is Part of the Parish of Selbourtie, and Farm, belonging to

John Baker of Hadley, which is in the Tything either of Kingsley or Oakhanger, and is a Purlieu; he knows no other Purlieu. Stream Farm has also Right of Common, and Moor House Farm and Hopperie, and a small Farm called Haine's and Becil's Farm, all in the Tything of Kingsley; he knows of no other out of the Perambulation which have Right of Common; but on all Open Grounds within the Forest the Deer and Commoners Cattle of the Forest are admitted, and all Estates within the Perambulation have Right of Common in the Forest, which is called Intercommoning. There are very few Oak Trees now in his Walk; one grows at a Place called Dead Water, and is called Grover's Oak, where a Forest Court is said formerly to have been held. There is a Part of the Common near Bins Pond, on the West Side of his Walk, claimed as belonging to Chapel Manor, which Manor, when he was first appointed Keeper, belonged to the late Mr. Legge, who had bought it about Three or Four Years before of one Mr. Chaffinch, a» he believes; and he remembers hearing Mr. Legge say' to a Tenant of his, one John Lee of Chapel Farm, who desired to have that Land for a Sheep Common, that he should not have it, as he could not find by his Writings that it belonged to Chapel Manor; and added, that , he should certainly have been glad to find that it belonged to him, as he would rather have it for his own than be Ranger over it. This Examinant has heard that Bins Pond was the ancient Boundary between the Forest and Chapel Manor, and that there were formerly Two Sluices in that Pond, one of which was managed by the Forest Officers, and the other by the Owner of Chapel Manor; but this Examinant does not remember more than One Sluice there since he has been Keeper, which Sluice is wholly managed by the Lord or Tenants of Chapel Manor. Says, that Lord Slawell cuts Peat in that disputed Part for his own Use at the Great Lodge, but not for any other Use; and that this Examinant cuts Turf there for Sale, as in other Parts of the Forest, but not Peat; but he has been informed by one John Adams, who was Keeper of the same Walk before him, that in Mr. Mordaunt's Time (Mr. Legge's Predecessor) the Keepers cut Peat there for Sale, as well as Turf.

The Examination of Darnel Arnett, One of the Keepers of WoolmerForest', taken on Oath,the Thirtieth Day of December 1789.

This Examinant is Keeper of Linsberry, otherwise Lynchborough Lodge, in Woolmer Forest. He was appointed by Lord Starcell in February last, of the Death of his Father Darnel Arnett, who was Keeper , of the 07

same Lodge upwards of Twenty-two Years, during all which Time this Examinant lived with his Father at the Lodge, and for the greatest Part of it acted aa a Servant under him. He occupies the Lodge House, with about Eight Acres of Arable Land, Seven Acres of Meadow-, and about One hundred and Ten Acres of rough Forest Ground, all of a poor Soil,*and not worth more than Nine or Ten Pounds a Year. He usually keeps about Four Cow’s, and Two nr Three Pigs, for the Use of his Family, and a Mare and Colt upon the Forest, and no more. He receives no Salary, nor any Rents or other fixed Payments; and his only Profits arise from Peat, Turf, Heath, Fern, and Stones, of which he has the Liberty of selling as much as he can. The Average Amount of these Profits he believes to be about Fifty Pounds a Year at the most, out of which he pays Five Pounds a Year to an Assistant (one William who

lives in a small House called Woolmer Pond House, and for the Wages and Board of a Boy who lives with him about Thirteen or Fourteen Pounds a Year, and he keeps One Horse, which costs him abont Nine or Ten Pounds a Year. There are no Deer in Woolmer Forest, nor have been since he has known it; but there are several People in the Neighbourhood who remember when there was a considerable Number of Red Deer there. There have not been any Courts held for the Forest, nor Verderors or Regarders appointed, since he has been employed there. There is some Oak Timber growing on a Tract of Ground of about Fifty Acres, called Oak Hills (or Holly Hills) near his Lodge, and in the Fences of his inclosed Grounds, in Number about One hundred and Eifty or Two hundred Trees, whereof about Twelve or Fourteen are good Trees, meting at about a Load each, and in his Judgment are fit for the Use of the Navy. The rest are young Trees, and were in a thriving State, but have been very much hurt by cutting Pieces of Bark from the Sides, and stamping Marks and Numbers on the Bodies of the Trees, which was done by this Examinant, by Order of Mr. Briant, the Deputy Surveyor. There is no Timber or Wood on any other Part of his Walk, except some Hollies in a Place called Sheer and some Alders and Willows in a Place called Liss Moor, and a small Alder Bed near the Lodge, which the Keeper cuts for Firing and for making Fences; the rest of Woolmer Forest is a barren sandy Soil covered with Heath, Part of it consisting of a reddish Sand, Part a white Sand, and the rest a Kind of black Rock. The best of these, he thinks, is the red Sand, which may be about One Tenth Part of the Whole. There are some Plantations of Firs in Henry White's Walk, made by the late Mr. Legge in that Sort of Soil, which seem to thrive very well; but some Firs, which were planted in the white Sand, died very soon. About One Half of Woolmer Forest is of this latter Kind. The black rocky Soil is deemed the worst, and will bear nothing besides a little Heath, on the Surface. There have not been any Encroachments made on the Forest since his Father was appointed Keeper, nor any Lands inclosed from thence for the Benefit of the Keepers, or otherwise; but the Lord of the Manor of Mill Land claims a Part of Oak Hill as within his Manor, and has cut Timber, and Wood there; and since the Trees now growing the re were marked by Mr. Briant's Order, as before;mentioned, Mr. Hutterson, the present Lord of that Manor, has had his Mark put upon them, and threatened to prosecute this Examinant for marking them as directed by Mr. Briant. Says, that the Parishes of Bramshot, Headley, Liss, Greatham, Amshot, Selbume, Kingsley, Binsted, and Bentley, claim a Right of Common of Pasture and Turbary, paying to the Keeper One Shilling per Waggon Load for Peat, which contains from 1,000 to 1,200 in Number, and for Turf One Shilling

and

173

and Six Pence per Thousand, besides One Shilling and Six Pence a Thousand for cutting the Turf, and Two Shillings a Load for cutting and drying the Peat. He has heard that the Price of Turf was formerly One Shilling a Load, but raised by one John Adams, a former Keeper, to One Shilling and Six Pence per Load, on being threatened by the Parishioners of Bramshot to be assessed to the Parish Rates, which however was not effected. These Prices are paid by the Commoners, but Strangers are charged Six Pence per Load more for Peat, and are not allowed to have any Turf. Heath is cut for burning Bricks and Lime, and is usually sold by the Kiln, at Five Shillings per Kiln to the Keeper, and Eighteen Shillings a Kiln for cutting; but if sold by the Load, the Price is One Shilling per Load, and is cut by the Buyers, or at their Expence, for which they pay Three Shillings a Load. Fern is cut for Litter for Cattle, and is sold at Two Shillings and Sixpence a Waggon Load, if cut by the Keeper, or One Shilling, if cut by the Buyers; and Stones at Six Pence per Load, and One Shilling and Six Pence for digging. It frequently happens that Stems of Fir Trees are found in the Peat Bogs, some as large as a Man’s Body. He has heard that Oak Trees have been

found in some of the Bogs in Woolmer, but never saw any other than Fir. No Payments are made for Herbage, except an optional Gratuity of One Shilling or One Shilling and Sixpence each, formerly given to the Keeper at Easier, by many of the Commoners, but now by very few. All Kinds of Cattle are admitted, except Sheep* which are not allowed to be turned into the Forest, but sometimes stray in from the adjoining Commons, the Forest being open on almost every Side. The Forest has not been driven within his Remembrance, but when any Cattle are seen in the Forest not belonging to Commoners, the Keeper endeavours to find out the Owners, gives Notice to them to take away their Cattle, and threatens to pound them if not taken out of the Forest. Has never pounded any Horned Cattle there, but frequently Horses, the Owners of which, on taking them out of the Pound, pay Two Shillings and Six Pence each for catching them, and the Expence of keeping them while there, and if not owned, they become the Property of Lord Sterwell; but he remembers only Three or Four Instances of Horses not owned, which were given by Lord Stawell to his Father for his Trouble.

Famham, 31st of December, 1789.

Gentlemen,

In Obedience to your Directions of the 21st Instant,

I have attentively looked over the Forests of Aliceholt and JVoolmer, and have considered the Nature of the Soil; and am of Opinion, That every Part of Aliceholt would produce Oak Trees of a Size and Quality fit for Naval Purposes, if properly managed. — The Trees now standing thereon are mostly Oak, some Beech, and a few Ash; and I judge to be nearly all of the same Age, and the greatest Part arrived at Maturity, and of course will not improve by standing longer.

From the present Appearance of this Forest, I am inclinable to believe, that the greatest Part of the Trees now standing thereon were originally raised by one general Inclosure of the whole Forest, as most of them appear to be of the same standing, which I suppose to be about 115 or 120 Years; and I cannot discover the Traces of either Banks or Ditches in the interior Parts, or any Appearances whatever of separate Inclosures, or if there were originally no Inclosure, the Bushes and Underwood must have been carefully preserved. The Trees were brought up very close together, and not being thinned from Time to Time, as they ought to have been, is the Reason why they are generally no larger at present.

There are not now any Inclosures in this Forest for raising of Timber, or very little Timber in Succession, nor is it possible there should, as the Bushes and Underwood of all Kinds, which are the Nurses and

Protectors of Timber, are destroyed by the adjacent Inhabitants as soon as they come up.

Though there are vast Numbers of Oak Trees standing in this Forest arrived at their full Growth, by far the greatest Part is not of a Size or fit for the Navy, owing to the Causes before observed; and a great Number of them are much injured by lopping, particularly on the South East, South, South West, and West Parts of the Forest, adjoining to the Parishes of Kingsley, Binstead, Famham, and 'Bently.

From the Account of the Survey taken of the Timber in this Forest in the Year 1783, and considering what has been felled since that Time for the Navy, together with the present Appearance of the Timber,

I am of Opinion, that about Two hundred Loads may be supplied from thence Annually for the Use of the Navy, for a few Years, exclusive of what Planking Timber may arise, which I suppose would be very considerable; and I would recommend that Six or Seven hundred Trees be felled Annually for Sale, reserving all such as should be found fit to make or 3 Inch Plank for the Navy, and to be converted in the Forest, in order to lessen the Expence of Carriage; and to send none to the King’s Yards but such as was good and fit for the Service. — In making such Annual Falls 1 would propose to begin, and so go on, in those Places where the Trees are most given out, or quite done growing, or most abused by lopping, and entirely clear the Ground as I went on, reserving all such Trees as should be found fit for the Navy to go towards making Part of the Two hundred Loads to be supplied Annually, besides all such as were fit to be cut for Plank; and I would recom-

04 mend

rmdnd the'making of Inclosures as the Land became Vacant, and in such Parts as are already so, and that they should be well attended to; without which (or a Toted Stop put to the cutting of the Bushes) a few Years must put a' Period to this Forest as a Nursery of Timber for the Navy; yet if a Stop could be put to the Abuses, and voting Timber; propetly cultivated and well managed, this ^Forest may beiinade of great Benefit to the Country, by yielding a lasting ‘Supply of Naval Timber, probably a Thousand Loads a Year.

The Average Distance of this Forest to the nearest Wharf (which is Godalming) is Ten Miles, and the Timber' carried thither at 13 Shillings per Load, and from thence to Deptford at 14 Shillings per Load more, the Hewing 1 s. 6d.per Load; the whole Expence, from the Felling to the Delivery, 1 /. 8$. 6d.

The most glaring Abuses now prevailing in this Forest, are the neighbouring Inhabitants going into the Woods, and constantly destroying the Bushes and Underwood of all Kinds as fast as they come up, so that there are none to be seen in any Part of it; the lopping and topping the Trees in a most shameful Manner, particularly in those Places mentioned before; they also claim a Right to the Roots of all Trees, and constantly grub them up as soon as the Trees are felled; also the stealing of Trees is not the least evil Practice in this Forest; and I presume that the Practice of Lord Stawell's People cutting Trees without Limita-

tion, View or Assignment, or giving any Account of what they do cut, or for what Purpose, must be considered also as an Abuse. As I was looking over the Forest, I saw 37 Oak Trees just felled by his Lordship’s People, with the Rind on, that would square about 30 Feet a Tree one with another. There are a few Encroachments in this Forest, which I suppose are pointed out in the Plan that has been taken. — I beg to remark, that if all this Forest was at some Time or other inclosed for the raising of Timber, which its present Appearance strongly indicates, there could be then no Claims upon it, or they must have been for a Time suspended; and if the Trees were1 brought up Without being inclosed (which is not likely) the Bushes alnd Underwood must have been preserved, otherwise it was impossible the Trees could have got up in the Manner they have; in this Case the Inhabitants must have been restrained from cutting them, and consequently had no Right to do so.

There are but a very few Oak Trees in Woolmer Forest; most of the Land is quite barren, being a sandy Soil, though there are some Parts of it that would produce Oak Trees, and Inclosures for that Purpose may be made with Advantage; and it is to be observed, that Fir Trees will grow in all Parts of it; some few, that were planted about 25 Years ago, by Government, are now in a very thriving State. The Average Distance of this Forest to the nearest Wharf (which is is

about Eleven Miles.

As I think it my Duty to endeavour to give every Information on this Subject in my Power, I shall be ready to answer any Questions you may be pleased to ask me.

And am,

Gentlemen,

with milch Respect, your most humble Servant,

Bedbridge, 17th of January 1790.

Gentlemen,

In Obedienee-to your Directions of the 1 ith Instant, I have considered of what Mr. Briant has proposed, relative to the selling of the Timber in Aliceholt Forest.

As most of the Timber in that Forest is at full Maturity, and will not improve by standing, but on the contrary get worse, and but a small Part of it fit for the Navy, nor ever will be; and considering the constant and many Depredations that are committed, and the very small Income it now brings to the Crown, owing to the extreme bad Mode of Management;

I am clearly of Opinion, that if all the Timber in this Forest was divided as near as could be into Ten Parts, and One of those Parts sold to the Merchants Yearly, and so on till the Whole was cleared away, leaving only a few Trees standing to spread Seed, at the same Time taking Care to make Inclosures for raising more in its Stead, that it would be the most advantageous Way of disposing of it, for the Benefit of the Public, and what, I believe, every Individual would do, was it his own Property.

That Part of the Timber which is fit for the Navy would most likely be sold again to the Navy Board, and at a Price on the Whole not much above w’hat is now given for it. — If not, the India Company would have it, who are now become Competitors with Government for large 'limber, and whose Market will be supplied, so long as there is any to be got in the Kingdom on private Estates, and Things remain on the Footing as at present.

Should the Mode of selling the Timber in this Forest to the Merchants, as proposed, be approved of, I would humbly recommend that after fixing on die Part where the first Fall is intended to be made, that the Trees should be numbered progressively till the Number was marked as intended to be felled for the first Part; and an Account taken, and put in different Classes, according to the Sizes and Quality of the Trees, with the estimated Content of each Tree, put against the Numbers, and the Value Load set against each Class; by this the Value of the whole Lot would be obtained, and the Numbers would be a Check against Abuses; but before felled each Tree should be marked on the Claw with the broad Arrow Hammer. The Lot to be put up to Auction to be sold standing; and should not the Value of it be offered, it may be afterwards sold privately, or left standing till the Value was offered, which I presume would soon be.

In all Cases were Goods are intended to be sold by Auction, or privately, the real Value of them should be first obtained, in order to guard against any Combinations in the Bidders.

I am,

Gentlemen,

with much Respect, your most humble Servant,

Thot Nichols.

That the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, of the 25th of 1774, relative to Bills of Drainage, had not been complied with, the Necessity of applying to Parliament, occasioned by the breaking and destroying of the Banks and other Works by the Sea, having happened late in the Month of October last, but that the Notices required by the said Standing Orders were given in the Months of November and December last; and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the same, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as follorweth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act, passed in the Twenty-eighth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for dividing, inclosing, embanking, draining, and preserving the said Marsh, and for other Purposes, was read, whereby it appeared that the Commissioners appointed for carrying the said Act into Execution were authorized to raise Money for defraying the Expences of the said Embankment and Drainage, by certain Rates or Dues to be collected for the Tonnage and Wharfage of Goods, Wares, and Commodities, conveyed upon the Cuts or Canals to be made for draining and preserving the said Marsh, and also by a Pound Rate or Assessment upon the Owners and Proprietors of the said Marsh: Then,

Thomas Williams, Esquire, being examined, said,

That the said Commissioners have expended the Sum of 6,000l. or thereabouts, in erecting a Bank, and other Works to prevent the said Lands being Overflowed by the Sea, but the same were washed down and destroyed by the High Tides, accompanied by uncommon High Winds, in October last — That the making a Bank of sufficient Height and Strength against the Sea, and such other Banks, Drains, and Works, as shall be necessary for the Preservation of the said Marsh, will be attended with a much greater Expence than was apprehended at the Time of passing the said Act, and that the Money authorized to be raised thereby will not be sufficient to defray such Expence — And the Witness added, That a considerable Quantity of the inclosed Lands and Grounds adjoining the said Marsh will be greatly improved by the effectual Embankment and Drainage of the said Marsh, and therefore it is thought reasonable that the Owners and Proprietors of such inclosed Lands and Grounds should contribute towards the Expence thereof.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for more effectually embanking the Marsh called MaUdraeth and Corsddaugau, in the County of and drain-

ing and preserving the same, and the inclosed low Lands

k

contiguous thereto: And that Mr. B*ykf and Mr. Gould do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Bottom* from London and every Part of the Coasts of Great Britain, and from most Foreign Port*; and that a Set of Vessels, from 100 to 140 Tons Burthen each, have been purposely built,' and have beeo for several Years past, and are now constantly employed in the Trade between London and York, and several other Vessels of as large Burthen are constantly employed in conveying Oak Timber from the said City of York, and other Places above Selby, to the City of London, to several of His Majesty’s Dock Yards, and to many other Ports and Places on the Sea Coasts of this Kingdom, and the said City of York, and a great Extent of Country for many Miles above the said City, are supplied with Coals, and chiefly with Lime, and all Sorts of Goods brought up the said River; and that the Petitioners apprehend the Navigation of the said River Ouse, and the Trade of the City of York, and all Places above Selby, will be materially injured by the Erection of any Bridge across the said River there, the Situation for which is very improper, the Course of the said River, above and near the said Town of Selby, being very crooked, the Current of Water rapid, and the Tide rising a considerable Heighth; and that several Vessels can now pass and re-pass, there at the same Time, whereas, if a Bridge is erected with One, or even Two Apertures, the Navigation will be greatly impeded, and rendered extremely dangerous for all Vessels navigating above Selby, which may frequently oblige the Traders of the City of York to change Bottoms, and have theiF Goods lightered up lor the Space of about Twenty-five Miles, the Distance between the City of York and Selby, by Water; that the Number of Vessels, constantly lost by the Erection of Bridges across Rivers-where the Tide runs so high and rapidly as at Selby, is considerable, and the Danger and Delay great, and in case of any Damage to their Goods the Traders of York would have great Difficulty to ascertain, with Precision, from whom to recover a Compensation for such Damage, which would not be the Case if their Goods were conveyed in One Bottom only, as at present; and that, at a General Meeting of Gentlemen, Land Owners, Merchants, Owners of Vessels, Tradesmen, Manufacturers, and others, held at Selby, in January >787, when an Application was intended to be made to Parliament for Power to build a Bridge over the River Ouse at Langrich, about Five Miles below Selby, it was resolved unanimously, “ That it was the Opinion of “ that Meeting, that such Bridge would not only bo “ attended with the greatest Danger and Delay to the “ Navigation of the said River, but would also be very “ detrimental to the Trade of all other Navigations,

“ frilling into, or connected therewith, and consequently to the Conveyance of Goods to and' from “ London, Hull, and other Places, belonging to Merchants, Tradesmen, Manufacturers, and ethers, of the many great Trading Towns in the Counties of “ York, Lancaster, and Westmoreland? and it was also resolved unanimously, “ That it was the Opinion of “ that Meeting, that the most effectual Measures “ should be adopted for opposing such intended “ Bridge;” and that most of the Persons, who now solicit Authority to build a Bridge at Selby, promoted and entered into the said Resolutions, but notwithstanding the Objections therein stated, which apply with equal, if not greater, Force to the Erection of a Bridge at Selby, the same Persona appear now to be desirous of erecting a Bridge at that Place, because the Inconvenience wiu be thereby removed' from- them, and thrown upon the Petitioners, with a View, no Doubt, to fix- the Trade at Selby below the said1 Bridge; although, jf any Bridge ought to be erected across the said River, it would' be likely to be of more Advantage to the Public at Langrich, than at Selby: And therefore praying; That they may- be beard1, by themselves or their Counsel1, against the said Bill, and that the

w

same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the principal Inhabitants, Grocers, and Petition from Shopkeepers, in the Borough of Thirslc, was also pre- Thirsk seated to the House, and read; Likewise taking Notice of the said Bill: And praying, That the same may not pass into a Law.

Petition from Hull re-

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are thereto subscribed, being the Principal Owners of Confiscation Ships and Vessels belonging to the Port of Kingston of Ship*. upon Hull, on Behalf of themselves, and all others concerned in Ships and Vessels employed in the Foreign Mercantile Trade from and to the said Port, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That most of the Acts, which have of late passed for the Suppression of Smuggling, expose the Ships of the fair and open Mercantile Trader to Forfeiture on there being found therein any inconsiderable Quantities of Foreign Spirituous Liquors, Tea, Coffee, or other Goods, above the Quantity allowed by Law, notwithstanding such Goods are clandestinely brought on Board by the Seamen belonging to such Ships, contrary to the express Directions of the Owners and Masters thereof, and though there has not been in any Degree a Want of due Care and Diligence in such Owners or Masters to prevent every illicit Practice; and, by an Act of the Twenty-sixth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, Ships of every Description, and be their Burthen or Value ever so great,

wherein is imported any Foreign Spirituous Liquors (British Plantation Ruin and Arrack excepted) in any Cask containing less than One hundred Gallons, except Two Gallons for each Seaman, with all their Stores and Furniture, are declared to be forfeited; and that neither the Act of the Twenty-first Year of the Reign of His present Majesty for securing the Property of the Owners in such Ships or Vessels as are liable to Forfeiture for importing Spirits, or other Goods, by the Misconduct of the Masters, Mates, and Seamen, the Second Section of the Act of the Twenty-fourth Year of His present Majesty, admitting Evidence to be given in Extenuation of the Charge of Smuggling, nor the Power of Mitigation, said to be entrusted with the Commissioners of the Customs and Excise, afford either effectual Security, or adequate Indemnity, to the unoffending Ship Owner, for though the Ships of the fair Trader are not in every Instance prosecuted to Condemnation, they are seized for having the most trivial Quantities of Contraband Goods on Board, and are frequently for a long Time withheld from the innocent Owners, who, beside losing the Use of their valuable Property, and, as it often happens, their only Means of Support, are put to very heavy and disproportioned Fines, Fees, and Impositions, and suffer other Loss, Expence, and Trouble, in obtaining the Release of such Ships, and are left without being able to obtain any Remedy over against the Persons guilty, Owners not daring, from the Hazard such a Prosecution would involve them in, to proceed for the Recovery of the Penalty imposed on the Master, Mate, and Seamen, by the former of the last-mentioned Acts; and that the Petitioners, fully sensible of the Necessity of preventing Smuggling, and of enforcing the Laws for raising Revenues for the Exigencies of the State, are willing not only to suffer the utmost Rigour of those Laws in case of they themselves directly or indirectly conniving at any illicit Trade, but are ready, even though innocent of any Offence, where the Offender cannot be immediately discovered, to be answerable for such a Forfeiture as may be proportioned to the Quantity of the Goods seized, they having Authority to reimburse themselves, as far as may be, out of the Wages due from the Owners to the Persons most likely to be guilty. — As such, and understanding it has been ever held incompatible with the Spirit of the British Constitution and Laws to punish one Person, and that too in the most summary Way, for the Offence of another, who, as in the present Instance, it is not in his Power effectually to prevent offending, the Petitioners cannot but feel themselves as labouring under more cruel Oppressions and Hardships than any other Branch of Trade whatever, and' they conceive the Severity of the Laws alluded to must soon have the roost prejudicial Effect: on the Trade and Commerce of this Country: And therefore praying, That the House will take the aforesaid Laws, and the Hardships they impose upon the Petitioners, into Consideration, and that Leave may be given to bring in a Bill to repeal so much or such Clauses of the before mentioned Acts, of Parliament as expose Ships employed in an open and fair Mercantile Trade to Confiscation, or to grant the Petitioners such other Relief as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for dividing and inclosing the same, and for allotting specific Parts and Shares thereof to the Petitioners, and the other Persons interested therein, in Proportion to their several Rights and Interests of and in the said Part of the said Common, or Waste Land, in such Manner, and with such Restrictions, as to the House shall seem meet and right.

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names Petition (mm are thereunto Subscribed, Owners of Lands in, and Barlby, Inhabitants of, the several Towns of Barlby, Osgodby,

Lund, Cliff, North Dttffield, South Duffidd, and Riccall,

near Selby, in the County of York, wa6 presented to the House, and read j Taking Notice of the Bill for building a Bridge at or near the Ferry over the River Ouse, from Selby, in the West Riding of the County of York, to the opposite Shore, in the Parish of Hemingborough, in the East Riding of the said County of York; and Setting forth, That the Inhabitants of the several Places above-mentioned are entitled to pass and re-pass over the Ferry at or near Selby for small Payments or Acknowledgments Yearly, and such Ferry is safe and commodious, and very sufficient to answer all the Purposes of Communication in that Part of the Country; and that, if i Bridge should be S " erected

erected over the RiVer Ouse there, find the Petitioners shade subject to 'the Payment of Toll every Day on tohdch they may have Occasion to pass over the same, it will affect and materially injure their Rights, and be an unnecessary and expensive Burthen upon them, and they are informed it is also proposed to subject them to other Restraints in the Use of the said River, contiguous to their respective Estates; and that no Communication towards HuU or any principal Town in the East Riding of Yorkshire, in any respect likely to be of general Use, or public Utility, can be effected by any such Bridge, because there are no direct Roads from Selby to those Places, nor any Materials to be procured to make Roads, or repair those already made, except at a great Distance and very considerable Expence, and it would also be requisite to build another Bridge over the River Derwent, in the Tideway of that River, and, if it were the Intention of the Promoters of a Bridge at Selby to procure any such proposed Advantage to the Public, the Petitioners apprehend it is incumbent upon them to bring forward a Plan for effecting every Thing requisite to attain that End at the same Time, in order that the whole Extent of the supposed Benefit on the one Hand, and the inevitable Expence and Mischief on the other, may be compared and considered together: And. therefore praying, That the said Ferry may remain in its present State, that the Right of the Petitioners to pass over the same may not be varied or affected, that the said Bill may not pass into a Law, or that they may have such other Relief in the Premises, as to the House shall seem meet.

Petition A Petition of several Persons whose Names are

against Selby thereunto subscribed, on Behalf of themselves and Bridge Bill. others, Owners and Proprietors of Lands and Tenements adjoining on, or lying contiguous to, each Side of the River Ouse, between the Town of Selby, in the County of York, and the City of York, was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth, That the Petitioners are Owners and Proprietors of large Tracts of Land, adjoining upon, or near to, the Banks on each Side of the said River, between the Town of Selby and the said City of York, which, in the Winter Season, are constantly much damaged by being overflowed with Water from the said River, and the Banks against the same, which are composed of Earth only, and in many Places very high, and supported at a great annual Expence, are often injured and broken down by the Overflowing of the said River; and that the Petitioners conceive that, if such Bridge be erected, it will constantly be the Cause of greatly interrupting the free Course of the Current of Water in the said River, and more particularly on the breaking up of Frosts, when there are large Sheets of Ice, whereby the Embankments on such River will be materially injured, and much more liable to be overflowed, and in greater Danger of being broken down than at present, to the great Injury and Prejudice of the respective Estates, of the Petitioners and others, by Reason of such Estates (which contain many thousand Acres of cultivated Land) being Overflowed, and by the enormous Expence that the Petitioners and others would unavoidably be put to in the necessary Repairs of the said Banks: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves Of their Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such Relief in the Premises as to the Hbuse shall seem meet.

Petition from A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are Matters of thereunto Subscribed, Owners or Masters of Ships Ship* apart and Vessels used and employed on the Navigation of 1 ‘ the River Ouse, in the County of York, was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking. Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth, That the Naviga-Vot. 45.

tion of the said River hath been improved, at a considerable Expence, by the Trustees thereof, and is rendered Safe and Commodious, and sufficient to admit Vessels of 120 Tons, and upwards, to the City of York, and such Vessels may be safely navigated to all Parti of the Kingdom, and to Foreign Ports; and that the said Navigation hath been for Time immemorial, and now is, open and free to all Persons, and the Tonnage Dues are extremely low, and the City of York, and the Towns of Tadcaster, Wetherby,

Knaresborough, Ripon, Masham, Richmond, Bedale,

Thirsk, Easingwould, Helmsley, Blackmoor, Kirby-moorside, and a very large Extent of the adjacent Country (which is well cultivated and populous) are supplied with Goods and Merchandize by Means of the said Navigation, and the City of York, and its extensive Neighbourhood, and many other Places, are also thereby wholly supplied with Coals, Lime, and many other Articles, from the West Riding of Yorkshire; and that the Quantity of Lime and Coals, constantly carried up the said Navigation, to be used in and near the above Places, is very considerable, and the Value of the Timber, Lead, Butter, Bacon, and other Articles taken in Return, amounts to a great Sum Annually; and that many of the Petitioners have expended considerable Sums, and others their whole Property, in purchasing Vessels and fitting up the same, to navigate on the said River, and the Maintenance of themselves and Families greatly depends upon the Safety and Success of their Employment therein; and the Petitioners being fully convinced that such Bridge will obstruct and materially prejudice the Navigation of the said River, are alarmed for the Consequences, as it will certainly occasion great Delay, and be very dangerous, to all Vessels passing the said Bridge, particularly those which are deeply loaded, and not in the best Condition, many of which are employed in the Coal Trade, and, should any of them run against the Bridge, which must sometimes unavoidably happen, the Petitioners Vessels, and their Cargoes, will be in the utmost Danger of being totally lost, and by any such Loss the Navigation will be liable to be entirely obstructed for a considerable Time, because the Bridge will confine the Passage of Vessels to one Aperture only, and it is found, by fatal Experience, that Numbers of Vessels are constantly lost wherever Bridges have been erected across Rivers in the Tideways; besides, the Petitioners are informed, it is intended to subject them to expensive Suits, by an opulent Body of Proprietors, for Damages done to the Bridge by the Carelessness or Negligence of their Servants, when the Fact may be so doubtful as not to be determined but by the Verdict of a Jury, and therefore the Petitioners must either submit in the First Instance, or risque the Expence of a Trial; and that, besides the Hazard and Mischief above specified, the River at Selby is crooked and narrow, the Banks dangerous, the Anchorage bad, and the Tide rises high, and runs rapidly, all which render it difficult to'bring Vessels up, either by running them aground, anchoring, or getting Ropes on Shore, and in Spring Tides, particularly, every Vessel ought to bring up and approach the Bridge Stem foremost, to pass with the least Degree of Safety: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the Merchants, Traders, Shopkeepers, Petition from and other Inhabitants of the Town of Tadcaster, as Tad.ca®t£r,lk well within the West Riding of the County of York, 5fr“d"ge jjhi/ as within the County of the City of York, was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth. That the Town of Tadcaster is situate on the Banks of the River

fVharfe,

JVharfe, which communicates with the River Ouse, about Six Miles above Selby, and is Navigable, from its Junction with the River Ouse, to the Town of Tadcasteraforesaid; and that the Petitioners have their Goods Water-borne on the said Rivers to a very

f eat Amount, and derive great Benefit by their rade on such Rivers, and are greatly alarmed at the inevitable Delay and Danger the Navigation of the River Ouse must receive from so great an Impediment as the Erection of a Bridge in the Tideway thereof at Selby, where the Foreshores and Anchorage are bad, and at the Injury they must consequently suffer in their Trade: And therefore praying, That the said Bill may not pass into a Law, but that the Navigation of the said River Ouse may be preserved in its present State, free and uninterrupted, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief as to the House shall seem meet

Petition A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are

against Selby thereunto subscribed, Trustees for improving the Na- Bridge Bill, vigation of the River Ouse, an the County of York, on Behalf of themselves and the other Trustees of the said Navigation, was also presented to the House, and read; likewise taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth, That by virtue of Two Acts, passed in the Thirteenth Year of King George the First, and the Fifth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, the said Trustees were authorized to make the said River Ouse more Navigable for Ships and other Vessels, and to remove all Gravel Beds, and other Impediments whatsoever, which may hinder the Navigation, either in sailing, or hauling Ships or Vessels upon the said River, and are entitled to receive divers Tolls for Goods and Merchandize conveyed upon the said River above a Place called Mouth; and that the said Navigation hath been improved at a very considerable Expence, and particularly by the Erection of a very expensive Lock and Dam, at the Distance of about Five Miles by Water from the said City, in order to raise the Water in that Part of the River above the said Lock and Dam, and the Tide flows up to the said Dam, so that Vessels of considerable Burthen can safely navigate from the Sea to the said City; apd that many Parts of the said River, below the said Lock and Dam, are so shallow, that any Interruption to the free Course of the Tide would materially prejudice the said Navigation, and occasion great Expence in deepening the same; and that about 1,900 Vessels pass through the said Lock to York Annually, and return through the same, and the Petitioners apprehend the Erection of any Bridge at or near Selby would not only materially interrupt and stop the free Course of the Tide, but would also be very dangerous and occasion great Delay to all Ships and Vessels having Occasion to pass through the same, and would materially affect the Trade upon the said River above Selby, and greatly decrease the Tolls,

- which the Petitioners are authorized to take, as Trustees of the said Navigation: And therefore praying, That the Rights and Interests of the Petitioners may be preserved, that they may be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

of the Reign of His present Majesty, the Petitioners were authorized to make the River Ouse, from below Widdington Ings aforesaid, to the Junction of the River Swale and Ure, more navigable, and to remove all Gravel Beds, and other Impediments whatsoever, which may hinder the said Navigation, either in Sailing, Haling, or Towing of Keels or Vessels upon the said River, and are entitled to receive divers Tolls for Goods and Merchandize conveyed upon the said River from below JViddington Ings, and the said Navigation hath been greatly improved, particularly by the Erection of a Lock and Dam near Linton, in the Coupty of York, and in such Improvements very large Sums of Money have been expended; and that about 900 Vessels pass through the said Lock from York Annually, and return through the same, and the Petitioners apprehend the Erection of any Bridge at or near Selby would not only materially interrupt the free

Passage of the said River, but would also occasion great Delay and imminent Danger to all Vessels navigating upon the River above Selby, and would materially affect the Trade upon that Part of the said River which is under the Management and Direction of the Petitioners, and greatly decrease the Tolls which they are authorized to take by the said Act: And therefore praying, That the Rights and Interests of the Petitioners may be preserved, that they may be heard, by themselves or their Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law, or that the Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the said Bill be read a Second Time; and such of the Petitioners as desire to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, are to be then heard by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petitions, if they think fit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petitions.

Mr. Lygon reported from the Committee, to whom Birmingham the Petition of the several Noblemen, and the humble and Wor* Petition of the several Gentlemen, Clergy, Free-holders, and Manufacturers, of the County and City reported, of Worcester, and of several other Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was referred; That the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, relative to Navigation Bills, had been complied with; and that the Committee had examined the Matter of the said Petition, and had directed him to report the same, as it appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Mr.

John Snape,an Engineer and Surveyor, being exa-

mined, said, That he hath taken Levels and Surveys, whereby it appears, That a Navigable Cut or Canal for Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, may be made

from

from or near the Town of Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to join and communicate with the River Severn at or near a Place called Diglis, in or near the City of Worcester; and that by Means of such Cut or Canal, a better and more certain Communication will be opened for the Conveyance of Goods and Merchandize between the Ports of and Hull, and

also between the Town of Birmingham, the large Manufactories in the Neighbourhood thereof, and the Cities of Worcester, Gloucester, and Bristol, and the several other intermediate Parts — That the several Counties of Worcester, Gloucester, and Hereford, and other Counties and Places, will be supplied with Coals from the large and extensive Coal Mines lying upon or near the Line of the said intended Canal, at an easier Expence, and in a more constant and regular Manner, than at present, and many other Benefits will result to the Public therefrom.

And being asked, Whether there is any Water Carriage on the whole Line of this Canal, between Birmingham and Worcester? he said, There is not.

And being asked, Whether he thinks there will be a better Corntnunication by Means of this Canal ? he said, There will; and that it will be a nearer Way than the other Water Carriage between Birmingham and Worcester, whereby Worcester will be better supplied with Coals — That there are no Coal Mines on the intended Line of this Canal, or nearer than Oldbury, at which Place there are now some Pits opening.

And being asked, What Part of this Canal he calls the Summit, and what the Extent of the Summit ? he replied. The Part between Tardebigg, being in Length about Sixteen Miles and an Hair — That this Canal does not communicate with the Birmingham Canal — That there will be Four Pounds, or Summits, on this Canal; the Locks are to be about Sixty-six Feet by Sixteen in the Chamber, and the Falls Six Feet — That the Canal is to be supplied with Water from various Springs which are found in the Bed of the Canal in digging; and Steam Engines are to be erected to raise more Water, so as to form a general Supply.

And being asked. How the Summit Level is to be supplied ? he answered. By such Springs as are found in it, and by Steam Engines, which have Power enough to supply Ten such Canals as the one intended.

And being asked, Whether he was ever concerned in the Execution of any Canals ? he replied. Not in the executive Parts; but that Canals have been executed from his Plans.

And being asked, Whether he has not good Reason to believe that the proposed Canal will, from all Appearances, according to his Judgment, be as well furnished in a natural Way with an ample Supply of Water, as those Canals which have been executed under his Plans ? he said, It will — That he alluded to the Birmingham, and Birmingham and Canals,

as having been executed on the Plan of the intended Canal.

And being asked. Whether those Canals depended entirely upon Water which was to be discovered in digging of the Canal? he said, No.

And being asked, Whether it is meant to raise Water by Engines to supply the Summit of the intended Canal from the River Severn ? he answered, What is not found in digging is to be supplied by Engines from that River; the Distance of this Summit from the River Severn is Fifteen Miles, and the Fall from the Summit is 448 Feet — That the Birmingham Canal is amply supplied with Water by Engines; the Locks of the said Canal are about 74 Feet long, and Eight Feet wide.

And being asked. What other Supplies the Birmingham Canal has besides the Water raised by Engines ? he said, The Summit of that Canal was heretofore Vox- 4£.

about One thousand Yards long, but was found inadequate to the great Trade carried on the Canal; and, in order to obviate that, they are now cutting down the Summit Eighteen Feet deeper, which will lengthen the Summit about Fifteen Miles — That the Birmingham Canal is at present in Part supplied by Reservoirs, but the greater Quantity of Water is supplied by Steam Engines; one Reservoir is about Two Miles, and the other not more than Half a Mile from the Canal.

And being asked, Whether, in dry Seasons, even with these Reservoirs, there is not a great Want of Water? he replied, No; it was just the Reverse — That before Steam Engines were introduced, there was a great Want of Water, which was a Reason for building of Steam Engines, which are supplied with Water from Old Coal Pit Hollows, and by Steam Engines from the Working Pits.

And being asked, Whether there can be any such Supplies from Steam Engines upon the Course of the intended Canal? he said. There are no Coal Mines upon the Canal.

And being asked, Whether the Birmingham Canal would not be amply supplied with Water at all Seasons, by Means of the Steam Engines only? he answered, Yes, very abundantly; and there would be a great deal of Water to spare — That he does not know whether it is intended to take any Water from the Birmingham Canal to supply the intended Canal — That Part of the present Waste Water from the Birmingham Canal runs into the Fazeley Canal, and a Part into the River Rea.

And being asked, Whether, notwithstanding the Fall of the Locks, and the Breadth of the intended Canal, and the Distance from the Summit to the vern, he does not think that the said Canal may be abundantly supplied with Water with Steam Engines, in the same Manner as the Birmingham Canal is from the River Severn ? he replied, It may.

And being asked, Whether the Upper Pound of the intended Canal is on a Level with the Birmingham Canal? he said, It is on a Level with that Part of the Old Canal next to the Town of Birmingham, but not so high as the long Summit by Eighteen Feet.

And being asked. Whether the Water raised by the Steam Engines upon the Birmingham Canal would not supply this Canal, if wanted ? he said, He apprehended it would.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Severn,

near to the City of Worcester: And that Mr. Lygon, Mr. Foley, Mr. Samuel Smith, Mr. Wigley, Sir Robert Lawley, and Sir George Augustus William Shuckburgh, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

The Lord Hinchingbrook reported from the Committee, to whom the Petition of several of the Trustees for putting in Execution an Act of Parliament, made in the Tenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repairing and amending the Road from Biggleswade, in the County of Bedford, through Bugden and Alconbury, to the Top of HiU, and from

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, the said Act was read: And,

Mr. Robert Godby (Treasurer for the said Roads) being examined, said, That the Trustees have pro* ceeded in the Execution of the said Act, for which Purpose a considerable Sum of Money has been borrowed upon the Credit of the Tolls, which now remains due, and cannot be paid off, nor the Roads effectually repaired, unless the Term of the said Act be enlarged, and some Amendments made thereto; and that it will also be necessary that a small Increase should be made in some of the Tolls authorized to be collected thereby: Then,

Mr. John Smith (a Surveyor) being examined, 6aid, That the Road leading out of the present Turnpike Road, in the Parish of Eaton Socon, in the County of Bedford, and through Eaton Ford to another Part of the said Turnpike Road, near Neat's Bridge (being about Half a Mile in Length) is sometimes overflowed, and rendered inconvenient for Travellers; and that it would be of great Benefit to Persons making Use of the same, if the said Piece of Road was properly raised and amended: And,

Mr. Godby being further examined, said, That no additional Toll is intended to be taken in, consequence of repairing the said Piece of Road, nor any Money borrowed.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill to continue the Term, and alter and enlarge the Powers, of an Act of the Tenth Year of His present Majesty, for repairing the Road from Biggleswade, in the County of Bedford, through Bugden and Alconbury, to the Top of Alconbury Hill, and from Bugden to Huntingdon, and from Cross Hall to Great Stoughton Common, in the County of Huntingdon, and also the Road leading out of the aforesaid Road, at or near the Ferry House in the Parish of Tempsford, to and through Little Bar-ford, Eynesbury, and Saint s, to the Turnpike Road at the End of Cross Hall Lane: And that the Lord Hinckingbrook and the Earl Ludlow do prepare, and bring in, the same.

A Petition of several of the Trustees for putting in Execution an Act of Parliament, made in the Tenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repairing and widening the Road from Tunstall, in the County of Stafford, to Bosley, in the County of Chester, and from Great Chell to Shelton, in the said County of Stafford, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by the said Act, the said Roads are made Two separate Districts, with separate Trustees for the Care of each District, and all the Tolls collected are directed to be applied towards repairing the Road within the District in which they are collected, and not otherwise; and that the Trustees have borrowed several Sums of Money upon the Credit of the Tolls arising within their respective Districts, which still remain due; and that the Term of the said Act is near expiring, and, unless the same is further continued, the Money borrowed cannot be repaid, and the Roads kept in good Repair: And therefore praying. That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for continuing the said Act for such further Term as the House shall think proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do examine the Matter thereof; and report the same, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Gilbert, the Earl Gower, &c: And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at

Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker's Chamber; and have Power to send for Persons, Papers, and Records.

That, by the said Act, the said Roads are made Two separate Districts, with separate Trustees for the Care of each District, and all Tolls collected are directed to be applied towards repairing the Road within the District in which they are collected, and not otherwise; and that the Trustees have borrowed several Sums of Money upon the Credit of the Tolls arising within their respective Districts, which still remains due; and that the said Act is near expiring, and, unless the same is further continued, the Money borrowed cannot be repaid, and the Roads kept in good Repair; and that by the said Act the Trustees of the said Second District have Powers only to repair and widen the Road to Newcastle under Line, but it would add much to the Safety and Convenience of the Public, if the Powers of the said Act were extended to a Place called The Church Lane-head, in the Town of Newcastle under Line aforesaid, being in Length, from the Terminal tion of the present Turnpike Road there, about Three hundred Yards, and, in case Powers were also granted to take down a Hece of Out-building, the Estate,

A Petition

Leeds and Liverpool Navigation Petition.

213

A Petition of the Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation from Leeds to Liverpool, was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, That an Act passed in the Tenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for making and maintaining a Navigable Cut or Canal from Leeds Bridge, in the County of York, to The North Lady’s Walk, in Liverpool, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, and from thence to the River Mersey; whereby the Petitioners were united into a Company, and authorized to make and complete a Cut or Canal, Navigable for Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, from or near Leeds Bridge, in the Town of Leeds, through the several Townships, Parishes, and Hamlets, in the said Act particularly mentioned, to or near a Place, called The North Lady’s Walk, in Liverpool, and from thence to communicate with the River Mersey; and, to the End the Petitioners might be enabled to carry on so useful an Undertaking, they were thereby empowered to raise among themselves a competent Sum of Money, not exceeding 260,000l. in the Whole, unless the said Sum should be found insufficient for the Purposes aforesaid, when they were empowered to raise any further Sum, not exceeding 60,000 /.; and that the Petitioners have raised among themselves the Sum of 300,000l., and upwards, which hath been expended in making and completing such Part of the said Cut or Canal as lies between the said Leeds Bridge and a certain other Bridge called Holm Bridge, in the said County of York, and in making and completing such Part of the said Cut or Canal as lies between the said Port of Liverpool and the Township of Parbold,in the said County of Lancaster, and in the purchasing and improving the Navigable River Douglas, alias Asland, in the said County of Lancaster, which is now consolidated and incorporated with the said Canal Navigation, by virtue of an Act passed in the Twenty-third Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, and in other Purposes directed by the said Acts; and that about Fifty-six Miles of the said intended Canal remain uncut, by Reason whereof all the interior Parts of the said Counties in particular, and the Public in general, are deprived of the Advantages which would be obtained by finishing the said Canal, and opening a short, easy, and commodious Communication between the said Ports of Hull and Liverpool, and the beneficial Intentions of the said Acts are thereby greatly prevented; and that the Petitioners are desirous of completing and finishing the said Cut or Canal with all Expedition, and for that Purpose have caused the Country, lying intermediate and between the said completed Parts thereof, to be re-surveyed, whereby it appears, that great Difficulties might be avoided, or very much diminished, and much Expence saved, by varying a Part of the said original intended Line of the said Cut or Canal, and by making the same Navigable for Boats, Barges, and other Vessels, from or near a Place called Reediford, in the Township of Great Marsden, in the said County of Lancaster, through Great Marsden, Little Marsden, Pendle Forest, Ightenhill Park, otherwise

Gawthorp, Padiham, Hapton, Altham, Clayton, and Harwood,otherwise Great Harwood, in the said County of Lancaster, to and through a Place called Nab Wood, in Great Harwood aforesaid; and that, in order to complete and finish the said intermediate Parts of the said intended Cut or Canal, it will be necessary to borrow a considerable Sum of Money upon the Credit of the said incorporated Navigations: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill to enable the Petitioners to borrow Money for making and completing the said Cut or Canal, and to make such Variations therein, as aforesaid, as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of a Committee: And that they do exa-

mine, the Matter thereof; and Report the same, as it shall appear to them, to the House:

And it is referred to Mr. Thomas Stanley, Mr.

Duncombe, &c.: And they are to meet Tomorrow Morning, at Nine of the Clock, in the Speaker’s Chamber; and have Power to send for Persons, Papers, and Records.

A Petition of the Inhabitants of the Town and Manchester Neighbourhood of Manchester, whose Names are there-under signed, was presented to the House, and read; ^acco Act. Setting forth, That the Petitioners cannot but observe, with deep Concern, the gradual Progress of the Excise Laws amongst the Manufactures of Great Britain, and the late alarming Step towards the general Establishment of that destructive System of Taxation, by an Excise upon the Manufacture of Tobacco and that the Petitioners are convinced, from Experience, that; although the Excise Laws may cause a temporary Increase of Revenue, their ultimate and certain Tendency is to diminish the Trade and Manufactures of the Country, and thereby to strike at the Root of the Prosperity of this Nation, and defeat the very End for which they are declared to be introduced; and that the whole System of Excise is arbitrary itr its Principle, and oppressive in its Execution, that it subjects the Manufacturer to Delays and Restrictions vexatious and unnecessary, invades the Security of private Dwellings, is peculiarly fitted to become the secret Instrument of iniquitous Oppression, or unjust Preference to particular Persons, and occasions the arbitrary Inflictions of Fines and Forfeitures in many Cases which no Foresight can prevent; and that the Trial by Jury is the unalienable Right of every English-, man in all Cases where his Person or Property is to be decided on, a Right of which every Subject of this Realm is unjustly deprived, who is liable to the Operation of the Excise Laws; and that the Petitioners are fully sensible of the Necessity of a Revenue adequate to the Exigencies of the State, and will chearfully submit to every Constitutional Claim for their Share of the Common Burthen, but they cannot, on any Consideration whatever, silently acquiesce in the Annihilation of their dearest Rights and Privileges, to which, as Englishmen, they are justly entitled:

And therefore praying, That the Act of the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act for repealing the “ Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting “ new Duties in lieu thereof,” may be repealed, and that the Excise Laws may not be further extended, to the Destruction of the Rights and Privileges of Individuals, and to the Injury of the Commerce and Prosperity of this Country.

A Petition of the Persons whose Names are there- Bristol Peti-unto subscribed, Manufacturers of Tobacco and Snuff don against in the City of Bristol, in Behalf of themselves and D#Act-others, was also presented to the House, and read;

Setting forth, That, by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act for repealing the “ Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting “ new Duties in lieu thereof,” the Petitioners are subjected to the Laws of Excise 5 and that, while the said Act was pending in the House, Evidence was given at the Bar, to prove that the System of Excise was inapplicable to those Manufactures, that given Rules could not be made to apply without Injury to the Trade, and Danger to the Revenue, on account of the Complexity and Variety of the Operations, the Uncertainty of the Produce of such Operations, and withal the exposing the Mysteries of every Individual Manufacturer of Snuff to the probable Knowledge' of the Smugglers; and that Experience under the Operation of the said Act hath proved the Truth of the Evidence, the Act (though hitherto executed with Lenity) is injurious to the Trade, dangerous

3 I to

to the Revenue, and in many Cases impracticable, and the Petitioners are fully persuaded that no Modification of the said Act will either ultimately benefit the Revenue, or relieve the fair Trader from the Competition of the Smuggler: And therefore praying, That the said Act may be repealed.

Petition ' A Petition of the Manufacturers of, and Dealers in, wainet the Tobacco and Snuff, in the City of in Be-

obacco Act jjajf of themselves, and others, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act “ for repealing the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, ,c and for granting new Duties in lieu thereof,” the Petitioners are subjected to the Laws of Excise, and by the said Act the Mysteries of the Trade, of inestimable Value, purchased or received in Patrimony, and hitherto considered as exclusive Property, are exposed — That, by exposing Mysteries, it will enable the Smuggler to supplant the fair Trader in those Articles which are mysterious, and thereby very materially injure, rather than improve, the present Revenues, as in those Articles alone the fair Trader can maintain a Competition with the Smuggler — That it imposes Rules and Regulations on the Manufacturer, which, in some Cases, are impracticable, and in many cannot be conformed to, without rendering the Goods unfit for his Customer, and in consequence subjects him to heavy Forfeitures and Penalties — That it prevents the Manufacturer supplying his Customers for Ten Days or a Fortnight, or sometimes longer, though all the Time in the Possession of the Goods which are wanted, the Manufacturer being under the Necessity of finishing the Manufacture of the whole Parcel before he can make Use of any Part of it — That it debars Manufacturers not in Ports of Importation, from disposing of such Parts of their Tobacco as they cannot vend amongst their own Customers, to the Manufacturers in the Ports of Importation, who are perhaps the only Persons they can sell them to without sustaining a considerable Loss — That it obliges many Manufacturers to alter their Mode of Manufacture, to the great additional Expence and Inconvenience of the Manufacturers, as well as imminent Danger of the Loss of their Customers — That it prohibits the Removal, either with or without Permit, of some Articles in less Quantities than 200 Pounds Weight, which, Nine Times out of Ten, are more than can be sent or sold — That, when executed in the most lenient Manner, it occasions Delays and Interruptions quite inconvenient with the Nature of the Trade, and which, as such, must in the End drive the Manufacture of the Article out of the Country, and give a Power to a malicious Officer to ruin the Business of any principal Manufacturer: And, that for these and many other Reasons, as well as from a full Persuasion that no Modification of the said Act will either ultimately benefit the Revenue, or relieve the fair Trader from the Competition of the Smuggler, therefore praying. That the said Act may be repealed.

Ditto. A Petition of the Tavemkeepers, Innkeepers, Coffeehouse-keepers, and Publicans, of the Cities of - don and Westminster, and [Parts adjacent, within the Limits of the Chief Office of Excise in , was

likewise presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by an Act made in the Twenty-ninth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, for repealing the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting new Duties in lieu thereof, it is enacted, “ That all and every Person or Persons, who shall “ manufacture Tobacco or Snuff, or deal in Tobacco or Snuff, shall, before he, she, or they shall manufacture Tobacco or Snuff, or deal in Tobacco 0 or Snuff, take out such licence and Licences as therein-after mentioned;” and that the Petitioners do not conceive that the Legislature, in passing the

said Act, meant that the Petitioners should be Objects of Taxation, or that they should be liable to take out such Licence under the said Act, and they do not conceive themselves to be “ Dealers in Tobacco,” within the true Intent and Meaning of the said Act, but the Petitioners have notwithstanding been compelled to take out Licences as Dealers in Tobacco, under a Construction of the said Act, that the Tobacco consumed in their Houses constitutes them to be “ Dealers in Tobacco;” and that the Petitioners have always cheerfully contributed to the Exigencies of the State, and have and do support very heavy and large Burthens by the many Imposts exclusively laid upon them; viz. £ s d

For every Beer Licence, the Sum of - 118 —

For every Wine Licence - - - 2 4 1

For Spirit Licences - - - - 2 6 —

For every Six Weeks Licence, about Two Shillings in the Pound on the Annual House Rent, (being an Additional Duty on Brandy) so that; if the Rent amounts to Fifty Pounds per Annum, the Licences are - > - - - 4 16 —

£ ti 4

and that none of the Licences above-mentioned are transferrable (except the Beer Licence) so that, as often as the Petitioners remove their Places of Dwelling, not only the Persons taking their Houses, but also the Petitioners, if they continue in the same Trade, are obliged to take out new Licences; and that the Petitioners are put to much Trouble and great Inconvenience by the Number of Attendances at the Excise Office, and the great Delays in procuring their Licences, and the Petitioners in the Out Parts feel themselves very much aggrieved by Soldiers being constantly Quartered on them, for, notwithstanding the re are upwards of Ten thousand Public Houses within the Bills of Mortality, and though the Guards do not consist, as the Petitioners are advised, of more than Three thousand Men (many. of whom are Quartered at the Savoy Prisons and the Tower) yet each Public House is Quartered with a Soldier, which is done by Means of most of the Landlords paying the Soldiers to provide for themselves, instead of entertaining them in their Houses: And therefore praying, That the House will take their Case into Consideration, and grant them such Relief as may seem meet.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table.

A Petition of John Courtney, Christopher Keld, Wil- Tickton liam Squire, and others, whose Hands are thereunto Inclosure set or subscribed, having certain Rights or Interests Petition, in the Carr or Common herein-after mentioned, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That there is, within the Township of in the Parish

of Saint John of Beverley, in the East Riding of the County of York, a certain Carr or Common, called Tickton Carr, computed to contain Two hundred and Forty-nine Acres, or thereabouts; and that it would be a Benefit to all Persons interested in the said Carr or Common, in case a Division and IncLosure was made thereof, and specific Parts and Shares allotted to the Parties, according to their different Rights and Interests:

Arid therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for dividing and inclosing the said Carr or Common, in such Manner, and under such Regulations, as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill, pursuant to the Prayer of the said Petition: And that Mr. Robert Burton and Mr. Anderson Pelham do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Part

Pail of them, should seam proper; and.that by Means of the said Estates, in and near the Parish of Saint Andi'av, Holborn,being let upon Building and Re-

pairing Leases, as the former Leases have fallen in and expired, the reserved Rents thereof have been greatly increased since the passing of the said Act, and also now amount to 2,917 17 Annum,

and it is estimated, that, in as much as Fifty of the present Leases on the same Estate will expire at Midsummer 1793, and Nineteen more in the Year following, the Rents of the Estates in the same Leases, upon being new let on Building and Repairing Leases, will be increased by the Yearly Sum of 1,000l. or thereabouts, and the remaining Part of the Estates will be also capable of considerable Increase in its Yearly Value upon the Determination of the Leases now in being, some of which have but a few Years te run; and that, in as much as the Revenues of the said Charity are very considerably increased, and are in a short lime likely to be still further increased, the Petitioners conceive it may be expedient again to enlarge the Charitable Uses thereof, and they also conceive that divers Regulations are wanting for the better governing and managing of the said Charity, and to prevent Abuses and Irregularities in the Disposition of its Revenues; and that it would tend greatly to the Correction of such Abuses and Irregularities, and to the general Benefit and Advantage of the said Charity, and greatly promote the good Management thereof, if the following Regulations were to take Place, via. That the Number of Trustees shall be enlarged, by admitting to that Office, in Addition to those appointed by the aforesaid Act, all Inhabitants of the said Town of Bedford paying Scot and Lot, who shall have been actually resident there for Three Years, and be likewise possessed of, or entitled to, a Freehold-Estate within the Town or County of Bedford, of the Yearly Value of 2 oLclear of all Reprizes, but that such additional Trustees shall not be entitled to act any longer than while they^hall so reside, and continue possessed or entitled, and that no Person shall be capable of acting as a Trustee who shall be Partaker of the said Chanty, or who shall be appointed by the Trustees to any Place or Office of Profit under the said Charity; but no Person to be incapacitated from being & Trustee merely on Account of having any Child or Children educated in the School, or sent from thence to either University, with the Exhibitions after-mentioned; — That the Warden and Fellows of the Niott College, in Oxford, who are appointed Visitors of the Free Grammar School by the aforesaid Letters Patent, may be authorized and directed to send Two sufficient Visitors Yearly to the same School, who, upon every 16th Day of shall, in a public Maimer, examine the Boys in their Learning, and shall, as Visitors^ examine into the Conduct of the Master and Usher, and also into all Faults and Neglects respecting the same School, and make a Report thereof to the Wardens and Fellows of New College; and that each Visitor be allowed Fifteen Guineas for his Trouble; and that the said Wardens and Fellows shall always have the Power of removing the Master and Usher for just Causes, and of appointing others in their Stead; — That the Trustees shall grant Exhibitions, not exceeding 30 per Annum each, to such Scholars, going to either of the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, as the Visitors shall from Time to Time recommend, and as the Trustees shall deem most worthy of Preference, hot so as there shall not be more than Six Scholars recasting Exhibitions at any one Time; and that no Scholar shall hold hie Exhibition alter Twenty-four Years of Age; — That in future no Girls shall be put out Apprentice, it haviqg generally happened that no Persons have been found to take them but their own Parents, who, being for the most Part in wry low and indiwafe Circam-Vox 45. '

stances, and following no Trade; have suffered the Bedford Girls to live in a State of Idleness and Neglect; — Chanty That Twenty Boys shall be Apprenticed every Half Pet*tion. Year, not being under Thirteen, nor above Fifteen Years of Age, and that they may be bound at any Time within Six Calendar Months from the Time of their drawing Lots, instead of within Two Months, according to the present Regulations; and that they shall be placed out to Masters of good Character and Responsibility, to be approved of by the Trustees, and that no Boys shall be Apprenticed, unless their Fathers shall have actually been Occupiers of One or more House or Houses in the Town for Ten Years next preceding the Apprenticing, or shall have been born in the Town, and been Occupiers of One or more House or Houses therein for Three Years next preceding the Apprenticing, it having been found that the Hope of obtaining this Part of the Charity has occasioned a great Influx of Paupers into the Town from neighbouring Parishes, who have soon become chargeable to the Parishes within the Town, and thereby occasioned a very burthensome Increase of Poor Rates, which are now, upon an Average, Six Shillings in the Pound; whereas, before the enlarging of the Uses of the Charity under the aforesaid Act, the Pour Rates were only from Two to Three Shillings in the Pound; and such Increase of Poor Rates appears to the Petitioners a great Grievance to the Natives or Old Inhabitants of the Town, for whose Benefit the Charity was designed; — That nd Sum shall be paid, as the Portion of any Poor Maidens, who shall marry Vagrants, or others of bad Fame or Reputation; and that no Poor Maidens shall be entitled to such Portions, unless- their Fathers shall have been Occupiers of One or more House or Houses in the Town of Bedford for Ten Years next preceding their claiming to draw Lots, or shall have been born in the Town, and been Occupiers of One or more House or Houses therein for Three Years next preceding their claiming to draw Lots; it being found that the Distribution of this Part of the Charity tu Poor Maidens of the Description in the present Regulation, has also tended greatly to causing an Influx of Paupers into the said Town, and consequently an Increase of the Poor Rates; — That in future no Sum shall be paid as the Portion of Poor Maid Servants (except to Maid Servants who shall, upon the 1st Day of June 1790, have been Two Years in Service in the said Town) the Distribution of this Part of the Charity having also been found a considerable Cause of the Grievance mentioned in the last Article; —

That no Persons shall be Partakers of the Surplusage of the Rents and Profits of the Charity Estate distributed in the Month of November Annually, unless they shall have previously lived and resided Ten Years within the said Town of Bedford, instead of Five Years, according to the present Regulations; and that the Petitioners conceive that forther Regulations may be wanted for the well managing and governing of the said Charity, and the disposing of the Revenues thereof and particularly for extending the Uses and Ob-jecta of the said Charity with respect to the Surplus of tho Annual Income: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring ia a Bill for regulating the said Charity in the Points aboYoenentioned, or ia such other Manner as to the House shall seem meet.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

since those Regulations have paved, have been further aggrieved, by having tfacir Gdods rendered liable to Seawre for making them of a Saleable Strength, though they have bona fide paid the Duty to Government, and several of the Petitioners have already sustained great Lose from being in this Situation, and there is no Instance, within the Knowledge of the Petitioners, of any ether Trade being restrained from vending Goods agreeable to the Orders of their Customers; that upon an Advance of Malt Spirits to the Petitioners, they have no other Alternative bat reducing the Strength of their Goods in Proportion to such Rise, as the Prices of Compounds to the Consumer are continued with the same Uniformity as the Price of Beer; and that, since those Regulations were first enacted, the Price of Spirits has varied more than Twenty-seven per Cent.; that when the last Regulation took Place, and the Price of Spirits was 60 /. per Ton, the Petitioners found from Experience that such Allowance was even insufficient to carry on their Business to Advantage, and keep within the Limits of the Law, and it is therefore impossible at the present advanced Price of 661, per Ton; and that the Reasons which have been given in Support of those Regulations are, to increase the Revenue, and prevent Smuggling, and the Petitioners have every Reason to believe that the Reduction of Duty has suppressed the Smuggling of British Spirits, and renders it unnecessary to oppress the fair Traders; and that the Complaints of the Petitioners are aggravated by Dealers reducing their Goods again in the Presence of an Excise Officer, to the great Injury of the Petitioners, who are thereby undersold with their own Articles, and they apprehend, if smuggling of British Spirits can exist under the present Duty, that such Permission to the Dealer may be the Means of encouraging it, as has been heretofore experienced; that the Petitioners also suffer the same Hardships by Retailers reducing their Compounds after the same have been received say them into their Stocks, contrary to Act of Parliament, and the Petitioners conceive that, as Restrictions have been enacted for the Benefit of the Revenue, the Object of Government would be more effectually answered, if the Redaction of Compounds was confined to the Manufacturer only, with a sufficient Allowance to make his Goods fit for universal Consumption; and that the Petitioners, in their present Situation, to avoid having their Goods seized by the Regulations under the Act, are compelled either to sell them at a great Disadvantage, or to submit their Property to great Risque, that their Stocks may appear within the Limitation of the Law, and do Increase be stated upon the Excise Accounts, and the Petitioners are unwilling to pursue their Business under Restrictions which subject them to Loss, or Seizure and Penalty, and aTe anxious to participate in the common Advantages of other Traders in this Kingdom: And therefore praying to be heard, by themselves or Counsel, if n eedful, in Support of this Petition, imploring the Protection of the House for that Purpose, and for such Relief in the Matters complained of, as the House shall think most fit.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

A Petition of the Owners of Ships at the Port of Leith, in that Part of Great Britain called whose Names are thereunto subscribing, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That by several Acs for the Suppression of Smuggling, not only the Vessels of the notorious and flagrant Smuggler, but the Ships of the fair and open Trader, are exposed to Confiscation, and, if those Acts make any Distinction between them, the Petitioners beg Leave to suggest that the Distinction appears to be in favour of the Smuggler. The Act of the Twenty-fourth of His present Majesty, which applies principally to Vessels hovering on the Coast, and as such indisputably Smug-

flers and Objects of exemplary Punishment, has a Clause enabling the Owner or Master thereof, as well as those of the fair and open Trader, on giving Evidence of the smallness of the Quantity of Goods found on Board, and other extenuating Circumstances, to assert his Innocence, and preserve his Vessel from Forfeiture, but, by the Act of the Twenty-second of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for the “ further securing the Property of the Owners in such “ Ships or Vessels as are liable to Forfeiture, for “ importing Spirits or other Goods by the Misconduct of the Master, Mate, and Seamen,” after admitting the Hardship that Ship Owners labour under, and the Reasonableness of their being secured in their Property, only gives to the innocent Owners Penalties from the guilty Seamen, which the Owners find impossible to recover; and the Fifty-ninth Section of the Act of the Twenty-sixth of His present Majesty, enacts, “ That every Ship importing any Foreign Spirituous “ Liquors (British Plantation Rum and Arrack ex-t cepted) in any Cask containing less than One hundred Gallons, except Two Gallons for each Seaman, “ with all her Stores and Furniture, be the Burthen “ and Value thereof what they may, shall be forfeited “ without any Limitation or Qualification whatsoeverand that, in consequence of those Acts, several of the Ships at the Port of Leith, employed in an open and fair Trade, have of late, on their Arrival from Abroad, been seized and detained by the Officers of the Customs, and the Owners put to great Incon-Vol. 45.

venience, Trouble, and Charges, by the Detention of their Shipping for many Months at a Time, by Application for their Release, by satisfying the seizing Officer, and by Fees, &c. notwithstanding the Liquor or other Goods above the Quantity allowed by Law, found on Board, have been trivial and inconsiderable both as to Quantity and Value, and notwithstanding the Owners and Masters of the Ships were not any way concerned in, or privy to, the Loading or having on Board the same; and that the Ships are seldom carried to Condemnation, yet the Owners, besides sustaining the aforesaid heavy and disproportioned Injury and Expences,. fire liable by the aforesaid Acts to be reduced to a State of Indigence and Beggary by having their valuable Property intirely wrested from them without any Offence whatever being committed by them, and without being able either to prevent the Offence in their Seamen, or having it in their Power to obtain any Recompenco or Satisfaction from the Aggressors, who often cannot be prevented in this unlawful Practice, and are poor in their Circumstances; and that the Ship Owners at Leith, having held a General Meeting, it was unanimously resolved to lay their hard Case before the House, to express their utter Aversion to, and Abhorrence of, all Smuggling whatever, and to submit to the Consideration of the House, whether if some Regulations similar to the following would not tend more to secure His Majesty’s Revenue, than the present Laws, which punish Persons not concerned in an illicit Trade, for the Crimes of those who at present pass with Impunity; viz. If a Law was made inflicting a heavy Penalty on the Persons actually guilty of Smuggling, and Imprisonment till paid, and enacting that where any Liquor or other Goods above the Quantity allowed by Law for the Ship’s Use, are found concealed, and the Aggressor cannot immediately, or before the Ship is cleared of her Cargo, be discovered, that the Owners are to forfeit Treble the Value of all the Goods so found, and the Ship detained until paid, such Owners being authorized to deduct the said Forfeiture out of the Wages due to the Master, Mate, and Seamen; and, if the Offender shall afterwards be discovered, the seizing Officer to cause him to be prosecuted for the said Penalty, and thereupon the Forfeiture of Treble the Value of the Goods seized, so paid by the Owners, to be repaid to him for the Use of the Persons from whom he may have deducted the same, except the Persons convicted, and their Shares to go to the Informer or Prosecutor, but the Ships to be in no Case liable to be seized or detained, unless for the aforesaid Forfeiture, nor liable to Confiscation, unless Proof is obtained that the Owners are concerned in, or privy to, the carrying on the illicit Trade; and that the Shipping at Leith is at present considerable, and breeds many Seamen for His Majesty’s Navy, as will appear from the Navy Books, where it will be found that more Seamen entered, or were impressed, for His Majesty’s Service last War than at any Port of its Size in the Kingdom, and the Port yields a considerable Revenue to Government; and that the Petitioners can-net continue to carry on the Business of Ship Owners, unless some Alteration is made in the present Penal Laws against them: And therefore they hope that Directions will be given for such a public Bill to be introduced as will repeal those Laws which subject Ships to Confiscation, where no Evidence can be adduced against the Owners of apy Connivance in, or Knowledge of, Contraband Goods being on Board, and fixing the Crime of Smuggling on board Ships employed in the open and fair Trade upon the Persons who must from the Nature of the Business be guilty, and thereby afford the Petitioners that Protection and Security which, as Persons whose Property is embarked in a Trade as fair and open in itself as productive to

A Petition of the most Noble John Duke of Atholl, being offered to be presented to the House;

Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, by His Majesty's Command, acquainted the House, That His Majesty, having been informed of the Contents of the said Petition, gives His Consent that the House may do therein as they shall think proper, and recommends the said Petition to the Consideration of the House.

Then the said Petition was brought up and read; Setting forth, That the Isle of Mann was, in the-Seventh Year of the Reign of Henry the Fourth, granted to Sir John Stanley, “ cum omni Dominio et Justitia “ Regali,” under which Grant it was held and enjoyed,

until, in Order to determine some Family Disputes, and for a pecuniary Consideration paid by William Earl of Derby, King James the First, in the Seventh Year of his Reign, re-granted the Isle of Mann to that Earl, and in the same Year an Act of Parliament was passed, assuring and establishing the said Isle, unalienably in the Heirs General of James Lord Stanley, under which Parliamentary Entail, the Petitioner’s Grandfather, James Duke of Atholl, succeeded to and took Possession of the said Isle of Mann, on whose Decease, in 1764, the Succession devolved on John Duke of Atholl and Charlotte Dutchess of Atholl and Baroness Strange, his Wife, the Petitioner’s Father and Mother, and the Petitioner became entitled to the immediate Possession of the Isle of Mann, soon after the Demise of the said John Duke of Atholl, in 1774, by virtue of a Deed executed by Charlotte Dutchess of Atholl and Baroness Strange, his Mother, for Reasons therein recited; and that great Frauds and Abuses having been practised upon His Majesty’s Revenues of Customs, as well in Great Britain as in Ireland, by the illicit and clandestine Trade carried on by British and Irish Subjects between the Two Kingdoms and the Isle of Mann, and those evil Practices having grown to so unparalleled an Extent as to be productive of a Loss to the Public, which was computed at no less than at 350,000l. Annually to the Revenue* of Great Britain alone, and it being conceived that to annihilate this Evil altogether, no other Means would be effectual than that of laying heavy Prohibitions and Restrictions on Imports and Exports to and from the Island, and placing Officers of Revenue, and armed Vessels, in the Ports and Harbours thereof with Power to enforce the same, for which Purpose, and to avoid interfering with the acknowledged Rights of the Lords of Mann, and at the same Time to avdid the heavy Expence which the Public must otherwise have sustained by Coasters and other Vessels, it was thought expedient that the Sovereignty of the Island, and the Revenues of the Customs thereof, with some of the Rights of Property therein, should be re-vested in His Majesty upon a fair Compensation to "be made by the Public to the Proprietors, an Act was passed in the -JFifth Year of His Majesty’s Reign, whereby

the said Island, and the Sovereignty of the same, were vested in the Crown, reserving only to the Proprietors thereof their Landed Property and Manorial Rights by Words of Exception contained in the said Act, and the Sum of 70,000 /. was thereby directed to be paid by the Public, and to be vested in Lands for the Uses in the said Act mentioned, as a Compensation for the Sovereignty and Rights of Property so vested in the Crown, and to which it is proper the Petitioner should add, for the Information of the House, His Majesty was pleased subsequently to grant to the said Duke and Dutchess of Atholl, the Petitioner’s Father and Mother, for their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of them, an Annuity of 2,000l. per Annum, on the Irish Establishment, in Consideration, as it is expressed in the Grant, that the Revenues of Ireland, as well as those of Great Britain, would be greatly improved by the Surrender of the Island; and that the said re-vesting Act was made under the Pressure of the Moment, when the Urgency of the Mischief called for an immediate and effectual Remedy, and when, from the recent Possession of the Petitioner’s Father and Mother, they could form no accurate Idea of the Extent or Value of the Rights and Interests which were necessary to be ceded, and the Act was passed without any Evidence produced to prove what Rights of Property in particular were necessary to be vested in the Crown for the Security of the Public Revenue (the sole Object of the Act) from future Frauds and Evasions; and for want of those Lights and proper Precautions, the Proprietors were under the general Transfer, and Re-vestment of the Island, and its Sovereignty, divested of sundry valuable Privileges and Rights of Property, not only unnecessary to have been transferred for the Protection and Security of the Public Revenue, but from their Nature wholly unconnected with it, and which, though they afford little Benefit to the Public, were of material Importance to the Petitioner and his Family; and that in the Hurry of the Transaction of 1765, arising from the Urgency already stated, the Titles of the Petitioner’s Family appear not to have been perfectly understood, insomuch that Words of great legal Import, contained in the Act of the Seventh of King James the First, for the Settlement and Entail of the said Island unalienably, were omitted to be inserted in the Preamble of the said Bill of 1765, and which, as the Petitioner is advised, militate against the Power of James Duke of Atholl, to new model the Succession by the Deed of Trust of 1756, recited in the said Preamble, but to the Uses of which Settlement the said 70,000l. has been actually applied by the Trustees thereof, under the Sanction given to the new Entail by that Agreement, made between the Crown and the said Trustees, and under the Power also given to the Trustees of the same Entail by the Provisions of the said Act for vesting Mann in the Crown; and that, as the Petitioner does not contest the Proposition that private Advantage should give way to public Expediency, so also he hopes that it will not be denied that a full and fair Compensation should be allowed to any Individual for such Rights of his as may be deemed necessary for the public Service; and the Petitioner is confident that upon a minute Investigation, it will be found that the Sum of 70,000l. and the said Annuity granted to his Family in 1765, were by no Means an adequate Compensation for the said Transfer, and that this Inadequacy might have proceeded from the probable Reasoning at the Time of the contingent Nature of the Revenue of the Isle of Mann, and which it might have been supposed would be considerably reduced by the Annihilation of the Contraband Trade, carried on by British Subjects to England, Scotland, and Ireland; that it appears by the Schedule annexed to the Act of 1765, the Revenues of the Isle of Mann

amounted,

amounted, for Five Years, to about 6,500l. Annually, and although from the Circumstance of the Merchants having an extraordinary Quantity of Goods on Hand, which, by Prohibitions laid on in 1765, were of Necessity kept for the sole Consumption of the Inhabitants, and by the Duties even on those having been, in a great Measure, evaded, the Revenues of Customs were considerably less productive than they would otherwise have been for a Course of Years after the Re-vestment, yet it will be found, on Enquiry, that exclusive of the Harbour Dues, and the Produce of the Herring and Salmon Fisheries, they have amounted, on an Average, for the whole Period since 1765 to about 3,000l. and

that they have been progressively improving, insomuch, that for some Years past they have amounted to nearly 5,000l. Annually, and that, with proper Management and Attention, no Doubt can be entertained of their future Increase; that he 'is confident it cannot be with reason contended that the Sums above stated were an adequate Compensation for such a Revenue, and for those Sovereign Rights and Prerogatives, and the Property of those Castles and Harbours which became vested in the Crown; that the Petitioner trusts it will appear, that in affording him that Redress which is the Ground of his Petition, and by restoring to his Family those specific Rights which do not bear upon or connect themselves in any Degree with the pernicious Practices for the Prevention of which the Act of 1765 was passed, the primary Object of the Legislature will be perfectly attained, and every Clause of the Act of 1765, and of every other posterior Act, which secures and guards the Revenues of the Public from Abuse or Evasion, continue in full Force and in full Effect; and that the Petitioner has no Wish to interfere in any Instance, or in any Manner, with the Sovereignty of the Crown, or with any of the Powers given by the Act of 1765, which are necessary for public Purposes, that he only desires that Parliament may restore to him such Rights as are consistent with the Safety of the Revenue, and enable him to avail himself of such Rights, and receive the Benefit of such Branches of his Property, as have been lost to him, and have not been productive to the Public, and that by a permanent Arrangement and Settlement of those Circumstances which the Petitioner has laid before Parliament in his Petition, the private Interest of his Family in the Isle of Mann, he trusts, will appear to be in no Degree incompatible with the Public Advantage: And therefore praying, That Leave may be given to bring in a Bill for appointing Commissioners to esquire what Rights and Species of Property are necessary or expedient to remain vested in the Crown for the Protection and Security of the Public Revenues, and what are the Value thereof, and also how far, and to what Extent or Value, the Petitioners -remaining Rights and Interests in the said Island have been, or will, by the Dismemberment thereof, be impaired or diminished, or that the House will afford such other Relief to the Petitioner as they shall think fit.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

Petition A Petition of the Manufacturers of Tobacco and

-against the Snuff in the Town of Paisley, North Britain, was obacco Act presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, the Petitioners were subjected to the Laws of Excise, and by the said Act the Manufacturers are subjected to a new and arbitrary Mode of Manufacture, to the great additional Expence and Inconvenience of the/ Manufacturers, as well as imminent Danger of the Loss of their Customers — That it imposes Rules and Regulations on the Manufacturer, which in many Cases cannot be conformed to, without rendering the Goods unfit for his Customer, and subjects' the Manufacturer to Pains and Penalties which he can neither foresee nor prevent — That it puts a total Stop to every Improvement in the Manufacture; as it restricts the Manufacturer in his Returns to certain per Cents. which cannot be complied with but at the Risque of spoiling the Whole, and with as much (or indeed more) Propriety might the Legislature enact that every Farmer in Great Britain should be compelled to produce a certain specified Quantity of Flour or Meal, and no more, from the same Quantity of Corn, of whatever Quality it might" be of, it being a well known Fact, that there are as many or more different Qualities of Tobacco than there are of Corn, and consequently their Retuns as different — That it prevents the Manufacturer supplying his Customer for Ten or Fourteen Days, or often longer, though all the Time in Possession of the Goods wanted, the Manufacturer being obliged to finish the Manufacture of the whole Parcel before he dare use any Part of it — That it occasions Delays and Interruptions quite inconsistent with the Nature of Trade, and which must

soon drive the Manufacture of that Article out of the Country — That it exposes the Mysteries of the Trade to the Officers and to the Smugglers, and gives a.

Power to the Officer to ruin the Business of any Manufacturer; and that it is the Opinion of the Petitioners, an Excise Law is totally inapplicable to the.

Manufacture of Tobacco, an Article which undergoes; such a Variety of Alterations in the Process of Manufacture, and it is also their Opinion, no Law consistent with the British Constitution can ever be effectual in, raising a Revenue on Tobacco, while the Duties continue so high, and they see nothing before them but the Ruin of their Manufacture, and the Triumph of the Smuggler, unless the Duties are considerably reduced:

And therefore praying, That the said Act may be repealed, and the Duties on Tobacco reduced, so that the Revenue may be benefited, and the Fair Trader »

relieved.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

Petition against the Birmingham and Worces* ter Canal Bill.

231

Application is making to the House, for Leave to bring in a Bill for making a new Canal Navigation, from the Town of Birmingham to the River Secern, at Digits, near Worcester;and that there has been already made and completed, at a very large Expence, one Communication by Water, from the Town of Birmingham, to Worcester, by Means of the present Birmingham, and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canals, which falls into the River Severn at Stourport, and another Communication is now making, under the Sanction of Parliament, and nearly finished, between those Places and the Collieries on the Upper Line of the said Birmingham Canal, by Means of the Junction of the Dudley and Birmingham Canals at Tipton, which will be fully sufficient to answer every good and useful Purpose of Water Conveyance between the Town of Birmingham and Worcester, and the City of Worcester, and other Places down the Secern, may be thereby supplied with Coals from the Mines lying at a Distance from Birmingham, instead of taking them from that Manufacturing Town, and upon as cheap Terms as by the proposed Canal; and that no Public Meeting has been called to consider of the Expediency or Utility of making such new Canal, and the Petitioners conceive the same calculated to answer the private Views of the Schemers thereof, and not founded on Principles either of Necessity, or real Public Utility-; and that Birmingham is a large and populous Town, in which various Manufactories in Iron, and other Metals, are carried on, and such Manufactures greatly depend upon, and cannot be advantageously prosecuted without, a regular Supply of Coals at a moderate Price; and that Coals have been for some Time past, and now are sold at a considerable advanced Price at the said Town, and the Petitioners are fully satisfied that the proposed Canal, if made, will increase the Price of Coals, and prove highly injurious to the Trade and Manufactures of the said Town: And therefore praying, That the said Bill may not pass into a Law, and that the Petitioners may be heard by Counsel against the same.

A Petition of the several Persons whose Names are thereunto subscribed. Owners and Occupiers of Water Mills and other Works, upon the several Rivers, Brooks, Streams, and Rivulets, lying between the Town of Birmingham and the City of Worcester, and the Neighbourhood thereof, was also presented to the House, and read; taking Notice of the Application mentioned in the last preceding Petition; and Setting forth, That, below the Line of such intended Canal, there are many Mills worked by Water flowing from various Springs and Brooks arising in and above the Line of such intended Canal, at which Mills very extensive Trades and Manufactures are carried on, and very large Sums of Money have been expended in planting and establishing such Works and Manufactures, and the Support and Maintenance of a large Body of Manufacturers and Labourers, their Wives and Children, depend on such Works; and that the present Supply of Water is not fully sufficient for the necessary Uses of the said Mills and Works, and, in' case the said intended Canal should take place, the same must unavoidably intercept and take away great Part of the Resources of Water which now feed and support the Brooks and Streams from whence the said Mills are supplied with Water, and thereby such Mills and Works will be very considerably injured, if not wholly ruined, and the Trade lost; and that the Petitioners hope their Manufactories will be deemed of Public Utility and Importance, and on that Account entitled to Encouragement and Protection, and they apprehend no Advantage is likely to be derived to the Public from the said intended Canal adequate to the Injury which the Petitioners and others will unavoidably sustain by it: And therefore praying. That such Bill may not pass into a Law,

Vol, 45.

and that the Petitioners may be heard, by themselves, their Agents, or Counsel, against the same.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Secern, near to the City of Worcester, be read a Second Time; and the Petitioners are to be then heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petitions, if they think fit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petitions.

That they may be beard, by their Counsel, against the said Bill in its present Form, and against the several Provisions thereof, and that the Powers thereof may be confined to taking down and re-building upon the same Foundation the present Church and Tower, or such Part thereof as shall be found necessary, or to re-build and enlarge the same on the present Scite, and for enlarging the present Church Yard, in such Manner as the House shall think proper.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the Bill for taking down the Church and Tower belonging to the Parish of Hackney, in the County of Middlesex, and for building another Church and Tower for the Use of the said Parish, and for enlarging the Cemetery, or Church Yard, belonging thereto, is committed: And that the Petitioners be heard, by their Coupsel, before the said Committee, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That it be an Instruction to the said Committee, That they do admit Counsel to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition,

Petition from A Petition of the Merchants and Owners of Ships Liverpool in the Port of Liverpool, whose Names are thereunto the*Confis- subscribed, was presented to the House, and read; cation of Setting forth, That the numerous and important Ad-

Ship*. vantages arising to every Maritime Power from em-

ploying the greatest possible Number of Ships in the Carrying Trade, are Facts too well known, and too firmly established, to require fresh Proofs, or further Notice, to any Member of the Legislature; and that other Nations, who wish now to acquire, or aim at increasing their already acquired, Maritime Strength, are using every Art, and exerting their utmost Efforts,

- to gain as large a Share as possible in that advantageous Employment, and, whilst other States are holding out particular and considerable Encouragements for this special Purpose, many and most depressing Clauses in our own Laws are permitted to remain unrepealed, and almost unnoticed: That, by an Act of the Nineteenth Year of His present Majesty, Owners of Ships are made answerable for all Spirituous Liquors, Tea, or Coffee, found on Board their Ships, on Arrival in Great Britain, from any Foreign Ports in Europe, in small Packages, exceeding a certain Allowance for each Man on Board, as specified in the said Act, and the Punishment for such Delinquency, though committed without the Knowledge of the Owners, and in express Breach of their positive Orders, is no less than the Confiscation of the Ship, with her Tackle and Furniture; and that the Value of such Ship is usually from One to Three thousand Pounds or upwards, and the Purchase of the Liquors, Coffee, or Tea, for which this heavy Penalty is incurred, will seldom amount to Thirty Pounds, and not often to a Third Part of that Sum, and such a Disproportion between the Crime and the Punishment, and the Infliction of that Punishment upon those who are not only clear of all Offence, actual or intentional, but have it not by any possible Means within their Power to prevent the Commission of the Crime, is certainly a Hardship which calls loudly for Redress; and that the said Law, as it now stands, is a great Discouragement to Persons of Property and Character from becoming Owners of Ships in the Carrying Trade, and without proper Modifications must tend eventually to injure much, if not totally destroy, that excellent Nursery for Seamen; and that, if the absolute Confiscation of the Spirits, Tea, and Coffee, and an additional pecuniary Penalty, payable by the Defaulter, bearing some Proportion to the Duty upon the Articles so seized, were imposed, and rigorously exacted, the Punishment would become an Act. of Justice, and the Crime be no less an Object of Vol. 45.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

That by an Act, made in the Twenty-seventh Year of the Reign of His present Majesty’s for laying additional Duties upon Licences, to be taken out by Persons dealing by Retail in Spirituous Liquors, the Petitioners are required to take out an additional Licence Annually, and the Sums paid for such Licences are regulated by the Rates of the Houses occupied by the Petitioners, and, by the said Act, they are required to attend at the Chief Office of Excise in London, Eight Times in each Year, to pay by Instalments the Sums directed by the said Act, and all Houses rated under 15/. per Annum, occupied by Retailers of Spirituous Liquors, pay 2/. 1 os. per Annum for such Licence, which Payment increases according to the Sums at which the Houses are rated; and that, prior to the said Act, the Legislature, in Tenderness to the fair Trader, reduced the Duties upon Spirituous Liquor's so low, as to enable the Petitioners to purchase Brandy, of the first Quality, at Seven Shillings and Six Pence per Gallon upon the Average, but which, at this Time, cannot be bought for less than Eleven Shillings, and the Prices of Rum, and other Spirits, have advanced in Proportion; and that the Petitioners conceive the said additional Licence was directed by the House in Consequence of the then reduced Price of Spirituous Liquors, and upon the Ground of the Petitioners not being liable to the then existing Tax on Shops; and that the Petitioners are at all Times willing to contribute to the Exigencies of their Country, in common with their Fellow Citizens, but feel themselves partially aggrieved by the Continuance of the said additional Licence, as the Payment of the Instalments is attended with great Trouble, Spirituous Liquors are nearly as dear as ever, and as the Shopkeepers have experienced the Liberality of the House by a Repeal of the Shop Tax, the Petitioners crave Leave to submit their Case to the Consideration of the House: And therefore praying, That the said Act of the Twenty-seventh of His present' Majesty may be repealed, and that they may be heard, by themselves and Counsel, in Support of this their Petition.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the -Table.

A PETITION of the several Persons whose petition Names are thereunder subscribed, Manufacturers against the and Traders in Tobacco and Snuff, and Inhabitants Tobacco Act. of the Borough of Berwick upon Tweed, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners, the Manufacturers and Traders in Tobacco and Snuff, are subjected to the Excise Laws by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, which they feel is not only attended with many Inconveniences and great Hazard to themselves and others of the same Trade, but also with the most dangerous Consequences to the Trade and Commerce of this Kingdom,

and

and therefore beg Leave to state to the House the particular Difficulties imposed upon them by the said Act, and their Apprehensions of its fatal Operation upon their Branch of Trade — That the said Act is extremely complex, in many Respects appears contradictory, and impossible to be strictly, in all Instances, complied with, particularly in making Roll Tobacco, which is the principal Trade in the Neighbourhood of the said Borough, whereby Manufacturers frequently have their Goods spoiled and rendered unfit for Sale, and, notwithstanding their utmost Care and Attention, while they are fairly endeavouring to prosecute their Business without Fraud, are exposed to the Hazard of severe Penalties, in no wise proportioned to the Nature of the Offence — That sundry Regulations are prescribed relative to the Mode of manufacturing Tobacco and Snuff, which are found to be inconsistent with Fact, prejudicial to Trade, and contradictory to Experience, particularly in allowing an' Increase of only Fifteen Pounds upon every One hundred Pounds manufactured into Roll Tobacco, whereas, according to the Manner of making Roll Tobacco as practised by the Petitioners, and every Manufacturer in their Part of the Country, they generally would require an Allowance of from Twenty to Twenty-five Pounds Increase for every One hundred Pounds, an Object of very serious Concern to the Petitioners, being an evident Loss to them of from Eight to Ten per Cent. — That the said Act imposes Rules for the laying down Tobacco Leaf and Tobacco Stalks to be prepared for Snuff, which, according to the Mode of manufacturing Snuff in the Neighbourhood of the said Borough, are altogether impracticable, without the Manufacturer endangering the Loss of his Commodity, or incurring Forfeitures — That the Restrictions of the said Act, which prevent Manufacturers from taking any Roll from the Press until the whole Quantity in Process is completed, is extremely prejudicial to the Trade and Interest of the Petitioners, and all other small Traders, as they are thereby prevented from answering the Orders of their Country Customers and Retail Dealers — That it prevents certain Articles from being removed but in certain Quantities, which is a further Hardship upon the Petitioners and others not in a Port of Importation, as they are thereby necessitated to keep a Stock in Hand beyond what their Credit and Capital may enable them, are prevented from disposing of what they cannot use in their own Line of Manufacturing, and from making speedy Returns, a Thing of the most beneficial Advantages in Trade; and, that the Rules and Regulations to which Manufacturers must conform according to the said Act are found to be attended with many Inconveniences and great Delays, which must necessarily enhance the Price of the Commodity to every fair Dealer, give the Smug-

fler the greater Advantage, and tend to the further encouragement of their illicit Trade; and that a great Number of People are constantly employed in travelling round the Northern Parts of England and Southern Parts of Scotland collecting Eggs, which they bring to the said Town for Sale, and in Return used to take very considerable Quantities of Manufactured Tobacco and Snuff and Grocery Goods, with which they supplied a vast Extent of Country, but those People who traverse the Country without Controul or Molestation, are now supplied with Manufactured Tobacco from abroad, which the Petitioners know and are well assured has of late been smuggled into this Country, and, if the present troublesome and hazardous System of Regulations are' continued, must and will, very considerably increase,* to the great Detriment of the Petitioners, and to the Prejudice of the Trade and Revenue of this Country; and that the operative Mechanic and Manufacturer being left to

the Exertions of their own Genius has been a principal Means of raising the Manufactures and Commerce of this Country to their present Degree of Perfection, but shackling them with restrictive Laws has always been attended with, and followed by, a Decay of Trade, and the Ruin of many Individuals, and if the Petitioners must be governed in Business by a given Set of Rules and Regulations (however well calculated) it will totally check and prevent them from making Exertions, or trying Experiments for the Improvement of their Manufactories, which must shortly yield the Competition to Foreigners, who are engaging Workmen to carry on the same, and industriously forming Connections to supply the Consumption of this Country, and to drive us out of our own Markets:

That the Petitioners are fully sensible of the Necessity of raising a Revenue for the Exigencies of the Nation, and will chearfully contribute on all Occasions to the Public Burthens, but they are so fully convinced of the dangerous Tendency and Consequences of introducing the Severity of the Excise Laws into the Manufactures of this Kingdom, whereby the Constitution and Liberty of the Subject are infringed upon, the Trader subjected to unnecessary Restrictions and Delay, and in many Cases to the Infliction of severe Fines and Forfeitures, whereby the Trade and Commerce of the Country are endangered, and, though they apprehend Taxation is the Object in view, the Revenue must ultimately be materially injured; that they cannot silently acquiesce to the Continuance of a Law fraught with such dangerous Consequences, not only to the Petitioners, but to the Trade and Commerce of this Country in general, and hope that the Wisdom of Parliament may devise Methods more congenial to the Constitution to protect the Revenue without endangering the Trade and Commerce of the Country, or fettering the Manufacturers of Tobacco and Snuff with so many tedious and impracticable Regulations: And therefore praying, That the House will take the Premises into Consideration, and grant them Relief, by repealing an Act, made in the last Session of Parliament, intituled,

“ An Act for repealing the Duties on Tobacco “ and Snuff, and for granting new Duties in lieu “ thereof.”

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

such View have expended large Sums of Money in erecting Dwelling Houses, Warehouses, and other Buildings, for their Habitations,' and the Exercise of their several Trades and Employments, and in so doing many of the Petitioners have expended the Whole of their Fortunes; and that, if the said intended Canal to Worcester should be carried into Execution, the Petitioners are very apprehensive the same will take away from Stourport a great Pai^ of the Trade and Business now brought to, and carried on at, that Place, which will be injurious to the Petitioners in the highest Degree, as the Loss of such Trade will not only render the Houses and Buildings erected by them of little or no Value, but will be the Means of bringing utter Ruin to many of the Petitioners, who now wholly depend upon that Trade and Business for the Support and Maintenance of themselves and Families; and that the Petitioners conceive the said intended Canal is projected to answer the private Views of Individuals, and that no public Advantage can possibly be derived therefrom, adequate to the Injury it will occasion to the Petitioners, and to the private Properties of other Persons: And therefore praying, That the House will take the Premises into Consideration, and not permit the said Bill to pass into a Law, and that the Petitioners may be heard, by themselves, their Counsel, or Agents, against the same.

and better Communication between Birmingham and the River Secern, and for more effectually supplying Worcester and the other Towns near the Severn with Coals, Acts have since passed for making Canals from the Birmingham Canal at Tipton, by Dudley and Stourbridge, to fall into the Petitioners said Canal at ton, which is Fifteen Miles nearer from Birmingham to the River Severn and Worcester, than by the Way of Autherley; and that, in a former Session of the present Parliament, a Bill was brought in for making another Canal to the River Severn, at Diglis, near Worcester, which was rejected, on full Hearing and Consideration, as being inexpedient and unnecessary; and that the chief Ground of Application for the said Bill being, as was then alleged, the imperfect State of the Navigation of the River Severn, between the Petitioners Canal at Stourport and Diglis aforesaid, a Distance of Thirteen Miles, the Petitioners, to remove every Cause of Complaint on that Head, did offer and engage, by their Counsel, at their own Costs and Charges, to improve and make perfect the said River Navigation, without burthening the Public with any Expence, Toll, or Duty whatever, and the Petitioners did, in pursuance of such Engagement, begin to improve the said Navigation, and expended therein a large Sum of Money, but were prevented from effecting their Designs by a Body of Men, actuated, as tho Petitioners believe, by Persons who, from private Views, were adverse to such Improvement, and the Petitioners were thereby compelled to desist from further proceeding; and that the Petitioners have ever since been, and still are, ready and willing to fulfil their Engagements to Parliament, if they can be invested with Powers to do so, and to that End they have lately presented their Petition to the House, for Leave to bring in a Bill to authorize them to make the necessary Improvements in the said River, by removing the Shoals, and by cleansing and deepening the Channel thereof, and it is with Surprize and Concern the Petitioners observe, that the Scheme of another Canal to Diglis is again brought forward, and that an Application has been made to the House, for a Bill to make such Canal, which, though not in the same Course, will be similar to the former in its Effects and Consequences to the Petitioners; and that the present Design, as the Petitioners understand, is, like the former, founded on the Circumstance of the River Severn being in dry Seasons an imperfect Navigation, and upon the Idea that the nearest Course between Birmingham and Wyrcester is through the Canal

of the Petitioners by Autherley, whereas in Fact (by the Junction of the Dudley Canal with the Birmingham) a nearer Course will be opened by Fifteen Miles than that which the Petitioners for the Bill have chosen to represent, and which will alsp open a nearer Communication by upwards of Eight Miles, between the Tipton and the several other principal Coal Mines and Worcester, than by the Canal proposed; and that the Petitioners doubt not but they shall be able to prove, that when the Dudley Canal is joined to the Birmingham, and they Improvements are made in the River Severn, as proposed and engaged to be done by the Petitioners, a certain, complete, and perfect Navigation will be found abundantly sufficient for all the Purposes of Trade and Commerce, and that the proposed Canal will not be necessary, or publicly useful, as it will not communicate, or open Commercial Intercourses, with any other Places than those which are already connected by Means of the present Navigations, nor will it open a Communication with any new Coal Mines; and the Petitioners submit that, in all hazardous and expensive Works executed for public Purposes under the Authority of the Legislature, the Undertakers thereof have jhst and reasonable Grounds of Reliance on Parliament for the Enjoyment of their Property acquired by such. Undertak-Vo htS»

ings, and in this Respect the Petitioners beg Leave to claim the Protection of the House; and that although the Introduction of Navigable Canals into this Kingdom has undoubtedly been, and will continue to be, of great public Benefit, yet, if suffered to be made indiscriminately, and, in the Event of some happening to succeed, others should be allowed to be made to supersede them, the Procedure would not only operate as a Discouragement, but would strike at the very Root of those National Irri^rovem^nts, and be productive of much public and private Mischief, and the Petitioners conceive such will be the Effect of the Design in Question, if suffered to be carried into Execution, in regard to the Canal of the Petitioners, and to several others lately completed, without affording the Public any material Benefit or Accommodation: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by their Counsel, against the said Bill for making a Canal from Birmingham to Diglis and that the same may not pass into a Law.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, an Act, passed in the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for the effectual Draining and Preservation of JVaterbeach Level, in the County of Cambridge, and Ho establish an Agreement, made between the Lord of the Manor of JVaterbeach cum Denny and the Commoners within the said Manor, was read: And,

Mr. Edward Allen being examined, said, That there is a Necessity for altering the Act, in Consequence of the Opinion given by an eminent Counsel respecting the Regulation for stocking the said Level; Then,

Mr. John Hcmmington, Junior, being examined, said, That the Number of Cattle allowed by the Act to be stocked upon the said Commonable Lands is greater than the said Lands will bear — That it has been customary for a few Years last past for a Majority of the Commoners to agree to lessen the Number of Common Rights allowed by the said Act, which the Commoners have, till lately, acquiesced in; but some of them have since refused to conform thereto, and now insist upon their whole Stockage — That the Common cannot be beneficially enjoyed without the Stint being lessened, which cannot be done without the Aid of Parliament.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring tn a Bill to alter and amend an Act, made in the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, intituled, “ An Act for the effectual Draining “ and Preservation of JVaterbeach Level, in the County “ of Cambridge, and to establish an Agreement made “ between the Lord of the Manor of Waterbeach cum “ Denny and the Commoners within the said Manor:” And that Sir Charles Gould, Mr. York, General Adeane, and Mr. Gould, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, Mr*

That there is not at present a necessary and regular Supply of wholesome Water within the said Town, for the Use of the Inhabitants, but that a sufficient and constant Supply of good and wholesome Water may be obtained by a Regulation and Improvement of the Water Works that at present supply the Town.

Then an Act, made in the Twenty-eighth Year of his late Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for enlightening “ the Streets and Lanes, and regulating the Pavements,

“ in the Town of Leeds, in the County of York," was read: And,

Mr. Nicholson being further examined, said, That there are several Streets, and other Places, within and near to the said Town, to which the said Act doth not extend, and which are not properly lighted, and are subject to divers Nuisances, Annoyances, Encroachments, and Obstructions; and that the Streets and Places under the said Act are subject to various other Nuisances, Encroachments, and Obstructions, which the Provisions of the said Act are not sufficient for removing and preventing — And he added, That the supplying the said Town and Neighbourhood with . a sufficient Quantity of good and wholesome Water, and the Regulation and Improvement of the Streets and Places before mentioned, will be of great Benefit and Convenience to the Inhabitants, and all Persons resorting to the said Town, and the Neighbourhood thereof.

A Petition of the Manufacturers of Tobacco and Glasgow Pe-Snuff in the City of Glasgow, was presented to the tition against House, and read; Setting forth, That towards the Tobacco Close of the last Session of Parliament, a Bill was in- c ’ traduced into the House, for the Purpose of putting Tobacco under an Excise, and the Petitioners at that Time most cordially joined the London Manafacturers in their Endeavours to prevent it from passing into a Law, and this they did from a Conviction that the End proposed could not be attained while the Duties on that Article continued so high; and that, in Consequence of the Exertions of the Manufacturers, and . from the Force of the Evidence adduced at the Bar. of the House, considerable Alterations were made in many of the most exceptionable 'Clauses, which Alterations (though greatly short of the Manufacturers Wishes) tended to alleviate the Hardships which the first Draft of the Bill meant to impose upon them, and in that amended State it passed into a Law, and it then became the Duty of every good Citizen to submit to an Experiment which the Legislature had determined to adopt; and that for a Period of Twtf

Months 'subsequent to ltd Operation, the Petitioners were inclined to believe, that an additional Revenue would result to the Nation, and that there might be a Possibility of the fair Trader being protected under it, they, therefore, with some Degree of Cheerfulness, submitted to the great Trouble, Expence, Risque of Forfeitures, &c. to which they were subjected, in Hopes that those flattering Prospects which gave a Spring to their Industry would in the End be realized; hut it is with much Concern the Petitioners find that those Expectations have been fallacious, and that the early Ray of Hope which dawned, upon their Exertions is obscured, and they now see nothing before them but the Ruin of their Manufacture, and the Triumph of the Smuggler, whose Operations were only suspended until a thorough Knowledge of the Law had enabled him to take the most effectual Steps to evade it; and that the Petitioners, from a Sense of that Duty which they owe to themselves, to their Brethren in Trade, and to their Fellow Citizens, beg Leave, with all due Submission, but with that Freedom which they consider their Inheritance, to represent to the House the ruinous Situation of the Business in their Part of the Kingdom, and to point out the Impracticability of levying a Tax of such Magnitude, even at the Expence of the Liberty of the Subject, upon any Commodity, the intrinsic Value whereof bears such a Disproportion thereto: That it is their firm Opinion, an Excise Law is totally inapplicable to an Article which undergoes such a Variety of Alterations in the Process of Manufacture, and that no Law, consistent with the Spirit of the British Constitution, can ever be effectual in raising a Revenue on Tobacco, while the Duties continue as they are, and that, if the House do not speedily adopt Measures to defeat the Operations of the Smuggler, the Manufacture in that Part of the Kingdom will soon be nearly . annihilated: And therefore requesting the House to take the Premises into Consideration, and' the Petitioners hope that they will not only find it expedient for the Relief of the Subject to repeal the Excise Law laid upon Tobacco, but for the Benefit of the Revenue to reduce the Duties so considerably, as to render the Prosecution of illicit Trade impracticable, and thereby supersede the Necessity of an Extension . of an Excise to that Article in future.

Linlithgow, A Petition of the Manufacturers of Tobacco and and Falkirk Snuff in the Towns of Linlithgow and Falkirk, was Petition ajs0 presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, Tobacco Act. That by an Act of the last Session of Parliament, the Manufacturers of Tobacco and Snuff are subjected to the Laws of Excise, and, by the said Act, the Mysteries of their Trade, which they consider as private Property, are exposed to the Officers and to the Smugglers — That it imposes Rules and Regulations on the Manufacture which, in many Cases, cannot be conformed to, and subjects the Manufacturer to Penalties and Forfeitures which he can neither foresee nor prevent, and puts it in the Power of the Officer to ruin any Manufacturer, however honest his Transactions may be — That it subjects the Manufacturer to a new Mode of Manufacture, to the great additional Expence and Inconvenience of the Manufacturer, as well as the Risque of losing his Goods — That it occasions Delays and Interruptions quite inconsistent with the Nature of Trade, and prevents . the Manufacturer from disposing of any Part of his Goods, however much wanted, until the whole Parcel is declared finished*, which, in some Cases, cannot be done in less than Five or Six Weeks — That it puts an entire Stop to every Improvement in the Manufacture, by restricting the Manufacturer to certain Returns, although his Goods will often yield Six or Eight per Cent, more, and consequently compels him either to injure himself, and spoil his Goods, or smuggle an Article for which he has paid a high

Duty; and that the Petitioners are of Opinion, that no Excise Law will ever apply to the Manufacture of Tobacco and Snuff, as they undergo such a Variety of Alterations in the Process of Manufacture, and, they are further of Opinion, that no Law will ever be’ effectual in securing the Revenue on Tobacco, without a considerable Reduction of Duty on that Article;

And therefore praying, That the Tobacco Excise Act may be repealed, and the Duties reduced, so that the Revenue may be benefited, and the fair Trader protected and encouraged.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider of the several Petitions which have been presented to this House in this Session of Parliament, praying that the Act, passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, ." An Act for repealing the Duties u on Tobacco and Snuflj and for granting new “ Duties in lieu thereof,” may be repealed or altered.

A Petition of the Freeholders, Commissioners of Petition Supply, Trustees on the Turnpike Roads, and He-ritors of the County of Stirling, thereto subscribing, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth,

That a Bill for disjoining the Counties of Stirling and Linlithgow, relative to the Turnpike Roads, and for maintaining and repairing the Roads in the said County of Stirling, and for imposing additional Tolls, and Loll upon Coal, to be levied within the said County, has been presented to the House; and that the Petitioners can demonstrate that the present Turnpike Funds are adequate to keep the Roads in Repair, and pay any Debts affecting the same, and they apprehend no additional Toll is necessary; and that the said' Bill contains several -other Clauses injurious to the Petitioners, and to the Public at large: And therefore praying to be heard by Counsel against such Clauses of the said Bill as are prejudicial to the Interests of the Petitioners and the Public at large.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill to continue the Term, and alter the Powers, of so much of Two Acts, made in the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Years of the Reign of his late Majesty, for repairing several Roads, in the Counties of Linlithgow and Stirling, as relates to the Roads lying within the County of and

A Petition of the Company of Proprietors of the Stourbridge Canal Navigation, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That in pursuance of an Act, made in the Sixteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, the Petitioners have made and completed a Navigable Canal from the Town of Stourbridge, with Two Collateral Cuts from the Coal Mines in the Neighbourhood thereof, to join the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Stourton, in the County of Stafford, and have therein expended upwards of 50,000 /. and the said Canal of the Petitioners also unites with the Dudley Canal, and by Means of the Extension of the said Dudley Cana], which is now executing, and nearly completed, a Communication will be opened between the said Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, and the _B-mingham Canal at Tipton, and a complete Canal Navigation will be thereby made between the Town of Birmingham And the River Secern, Fifteen Mile9 nearer than the present Canal by; and that

the great Object of the Petitioners, in making the said Canal, was to supply the City of Worcester, mid g other

Petition from the Proprietors of the Stourbridge Navigation against the Birmingham and Worces-terCanalBilL

other Towns and Places on the River Severn, with Coals, from the very extensive and valuable Mines lying upon, or near to, the Line of such Canal, and which Object has been. effected with great Benefit to the Public; and that the Petitioners observe, by the Votes, that a Petition hath been presented to the House, for Leave to bring in a Bill to make a Navigable Canal, from or near the Town of Birmingham, to the River Secern, at Diglis, near to the City of Worcester, which, if carried into Effect, will be attended with very injurious Consequences to the Petitioners said Canal, without affording, as they apprehend, a Prospect of any real public Utility: And therefore praying to be heard, by Counsel, against the said Bill, and that the same may not pass into a Law.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the Bill for making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of Birmingham, in the County of Warwick, to communicate' with the River Secern, near to the City of Worcester, be read a Second Time; and that the Petitioners be then heard, by their Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition.

Ordered, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for amending and enlarging the Powers of, and rendering more effectual, an Act, made in the Twenty-eighth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An uAct for pulling down the Church of Saint James, at “ Clerkenwell, in the County of Middlesex, and for “ building a new Church, and making a new Church “ Yard or Cemetery, in the said Parish, with convenient Avenues and Passages thereto:” And that Mr. Mainwaring and Mr. Jerooise, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

an Extent of Eight Miles and a Half, and that a Toll of Six Pence will be charged on all Carts carrying Lime for Manure and other Uses, together with Dung, at a Gate to be set up at Prendegast, or some Place adjacent; and the Petitioners beg Leave to represent the very great Hardships which the Said Bill, if it should pass into a Law, will bring on them and their Posterity, by reason that the Road, leading from the Town of Haverfordwest to their respective Dwellings and Farms, branches out of the Cardigan Road at a Place called Rosswell, near Stephen's Ford, at the Distance of One Mile and a Quarter only from the Town of Haverfordwest, which they conceive to be a very trifling Consideration for a Toll of Six Pence for each Cart employed by them in Carriage of Manure and Fuel, although the Money to be collected from them at the intended Gate will amount to Three Times more than that of the Road leading from Rosswell, near Stephens Ford, towards Cardigan, for it' is notorious that the Number of Carts is in the Proportion of Three to One greater than on the Cardigan Road, which is the Thoroughfare of Six Parishes only, but that of the Petitioners the constant Thoroughfare of Twenty-four Parishes: And therefore praying, That the House will amend so much of the said Bill as may tend to subject the Petitioners to any Toll whatever, for passing from the Town of Haverfordwest, to a Place called Rosswell,. near Stephen's Ford, where the Cardigan Road branches off to the Left at Rosswell, from that frequented by the Petitioners, or add a Clause to compel the Trustees of the projected Turnpike towards Cardigan to make a Road of equal Length, leading from the Entrance of Rosswell Eastern Lane, by the Rath, Cross

Inn, and over Knockhill, to and New

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, your Committee find, That by a private Act of Parliament produced to your Committee, made in the Seventh Year of the Reign of King James the First, intituled,

“ An Act for the assuringe and establishinge of the “ Isle of Manne,” after reciting, or taking Notice, that William, then Earl of Derby, and his Ancestors, had, ever since the Seventh Year of the Reign of King Henry the Fourth, held and enjoyed the Isle of Mann as their proper Inheritance, it was enacted, that the said William Earl of Derby, and the Lady Elizabeth his Wife, during their Lives, and the longer liver of them; and after their Deaths James Lord Stanley, Son add Heir Apparent of the said Earl, and the Heirs Male of his Body, lawfully begotten, and to be begotten; and after his Death without such Issue, Robert Stanley,

Second Son of the said Earl, and the Heirs Male of his Body, lawfully begotten, and to be begotten; and after his Death without such Issue, the Heirs Male of the Body of the said William Earl of Derby, lawfully begotten, and to be begotten; and for Default of such Issue, the right Heirs of the said James Lord Stanley should and might for ever thereafter have, hold, and quietly enjoy the said Isle, against the said King James, his Heirs and Successors, and against the several Persons in the said Act particularly named, being the Widow and the Three Daughters and Co-heiresses of Ferdinando late Earl of Derby, deceased, their Husbands and Heirs; and that neither the said James Lord Stanley, nor any the Heirs Male of his Body, lawfully begotten, or to be begotten, nor the said Robert Stanley, nor any the Heirs Male of his Body; lawfully begotten, or to be begotten, nor any the Heirs Male of the Body of the said William Earl of Derby, lawfully begotten, or to be begotten, should have any Power, Authority, or Liberty to give, grant, alien, bargain, sell, convey, assure, or do away the said Isle, or any Part thereof, from his or their Issue or Issues, or other Persons by the said Act appointed to enjoy the same; but that the same should remain and continue to the said James Lord Stanley, and the Heirs Male of his Body, lawfully begotten, and to be begotten; and for Default of such Issue, to the said Robert Stanley, and the Heirs Male of his Body, lawfully begotten, and to be begotten; and for Default of such Issue, to the Heirs Male of the Body of the said William Earl of Derby, lawfully begotten, and to be begotten; and for Default of such Issue, to the right Heirs of the said James Lord ,

Duke of Atholl’s Petition*

278 16o Mart'ri. A. 1790.

made, to the contrary, should be utterly- Void, frustrate, and of none Effect.

And to prove that on the Failure of Heirs Male of the said William Earl of Derby, James Lord Stanley, and Robert Stanley, the said Isle, on the Death of James late Earl of Derby, in the Year 1735, descended, under the said Parliamentary Entail, to the most Noble James Duke of as right Heir of

the said James Lord Stanley, and that on his Decease, in 1764, the Succession thereof devolved on John Duke of Atholl, and Charlotte Dutchess of Atholl and Baroness Strange, his Wife, Daughter and only surviving Child and Heir at Iaw of the said James Duke of Atholl, an Act of Parliament of the Fifth Year of His present Majesty was produced to your Committee, intituled, “ An Act for carrying into “ Execution a Contract made pursuant' to the Act “ of Parliament of the Twelfth Year of his late Majesty King George the First, between the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury and the Duke “ and Dutchess of Atholl, the Proprietors of the Isle “ of Mann, and their Trustees, for the Purchase of “ the said Island and its' Dependencies, under certain Exceptions therein particularly mentioned,” wherein those several Facts last-mentioned are stated or recited.

And Mr. George Stuart informed your Committee, That the said John late Duke of Atholl departed this Life in the Year 1774, leaving the said Charlotte Dutchess of Atholl, his Wife, and the said present Duke of Atholl, his eldest Son and Heir at Law, him surviving; and that by virtue of a Deed of Restriction, bearing Date the 30th Day of December 1774, duly executed by the said Dutchess, for the Reasons therein recited the said now Duke of Atholl became entitled to the immediate Possession of the said Isle, and hath continued in the Possession thereof; a Copy of which said Deed, taken from the Records of the Court of Session in Scotland, and proved to be a true Copy thereof by the said George Stuart, who compared the same, was also produced to your Committee.

In further Proof of the Allegations of the said Petition, Three several Reports made to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury; namely, a Report of the Commissioners of the Customs in England, of the 4th of January 1765; a Report of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise in Scotland, of the 24th of 1764; and a Report of the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, of the 20th of October 1764, were produced to your Committee, by which it appears that great Frauds and Abuses had been practised by the running of Goods from the Isle of Mann into the Two Kingdoms, highly injurious to the Revenues thereof, the Loss thereby sustained in the Revenue of Great Britain alone being stated, in the Report of the said Commissioners of Customs and Excise for Scotland, to amount by Computation, to 350,000l. or nearly that Sum, Annually: And, in further Proof.of the Existence of the said Mischiefs, His Majesty’s Orders and Proclamations in Council, of the 17th of August 1764, were produced to your Committee, whereby it was ordered, that the Commissioners of the Admiralty should station a sufficient Number of Ships and Cutters in the Harbours and Coasts of the Isle of Mam, in order to the putting a Stop thereto: And your Committee find. That by virtue of certain special Clauses contained in an Act of the Twelfth Year of King George the First, whereby the Commissioners of the Treasury were authorized to treat for the Purchase of the said Isle of Mam on the Behalf of the Crown, the said Commissioners, by their Letter of the 25th of July 1764, had made Overtures to the late Duke of Atholl for the Purchase thereof, or of such Part thereof as it should be found expedient to vest in the Crown for preventing the 01

pernicious Effects of the illicit Trade then carried oil between the said Island and the other Parts of His Majesty’s Dominions; but to which no Answer appears to have been returned by the said Duke, until the 20th of August, a few Days after issuing the said Proclamations.

The said Letter of the 26th of July, with the Duke’s Answer thereto, and the Reply of the Commissioners of the Treasury of the 12th of September following (being, as your Committee is informed, the Whole of the Correspondence on that Occasion) appearing to contain Matter deserving Attention, Your Committee have annexed a Copy thereof to their Report.

In further Support of the Allegations of the said Petition, the several Proceedings entered in the Journal of the House of the nth, 12th, 14th, 17th, and 21st of January 1765, touching the aforesaid illicit Practices, were read to your Committee from the Entries of the Journals; as was likewise the aforesaid Act, passed in the same Year, for re-vesting the said Isle of Mann in the Crown, reserving to the said late Duke and the Dutchess of Atholl, and their Heirs, their Manerial Rights and Landed Property, in the Manner stated and set forth in the said Petition; and also a Grant under the Great Seal of Ireland, dated the 2 2d Day of August, in the Fifth Year of His Majesty’s Reign, whereby, after taking Notice of the said Act of Re-vestment, and that His Majesty, having taken into His Royal Consideration the particular Situation of the Duke and Dutchess of Atholl from Rent Charges and Annuities upon their other Estates, in Consequence of Settlements made by the ldte Duke of Atholl, from the Prospect that the Revenues of the Isle of Mann would have continued to them, and on that Account that His Majesty was graciously disposed to give them a Mark of His Royal Munificence and Bounty; and His Majesty, being sensible that the Revenues and Commerce of the Kingdom of Ireland, as well as those of Great Britain, would receive great Benefit and Improvement by the said Surrender, His Majesty was graciously pleased to grant to the said Duke and Dutchess, for their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of them, an Annuity or Yearly Allowance of 2,000l. to be issuing out of His Majesty’s Revenues at large in the said Kingdom of Ireland, in the Manner stated in the said Petition.

To shew that the said re-vesting Act was made under the Pressure of the Moment, when the Urgency of the Mischief called for an immediate and effectual Remedy, and when, from the recent Possession of th6 Petitioner’s Father and Mother, they could form no accurate Idea of the Extent or Value of the Rights and Interests which were necessary to be ceded, and that the Act was passed without any Evidence produced to prove what Rights of Property in particular were necessary to be vested in the Crown for the Security of the public Revenue (the sole Object of that Act) from future Frauds and Evasions, it was observed to your Committee, on the Part of the Petitioner, That the aforesaid Proclamations of Council were, at the-Time of making the Contract of March 1765, for the Surrender of the Island, in full Force and Effect, and that the Bill (which with some Amendments was afterwards passed into a Law) “ for K the more effectual preventing the Mischiefs arising “ to the Revenue and Commerce of Great Britain “ and Ireland, from the illicit and clandestine Trade u to and from the Isle of Mann," was then depending in the House; and that, although the Duke and Dutchess of Atholl had been heard by their Counsel at the Bar, on the 19th of February, in Support of their Petition, complaining, “ That if the said- Bill should

“ pass into a Law, they apprehended all the valuable “ Rights, Privileges, and Advantages, granted to “ their Ancestors under the Sanction of the Legislative Authority, so long exereised and enjoyed by “ them to the Extent of their Grant, and lately* “ recognized by Parliament, would be wrested and “ torn from them without any Provision made for “ that Recoin pence and Compensation which the “ Legislature, upon a former Hearing of the Paten- tee’s Right, seemed to consider as a Debt to be “ paid by the Public for the great consequential “ Advantages which would result to the Community “ from a Resumption, expedient perhaps to the State, ct but injurious and detrimental to the Proprietor Nevertheless the House proceeded to the P-eading the said Bill a Second Time, and on the same Day resolved that the Bill should be committed to a Committee of the whole House; and further resolved, that the House would, upon that Day Sevennight, being the 28th of February then Instant, resolve itself into a Committee upon the said Bill, in Proof whereof the said Petition, and the Resolutions thereon, were read to your Committee, from the Entries on the Journals; and in further Evidence of the said Allegations, a Letter from the said Duke and Dutchess of Atholl, addressed to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, of the 27th of February aforesaid, was produced and read to your Committee, whereby the said Duke and Dutchess did declare their Readiness, if it should be deemed necessary for the public Service, to part with all their Rights in the said Isle; as likewise the Evidence of Mr. Hammer sly, taken at the Bar of the House, on the 18th of May 1781, and of Sir Fletcher Norton, a Member of the House, given in his Place on the same Day, tending to prove (amongst other Things) that the Contract was considered, by the Duke and Dutchess of Atholl, as an involuntary or compulsory Act on their Parts, and that if the Duke was at Liberty, he would not take double the Consideration which had been proposed; and that it Was understood by the Duke, that an Application would be made to Parliament in the next Session to explain and set to Rights any Errors or Improprieties that might have escaped in the said re-vesting Act; and that the Committee on the said other Bill stood suspended only for a Week, to give an Opportunity for re-commencing the Negotiation with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for the Surrender of the Island, and within which Time it appears, by the Preamble of the said re-vesting Act, to have been accordingly concluded.

To prove the Annual Produce of the several Species of Revenue arising to the Crown within the said Island, consisting of Customs, Harbour Fund, and Herring and Salmon Fisheries, Two Accounts thereof, purporting to be the Accounts of George Watts, Receiver General of the said Island, have been produced to your Committee; by the One of which it appears that the Produce of the Revenue of Customs of the said Isle, from the Re-vestment in 1765 to the 10th of October 1789, amounts to the Sum of 70,145 /. 3 s.id.; and that by the other . of the said Accounts, that the Net Produce of Harbour Duties on Shipping and Goods, and Herring and Bay Fisheries, from the 5th of July 1771 to the 5th of July 1789, have amounted to the Sum of 7,024/. 16$. 5 which said Two Accounts your Committee have thought fit to annex to their Report, for the Information of the House.

With respect to the Complaint made by the said Petition, that in the Hurry of the Transaction of 1765, arising from the Urgency already stated, the Titles of the Petitioner’s Family appear not to have been perfectly understood, insomuch that Words of Voi. 4 5.

gveat legal Import, contained in the Act of the Se- Duke of venth or King James the First, “ for the Settlement £tho!1 “ and Entail of the said Island unalienably,’’ were icUUt>n‘ omitted to be inserted in the Preamble of the said Bill of 1765, and which, as the Petitioner is advised, militate against the Power of James Duke of Atholl to new model the Succession by the Deed of Trust of 1756, recited in the said Preamble, but to the Uses of which Settlement the said 70,000 /. hath been actually applied by the Trustees thereof, under the Sanction given to the new Entail by that Agreement made between the Crown and the said Trustees, and utider the Power given to the Trustees of the same Entail, by the Provisions of the said Act, for vesting Mann in the Crown: Your Committee, on comparing the Recitals of the said Act of Settlement, contained in the said Preamble, with the said Act, have found that some Inaccuracies have crept into the said Recital, and in particular, that neither the Date nor the Title of the said Act are correctly stated in the said Preamble, and that some Part of the Clause contained in the said Act, whereby any Acts or Deeds for alienating the said Isle are nullified, are omitted to be inserted in that Part of the Preamble which recites the said nullifying Clause; but whether the said Inaccuracies in the Recital of the Date and Title of the said Act, or the said Omissions, are of great legal Import, or militate with the Powers of the said James Duke of Atholl to new model the Succession to the said Isle, your Committee submit to the Judgment of the House; and for their better Information (the said Act of Succession being a private One, and not a printed Statute) your Committee have annexed an authenticated Copy thereof to their Report

Copy of a Letter, dated 25th July 1764, from the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to the Duke of Athol, in relation to the Purchase of the Isle of Man.

My Lord,

We think proper to inform your Grace, That id pursuance of the Powers vested in us by the Twelfth of George the First, we are willing to treat with you for the Purchase of the Isle of Man, or of such Part of the Rights claimed by your Grace in the said Island as it shall be found expedient to vest in the Crown, for preventing that pernicious and illicit Trade which is at present carried on between the said Island and the other Parts of His Majesty’s Dominions, in Violation of the Laws, and to the great Diminution and Detriment of the Revenues of this Kingdom.

The House of Commons, during the last Session of Parliament, thought fit to esquire whether any, and what Steps, had been taken for this Purpose; and we have Reason to think it is expected of us that we should pursue every legal Method for the Prevention of this Evil; with, this View we have judged it necessary, First, to inform ourselves of the present extent of this illegal Commerce, of the Nature of those Rights, under Colour of which it is carried on, and of the Laws of this Country with respect to them: We are now ready to treat with your Grace, pursuant to the said Act of Parliament, and to receive from you a Proposal for that Purpose, specifying what Part of your Property and Rights in the said Island you are disposed to sell, and the Value you put upon them, that we may know whether the Terms are in all Respects such as we, who are Trustees .-for the Public, can admit; but if your Grace is qotjSfeclined to enter into a Treaty with us upon the Subject, we beg to be informed of it, that we may ifiien pursue

Copy of a Letter, dated 20th August 1764, from the Duke of Athol to the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, in relation to the Sale of the Isle of Man.

Athol H,20th August 1764.

My Lords,

I have received the Honour of your Lordships Letter of the 25th of July, informing me, that, in pursuance of the Act of the Twelfth of King George the First, you are willing to treat with me for the Purchase of the Isle of Man.

I am very sdiry to hear there has been so many Complaints of Smuggling from thence, which is a Practice I give no Maaner of Encouragement to, iny Revenues arising from a fair Duty, collected upon the Importation of Goods.

I have the same Ideas with regard to the Sale of the Island that the late Duke of Athol had, who always declared, that no Temptation of Gain could induce him to give up so ancient, so honourable, and so noble a Birth Right, such as no. Subject of the Crown of England now has, or ever had, which has been in our Family near Four Centuries; and that he thought nothing could be an Equivalent to One of his Rank and Circumstances for so great a Patrimony: At the same Time his Duty and Attachment to the King was such, that if it was esteemed, upon a full Consideration, an important Point for His Majesty’s Service, and for the Good of the Public, he in that Event was willing to enter into a Treaty for the Disposal of it; — and these are the only Reasons that can induce me to do the same.

The Purchase of the Isle of Man has been frequently thought of by former Administrations; but upon balancing the Advantages and Disadvantages which might arise to Government, they did not think proper to treat conclusively upon it. Sir Robert Walpole made some Proposals to the late Duke, but afterwards dropt them. Mr. Pelham once seemed very desirous to bring the Sale to a Conclusion; and the Duke of Athol gave him a true and precise State of the Nature and Revenue of this Principality, that he might be able to judge what Proposal to make; and he assured the Duke, that no Proposal should come from him which he would not adjudge, if it was left to him to settle as an Arbitrator: However the Affair, after being some Months in Agitation, was again dropt. It was resumed by the Duke of Newcastle, when he was First Lord of the Treasury; and the Duke of Athol treated with the same Confidence, being averse to sell, but always ready to submit to the King's Pleasure in any Matter which he thought for the Public Good; and having a full Reliance in the Duke of Newcastle's Honour and Justice, that as his Brother had said, so his Grace would propose no Terms which he would not award as an Arbitrator: After the Duke of Newcastle was informed, the Matter was likewise in the same Manner laid aside.

The Reason why neither Sir Robert Walpole, Mr. Pelham, nos the Duke of Newcarried it further,

was thought to be, that upon thorough Examination the Object did not appear to them of such Consequence, as it did at first; for, supposing it was in the Possession of the Government, the Proximity must still be the same; between Thirty and Forty thousand Inhabitats must still have a Right to their Constitution, Laws, Administration of Justice, and interior Trade and Commerce; and it would be in the Case of Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, and Alderney, where Imports and Exports are governed By their own Laws, as much as if they were under Feudatory Lords; and from these Islands they found that Smuggling was carried to a much greater Excess than from the Isle of Man (and I am credibly informed that is still the Case) I have heard that they have often thought in Ireland of raising a large Sum. to offer towards the Consideration, and upon fuller Consideration dropt it.

As I have been but a few Months in Possession of the Isle of Man, and never in the least turned my Thoughts towards a Sale of it, it is impossible for me, uninformed as I am at present, to fix upon what I should think an adequate Price for a Possession so very considerable both for Honour and Profit; and as I never heard of any Notion to purchase a Part only, I don’t at all understand what it is. I can therefore at present have no Proposal to make, but will always be ready to receive, with Respect, any Proposal which shall come to me from your Lordships,

I am,

My Lords,

Your Lordships most obedient and most humble Servant,

Athol.

Copy of a Letter, dated 12th of September 1764* from the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to the Duke of Athol, in relation to the Purchase of the Isle of Man.

My Lord,

We have received your Grace’s Letter of the 20th of August, in Answer to that we wrote to you on the 25th of July, in which we informed your Grace, that in pursuance of the Powers vested in us by 12th George i”; we were willing to treat with you for the Purchase of the Isle of Man, and to receive from you a Proposal for that Purpose. Your Grace acquaints us, that, uninformed as you are at present, from the short Possession you have had of this Island, it is impossible for you to fix upon what you should think an adequate Price for it; that you cannot therefore at present make any Proposal, but that you shall always be ready to receive such as shall come to you from us.

Your Grace must be sensible, that this Objection, which you alledge against making a Proposal on your Part must operate much more strongly to prevent our making any to you; and that we, who have not even an Opportunity of informing ourselves of the Value of this Possession, cannot possibly fix upon a Price, which, as Trustees to the Public* we should think ourselves authorized to propose; but as your Grace informs us, that when the Purchase of this Island was on former Occasions under Consideration, the late Duke of Athol gave to Mr. Pelham, and the Duke of N,a true and precise State of the Nature of this Possession, and of the Revenue arising firom it, we think it proper to desire, that, if your Grace now intends to treat with us, you would in like Manner transmit to us an exact and accurate Rental of the said Revenue,

specifying

30 Geo. III.

.16° Martii.

specifying the several Kinds of which it consists, the Annual Amount of each, and, with respect to any Customs or Impost Duties which you may receive, the several Species of Goods on which they are levied, the Rates at which they are paid, and the Annual Amount of the Duties arising from each Species respectively. We must know the Nature as well as Value of every Branch of the Revenue of this Island before we can form any Judgment of the Price which ought to be paid for it, or can determine what Part of your Grace’s Possessions in this Island it will be necessary or expedient to purchase, in order to obtain the Benefit for which such Purchase is intended; and this is what we meant by the Proposal we made in our former Letter, of purchasing only a Part of your Grace’s Property and Rights in the said Island.

As it is highly probable that Parliament will expect to be informed in the ensuing Session what Measures have been taken for carrying their Intentions into Execution, and what has passed upon the Subject, we are the more desirous to obtain from your Grace the Information above-mentioned in the most full and accurate Manner, that the Parliament may thereby be enabled to judge what Terms it may be proper to allow; they will then take under their Consideration the Objections mentioned by your Grace, arising from the Proximity of that Island, and from its present Constitution, Laws, and Administration of Justice, as well as its interior Trade and Commerce; and as they have frequently made Laws respecting this Island, they will enact such other Laws, and make such further Provisions for preventing the illicit Trade carried on by Means thereof, as in their Wisdom and Justice they shall think proper.

Duke of Athol.

Copy of a Letter from the Duke and Dutchess of Athol, to the Commissioners of the Treasury; dated February the 27th, 1765.

London, February 27th, 1765.

My Lords,

We have already communicated to your Lordships, and by our Petition humbly laid before Parliament, our Desire to accommodate the Public, at the Expence of our private Feelings, with any Part of our Hereditary Rights in the Isle of Man, which it may be expedient to vest in the Crown for the Public Service. Your Lordships, by your Letter of the 25th of July 1764, invited us to make Proposals, and by your Letter of the 12th September following, desired us to produce such an Account of the Nature and Amount of our Revenues, as might enable you to determine what Part of our Rights and Possessions it would be expedient to purchase, and to form a Judgment of the Price which ought to be paid for them.

This has led us into a particular Consideration of Duke of these Objects; and we are now enabled to make Proposals, and to afford your Lordships the Information you desired. The inclosed Account will shew your Lordships the Nature of our Revenues arising from our Rights and Possessions in the Isle of Man, and the Amount of them. We are ready, if it should be deemed necessary for the Public Service, to part with all our Rights, held under the several Grants of the Isle of Man; but we apprehend that the Reservation of our Landed Revenue, together with the Patronage of the Bishoprick, and other Ecclesiastical Benefices in the Island, cannot interfere with the Interest of the Public: And we presume your Lordships will not have any Objection to our preserving the honourable Distinction and Service which our Ancestors have so long enjoyed, and by which they held their Rights in this Island, of presenting the Two Falcons at the Coronation.

The Legislature have formerly authorized Us to hope, and your Lordships have called upon us to propose a proper Compensation: We feel the Weight of this additional Difficulty, which may expose us to the Imputation of making an unreasonable Demand on the one Hand, and of not doing sufficient Justice to our Family on the other; but the Circumstances of the Case make it necessary, and therefore, without entering into any Discussion of the various Articles of which our Rights consist, we hope neither His Majesty nor the Parliament will think the clear Sum of 70,000l. too great a Price to be paid us in full Compensation for the absolute Surrender of the Isle, Castle, and Peele of Man, and all Rights, Jurisdictions, and Interests in or over the said Island, and all its Dependencies, holden under the several Grants thereof, or under any other Title whatsoever, reserving only our Landed Property, with all our Rights in and over the Soil, as Lords of the Manor, with all Courts Baron, Rents, Services, and other Incidents to such Courts belonging, our Wastes, Commons, and other Lands, Inland Waters, Fisheries, and Mills, and all Mines, Minerals, and Quarries, according to our present Rights therein, Felons Goods, Deodands, Waifs, Estrays, and Wrecks at. Sea; together with the Patronage of the Bishoprick, and of the other Ecclesiastical Benefices in the said Island, to which we are now entitled, to be holden of the Crown by the honourable Service above-mentioned.

But we presume to hope that our particular Situation arising from Rent Charges and Annuities upon our other Estates, in consequence of Settlements made by the late Duke of Athol, from a Prospect that the Revenues of the Isle of Man would continue to us, will, through your Lordships favourable Mediation, recommend us to His Majesty for such Mark of His Royal Munificenae, as from the Consideration of the Case shall appear to His Majesty to be reasonable.

We are,

Your Lordships

Most obedient Servants,

Athol.

Edinburgh A Petition of certain Persons in the City of

agatngTthe burgh thereunto subscribing, Manufacturers of, and

Tobacco Act. Dealers in Snuff and Tobacco, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners have no Reason to dispute that the Act for repealing the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting

new Duties in lieu thereof, like all others, was wisely intended for beneficial Purposes, but, if those Purposes come short of their original Intention, there must be an Error in the System, which ought to be rectified, and there can be none so materially interested in that Rectification as those who immediately feel the Hardships of the Statute; and that although the Petitioners wish at all Times not only to contribute towards the Exigencies of the State, but chearfully to comply with every Law made in that Behalf, yet the one already mentioned, and of which they now complain, is dark, inexplicable, and totally subversive of the Ends for which it was enacted, and while the Petitioners are endeavouring to obtain a Knowledge of the Law for the Regulation of their Conduct, and which after unremitted Application they have not been able to acquire, they are at all Times exposed to severe Penalties, which the utmost Circumspection upon their Part cannot avoid; and that, besides those Statutory Hardships, and probably ultimate Ruin, to which the fair Manufacturers and Dealers are exposed, they are otherwise oppressed, owing to a large Quantity of manufactured Snuff and Tobacco being already smuggled into the Country, which, so far from meeting with any proper Check, is every Day increasing to a pernicious Height, and by which the Interests of many honest and industrious Families will be totally destroyed: Such Circumstances are not Matter of private Complaint, they have been universally felt and universally reprobated, insomuch that an Application is to be made for a Repeal of the Act in Question, so far as it imposes an Excise Duty upon Tobacco and Snuff, at least for a Reduction of the Duties to a certain Amount, which Application merits the Approbation of the Petitioners, and meets with their hearty Concurrence, but, situated as they are, they can do nothing more to promote the End, than request that the House will use their best Endeavours to procure such new Enactment as may be judged beneficial for the State, and less oppressive to the Subjects: That previous to the American War, the Duty upon each Pound of Tobacco was about Five Pence, and it must be admitted, that, at that Period, none was smuggled into the Country: How soon the Duty was increased under the Customs, smuggling of Leaf Tobacco became common, and now when the Legislature, in order to remedy that Abuse, has put the Duties under the Management of Excise, the Smuggling Adventurer is, with equal Success, bringing in manufactured Tobacco and Snuff; and the Petitioners submit that a Reduction of the Duties to Nine Pence per Pound would go far to defeat those pernicious Practices, for the Object of Gain, which influences the illicit Trader, being thereby made disproportionate to his Risque, few or none would embark in such Adventures, and by this too the Duties would be rendered more effectual and permanent, and fair Traders put on a Footing to combat the sinister Practices of the Defrauders of the Revenue; and it is a Fact, that when the Duties were increased above the original Standard of about Five , Pence per Pound, Two-thirds of the Tobacco consumed in this Country was smuggled: If the Petitioners are right in this Proposition, and which they could undertake to prove, it follows as a necessary Consequence, that Government profited as much from

the original Duties when no Tobacco was smuggled, as under the higher Duties which give Encouragement to Smuggling, and there can be little Doubt that, were they reduced to the Medium pointed at by the Petitioners, it would produce a certain Saving of Four Pence per Pound: These are the Sentiments of, and the only Observations which the Petitioners will make upon, the Subject, being fully convinced that, when the Law is recognized, it will be found to stand truly in Need of Alteration and Amendment: And therefore praying the House to consider the Premises, and to give the Petitioners such Relief as may be thought proper or expedient.

Ordered, That the said Petition he referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to whom it is referred to consider of the several Petitions which have been presented to this House in this Session of Parliament, praying that the Act, passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act for “ repealing the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and “ for granting new Duties in Lieu thereof,” may be repealed or altered.

up to the Top of Ditchling Bost Hills, in the said County of Sussex, was read the Third Time.

Resolved, That the Bill do pass: And that the Title be, An Act for continuing the Term, and enlarging, altering, and amending the Powers', of an Act, made in the Tenth Year of His present Majesty, for repairing, widening, and keeping in Repair, the Road from New Chappell, in the County of Surrey, over Copthorn, in the County of Sussex, through Lindfield, to the Town of Ditchling, up to the Top of Ditchling Bost in

Ordei'ed, That Mr. Thomas Pelham do carry the Bill to the Lords, and desire their Concurrence.

A Petition of the Merchants, Owners of Ships, and Petition from others concerned in Maritime Commerce, residing in Plymouth re-the Town of Plymouth, was presented to th6 House, ®Pec‘intS !he and read; Setting forth. That, by several Acts for the 0f°Ships. '°n Suppression of Smuggling, not only the Vessels and Goods of the fraudulent Trader, but those of the fair and honest Merchant, are liable to Seizure and Confiscation, and, if those Acts make any Distinction between them, the Petitioners beg Leave to suggest, such Distinction appears to be in Favour of the Smuggler. The Act of the Twenty-fourth of His present Majesty, which seems to apply principally to Vessels hovering on the Coast, and as such indisputably Smugglers, and Objects of exemplary Punishment, has a Clause, enabling the Owner or Master, as well as those of the fair and open Trader, by giving Evidence of the Smallness of the Quantity of Goods found on Board, and other extenuating Circumstances, to assert his Innocence, and preserve his Vessel from Forfeiture; whilst the Act of the Twenty-second of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for the “ further securing the Property of the Owners in such “ Ships or Vessels as are liable to Forfeiture for iraporting Spirits, or other Goods, by the Misconduct “ of the Master, Mate, and Seamen,” and which admits the Hardship that Ship Owners labour under, and the Reasonableness of their being secured in their Property, does nothing more than give to the innocent Owners Penalties from the guilty Seamen, which the Owners find impossible to recover, from the Hazard and Difficulty a Prosecution of that Sort would involve them in; and the 59th Section of the

Act

Bill te prevent Delay iu Electious presented.

Act of the Twenty-sixth of His present Majesty enacts, “ That every Ship, importing any Foreign “ Spirituous Liquors, British Plantation Rum and “ Arrack excepted, in any Cask containing less than “ One hundred Gallons, except Two Gallons for each “ Seaman, with all her Stores and Furniture, be the “ Burthen or Value thereof what they may, shall be “ forfeited, without any Limitation or Qualification “whatsoeverand that, in consequence of those Acts, the Ship Hope, belonging to the Port of Plymouth, was seized in the River Thames, condemned and sold, owing to a fraudulent Act of the Master, in his Voyage from Hamburgh to London, with which the Owners were actually unacquainted, as appeared to the entire Satisfaction of the Commissioners of the Customs, and to the Judge who tried the Cause, by which the Owners, Men of large Families, were nearly ruined, their Loss amounting to 3,000 /., and upwards; and a large Swedish Ship called The Aurora, was also seized in the said Port, for a trifling Act of Smuggling of the Master, and the Owner in Sweden, by the Loss of his Ship and the heavy Expences attending his Endeavours to recover the same, was reduced to Poverty; and that, although Ships are not always prosecuted to Condemnation, yet the Owner is liable, from the Tenor of those Acts, to great Injury, by Delays and Expences in compounding with the Seizing Officer, &c. without having it in his Power to obtain Satisfaction from the Aggressors, Seamen in general being Men of no Property, and the Petitioners believe, that the Dread of falling under the Penalties inflicted by the aforesaid Acts hath prevented many Men of Fortune from being concerned in Shipping: And therefore praying the House to take the late Acts made for the Suppression of Smuggling into further Consideration, and fix the Punishment on the Persons actually guilty of the Fraud, in such Manner as to the House shall appear best.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.

Petition from \ Petition of the several Persons whose Names are Estate* of thereunto subscribed, being Owners or Occupiers of against the Lands or Estates through or near which a Canal Na-liirmingham vigation is intended to be made from or near the

ttrCanomlu *^own Birmingham, to communicate with the River *r an , Severn,at or near Worcester, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the said intended Canal, if made, will totally destroy a large Quantity of valuable Land, and otherwise materially injure the Estates and Property through or near which the same will pass; and that a Canal Navigation from the Town of Birmingham, into the River Secern, hath been already made at a great Expence, and another is now also making to the said River, and nearly completed, by Means of the Junction of the Dudley and Birmingham Canals, which will be fully sufficient to answer every necessary and useful Purpose of Water Conveyance from the Town of Birmingham into such River; and that the Petitioners conceive the said intended Canal is calculated to answer the private Views of the Schemers thereof, without a Probability of affording to the Public any Advantage adequate to the great Injury which the Petitioners, and others, will unavoidably sustain thereby; and the Petitioners, sensible of the great Injury they must sustain in their Estates and Property, if the Scheme of making such intended Canal should be carried into Execution, do hereby declare their total Dissent thereto: And therefore praying, That the Bill for making such intended Canal may not pass into a Law, and that they may be heard, by themselves, their Agents, or Counsel, against the same.

Expiring Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, Law. That an Act, made in the Twelfth Year of the Regin

of His present Majesty, intituled, “ An Act for encouraging the Manufacture of Leather, by lowering the Duty payable upon the Importation of Oak “ Bark, when the Price of such Bark shall exceed a “ certain Rate, for a limited Time,” which was to continue in Force for Five Years, and from thence to the End of the then next Session of Parliament, which Act was by another Act, made in the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, continued for the further Term of Five Years,* and from thence to the End of the then next Session of Parliament, and which Act, by another Act made in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, was revived and continued for the further Term of Five Years, and from thence to the End of the then next Session of Parliament, is near expiring, and fit to be continued.

Isle of Ely, Huntingdon, and Suffolk, on Behalf of themselves, and others; and also the Petition of the several Gentlemen, Clergy, Traders, and other Inhabitants of the Counties of Herts, Essex, Cambridge, Isle of Ely, Huntingdon, and Suffolk, on Behalf of themselves and others,' were severally referred; That the Committee had examined, and found that the Standing Orders of the House, relative to Navigation Bills, had been complied with; and that the Committee had examined the Matters of the said Petitions, and had directed him to report the same, as they appeared to them, to the House; and he read the Report in his Place, and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth, viz.

To prove the Allegations of the said Petitions,

Mr. John Rennie being examined, said, That a Navigation is already completed from the City of London to the Town of Bishop's Stortford, in the County of Herts — That by a Survey lately taken, it appears the same may be extended, by proceeding to a Place called Palmers Water, in the said County, and from thence to the Parish of Elsenham, and through the North Parts of the County of Essex to the Town of Saffron Walden, and from the last-mentioned Place through the Counties of Cambridge and Suffolk, to join the Brandon River, whereby Communication will be opened to the County of Norfolk — That a Branch may be made from such extended Line in the Parishes of Great and Little Abingdon and Baber ham, to communicate with the Town of Cambridge, and another Branch may be made by a Cut to fall into the Burwell Lode, which is already Navigable to the Cambridge River, whereby a convenient Communication will be opened with the Isle of Ely, and the Counties of Huntingdon and Bedford.

The Reverend Abraham Jobson being examined, said, That he lives at March, In the Isle of Ply, which is the Centre of the Fens — That if such Navigation, with the Branches therefrom, are made, it will be productive of great Utility and Benefit to the Inhabitants of the said Counties, and to the Public in general, by rendering the Carriage of Corn, and all Kinds of Merchandize, which pass between the Metropolis and the before-mentioned Counties, and the several Towns and Places therein, cheaper and easier than at present. —

And being asked, Whether his Place of Residence is near the Course of the intended Canal ? he said, That March is situated upon the River Nene, which will communicate with the intended Navigation.

And being asked, How far it is from the intended Canal ? he said, About 20 Miles. — And being asked,

Whether he thought himself a Judge what Effect the Canal would have upon that Part of the Country between Cambridge and Bishop's Stortford? he said. It would have a very good Effect; but is in a great Measure a Stranger to that Part of the Country.

Mr. Charles Wedge being examined, said, That he lives at Gaze ley, in Suffol, and is a Farmer; and confirmed the Evidence of the former Witness, with respect to the Utility and Benefit of the proposed Navigation. — And being asked, What particular Part he spoke to? he said, To the Country about Newmarket. — And being asked, What Distance he lived from the Line of the intended Canal? he said, Four or Five Miles. — And being asked, What particular Utility he thought the intended Navigation would be of in the District of Country he spoke to? he said, It would much reduce the Price of Carriage.

A Petition of several Gentlemen, Freeholders, Merchants, Tradesmen, and other Inhabitants, of Brad-v.

ford, in the West Riding of the County of York, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That several Gentlemen in the Town and Neighbourhood of Bradford, about Forty-five Years ago, for the Benefit of the Inhabitants of the said Town, borrowed a Sum of Money for conveying Water to the said Town from a Coal Drain in Horton, and such Gentlemen being all dead, their Shares have been sold to several Persons, who, the Petitioners apprehend, now wish to make great Advantage to themselves of the Waterworks; and that Part of the Inhabitants of the said Town have, for several Years last, been very badly supplied with Water, and, in order that all the Inhabitants may have equal Benefit, the Petitioners apprehend that several Improvements are necessary to be made in the Works, and that the same ought to be under the Direction of Commissioners, and the Execution of the Act vested in them, with Power to borrow Money for making Improvements, and completing the Works, so as to serve all the Inhabitants, and paying off, to such of the old Proprietors as are dissatisfied with their Security, their Principal Money, and that the Inhabitants ought not to be restrained from bringing other Water to the said Town, and laying Pipes in the Town for such Water, nor should any Person be obliged to pay for the present Water, who does not agree for it; and that the Proprietors give out, that they will apply to Parliament, this present Sessions, for an Act to authorize them to take any Sum, not exceeding 4/. per Annum, for the Water to any Public House, and 1/. i6r. for the Water to any private House, and, if such Act was to pass, the Petitioners apprehend that such Sums would be very oppressive on the Inhabitants of the said Town, instead of being beneficial, according to the original Institution; and that the former Owners of Land in Horton, through which the Water passes to the Town of Bradford (as it was for the Benefit of the Town) permitted the Gentlemen to convey the Water through their Grounds, and the present Waterworks ought to be a Security to the Proprietors for their principal Money and Interest, but such Proprietors ought to be restrained from advancing the Water Rents any higher than will allow 7/. per Centum Interest for their Money, such Rents to be settled by Commissioners fairly and equally upon such Inhabitants as chuse to take it: And therefore praying. That the Execution of the Act may be vested in Commissioners, and such Powers to them given for borrowing Money for the Purposes above, and completing the Works, as to the House shall seem meet, and that the Petitioners may be heard by Counsel, against the present Bill, and may be allowed to examine Witnesses thereupon at the Bar of the House.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee, to whom the Bill for improving and preserving the Works made for supplying the Town of Bradford, in the County of York, and Part of the Township of Horton, in the Parish of Bradford aforesaid, with Water, and for the more easy Recovery of the Rents for the said Water, is committed; and that the Petitioners be heard, by their Counsel, before the said Committee, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That it be an Instruction to the said Committee, That they do admit Counsel to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition.

Then the Residue of the Petition of the House of Keys, the Representatives of the People of the Isle of Mann, was read; Setting forth, That a Bill has been brought into the House in Consequence of a Petition from the most Noble John Duke of , for appointing Commissioners to enquire into the Extent and Value of certain Rights, Revenues, and Possessions in the Isle of Mann, and from the general Terms of the said Bill the Petitioners are apprehensive that some Alteration is intended to be effected thereby in

of the said Duke, as far as it should be thought compatible with the Interests of His Majesty, and the Rights and Liberties of His Subjects; and that Two of the most valuable Sovereign Rights transferred to the Crown, namely, the Herring Custom, and the* Salmon Fisheries in the Bays, have been appropriated by Parliament to the Repair and Support of the Harbours in the said Isle, yet the same, with the Addition of other Funds, is so insufficient lor the Purpose, that the Harbour of Douglass, the principal Harbour in the said Isle, and which is of great Utility to Ships navigating the Irish Channel, has remained, for near Four Years past, in so ruinous a State, as to have occasioned the Wreck of several Boats and Vessels, and the Loss of many Lives, and there is a considerable Debt chargeable upon the Harbour Funds of the said Isle still remaining unpaid; and that the Petitioners submit to the Justice of the House, although the House should now be inclined to add to the very ample and liberal Compensation which has already been made to the Family of the said Duke,

the present Settlement of the Sovereignty of the said that those Rights and Privileges which have been so Isle, and they are therefore greatly surprized that a ^ong granted to the Petitioners, and the Inhabitants Matter of such Magnitude, which might so materially of ,the said Isle> would neither be consistent with the affect the Rights and Interests of near Forty thousand Faith of Parliament, nor the Dignity of the Crown, of His Majesty’s Subjects, Inhabitants of the said Isle, to resume; and that the Inhabitants of the said Isle who have experienced the many happy Effects of the have experienced such Prosperity and Blessings under present Establishment of the Island near Twenty-five die present Settlement of the said Isle, that they trust Years, should have been brought into the House the Ki.ng of Great Britain will continue their only without any previous Notice having been given to Sovereign, and that the Parliament will never

them, that such a Measure would be attempted; and reduce them again to the degraded State of being Sub-that, as no particular Object is specified by the said jects to a Subject: And therefore praying the House Bill, the Petitioners are still unacquainted with the to take the Premises into Consideration, and that they Nature and Extent of the Claims and Wishes of the may be heard» bY Counsel, or by themselves, at the Duke, nor can they form any Conjecture of the Pur- Rar *he House, against the said Bill, and that the poses of the present Bill, except that they apprehend same may not Pass into a Law.

they are similar to those of some ineffectual Bills which some Time past were brought into the House upon the same Subject; that the Reasons assigned in Support of the present Bill are, that the Act, by which the Sovereignty of the said Isle was re-vested in His Majesty, was made on the “ Pressure of the Occasion,” and that “ sufficient Time was not given for enquiring into and ascertaining the Extent of the “ Pre-eminencies and Rights of Property necessary to “ be vested in the Crown, or the Amount in Value “ of those Rights and Revenues which were transferred to the Crown, that, for Want of such Enquiry, “ some Manerial Rights have become the Subject of “ Litigation, and the Income of the Landed Estates, “ and other Species of Property reserved to the Family of the said Duke, has been impaired,” and the Petitioners submit to the House, that it appears, from the Correspondence upon the Subject, printed by Order of the House, that the Contract between the Crown and the Family of the said Duke was entered into after considerable Time and Deliberation; that the Petitioners know of no Litigation in which the Duke or his Family have been involved for the Re-

Ordered, That the said Petition do fie upon the Table, until the said Bill be read a Second Time; and that the Petitioners be then heard, by themselves or Counsel, against the said Bill, upon their Petition, if they think fit.

Ordered, That Counsel be admitted to be heard, at the same Time, in Favour of the said Bill, against the said Petition.

The House being informed that Mr. Deare, from the Office for auditing the Public Accounts, attended at the Door; he was called in; and, at the Bar, presented to the House, pursuant to their Order,

An Account of the Amount of the Balance of the Revenue of the Customs of the Isle of Man, from the 5th of July 1765 to the 10th of October 1784.

Worcester, Gloucester, and Her ford, have been supplied with Coals from the Petitioners Mines in very large Quantities, and in a constant and regular Manner; and that the Petitioners observe, by the Votes, that a Bill is depending in the House, for making a Canal from or near the Town of Birmingham to the River Severn, near to the City of Worcester, which Canal is calculated to give a Preference in the Severn Market to the Mines on the Line of the Birmingham Canal lying nearest to the Town of Birmingham, and will operate greatly to the Injury and Prejudice of the Petitioners, without any real Advantage to the Public:

Prayers.

A PETITION of the Mayor, Aldermen, Citizens, and principal Inhabitants of the City of Gloucester, was presented to the House, and read; Taking Notice of the Bill lor making and maintaining a Navigable Canal from, or from near to, the Town of ,

in the County of Warwick, to communicate with the River Severn, near to the City of Worcester: And praying that the same may pass into a Law.

Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table, until the said Bill be read a Second Time.

A Petition of the Person thereunto subscribing, being the only Manufacturer of Tobacco and Snuff in the City of Gloucester, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by an Act of Parliament passed last Session, intituled, “ An Act for repealing “ the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting “ new Duties in Lieu thereof,” a new System is introduced, whereby the Manufactory is rendered difficult, tedious, expensive, dangerous, unprofitable, and ruinous; difficult, because the Act obliges the Manufacturer to work by a fixed Rule, which, although it may appear easy upon Theoretical Principles falsely founded, never can be practicable on the Article of Tobacco, being in its very Nature fluctuant — It is rendered tedious and expensive by the numberless Weighings, Re-weighings, taking of Stock, Notices, Declarations, and Counter-Declarations, all unnecessary, oppressive, and futile; dangerous, unprofitable, and ruinous, because the Act contains no less than Thirty-two Penalties in the Manufacturing Part, amounting to the enormous Sum of 2,390/., besides Forfeiture of Goods, the greatest Number of which the best of Judges, and the most careful honest Man, cannot avoid: That the Petitioner, notwithstanding he has paid the legal Duties on all his Tobacco, has, nevertheless, under the Operation of the said Act, incurred Penalties in his Manufactory, which no human Foresight could have avoided (without rendering the Goods unfit for Sale) to the Amount of 8,0001, and upwards, and, had it not been for a partial Suspension of the Act, must have been the total Ruin of himself and Family — It is ruinous also, because it defeats its own professed Purpose, for, instead of suppressing Smuggling, it has erected an Asylum for it in One Department, and generated a new and successful Mode in another — It is ruinous also, because it expressly prohibits a Manufacturer from selling nearly One Third of his Stock (Tobacco Stalks) because it says, he'shall not send them to a Port of Importation, which, Nineteen Times out of Twenty, is his only Market, and the Petitioner has, at this Moment, a large Stock on Hand which he cannot sell, owing to the Operation of the Act in this particular Instance — It is ruinous also, because it exposes and destroys all the Manufacturers Secrets, which have been of inestimable Value to them, and have, for many Years, proved a Source of great and increasing Revenue to this Kingdom: And therefore praying, That the said Act may be repealed, and the Duties reduced, because the Petitioner conceives no other Measure can now be adopted to secure the Manufacture of Tobacco and Snuff to this Country.

A Petition of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of Merchant Venturers of the City of Bristol, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are fully convinced the Vox.. 4 3.

Laws of Excise are not only hostile to our free and happy Constitution, but that they depress the Spirit of Trade and Manufacture, on which the National Opulence depends, and although the Revenue mayderive a temporary Increase from their Exertion, yet it will most certainly, in the Event, wholly defeat the Purpose it was intended to promote; and that the Petitioners apprehend, from the Experience of the Manufacturers of Tobacco In the said City, that the Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, applying to them this System of Laws, is extremely oppressive, and subjects the fair Trader to Penalties, which, with all his Caution, he cannot avoid: And therefore praying, That the said Act may be repealed; and that the Excise Laws may not b further extended, to the Destruction of those Princip.es of Liberty which distinguish this Nation from arbitrary Governments.

A Petition of the Traders of the Borough oi Newbury Petition and Speenhamland, in the County of Berks, was also ”P‘nst presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That 10 acco 1 the Petitioners are folly sensible of the Necessity of raising a ll'evenue adequate to the Exigencies of the State, and are ready, in an equal and Constitutional Manner, to contribute their Share to the Public Burthen, but that the Petitioners are convinced, however the Rigour of the Excise Laws may cause a temporary Increase of Revenue, they will ultimately tend to diminish the Trade and Manufactures of the Country, strike at the Root of the Prosperity of this great Commercial Nation, and defeat the very End for which they are declared to be introduced, and in this Light the Petitioners regard an Act, passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act for repealing the Duties “ on Tobacco and Snuff, and for granting new Duties in lieu thereofAnd therefore praying, That the same may be forthwith repealed, and that the Excise Laws may not be further extended, to the Destruction of the Trading and Manufacturing Spirit of the Country, and to the Subversion of the dearest Rights and Privileges which they claim under this free Constitution, and particularly the Right of Trial by Jury.

A Petition of the Persons thereunto subscribing. Ditto, being the Traders and Inhabitants of the Town of Sheffield \was also presented to the House, and read;

Setting forth, That the Petitioners are fully sensible of the Necessity of raising a Revenue adequate to the Exigencies of the State, and are ready, in an equal and Constitutional Manner, to contribute their Share to the Public Burthen, but the Petitioners are convinced, however the Rigour of the Excise Laws may cause a temporary Increase of Revenue, that their ultimate and certain Effect will be to diminish the Trade and Manufactures of the Country, and thereby to strike at the Root of the Prosperity of this great Commercial Nation, and defeat the very End for which they were declared to be introduced, and in this Light the Petitioners regard an Act, passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, * An Act for repealing “ the Duties on Tobacco and Snuff', and for granting “ new Duties in Lieu thereofAnd therefore praying, That the same may be forthwith repealed, and that the Excise Laws may not be further extended, to the Destruction of the Trading and Manufacturing Spirit of the Country, and to the Subversion of the dearest Rights and Privileges which they claim under this free Constitution, ana particularly the Right of Trial by Jury.

A Petition of the Persons thereunto subscribing, rjjtto. being principal Traders or Inhabitants of the Borough of Knaresborough, in the County of York, was likewise presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners are fully sensible of the Necessity of raising a Revenue adequate to the Exigencies of the State, and are ready, in an equal and Constitutional Manner, to contribute their Share to the Public Burthen, but; the Petitioners are convinced, however the

Rigour of the Excise Laws may cause a temporary Increase to the Revenue, that their ultimate and certain Effect will be to diminish the Trade and Manufactures of the Country, and thereby to strike at the Root of the Prosperity of this great Commercial Nation, and defeat the very End for which they are declared to be introduced, and in this Light the Petitioners regard an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament, intituled, “ An Act for repealing the Duties on Tobacco “ and Snuff, and for granting new Duties in Lieu “ thereofAnd therefore praying, That the same may be forthwith repealed, and that the Excise Laws may not be further extended, to the Destruction of the Trading and Manufacturing Spirit of the Country, and to the Subversion of the dearest Rights and Privileges which they claim under this free Constitution, and particularly the Right of Trial by Jury.

Surrey, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That, by an Act, made in the Twenty-seventh Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, for laying additional Duties upon Licences to be taken out by Persons dealing by Retail in Foreign Spirituous Liquors, the Petitioners are obliged to take out an additional Licence Annually, for which they pay certain Sums, according to the Rent of the Houses occupied by them (that is to say) If the Rent is under Fifteen Pounds, 21. 8 s.; if Fifteen Pounds, and under Twenty Pounds, 2/. i6«.; and so on in Proportion to the Yearly Rent of Fifty Pounds, which pays 4/. 16$. and a House of One hundred Pounds, or upwards, per Annum, pays no more, and the Petitioners are required, by the said Act, to attend Eight Times in the Year at the Chief Office of Excise in London, to pay, by Installments, the Sums directed by the said Act; and that, before the passing of the said Act, the Legislature, in Consequence of the Commercial Treaty entered into with France, reduced the Duties upon Foreign Spirituous Liquors so low, as to enable the Petitioners to purchase Brandy of the best Quality at 7 s.6 d.per Gallon, upon an Average,

with Fish, should sell off their Cargo within Eight Days after their Arrival, and the Trustees were empowered to appoint an Inspector, to take an Account of the Arrival of such Vessels, and to examine into the State of their Cargo, and for defraying the Expence of such Appointment, and otherwise, it was directed, that there should be paid to His Majesty’s Searcher at Gravesend, for the Certificate of the Entry of any such Fishing Vessel, Two Shillings, whereof the Searcher was to have Six Pence, and the remaining One Shilling and Six Pence was to be paid by the Searcher to the Trustees, or such Persons as they should appoint, and all Masters and Owners of Fishing Vessels were ordered, within Three Days of their Arrival, to report the same to the Searcher at Gravesend, but, by an Act, passed in the Thirty-third Year of the late King, it is directed, that, instead of making such Entries with the Searcher at Gravesend, they should be made with the Deputed Clerk in the Coast Office, under the Collector Outward in the Port of London, at the Custom House there, subject to the same Payment, for the same Purposes, and the Trustees were likewise empowered by the said Act of the Twenty-ninth of the late King, to mortgage and otherwise dispose of the Ground and Buildings of the said Market, for securing any further Sums of Money that might become necessary to be borrowed; and that notwithstanding all proper Means were used to carry the said Design into Execution, yet the Market was but little resorted to, insomuch that scarcely any Toll Duties were received, and the Debt contracted for its Support w-as rapidly increasing, to defray which the Trustees were finally obliged to abandon the Design, and borrow Money on a Building Lease of the Market Ground, w'hich Lease was granted to Richard Hughes for the Term of Seventy-two Years, commencing from Lady Day 1753, at a Pepper Corn Rent Yearly for the First Two Years, and at the clear Annual Rent of 6,51, for the remaining Seventy Years, and the said Trustees borrowed a Sum of 6001, upon the Security of the said Lease for the Discharge of the Debts thus contracted by the Failure of the Market; and that the Trustees continuing in the Receipt of the above stated Ground Rent, and of the Profits arising from the Entries of Fishing Vessels, were enabled, and actually did, some Time in the Year 1774, discharge the Whole of the* Principal Money, and Interest due on the Two several Loans of 400l. and 600l. before-mentioned, since which Time the said Ground Rent and Profits have been accumulating in the Hands of the Trustees, without being applied to any particular Object, and have, of late Years, been constantly and regularly invested in the Three per Cent. Consolidated Bank Annuities, for the Benefit of the Trust, and for the Increase of the Fund; and that, since the passing of the Act of the Twenty-second of the late King, all the Trustees originally named in the said Act are dead, except the Marquis of Stafford, and the present Trustees have been regularly elected agreeably to the Provisions contained in that Act; and that their Receipts and Disbursements Annually are as follows, the Interest of 4,2001. Throe per Cent. Consolidated Bank Annuities, being the Total, of the Savings invested in Government Security, 65/. per Annum, being the Ground Rent of the Market, and the Yearly Sum of 140/., being the Average Three Fourths of the Duties arising from the Entries of Fishing Vessels in the River Thames, that the Disbursements consist in 25 /. a Year for an Inspector at Gravesend, 201, a Year for a Clerk, with about 15/. Annually for the Use of a House, and otherwise; and that the Petitioners conceiving that it was their Duty, under the present subsisting Acts, to abstain from applying the remaining Profits to any new Purpose, and hoping that the Wisdom of Parliament would find out some other 01 Mode

To prove the Allegations of the said Petition, the-said Act of the Twenty-second Year of his late Majesty

Vox.. 45.

And it further appeared by the said Act, That if there should be any Surplus of the said Duties, the same should be applied Yearly in binding out Boys Apprentices to Fishermen, Masters of Ships, or some other Persons employed in the Sea Service.

And it also appeared by an Act, made in the Thirty-third Year of his late Majesty, That the Sum of Two Shillings is made payable for every Fishing Vessel arriving at The Nore, One Shilling and Six Pence of which is directed to be paid to the said Trustees, to be applied as therein is mentioned;

Mr. Thomas Drake, Clerk to the said Trustees, being examined, said, That soon after the passing of the said first-mentioned Act the Trustees caused a Fish Market to be erected upon the Piece of Ground conveyed to them for that Purpose, which Market continued for some Time, but the same could not be kept up in such Manner as to be of any Benefit to the Inhabitants of the said City; and the Trustees were therefore obliged to abandon the Design, and the said Piece of Ground whereon the Market was held hath been since let out upon a Building Lease, for a certain Term of Years, at a reserved Rent of 65 /. per Annum.

And the Witness further said, That for several Years past the Surplus Money, as it came into the Hands of the Treasury, had been placed in the public Funds, and had been accumulating.

And it appeared by the Treasurer’s Accounts, which the Witness produced, That the Trustees are now possessed of 4,200l. in the 3 per Cent. Consolidated Bank Annuities, and that their whole Annual Income amounts -at present to the Sum of 320/. or thereabouts, and their Disbursements to about 50/. per; and that

there is now in the Hands of the Treasurer the Sum of 185/. lf>J. 11 d.

Then several of the Trustees informed your Committee, That they are desirous of conveyir.g and giving up all their Estates and Property they are entitled to by virtue of the said Acts, to the Marine Society, in Augmentation of their Fund, and to be discharged from their Trust; and they beg Leave to submit to the House, whether so much of the several Acts as relates to the said Fish Market should not be repealed.

Ordet'ed, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for conveying and applying the Estates and Monies belonging to the Trustees of Westminster Fish Market, to the Marine Society, in Augmentation of their Fund, and for repealing certain Provisions in the several Acts of Parliament relating to the said Fish Market: And that Mr. Henry Hobart and Mr. Samuel Thornton do prepare, and bring in, the same.

His Majesty has received Information, that Two Vessels belonging to His Majesty’s Subjects, and navigated under the British Flag, and Two others, of which the Description is not hitherto sufficiently ascertained, have been captured at Nootka Sound, on the North Western Coast of America, by an Officer commanding Two Spanish Ships of War; that the Cargoes of the British Vessels have been seized, and that their Officers and Crews have been sent as Prisoners to a Spanish Port.

The Capture of One of these Vessels had before been notified by the Ambassador of his Catholic Majesty, by Order of his Court, who at the same Time desired that Measures might be taken for preventing His Majesty’s Subjects from frequenting those Coasts, which were alledged to have been previously occupied and frequented by the Subjects of Spain. Complaints were also made of the Fisheries carried on by His Majesty’s Subjects in the Seas adjoining to the Spanish Continent, as being contrary to the Rights of the Crown of Spain. In Consequence of this Communication, a Demand was immediately made, by His Majesty’s Order, for adequate Satisfaction, and for the Restitution of the Vessel, previous to any other Discussion.

By the Answer from the Court of Spain it appears, that this Vessel and her Crew had been set at Liberty by the Vice-Roy of Mexico; but this is represented to have been done by him on the Supposition that nothing but the Ignorance of the Rights of Spain encouraged the Individuals of other Nations to come to those Coasts for the Purpose of making Establishments, or carrying on Trade, and in Conformity to his previous Instructions, requiring him to shew all possible Regard to the British Nation.

No Satisfaction is made, or offered, and a direct Claim is asserted by the Court of Spain to the exclusive Rights of Sovereignty, Navigation, and Commerce, in the Territories, Coasts, and Seas, in that Part of the World.

His Majesty has now directed His Minister at Madrid to make a fresh Representation on this Subject, and to claim such full and adequate Satisfaction as the Nature of the Case evidently requires. And, under these Circumstances, His Majesty, having also

received Information that considerable Armaments are carrying on in the Ports of Spain, has judged it indispensably necessary to give Orders for making such Preparations as may put it in His Majesty’s Power to act with Vigour and Effect in Support of the Honour of His Crown, and the Interests of His People. And His Majesty recommends it to His faithful Commons (on whose Zeal and Public Spirit He has the most perfect Reliance) to enable Him to take such Measures, and to make such Augmentation of His Forces, as may be eventually necessary for this Purpose.

It is His Majesty’s earnest Wish, that the Justice of His Majesty’s Demands may ensure, from the Wisdom and Equity of his Catholic Majesty, the Satisfaction which is so unquestionably due; and that this Affair may be terminated in such a Manner as to prevent any Grounds of Misunderstanding in future, and to continue and confirm that Harmony and Friendship which has so happily subsisted between the Two Courts, and which His Majesty will always endeavour to maintain and improve, by all such Means as are consistent with the Dignity of His Majesty’s Crown, and the essential Interests of His Subjects.

counteract the former Regulation, from which the most beneficial Effects have been experienced, while, at the same Time, Agriculture has in every Respect kept Pace with the general Prosperity of the Country, and the Petitioners cannot help having the most serious Apprehensions of the Consequences to the Manufactures, the Population, and the Peace and Quiet, of that very industrious Part of the Country, which must at all Times depend upon Importation for a considerable Part of their Subsistence; and that, while the Petitioners acknowledge the Propriety of subjecting all to one

and the same Law, they beg that the Extent of the District in which they are to be classed may be as much confined as possible, and they must object to the proposed separate Regulation of Oat-meal in Scotland, by which, while that Article may be imported into England whenever Oats are at or above Sixteen Shillings Sterling per Quarter, they are to be restrained from importing it till the Price of Meal exceeds Sixteen Shillings Sterling per Boll, which is equal to upwards of Nineteen Shillings per Quarter of Oats, and this proposed Regulation they thus object to, as being not only an Infringement of their Rights, as British Subjects, entitled to the Participation of equal Laws with their Fellow Subjects of England, but as a Precedent of the most dangerous Tendency to the Commerce, the Manufactures, and the Liberties, of the Country: And therefore praying the House to hear them, by themselves or Counsel, in Support of this Petition, and to afford such Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem proper.

A Petition of the Directors of the Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures established by Royal Charter in the City of Glasgow, and representing the Trading Interest of the West of Scotland, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That the Petitioners, anxious for the Prosperity of that Part of the Country in which they reside, and solicitous for the Subsistence of its numerous Labourers and Manufacturers, cannot help being alarmed at certain Regulations proposed to be adopted into the Corn Laws, which will not only, in a very great Degree, affect the Prosperity of that Country, but which threatens the Destruction of the very extensive Manutactures established among them: That the District of the Country in which the Petitioners reside is one of the most populous and industrious in Scotland, Von. 45.

and the Manufactures thereto established have, within these few Years, increased in a high Degree, and they hope, from the' Perseverance and Assiduity of its Inhabitants, will increase ‘still further, and though the Agriculture of the Country is greatly improved, yet the Quantity of Com which is raised is so far from being sufficient for the Subsistence of its increasing Inhabitants, that they are always obliged to depend upon Importation from other Quarters; and that the Petitioners were rejoiced to find that it was proposed to make the Regulations of the Corn Trade the same over the Whole of Britain, they were convinced of the Propriety of general Laws and general Regulations for the whole Empire, and they trusted that the illiberal Distinctions in those Laws, which had so long operated to the Disadvantage of that Country, would now be at an End, they were therefore astonished to find that it was proposed not only to keep up these Distinctions, but, by the Alteration of Part of those Laws by which they are at present governed, to make the Situation of, that Country worse than it was before; and that the Grievance-which the Petitioners complain of is the very great Distinction made between their Country and England, that--though Oat-meal is allowed to be imported into England, at a Duty of Two Pence per Hundred Weight, when the Price of Oats is as high as Sixteen Shillings per Quarter, yet, by the proposed Regulations, it cannot be imported into Scotland at the same Duty, until the Price of Meal he Sixteen Shillings per Boll, which is equal to more than Nineteen Shillings per Quarter of Oats; a Distinction of such a Nature, and whereby such a Discrimination is made between one Part of the Country and another, that they trust, it is only necessary to state it to the House, to have it rectified; and that although the present Laws, which have been often and justly complained of, establish this Difference, yet, from the Average of Price for Importation being taken in each County separately, Part of the Hardship was alleviated, but the Petitioners see, with Regret, that while particular Attention has been paid to the local Situation of England, by dividing its Maritime Counties in such a Manner as that sometimes only Two, and, in One Instance, a single County, composes a District by itself, yet that a different System is intended for their Country, as it is proposed to throw the Whole of Scotland into Three Divisions, a Measure which, by uniting that Part of the Country with others less populous or more fertile, will involve its Inhabitants in Distress, and tend to the Ruin of its Manufactures, by preventing the Importation of Grain until it arrives at a Price totally incompatible with their Situation; and that the Petitioners glory in calling themselves British Subjects, and as such depend on an equal Legislation, -but, while they retain that Name, they firmly expect that they shall participate in the Advantages of every Regulation which Parliament shall judge proper for the Welfare of the Empire, and that they shall suffer no Restrictions which the other Parts of the Kingdom are freed from, and therefore rely with Confidence on the Justice of Parliament to prevent such an unequal and -oppressive Distinction, which threatens Ruin to the numerous Manufactures of the said District, and which may, if persisted in, reduce Thousands of its Inhabitants to Distress and Despair: And therefore praying the House to take these Matters under their Consideration, to hear the Petitioners, by themselves, or Counsel, in Support of their Claims, and to grant such Relief as to the House shall seem proper.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to be referred to the Consideration of the Committee to whom the Bill for regulating . the Importation and Exportation of Com, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign . Com imported, and of the Bounty on

Mr. Shears's Memorial, dated 30th April 1790.

(14 Inclosu.)

To the Right honourable William Wyndham Grenville, One of His Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State.

The Memorial of John Shears, Lieutenant in His Majesty’s Navy;

Most humbly sheweth,

That early in the Year 1786, certain Merchants residing in the East Indies, and under the immediate Protection of the Company, desirous of opening a Trade with the North West Coast of America, for supplying the Chinese Market with Furs and Ginseng,

communicated

13° Man.

464

A. 1790.

Intelligence communicated such Design to Sir respecting Governor General of India, who not only approved

NootkaT8t of the Plan, but joined in the Subscription for its '---. ----- - Execution; and Two Vessels were accordingly pur-

chased, and placed under the Orders and Command of your Memorialist.

That in the Month of March, your Memorialist dispatched One of the said Vessels, which he named The Sea Otter, under the Command of Mr. Tipping, to Prince Williams Sound, and followed her in the other Ship, which he named The Nootka.

That on your Memorialist's Arrival in Prince William's Sound, in the Month of September, he found the Sea Otter had left that Place a few Days before; and, from Intelligence he has since received, that Ship was soon after unfortunately lost off the Coast of Kamschalka.

That your Memorialist remained in ’ Sound the whole of the Winter, in the Course of which

Time he opened an extensive Trade with the Natives, and having collected a Cargo of Furs, he proceeded to China, in the Autumn of 1787.

That in the Month of January 1788, your Memorialist having disposed of the Nootka, he, in conjunction vtith several British Merchants residing in India, purchased and fitted out Two other Vessels, named The Felice and Iphigenia;the former your Memorialist commanded, and the latter he put under the Direction of Mr. William Douglas. That your Memorialist proceeded from China to the Port of Nootka, or King George's Sound, which he reached in the Month of May, and the Iphigenia arrived in Cook's River in the Month of June.

That your Memorialist, immediately on his Arrival in Nootka Sound, purchased from Maqmlla, the Chief of the District contiguous to and surrounding that -Place, a Spot of Ground, whereon he built a House for his occasional Residence, as well as for the more convenient Pursuit of his Trade with the Natives, and hoisted the British Colours thereon; that he also erected a Breast Work, which surrounded the House, and mounted One Three-pounder in the Front; that having so done, your Memorialist proceeded to trade on the Coast, the Felice taking her Route to the Southward, and the Iphigenia to the Northward, confining themselves within the Limits of 6o° and 45* 30' North, and returned to Nootka Sound in the Month of September; that on your Memorialist’s Arrival there,-his People, whom he had left behind, had nearly completed a Vessel, which previous to his Departure he had laid down; and that the said Vessel was soon after launched by your Memorialist, and called The North West America, measuring about 40 Tons, and was equipped with all Expedition to assist him in his Enterprizes.

That during the Absence of your Memorialist from Nootka Sound, he obtained from Wickananish, the Chief of the District surrounding Port Cox and Port Effingham, situated in the Latitudes 48* and 49°, in consequence of considerable Presents, the Promise of a free and exclusive Trade with the Natives of the District, and also his Permission to build any Storehouses or other Edifices, which he might jq^ge necessary; that he also acquired the same Privilege of exclusive Trade from Tatouche, the Chief of the Country bordering on the Straits of Juan de Fuca, and purchased from him a Tract of Land within the said Strait, which One of your Memorialist’s Officers took Possession of in the King's Name, calling the same Tatouche, in Honour of the Chief.

That the Iphigenia, in her Progress to the Southward, also visited several Ports, and in consequence of Presents to the Chiefs of the Country, her Commander had Assurances given to him of not only a free Access but of an exclusive Trade upon that Coast, no other European Vessel having been there before her.

That your Memorialist, on the 23d of September, having collected a Cargo of Furs, proceeded in the Felice to China, leaving the Iphigenia and the North West America in Nootka Sound, with Orders to winter at the Sandwich Islands, and to return to the Coast in the Spring. That your Memorialist arrived in China early in the Month of December, where he sold his Cargo, and also the Ship F.

That a few Days after your Memorialist’s Arrival m China, the Ships Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, fitted out from the Port of London by Messrs. John and Cadman Etches and Co. came to Canton from a trading Voyage on the North West Coast of America-, and your Memorialist finding that they had embarked in this Commerce under Licences granted to them by the East India and South Sea Companies, which would not expire until the Year 1790, and apprehending at the same Time that the Trade would suffer by a Competition, he and his Partners associated themselves with the said Messrs. Etches and Co. and a formal Agreement was executed in consequence between your Memorialist and Mr. John Etches, then Supra Cargo of the Two Ships, making a joint Stock of all the Vessels and Property employed in that Trade; and under that Firm they purchased a Ship, which had been built at Calcutta, and called her The Argonaut.

That the Prince of Wale? having been chartered to load Teas for the East India Company, soon after returned to England, and the Princess Royal and Argonaut were ordered by your Memorialist to sail for the Coast of America, under the Command of Mr. James Colnett, to whom the Charge of all the Concerns of the Company on that Coast had been committed.

Mr. Colnett was directed to fix his Residence at Nootka Sound, and, with that View, to erect a substantial House on the Spot which your Memorialist had purchased in the preceding Year, as will appear by a Copy of his Instructions hereunto annexed.

That the Princess Royal and Argonaut, loaded with Stores and Provisions of all Descriptions, with Articles estimated to be sufficient for the Trade for Three Years, and a Vessel on Board in Frame, of about 30 Tons Burthen, left China accordingly in the Months of April and May 1789. They had also on Board, in Addition to their Crews, several Artificers of different Professions, and near 70 Chinese, who intended to become Settlers on the American Coast, in the Service, and under the Protection, of the Associated Company.

That on the 24th of April 1789, the Iphigenia returned to Nootka Sound, and that the North West America reached that Place a few' Days after; that they found, on their Arrival in that Port, Two American Vessels, which had wintered there, one of them was called The Columbia, the other The Washington-, that on the 29th of the same Month, the North West America was dispatched to the Northward to trade, and also to explore the Archipelago of St. Lazarus.

That on the 6th of May, the Iphigenia being then at Anchor in Nootka Sound, a Spanish Ship of War, called The Princessa, commanded by Don Estwan Joseph Martinez, mounting 26 Guns, which had sailed from the Port of San Bias, in the Province of Mexico, anchored in Nootka Sound, and was joined on the 13th by a Spanish Snow of 16 Guns, called The San Carlos, which Vessel had also sailed from the Port of San Bias, loaded with Cannon and other warlike Stores.

That from the Time of the Arrival of the Princessa until the 14th of May, mutual Civilities passed between Captain Douglas and the Spanish Officers, and even Supplies were obtained from Don Martinez for the Use of the Ship; but on that Day he (Captain Douglas') was ordered on Board the Princessa, and, to his great Surprize, was informed by Don Martinez, that he had the King’s Orders to seize all Ships and

Vessels

30 Geo. IIL 13° Man. 465

Vessels he might find upon that Coast, and that he (the Commander of the Iphigenid) was then his Prisoner; that Don Martinez thereupon instructed his Officers to take Possession of the which they

accordingly did, in the Name of his Catholic Majesty, and the Officers and Crew of that Ship were immediately conveyed as Prisoners on Board the Spanish Ships, where they were put in Irons, and were otherwise ill-treated.

That as soon as the Iphigenia had been seized, Don Martinez took Possession of the Lands belonging to your Memorialist, on which his temporary Habitation before-mentioned had been erected, hoisting thereon the Standard of Spain, and performing such Ceremonies as your Memorialist understands are usual on such Occasions, declaring at the same Time, that all the Lands comprized between Cape Horn and the 6oth Degree of North Latitude did belong to his Catholic Majesty; he then proceeded to build Batteries, Storehouses, &c. in the Execution of which he forcibly employed some of the Crew of the Iphigenia, and many of them who attempted

to resist were very severely punished.

That during the Time the Commander of the Iphigenia remained in Captivity, he had frequently been urged by Don Martinez to sign an Instrument, purporting, as he was informed (not understanding himself the Spanish Language) that Don Martinez had found him at Anchor in Nootka Sound; that he was at that Time in great

Distress; that he had furnished him with every Thing necessary for his Passage to the Islands, and

that his Navigation had in no respect been molested or interrupted; but which Paper, on Inspection of a Copy thereof, delivered to Mr. Douglas, and hereunto annexed (N* 2.) appears to be an Obligation from him and Mr. Vinania, the Second Captain, on the Part of their Ow ners, to pay on demand the Valuation of that Vessel, her Cargo, &c. in case the Vice Roy of New Spain should adjudge her to be lawful Prize, for entering the Port of Nootka without the Permission of his Catholic Majesty; that Captain Douglas, conceiving that the Port of Nootka did not belong to his Catholic Majesty, did frequently refuse to accede to this Proposal, but that Don Martinez, partly by Threats, and partly by Promises of restoring him to his Command, and of furnishing him with such Supplies of Stores and Provisions as he might stand in Need of, ultimately carried his Point; and having so done, he, on the 26th of the same Month, was restored to the Command of the Iphigenia, but restrained from proceeding to Sea, until the Return of the North West America, insisting that he should then dispose of her for 400 Dollars, the Price which One of the American Captains had set upon her.

That during the Time the Spaniards held Possession of the Iphigenia, she was stripped of all the Merchandize which had been provided for trading, as also of her Stores, Provisions, Nautical Instruments, Charts, &c. and in short every other Article (excepting 12 Bars of Iron) which they could conveniently carry away, even to the Extent of the Master’s Watch, and Articles of Clothing.

That the Commander of the Iphigenia, finding himself thus distressed applied for Relief, and after much Solicitation obtained a trifling Supply of Stores and Provisions, for which he was called upon to give Bills on his Owners. The Articles so supplied were charged at a most exorbitant Price, and very unequal in Quality or Quantity to those which had been taken from him.

That notwithstanding what had been insisted on by Don Martinez, respecting the Sale of the North W America, he had constantly refused to dispose of that Vessel on any Ground, alledging that, as she did not belong to him, he had no Right to dispose of her; that the North West America not returning so soon as was expected, lie (Captain Douglas) was told by Don Martinez,

Vol. 45.

that on his ordering that Vessel to be delivered to him Intelligence for the Use of his Catholic Majesty, he should have Liberty to depart with the Iphigenia; that he accord- a

ingly, on the First of June, w’rote a Letter to the > ‘.aster . of the North West America, but cautiously avoided any Directions to the Effect desired *, and availing himself Vide of Don Martinez's Ignorance of the English Language, Jp^aJia s he instantly sailed from Nootka Sound, though in a very our “ ’ unfit Condition to proceed on such a Voyage, leaving behind him the Two American Vessels which had been suffered to continue there unmolested by the Spaniards, from the Time of their First Arrival; that the Iphigenia proceeded from thence to the Sandwich Islands, and after obtaining the re such Supplies as they were enabled to procure with the Iron before-mentioned, returned to China, and anchored there in the Month of October 1789:

Your Memorialist thinks it necessary upon this Occasion to explain, that in order to evade the excessive high Port Charges demanded by the Chinese from all other European Nations, excepting the Portuguese, that he and his Associates had obtained the Name of Cawalho to their Firm, though he had no actual Concern in their Stock; that Cawalho, though by Birth a Portuguese, had been naturalized at Bombay, and had resided there for many Years, under the Protection of the East India Company, and had carried on an extensive Trade from thence to their several Settlements in that Part of the World.

That the Intimacy subsisting between Cawalho and the Governor of Macao had been the principal Cause of their forming this nominal Connection, and that Cawalho had in consequence obtained his Permission that the'Two Ships above-mentioned, in case it should be found convenient so to do, should be allowed to navigate under, or claim any Advantages granted, to' the Portuguese Flag.

That this Permission had answered the Purpose of your Memorialist, so far as respected the Port Charges of the Chinese, until the Return of the Iphigenia; but the Portuguese Governor dying soon after her Departure, and Cawalho becoming a Bankrupt, his Creditors demanded his Interest in that Ship; that your Memorialist having resisted their Claim, an Application was made by them to the succeeding Governor for Possession of the Ship; that the Governor had, in consequence, investigated the Transaction, and finding that Cawalho had no actual Concern or Interest in the Property, obliged her to quit the Port; that this Proceeding had subjected the Iphigenia at once to the increased Port Charges, which were instantly demanded by, and paid to the Chinese.

Your Memorialist has stated this Transaction thus fully, in order to shew, that the Iphigenia and her Cargo were actually and bond side British Property, as well as to expain the Occasion of the Orders which were given to her Commander, Extracts of which accompany this, and are referred to in the Journal of that Ship, having been under the Inspection of Don Martinez.

Your Memorialist further begs Leave to state, That after the Departure of the Iphigenia, Don Martinez became apprized of the Purport of the Letter with which he had been furnished, and that on the Return of the North W1st Amei'ica, off the Port of Nootka, on the 9th of June, she was boarded and seized by Boats manned and equipped for War, commanded by Don Martinez; that he did tow and convey the said Vessel into the Sound, and anchoring her close to the Spanish Ships of War, did then take Possession of her in the Name of his Catholic Majesty, as good and lawful Prize; that the above-mentioned Vessel was soon after hauled alongside of the Spanish Frigate, and that the Officers and Men, together with the Skins which had been collected, amounting to 215, of the best Quality, and also her Stores, Tackle and Furniture, .

6 C Articles

466 13° Mail. 1790.

intelligence Articles of Trade, &c. were removed on Board the respecting Spanish Frigate; that the Commander of the North

NootkaT at WestAmerica, his Officers and Men, were accordingly

<---,..... made Prisoners, and Mr. Thomas Barnett, one of the

Officers of that Vessel, and some of her Men, were, as appears by the Affidavit of William Graham, one of the Seamen belonging to that Vessel, hereunto annexed (N® 4.) afterwards put in Irons.

That the Princess Royal arriving a few Days after the Seizure of the North West America, and being allowed by Don Martinez to depart, the Skins collected by the last-mentioned Vessel (excepting 12 of the best Quality, which Don thought fit to detain)

were returned to the Master, and with the Permission of Don Martinez, were shipped on Board the Princess Royal, for the Benefit of the Owners; and that Ship, ias appears by her Journal, put -to Sea on the 2d of July, to pursue the Trade upon the Coast

That Don Martinez, after seizing the North West America in the Manner and under the Circumstances above stated, employed her on a Trading Voyage, from which she returned after an Absence of about 20 Days, with 75 Skins, obtained by British Merchandize, which had either been found in that Vessel at the Time of her Capture, or had been taken from the Iphigenia; and that the Value of the Furs so collected, cannot upon a moderate Calculation, be estimated at less than 7,500 Dollars, and which Don Martinez had applied to his own Advantage.

That the Argonaut arrived off the Port of Noot/ca on or about the 3d of July 1789. That Don Martinez, on observing her in the Offing, boarded her in his Launch, and, with Expressions of Civility, promised *Mr. Colnett, her Commander, every Assistance in his Power; that before the Argonaut entered the Sound, Mr. Thomas Barnett (who had belonged to the North West America, and who was then a Prisoner) came off in a Canoe, and informed Mr. Colnett of the Proceedings which had taken place, and of the Danger to which he was exposed; but that, under the Assurances given by Don Martinez, that the Argonaut should remain unmolested, and, being in Want of Refreshments for the Crew, Mr. Colnett proceeded into Nootka Sound.

That, notwithstanding the Assurances given by Don Martinez, he on the next Day sent the First Lieutenant of the Princessa, with a Military Force, to take Possession of the Argonaut, and that Ship was accordingly seized in the Name of his Catholic Majesty, the British Flag was hauled down, and the Spanish Flag hoisted in its Stead.

That on the Seizure of the Argonaut, her Officers and Men were made Prisoners, and Mr. Colnett was threatened to be hanged at the Yard-arm, in case of his refusing Compliance with any Directions which might be given to him.

That on the 13th of July, the Princess Royal, as is stated in her Journal, again appeared off the Port of Nootka; that her Commander approaching the Sound in his Boat, in Expectation of finding the re the Commander of the Expedition (from whom he was desirous of receiving Instructions for his future Proceedings) was seized and made Prisoner by Don Martinez, and under Threats of hanging him at the Yard-arm, forced him to send Orders to his Officers to deliver up the Princess Royal without Contest.

That a Spanish Officer was dispatched into the Offing with these Orders; and that the Vessel was accordingly seized in the Name of his Catholic Majesty, and brought into Port; that her Crew were in consequence made Prisoners; and that her Cargo, consisting of 473 Skins (including 203 which had been put on board her from the North West America, as appears by the inclosed Receipt, N® 5.) was seized.

That Mr. Colnett, from the Circumstances of his Capture, became so deranged, that he attempted fre-

quently to destroy himself; and that, according to the last Accounts received, the State of his Mind was such as to render him unfit for the Managment of any Business which might have been entrusted to his Care; that in this melancholy Situation, however, Don Martinez (notwithstanding the Vessel and Cargo had before been formally seized) attempted to procure from him the Sale of the Copper, of which a principal Part of the Cargo of the Pi'incess Royal had been composed,

and that such Sale would actually have taken place, had not the other Officers of that Vessel, seeing Colnett'% Insanity, prevented it.

Your Memorialist farther begs Leave to represent, That the American Ship Columbia, intending to proceed to China, the Crew of the North West America were ordered by Don Martinez on Board her, principally, as your Memorialist understands, for the Purpose of assisting her in her Navigation to China, the greatest Part of her own Crew, as well as of her Provisions, having been previously put on Board the ,

in order that she might be enabled to continue on the Coast.

That the Columbia having reduced her Provisions considerably, from the Supplies she had spared to her Consort, was furnished from the Argonaut, by Order of Don Martinez,vi'wh what was necessary for herVoyage, said to be intended however for the Supply of the Crew of the North West America. That previous to the Departure of the Columbia, 96 Skins were also put on Board her, as appears by the Paper hereunto annexed, N® 6, to defray the Wages of the Officers and Crew of the North West America, under a Supposition that their late Employers would be unable to liquidate their Demands, first deducting, however, 30 per Cent, from the Sales, which Don Martinez had agreed should be paid for the Freight on the said Skins to the American Commanders.

That the Columbia thus supplied left Nootka Sound accordingly, and proceeded to the Southward; that a few Days after she entered Port Cox, where she was joined by her Consort the Washington, from w hom she received a considerable Number of Skins, conceived to be the Whole (excepting the 96 before-mentioned) which had been collected by the Americans and as well as by the British Traders, and with which, after sparing a further Quantity of Provisions to the Washington, the Columbia proceeded to China, where she arrived on the 2d of November, and landed the Crew of the North West America.

That the Crew of the North West America, previous to their leaving Nootka Sound in the Columbia, saw the Argonaut proceed, as a Prize, to San Bias; and that her Officers and Men, who were Europeans, were put on Board her as Prisoners; and that the Princess Royal was shortly to follow, with her Crew in Confinement, in the same Manner. The Washington, on joining the Columbia in Port Cox, gave Information that the Princess Royal had also sailed for San Bias.

That Don Martinez had thought fit, however, to detain the Chinese, and had compelled them to enter into the Service of Spain; and that on the Departure of the Columbia, they were employed in the Mines, which had then been opened on the Lands which your Memorialist had purchased.

Your Memorialist begs Leave to annex a Deposition of the Officers and Crew of the North West America, together with an Extract of the Journal of the Iphigenia, and also some Letters which he has received from Mr. Duffin, Second Officer of the Argonaut, which Papers will serve to throw considerable Lights on the several Transactions alluded to in this Memorial: He also has subjoined a Statement of the actual as well as the probable Losses which be and his Associates have sustained from the unwarrantable and unjustifiable Proceedings of Don Martinez, in open Violation df the Treaty of Peace subsisting between this

others, that you seize the Offenders, and put them in Irons, and send them to the Agents in China, in order that they may be brought to condign Punishment; we are here necessitated to dwell on this Subject, from the strong Reports of such atrocious Acts being committed, which are at once not only destructive of the Commerce, but of every Sentiment of Humanity; we recommend a steady Pursuance of a mild Conduct, as the only Means to Cultivate the good Will of the Natives, and draw them within the Verges of civilized Life.

We recommend to you, if possible, to forth a Treaty with the various Chiefs, particularly near Nootkia. If you happily accomplish this, you at once become possessed of the Furs of a great District with Honour and Credit, and without incurring a Stigma; and, if there is a Possibility of conquering our Competitors, we beg it may be in a Mode so honourable to ourselves as Generosity and Humanity, and also a strict Attention to our Business.

On the Strength of a Treaty we form considerable Hopes, for though at the Moment it may not be productive, yet in Time it will be found the most stable Way of accomplishing our Wishes, and gaining the Confidence of the Chiefs, who are known to manage the Commerce of their Subjects; for this Purpose we have supplied you abundantly with every Article known to be had in Estimation among them; and so anxious are we to have a good Uunderstanding,

So soon as the Argonaut is ready for Sea, you will and the perfecting a Treaty, that we authorize you to

proceed on your Voyage, and put into Execution the several Plans we have laid down, and with which you are so thoroughly acquainted; you are also so perfectly informed of the Basis they are founded on, that any Recapitulation here would be needless.

v - w ’ "*

The Fall of the Year we wish all the small Craft to be laid up at the Factory, which you will name Fort Pitt.

You will invest Mr. R. Dvffin with the Superintendence of this Station, and strenuously recommend to him to keep good Order and Harmony therein; to build Storehouses for the Reception of the Tackle and Furniture of the Shipping that you may order to be laid up, and above all, to recommend to him to use every Precaution against the Scurvy by Exercise, and the unremitting Use of the Decoction of Pine Tops.

You will in the Winter Season send what Vessels you judge proper to the Sandwich Islands for Provisions, &c. In their Return we imagine that some of the Natives of those Isles, both Men and Women, may be embarked and transplanted to America, and made useful in our Employ; this must be done with their own Consents, and with every Precaution with regard to their Health as well as Happiness.

We desire the Argonaut may be returned to China the End of this Season with the Furs. You will deliver her to Captain William , and receive

from him the Ephigene and America, shifting the Crews, &c. &c. You will also receive his Surplus Trade, and all other Stores of that Nature, and in Return supply him with Refreshments to carry him to the Islands where he can procure a Supply.

The Furs you send to Chi,we desire may be well cleaned, and otherwise dressed, classed, and put into Chests; Musters of each Quality must be put into a separate Box; every Skin, Piece, and Tail, must be numbered, and a Register kept of the Whole, and transmitted to us, with your other Dispatches, by Captain Douglass-, in these you will be very particular in advising us of all Articles wanted for the Year 1790.

We recommend to your Attention the State of the Markets in China;the vast Difference between good and bad Skins, as a Guidance to your Purchases on the Coast, as ioo prime Skins are most assuredly worth 500 bad, independent of lessening the Value of your Articles of Commerce. All Collections of Furs, to the latest Period, you will send Home, in the Argonaut.

Sea Otters Tails and Seal Skins now become an Object, from the Price they bear. — It will be entirely needless to direct you in the Purchases of Furs, where you are so well acquainted; this we leave entirely to yourself; but we cannot avoid reminding you, and to desire a strict Attention is paid, that no illicit Commerce is carried on by any Persons in our Employ; on any Circumstances of this Kind, the Offenders may depend on our availing ourselves in the strictest Manner which a Breach of Articles may occasion. The Pay of Officers of every Description is extremely liberal; and we shall esteem it the Duty of every Individual to make known such Circumstances of illicit Commerce as may come within their Knowledge, as in our Eyes it is equally criminal, and shews a great Neglect of their Employer’s Interest, to either hide or stifle such Discovery; and you have our most positive Orders, on such Points coming to your Knowledge, to instantly dismiss such Persons, and those concerned, from our Service; nor will we permit any Deviation from this Point, except your Reasons are strong and sufficient for pursuing a different Line of Conduct.

We also authorize you to dismiss from our Service all Persons who shall refuse to obey your Orders, when they are for our Benefit, and, in this Case, we give you to understand, the Princess Royal, America, and other small Craft, are always to continue on the Coast of America; their Officers and People, when the

Time of their Service is up, must be embarked on the returning ship to Chinj and on 00 Account

whatever will we suffer a Deviation from those Orders.

Should you meet with any of the Ships of Messrs. Etches and Co. on the Coast, you will of course afford them every Assistance in your Power; but as we shall have no Interest in those Ships, if you can induce the Commanders to trade on our Joint Account, it will be most agreeable to us; but no trading Connections whatever must be, except on Account of the present Company. To the Person entrusted with the Command of those Ships you will make known the Nature of our Connections with Mr.; you will

in consequence make a Demand of all their Surplus Stores, or Articles of Commerce, &c. that they have to dispose of, in order that they may be left in the Factory; and a particular Account must be taken of all that are delivered, as they must be accounted for to Mr. Etches by the Company. We have no Doubt but that your Requisition will be complied with, as it ultimately tends to the Good of their Employers.

The Number of Competitors you will meet with on the Coast will, wre fear, somewhat diminish your Collection of Furs, as well as enhance their Price; we have no Doubt of your Activity and Perseverance, as well as Address in your Negociations. We place the strongest Reliance on your Vigilance and Caution, and as we have conferred on you the most ample Powers, in Return w-e look for considerable Responsibility, and a happy Completion of our 1 Ians. In a full Persuasion of this we shall take ou Leave, with a strong Recommendation of Unanimity amongst your Officers, and the strictest Discipline over your People. We'wish you Health and a prosperous Voyage, and remain, &c.

Extracts of a Letter from Mr. Shears to Captain Colnett; dated Macao, 25th April 1789.

In Mr. Shears's Memorial of 30 April 1790.

To accompany Inclosure (N* 1.)

We have well-founded Information, that Mr. Jaques, Mate of the Princess Royal, gave Copies of his own and Captain Hudsons Journals and Charts to Captain Metcalf, who commanded an American Ship when he was in China. This Act of Mr. Jiiqucs we esteem to militate so extremely against himself and our Service, that we desire you to return him to China.

Our Displeasure is no less pointed against Mr. Gibson, one of your Officers, whose Acts of Inhumanity, exercised on the Coast of America, render him extremely unfit to be employed in our Service; you will thefore return him to China. Those Circumstances relative to the above Persons did not come to our Knowledge till after the Departure of the Princess Royal from China, or we most assuredly would have embraced the earlist Opportunity of dismissing them our Service; but, with regard to Mr. Gibson, we have put the small Stock of his remaining Merit against his Situation, and our Promises prior to the Discovery of his Character, and we have formed the Resolution of employing him but One Season.

As the Dismission of those Officers may put you to some Inconveience, we shall write to Messrs. Shep-pardson and Barnett to remain under your Command; and though they are, yet we are convinced of their Value, being entirely attached to Interest and Service.”

“ As it is probable, that in Autumn 1790 you may ot meet

meet with a Store Ship from England, on the Company's Account, we have the strongest Hopes, should that Event happen, that from her you will form the entire Establishment of the Coast on such reasonable Terms under the present, that will meet our Satisfaction, and enable the Company, through the Medium of Oeconomy, to destroy our Competitors. It is probable, however, that all those Engagements may be settled in England prior to the Departure of the Store Ship; in this Case you will resign the Charge of our Cdncerns to those who are appointed to manage the same, and return with the Officers and People who-are impressed from China on the Store Ship, or the Argonaut, which ever you think most eligible; but we rather apprehend that, by the above Period, you will have so much Tonnage on the . Coast, that it will be needless detaining the Argonaut, more particularly as we shall want her in 1791, to rctumTher again to the Coast. We have nothing more to repeat, in Addition to the former Orders.” ,

Should you, in the Course of your Voyage, meet with the Vessels of any other Nation, you will have as little Communication with them as possible; should they be of superior Force, and desire to see your Papers, you will cause your Portuguese Captain to shew them.

Should they be either Russian, English, Spanish, or any other Civilized Nation, and be authorized to examine your Papers, you will permit them, and treat them w ith Civility and Friendship; but at the same Time you must be on your Guard.

Francisco Jose Bandeiro, and Jononimo Rubisno Neoes, Attornies, at Lisbon.

Should you, on such Conflict, have the Superiority, you will then take Possession of the Vessel that attacked you, as also her Cargo, and bring both, with the Officers and Crew, to Macao, that they may be condemned, and their Crews punished as Pirates.

The Information of William Graham.

In Mr. Means Memorial.of 30 April 1790.

(N® 4.)

*^}Tbe Information of William Graham, of Grub Street, Mariner; taken before me Sir Sampson Wiright, Knight, One of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the said County of Middlesex, this 5th Day of May 1790.

Who, being on Oath, says, That on or about the Month of September 1788, he entered himself on 'Board the Vessel called The North West America, then lying in King George's Sound, on the North West Coast of America, belonging to Mr. John Meares, a Merchant trading in those Parts: And further says, That be saw said Vessel launched in said Harbour under British Colours, and navigated under the British Flag, and that she was commanded by Robert Funter, who is a British Subject.

And this Informant further says. That said Ship was trading on Account of said John Meares on the North West Coast of America, between the Latitudes of 60 and 45 North, for Furs, a large Number of which they had purchased and got on Board; and that being in Want of Provisions, they sailed from the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, where they had been so trading as aforesaid, and returned to King George's Sound for a fresh Supply of Provisions, at which Time the Natives were bringing great Quantities of Furs for Sale.

And this Informant further says, That when the said Vessel arrived in the Offing of said King George's Sound, a Number of Boats came out of said Sound, and seized said Vessel, and conducted her into said Sound; that One of said Boats had a Gun in her Bow, and all the People on Board the Boats were Spaniards, and were armed with Cutlasses, Pistols, and Musquets; that they took Possession of said Vessel in the Name of the King of Spain, and made this Informant and the rest of the Crew Prisoners.

That on entering said Sound in Manner aforesaid, he, this Informant, saw Two Spanish Men of War lying the re, one carrying 26 Guns, called The Princessa, and the other 24 Guns, called The St. Carlos, with several Hundred Men on Board, and carrying the Spanish nag-

That the Spaniards who had boarded said Vessel as aforesaid, brought her to an Anchor close to said Frigates, and put the Captain and Crew of said Vessel on Board said Frigates; that they then took out of said Vessel all the Furs and other Merchandize, and put the same also on Board said Frigates, and then

hoisted the Spanish Flag on Board the Vessel they had so captured.

That the Spaniards entreated this Informant, and the rest of the Crew of said Vessel, to enter themselves as Seamen on Board said Frigates, which they all refused to do; that said Spaniards then put the Crew of said Vessel in Irons, and fed them with Horse Beans and Water, for the Space of about Three Weeks, and beat and otherwise ill treated several of them.

And this Informant further says, That he was informed that the Name of the Officer who commanded said Frigates is Stephen Joseph Martinez; and he also further says, that if said Vessel could have continued longer in the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, from whence she was obliged to return to King George's Sound through 'Want of Provisions, or if she had got a Supply of Provisions at said Sound, and gone back to the Archipelago (from which she was prevented by being captured as aforesaid) he is well assured that they should have collected a large Quantity of Furs, and other Merchandize, and that the Voyage would have 'been very advantageous to the Parties interested therein.

That soon after the Capture of said Vessel as aforesaid, she was fitted out, and sent on a trading Voyage, by said Stephen Joseph Martinez, manned with Spaniards, bearing the Spanish Flag, and having also on Board one David Coolidge, Mate of the Sloop Washington, belonging to the United States of America, which was then lying in said Sound; that in the Month of July following, said Vessel returned to said Sound, having on Board a considerable Quantity of Otters Skins, which he, this Informant, saw taken out of said Vessel, and put on Board said Frigates.

That on the 14th Day of the Month of June 1789, the Princess Royal Merchant Ship, of London, belonging to said Mr. Meares and others, and commanded by Mr. William Hudson, came into said Sound with British Colours flying, and Anchored near the said Frigates; that 6aid Vessel Princess Royal lay in said Sound a few Days, and then sailed (having first obtained the Permission of said Martinez so to do) without any other Interruption or Molestation whatever.

That on or about the Third of July, the Argonaut, a Merchant Ship, appeared in the Offing of said King George's Sound, commanded by James that

said Martinez equipped a Launch with Twenty Men and upwards, and went with the same himself, accompanied by Richard Home, an American, and Supercargo of the Ships Columbia and Washington (belonging to the United States of America, and then lying in said Sound) on Board said Argonaut; that said Argonaut sailed into and Anchored in said Sound with British Colours flying; that the next Morning the Argonaut wanting to put to Sea, was prevented by said Martinez, who seized said Vessel with an armed Force, took the Captain and Crew on Board said Frigates, and put them in Irons; that said Martinez ordered the British Colours on Board the Argonaut to be hauled down, and the Spanish Colours to be hoisted, and fired a Gun on Board the Argonaut, and took Possession of the Vessel in the Name of his Catholic Majesty; that said Martinez then ordered all the Property on Board said Argonaut to be removed on Board said Frigates; that on the 13th Day of July the before-mentioned Vessel the Princess Royal appeared in the Offing of said King George's Sound, and that Robert Hudson, Master of said Vessel, came into said Sound in his Boat; that since Martinez immediately seized said Boat, together with said Hudson and the Boat’s Crew, on whom several Spanish Soldiers who were on Board the Argonaut and the Princessa (one of said Frigates) fired with Ball; that when said. Hudson came along-side said Frigate in his Boat, the Crew belonging to said Frigate beat said Hudson and his Men, and threw said Hudson down

the After Hatchway of said Frigate, saying, “Got “ down, you English Dog,” and afterwards put him in the Cabin under a Guard of Soldiers; that the Spaniards then launched Two Boats, armed with Cutlasses, &c. which went on board the Princess Royal, and brought her from the Sound; that they then fired a Gun on Board her, hauled down the English and hoisted Spanish Colours on Board her, and put the Crew, all the Merchandize, and other Property that was in her, on Board One of said Frigates, and took Possession of said Princess Royal in the Name of his Catholic Majesty; that at this Time, he, this Informant, saw Two Spanish Batteries which were erected on Shore in said Sound, the one mounted 16 Guns, and the other 7 Guns, with the Spanish Flag flying thereon.

And this Informant further says. That he remained in Confinement on Board one of said Spanish Frigates for the Space of Three Weeks, and was then put on Board the aforesaid American Vessel the Columbia, in order to return to China; that before said Vessel sailed, he, this Informant, was several Times on Board the Argonaut, where he saw Captain Colnet and his Officers confined in the Cabin, and the Crew in the Fore Hatchway in Irons.

And this Informant further says, That he sailed from China on Board the Fcelice, and arrived in said King George's Sound in the Month of May 1788; that in about a Fortnight or Three Weeks after their Arrival, he saw Mr. Meares deliver some Articles of Merchandize to Maquilla, the Sovereign Prince of the said Sound, which he then understood and believed were given as a Consideration for Lands which the said Mr. Meares had required for an Establishment on Shore; that said Mr. Meares did erect a Building and other Conveniences on said Land; and that the same were taken Possession Of by said Martinez, who raised a Battery of Two Guns, and hoisted the Spanish Flag thereon.

And this Informant says, That there were a Number of Men, Natives of China, at said Sound, who had been taken thither by said Mr. Meares; and that said Martinez refused to let them return to China, and employed them in erecting Batteries and other Works, and, as he hath been informed, in digging in the Mines.

That while he was on his Passage in the Columbia to China, he saw a Quantity of Furs put on Board said Vessel from said Princes and that the Name Martinez was stamped or marked thereon; that in Port Cose, in their Way to China (and w'here the Washington and Columbia met) he also saw a Number of Furs put on Board the Columbia from the Washington.

And this Informant hereby acknowledges, That he has received from said Mr. Meares all the Wages due to him from the Time of his embarking on Board the Fcelice as aforesaid, to the Time of his Arrival in China on Board the Columbia: And says, that the principal Reason of his coming to Europe was to give Information of the before-mentioned Transactions.

That when he was at Port Cose, in the Columbia as aforesaid, Captain Kenrick, who commanded said Vessel* told this Informant, that if he would not sign Articles to assist in navigating her to China, he would turn him ashore among the Indians', and in consequence of said Threats, he signed said Articles; and he, this Informant, is of Opinion, that if he and others under the like Circumstances had not given such Assistance, they could not have carried said Vessel to China; but he did not receive any Recompence for such Service.

24th April. Strong Gales and Hazy Weather, with Rain: Employed moving the great Guns in the Hold, which we found a very laborious Piece of Work; every Rope we had in the Ship gave Way, so that we were obliged to born>w a Fall from the American Sloop. Having Intelligence that a Sail was in the Offing, did* patched the Long Boat to her Assistance; found her to be our Consort, the North West America; at Noon she anchored in the Cove. Sailed out of the Cove the Sloop Washington for Moweena.

I gave Orders for the Schooner not to unbend her Sails, but to be hauled on Shore immediately to stop her Leaks. At 6 P.

pliments to me, and requested my Company oil Boat'd the Princessa (for that was the Name of the Ship) to

had been in Prince Williams Sound and Cookes River; and shewed me a Copy of a Letter I wrote in Answer to One I received from Mr. on the 25th Day

of June 1788. At the Time I wrote this Letter I was in Cooke's River, he was at Anchor then off Montagu Island. How we came to pass One another, be sailing from the Sound to Cooke's River, and I sailing from Cooke's River to the Sound, I am at a Loss to know. He fell in with the Washington to the Northward, and supplied her with several Things she was in Want of I acquainted him with my distressed Situation; that the Vessel had like to have foundered before we made the Port, for Want of Pitch and Tar to stop her Leaks; that I expected my Consort from Macao every Day; if she did not arrive, I must beg his Assistance, which he promised me. Captain Kendrick arriving from Mo, after Dinner we went on Shore, accompanied by Don Joseph, and Three Padries that was to make all the Indians Christians. I thought they had taken a hard Task in Hand.

7th May. Foggy Weather, People employed in cutting up Fire Wood.

8th. Moderate Breezes and fair Weather; completed our Fire Wood, waiting with great Impatience for the Arrival of the Felice.

9th. D® Weather. In the Morning I accompanied the Commodore, the Padries, and his Officers to Moweena, to dine with Captain Kendrick. In the Evening we returned.

totli. Pleasant Land and Sea Breezes. This Day Captain Kendrick and Officers, the Spanish Commodore, and the Padries dined on Board the having One Sandwich Island Hog left, and a few Yams, I sent the Hog on Board the Spanish Ship, and had it dressed after their own Fashion; they added Two or Three other Dishes; so that we made it out pretty well.

11th. Cloudy Weather and heavy Rain. In the Morning the Spanish Commodore went up to Moweena, taking his Cot and Bedding along with hini. He promised to let me have the Articles I was in Want of at his Return. In the Evening we had Intelligence by the Natives of a Vessel being in the Offing.

12th May. Moderate and Cloudy Weather. In the Morning, having got some Pitch and Tar from the Princessa, hauled the Long Boat ashore, and set

the Carpenter and Caulker to work to caulk her Bottom. At 3 P. M. having finished the Long Boat,

I intended to send him down to Week-a-nennishies. At 5 D" Mr. Adamson acquainted me that Captain Meares was in the Offing, that the Natives had sold him some Fish; (having been unwell for some Time past, and now confined to my Bed) I ordered him to go oft' with the Long Boat to his Assistance. At 6 I)® I was acquainted she dropped Anchor One Mile to the Northward of the Port, and hoisted Spanish Colours.

He sent his Compliments to me, and requested my Company to Dinner; being unwell I declined his Invitation. In the Afternoon he paid me a Visit; and in the Evening the Commodore came down from Moweena, accompanied by Captain Kendrick, and some of his Officers.

14th. At Nine in the Morning of the 14th the Spanish Commodore sent for Mr. Viana and me on Board the Princessa. As soon as I was on Board he took out a Paper, and told me, that was the King of Vox* 45.

Spain's Orders to take all the Vessels he met with on Intelligcnca tl»e Coast of America 1 that I was now his Prisoner. I ^sPectin« urged the Distress we were in before we readied the NcStksT Harbour; the Vessel without Cables; no Pitch nor — Tar on Board to stop her Leaks; no Bread on Board, nor any Thing to live on but Salt Pork; that if I had steered for any Port in South America, the Spaniards would not have seized my Vessel, but supplied me with the Necessaries I was in Want of, agreeable to the Laws of Nations; to make me a Prisoner, in a Foreign Port that the King of Spain never laid Claim* was a Piece of Injustice that no Nation had ever attempted before: But that, sooner than be detained as a Prisoner (although the Vessel had like to have foundered before we got into the Harbour) if he would give me Permission,. I would instantly leave the Port. This was denied. Forty or Fifty Men* with some Officers, went on Board, hoisted the Spanish Colours, and took Possession of the Iphigenia Nubiana. The Keys of my Chest was demanded; my Charts, Journals, Papers, and in short, every Thing that was in the Vessel, they took Possession of I was not so much as allowed to go on Board,

I enquired the Cause of his not taking the Washington Sloop, as he had Orders from the King of Spain, to take every Vessel he met with on this Coast. He gave me no satisfactory Answer; but told me, my Portuguese Papers were bad; that they mentioned, I was to take all English, Russian, and Spanish Vessels that were of inferior Force to the Iphigenia Nubiana, and send or carry their Crews to Macao, there to be tried for their Lives as Pirates,

I told him, they had not interpreted the Papers right; that although 1 did not understand Portuguese, I had seen a Copy of them in English at Macao, which mentioned, if I was attacked by any of those Three Nations to defend myself, and if I had the Superiority, to send the Captain and Crew to Macao to answer for the Insult they offered the Portuguese Flag. The Padries and the Clerk read the Papers over, and said they had interpreted the Papers right The guese Captain Viana was silent although he must have known to the contrary. In the Evening of the 15th, Captain Kendrick came down from;

having been informed Captain Kendrick was privy to my being taken Prisoner, and that it was settled when the Spanish Commodore was last at , when

he came on Board the Iphigenia I refused to see him.

This being reported to the Spanish 'Commodore, I was ordered, at Ten o’Clock at Night (although I was very unwell) to turn out, and carry my Bed on Board the Spanish Suow, it both raining and blowing at the Time. Here 1 remained for some Time without a Soul to speak to My Servant, that was a Manilla Man, and spoke the Language very well, was not permitted to come near me, for fear of his discovering some of their Proceedings that was carrying on. In short, they stole a Number of Things, and afterwards laid the name on my Servant. My People were divided between the Two Vessels, and every Method made Use of to entiee them to enter.

The Sails were bent, and some new running Rigging wove. A Captain was appointed, and Officers, to carry me and Mr. Viana’to St. . My Officers were to be detained, and One Half of my People, on Board the Two Spanish Ships, and I was requested to choose the quietest of my Men to go along with me.

A Last of them I was desired to give to the Commodore, as we were to sail in a few Days. This I would not comply with, but told him, he might send hofne if he thought proper; that the Iphigema was not fit to go to Sea till she was caulked, and her Leaks stopped. This they immediately set about. -After taking every Thing out of her. Copper, Iron, Trade of every Kind, ana all my Sandwich Island Pork, they filled the Afterhold with Sand Ballast, that we had

been at so much Pain* to get out The Schooner North West America, and the Felice being

daily expected in, none of us were permitted to speak to the Natives, although I found an Opportunity to acquaint M‘ Quilla, and the other Chiefs, as did Mr. Ingraham, Chief Officer of the Columbia. We requested them to have Boats ready to go off to Captain Shears and Captain Funter, and acquaint them not to come into Nootka. That I was Chet led they told

us they understood. They wanted to know if I was now a Colt, that is, a Slave — that if I would go with him, they would send Boats to watch for an Opportunity to carry me off. They instantly shifted their Village about Four Miles to the Northward, so that I am in great Hopes both Captains Shears and Funter will have Intelligence of my being captured. One of my People on Board the Iphigenia, the Servant, was bargaining with the Natives for some Fish they had in their Boat; the Spaniards not understanding what was said, he was ordered on Board the Commodore’s Ship, and put into the Stocks, where he was strictly examined, and threatened severely, if he did not tell whether he had mentioned to the Natives for them to go and acquaint Captains Shears and Funter not to come into Nootka. When they found he had not mentioned any Thing about- the other Vessels, they wanted to know if the Natives had not told him they had seen a Vessel in the Offing. He told them they had not. He was after this set at Liberty, but ordered never to converse with the Indians, nor speak to them in future. I afterwards had a Conference with Captain Kendrick; he denied being accessary to my being taken; that the Spanish Commodore had

?entioneu to him he would take Captain Shears risoner as soon as he arrived in the Harbour; that he had said every Thing, and had made Use of all his Interest to prevent my being taken Prisoner. How far this is true I shall leave it for him to discover. On the 22d the Irons arrived from Maweena, which were made by Captain Kendrick's Armourer. We were now to proceed instantly to St. Blows, and I was once more requested to choose One Half of my Men, as the other Half was to remain with my Officers. Finding not One of them would enter, or desert me, I declined giving the Preference to any. Before we sailed, I requested my own private Papers might be delivered up, likewise a Copy of my Portuguese Papers, which was promised me. The Interpreter, when he came to that Part which mentions my defending myself in case I am attacked, and if I had the Superiority, to carry the Aggressors to Macao to be tried for the Insult, he mentioned to the Commodore, in my Presence, he thought the Papers very good. I told him, if that was the only Cause he had to alledge against me, it would not be difficult for me to cast him in any Court of Justice in Europe. He had now got every Thing out of her that he took a Liking to; and what Things I had belonging to myself he robbed me of in as gentle a Manner as he possibly could, by letting me know he must have my Gold Watch, my Sectant, my Stove, and all my Charts; likewise all my long Feathers, Cloaks, ana Caps, that Tyana and his Relations presented me with; even my Shoes and Boots, and very Bed Cloaths went; as a Reason for doing so, he told me some of those Things could be got at Mexico. He now proposed to return the Vessel, and supply me with Provisions to carry me to the Sandwich Islands, if I would sign a Paper that was already prepared and presented me. This I refused nto comply with, till I had Witnesses, and knew the Contents of the Paper. Mr. How, Supercargo of the was requested

to write a Letter to Captain Kendrick and Mr. Ingraham, to come down from' Maweena, to be Witnesses to the Papers I was to sign. . On the 24th they arrived; the Papers were interpreted to me,

which mentioned he arrived on such a Day, and found me in the Bay of St. Lawrence, Nootka; that I was in Distress, and in Want of every Thing; that he had not stopped my Navigation, but supplied me with every Necessary I was in Want of to carry me to the Sandwich Islands. This Paper 1 refused signing, fof Two Reasons; One was, he had not only stopped me in my Navigation, but had taken Possession of the Ship, and every Thing that belonged to her; another was, the Spaniards could lay no Claim to a Port they had never before seen, nor had any of the King of Spain's Vessels ever entered. The Commodore said, in the Year 1775» he was Second Officer on Board a King’s Frigate that was on Discovery, that saw the Port, and named it the Bay of Si. Lawrence I told him, having the Chart of that Voyage by me, I begged Leave to differ in Opinion from him. If I did not choose to sign the Papers, he told me he would keep the Vessel, and send her along the Coast as a Privateer to trade with the Natives. The Paper* were instantly laid aside, and Captain Kendrick went up to Maweena. The same Evening he told me his Orders were to take Captain Kendrick, if he should fall in with him any where in those Seas; and mentioned it as a great Secret, that he would take both him and the Sloop Washington as soon as she arrived in Port; The 24th and 25th, a heavy Gale blew from the S. W. the Spanish Vessels had each Four Anchors a-head; the Commodore requested I would go on board the Iphigenia Nubiana, with my Officers and People, and secure her; having nothing on Board to secure her with, I declined having any thing to do with her; he was therefore under the Necessity of sending Two Hawsers of Eight-Inch, and making her fast to Hog Island. As I was not permitted to go on Shore, I did not know much of what was carrying forward; they were busy in erecting Forts on Hog Island, and by what I learned, they were cutting down large Trees to build Houses. The Commodore acquainted me, that last Year when he was at Oonalaska, Mr. Ismylojf told him he expected Three Vessels from Kamschatka, with a Number of Men; that

on their Arrival at Oonalaska, he was to take the Command, and conduct them to Nootka Sound, where they were to form a Settlement; that he expected to arrive at Nootka by the Middle of July, er 1st of August, 1789; that Two Russian Frigates were to sail from Petersburgh, by the Way of Cape Horn, and join them in Nootka Sound with Stores and other Necessaries that they might want. On his Arrival at St. Blows last Year he sent an Express to the Vicerdy, who ordered him to sail immediately for Nootka, and erect Forts to keep the Russians out. He likewise acquainted me, that in the Year 1786, Two English Vessels were cast away, One was drove ashore at her Anchors on the Island Maidenoi Ostroff; that all the Hands perished except Three Men that happened to be on Shore; they were sent over Land to Petersburgh. The Officers of foe other Vessel being on Shore they put to Sea, and as there was no Person on Board that could navigate foe Vessel, she was never afterwards seen or heard of As they now had got Possession of my Charts and Journals, the Spanish Commodore intended to send the St. Carlos, Captain Arrow, to foe Northward, as soon as they could get her Bottom cleaned and her Sides caulked. Captain Kendrick was likewise ready for Sea, and he was going to push to the Northward. My People were after me every Hour of foe Day, requesting I would sign the Papers that they might get on Board their own Vessel. Although the Commodore had promised to supply me with what he thought would be necessary to carry me to the Sandwich Islands, and made this Promise before Mr. How and Mr. Ingraham, still there was no Dependence to be put in his Word; however on the 26th this Paper was once more produced. The

Portuguese

13° Mail.

Portuguese Captain Fiona said it tvas a Pass for him; and signed the Paper. I was under the Necessity of doing the same. At Eleven o’Clock on the 26th I Carried my People on Board, and took Possession of the Iphigenia Nubiana. I was not above Half an Hour on Board, when a Message came, that I was wanted on Board the Princessa. When I went on Board, I was told by Don Stephen Joseph Martinez (in the Presence of Mr. Ingraham) that although he had given me back the Iphigenia Nubiana, he would not permit me to sail till the Arrival of the Schooner North-lVest America, and that I must sell her to him for the Price that Captain Kendrick and Officers should set on her. I told him the Schooner did not belong to me; that I had no Power to sell her; that he might act as he thought proper on the Occasion. In the Afternoon the Spaniards left the Ship,’ each carrying off what he could lav his Hands on.

May 27th. Cloudy Weather, with the Wind from the West; loosed the Sails to dry; employed heaving out the Sand Ballast.* In the Evening the Commodore acquainted me he had Intelligence from the Natives that the Schooner was in a Port a little Way to the Northward. He got out some Ink and Paper, and requested I would write a Letter to Captain to

come into Nootka Sound. This I would not comply with, so that he refused to send my Stores, or any of his own, on Board me.

28th. Fresh Breezes and fair Weather; employed -fitting the Rigging in its old Places.

29th. On the 29th, I made out a List of what Articles I was in want of; I desired the Portuguese Captain to write it off and present it, as my chief Demand was One Cable of Eleven-Inch, Bread, some Pitch and Tar, together with Forty Fathoms of Four-Inch Rope for Top-Sail Sheets, and the Rope that was wove when the Vessel was in their Possession. The Commodore sent me Word he would let me have what Things he thought necessary, and what he could best spare, so that I received on Board the following Articles; viz.One Cask of Beef for Three Casks of Sandwich Island Pork that was kept; Four Bags, weighing each 20 lb.; One Box of Bread, weighing about 150 lb.; Two Bags of Rice, Four of Beans, Eight Ditto of Flour, One Chest of Pitch, One Bladder of Tar, and One 18 Gallon Keg of Spanish Brandy; Rope of Three-Inch, 18 Fathoms; One Coil of One and an Half Inch, containing 50 Fathoms, and 30 Fathoms of Two Inch. The rest of the Cordage and ether Things were wove and sent on Board when I was a Prisoner.

May 30th. Employed rigging the Top Gallant Masts. In the Afternoon an Accodht of the Articles we had received was brought on Board, charging Five Times the Quantity, and Five Times the Sum they cost; in short, I was going to return most of them, but I found if I returned any I must return the Whole. As I had made no Charge against him of my Pork, Iron, Copper, Watch, Stove, Sextant, my Cloaks, Caps, and Charts, which he had deprived me of; on this Account I granted him the Bills he requested. There was another Thing I was obliged to comply with; my Servant being a Manilla Man, by great Promises he got him to enter on Board the Princessa. — I was therefore under the Necessity of discharging him, and paying his Wages up to the Day he wa3 discharged.

May 31st. As I was determined to be detained no longer, I went on Board in the Morning of the 31st, and acquainted Don Stephen Joseph Martinez, that the Moment the Wind favoured me I would sail for the Sandwich Islands. I found there were Objections made. — The Commodore acquainted me, he had Information and was told I intended to go to the Northward. As I had taken great Care not to give the least Hint to

Vol. 45.

any Person of my future intentions, I mentioned, that Intelligent whoever he was that respecting

could not be so well acquainted With the State of my 41

Vessel as he was himself; that by his own Calculation I had not above Six Weeks Provisions; that he had only left me 10 or 12 Bars of Iron, which would only purchase the as many Sea Otter Skins, and if I was even to dispose of them, the Consequence would be but small; we should only be starved before we got to Macao', as be had left us nothing else to purchase bur Hogs with at the Sandwich Islands; besides he had not left me a Chart to carry me to China, let alone along the Coasts of America. My People, I told him, were on high Wages, and that it was necessary for me to make the best of my Way to MaCao, having no other Prospect but to lessen the Expences of the Voyage as much as lay in my Power.

June 1st. I gave Orders to unmoor, and requested he would let me have my great Guns, small Arms, and Ammunition, which he complied with. Captain Kenrtck and Officers having come down from they acquainted me the Columbia would sail the Day following to the Northward. Another Paper was produced, which the Commodore requested I would sign; and to be witnessed by Captain Kendrick and Mr.

Ingraham, the Contents of this Paper they told me was, if my Portuguese Papers were bad the Vessel was to be delivered up at Macao. It was easy to see through those Artifices. I signed the Papfer after the Portuguese Captain, and requested a Copy, but this was not complied with. A Dinner being provided on Board the Princessa, every Method was made use of by Captain Ke?idrick and others, to find out if I intended to touch to the Northward. I gave them the same Answers as before, telling them I had no Intention to throw away the Lives of my People. On this Day they drank my Health, wishing me a good Voyage to Macao, and accompanied it with Thirteen Guns. As soon as Dinner was over I went on Board, accompanied by Captain Kendrick and Officers, and the Spanish Commodore. A light Breeze springing up from the Northward, I gave Orders to get under Way.

The Commodore told me I must leave a Letter fof Captain Funster if he should arrive in Nootka Sound to sell the Schooner. I acquainted him, Captain Funster nor myself had neither Power nor Authority to sell the Schooner; that I would write a Letter and leave it with him, to be delivered in case of his returning to Nootka Sound. I shall here insert a Copy of the Letter I left.

“ To Captain Robert Funster, Commander of “ the Schooner North-West America.

“ Sir,

“ On the 6th of May, a Spanish Ship of War “ arrived in Friendly Cove, Nootka Sound, commanded by Commodore Don Stephen Joseph Martinez; on the 13th the Snowr S* Carlos “ arrived; on the Morning of the 14th the Iphi* “ genia Nubiana was seized, and we were made “ Prisoners, it being alleged our Papers were “ not good. This being cleared up, I am now “ pennitted to sail to Macao, being supplied “ with Stores and Provisions to carry me to the “ Sandwich Islands. As there is no Account of “ Captain Shears, I am afraid some Accident “ has happened to him between the Sandwich “ Islands and China; if that is the Case you will “ be but poorly off for Provisions. My own “ Situation prevents me from giving you any “ Assistance: I must therefore leave you to your “ own good Conduct, being as much at a Loss " how to act as you can be. All that I have 6 F “to

Friendly Cove, Noolka See.

" Sound, 1 June 1789. . IV. Douglas."

The Moment I had finished my Letter I gave Orders to slip the Hawser, and made Sail out of the Cove, the Fort on Little Hog Island saluting me with Five Guns which I begged to be excused returning. At 3 P. M. the Spanisn Commodore and Captain Kendrick left me and went on Shore. As the Wind was from the Northward I stood to the Southward under all Sail; at Sunset Nootka Sound bore N. HalfW. Distance Seven or Eight Leagues.

June 2d. Having got out of the Hands of my Enemies,

I was now at Liberty to judge for myself; knowing it would be a Length of Time before the Spaniards could have their Snow ready which they intended to send to the Northward, and being of Opinion they would not permit Captain Kendrick to sail before he was ready, the Interval was therefore mine. I had no Idea of running for Macao, with only between Sixty and Seventy

Sea Otter Skins which I had on Board. My People had been accustomed to short Allowance, I therefore gave Orders at Midnight to put the Ship on the other Tack, and stand away to the Northward. I was in

feat Hopes I should fall in with Captain , and

am fully resolved if I do, to take the People and Cargo out of her, and set her on fire, if I find I cannot carry her along with me. At Noon we had thick hazy Weather; Nootka Sound bore N. E. Half E. Distance Fourteen Leagues.

In Mr. Mcars*s Memorial of 30//1 1790. (N* 9.)

Nootka Sound, July 12th, 1789.

Dear Sir,

I beg to inform you, per Favpur of Mr. Harnett, with our safe Arrival in Nootka Sound, after a pleasant Passage of Nine Weeks and Four Days, during which Time nothing materially happened. We lived in the greatest Harmony and good Friendship during the Time we have been together, and every Thing promised fair fora Continuation of the same, every Officer on Board seeming strenuous for their Employers Interest. We made the Coast of America, July 3d, at Woody Point, and stood along Shore under easy Sail iluring the Night. In the Morning several Natives came off, with the rest Counna Kedah (that was brought by you from Macao to Noot) from him we learnt there were Five Vessels in Friendly Cove, but could not learn of what Nation they were; however he informed ua they had captured tb e North-We American Schooner,

commanded by Mr. Funter. We immediately conjectured that the Vessels were some belonging to Mr. Etches, and the America Ship and Sloop. We made all the Sail we could, intending to get in that Night, if possible. On our nearing the Sound, we saw a Sloop coming out, which we were informed, was the Princess Royal, belonging to our Concern. We then had not the least Doubt but there were some of Mr. Etches Vessels in the Cove. When we were about Two Miles from the Entrance of the Sound, we saw a Boat coming towards us; it was then between Nine and Ten o’Clock, so that wc could not discern of what Country they were. They hailed us in Spanish; and asked if they might be permitted to come on Board.

Mail A. 1790.

They were answered in the Affirmative; on which they came alongside, and the Officer, with several other Gentlemen, stepped up. We found the former to be the Spanish Commodore; those who accompanied him were of his Ship. After having welcomed then! on Board, Captain Colnelt asked them down in the great Cabin; what their Conversation was there I am unacquainted with; but Captain Colnett soon told me his Intention was to go into Friendly Cove, and the Spanish Launch took us in Tow accordingly. About len Minutes after this, came on Board Mr. Barnett, whom I directly introduced to Captain Colnett, who informed him that there was a Spanish Frigate of ad Guns, and a Snow of 16, lying in the Cove, as also the Atnerican Ship and Sloop; that the former had erected a Fort on Hog Island, on which 1C Guns were, mounted, and had taken Possession of the Sound in the Name of his most Catholic Majesty, Carolus the 3d, King of Spain; that they had captured the Schooner, and plundered the Iphigenia Nubiana, but had permitted Captain Hudson to proceed without any Molestation. As the Commodore heard this Intelligence, he immediately gave Captain Colnett his Word and Honour that he would not offer to detain him, but give him every Assistance in his Power, in doing which, he only complied with the King of Spain's Orders. Under these Circumstances, and depending on his Honour, Captain Colnett entered the Cove, and brought up between the Frigate and Snow, though I must add, Mr. Barnet, with others of our Well-wishers, advised us to anchor without Side the Cove* that we might take a View of the surrounding Objects, in the Morning. Every Tiling that Night, and fh© next Morning, seemed to wear a favourable Aspect, no Obstacle arising that might stop our Departure. In the Afternoon Captain Colnett went on Board the Commodore’s Ship, and requested his Permission for go to Sea immediately, which at first was granted,’ but on second Consideration the Commodore desired to see his Papers. Captain Colnett left the Commodore, and came on Board of his own Vessel, where, after having put on the Company’s Uniform, and his Hanger, be took his Papers on Board the Commodore. He was then informed by that Gentleman, that he could not sail that Day, on which some high Word* ensued between them, and Captain Colnett insisted on going out immediately, which he said he would do, unless the Commodore fired a shot at him; if so, ha would then haul down his Colours, and deliver him* self up a Prisoner. Hardly had he uttered tins, but he was put under an Arrest, his Sword taken from him, the Vessel seized, and the Officers and Crew taken out, and sent Prisoners, some on Board the Ship, and the rest on Board of the Snow; but what is most particular, we desired Captain Kendrick to load his Guns with Shot, to take a Vessel that had only Two Swivels mounted, so that it was impossible to make any- Resistance against such Superiority; indeed it would have been Madness to have attempted it The Commodore’s Passion how began to abate a little, and he sent for me from the Saint Carlos, where I was imprisoned. When I came to him, he seemed to profess a very great Friendship for me, and appeared to he exceeding sorry for what he said his Officers compelled him to do. He declared to me, that he had given Captain Colnett Permission to depart, and would have assisted him all in his Power, but that Captain Colnett insisted on erecting a Fort opposite to his, said he represented the King oiGreat Britain, and that he came to take Possession in His Britannic Majesty’s Name. The Spaniard quoted the same, and said he was Representative of his most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain; but I have ©very Reason to suspect there was a Misunderstanding between the Two Parties, for the Linguist spoke English very imperfectly, 01 and

Nootka Sound, July 14th, 1789.

Dear Sir,

Yesterday, at 2 P. M. a Sail was seen in the Offing, coming round Breakers Point from the Southward, standing into the Sound: As she neared the Shore, we perceived her to be the Sloop Princess Royal, Captain Hudson. — At 7 she came to an Anchor about Two or P. S. I am sorry to inform you that the Spaniards Three Miles from the Cove, and Captain Hudson him-have taken the chief Part of our Copper, all our Guns, self came into the Cove in his Boat, with Four of his Shot, and Powder, with the spare Canvas, &c. The People, when instantly as he made his Appearance in Vo l. 45. the

Intelligent respecting Capture* at Nootku.

the Cove, the Spanish Boat boarded him, and took him and his People on Board the Commodore as Prisoners. His Motive for coming in, from what I could learn from himself, was to see if Captain was there

in order to receive his Orders how he was to proceed in future. Whether Captain s Conduct in this

Proceeding is blameable or not, I leave to your superior Judgment.

We are now out of the Cove into

the Mouth of the Sound, and are positively to sail Tomorrow Mottling for St. Bias. The Sloop is towed into the Cove within all the Shipping; and the Spaniards from every Appearence have finally captured her.

Captain Hudson seems very much hurt from his Misfortune, and candidly declares that it is entirely from his own Simplicity, and being too credulous of the Spaniards Honour, that has brought him into the disagreeable Dilemma.

Captain Coilnett is much better Today, and in general discourses very rationally. I have endeavoured to persuade him to draw out every Particular concerning our being captured, to send to his Employers, which he refuses: His Objection is, that he has involved himself and every one else into Difficulties that he is not able to extricate himself from, and therefore declares to me that he will have no more Concerns with the Charge of the Vessel, but leaves every Thing entirely to me, which I have, but most reluctantly, complied with, knowing that I cannot acquit myself with Satisfaction to myself, nor unr doubtedly more so to my Employers. Nevertheless,

if the Vessel is delivered up at St. Bias, as the Commodore gives me every Reason to hope that she will* I will endeavour to the utmost in my Power to do every Thing in my Power that may be any Ways beneficial to my Employers.

The Commodore wanted Captain Coilnett to sell all his Copper to him, and he would give him Bills 'lor the as he valued it, which Captain Coilnett

had complied with; but I objected, as I thought if his Orders tolerated him to capture the Vessel, they would undoubtedly tolerate him to capture the Cargo likewise. We are deficient in a great Deal of Copper, as I mentioned in my former, but Mr. Barnett will be able to inform you 1 imagine where it goes to.

Accompanying this, I send under the Care of Mr. Barnett a Copy of my Journal from , wherein you will find the principal Occurrences that have happened to us since our Departure. I have nothing more to add; neither have I Opportunity to do it, the Vessel being continually crowded with People from the different Ships, so beg you will present my Compliments to Mr. M‘Intire, and every other Gentleman in Macao; and remain,

Dear Sir, most obediently your’s,

B. Dnffin.

A Petition of the Trades House of Glasgow, was presented to the House, and read; Taking Notice of the Bill for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Corn imported, and of the Bounty on British Com exported; and Setting forth, That although the avowed Purpose of the said Bill is to subject all Britain to one and the same Law in that necessary and important Article, it contains Clauses depriving the Petitioners of the Benefit derived from the Privilege of regulating Importation by the Prices in each County separately, and at the same Time continuing a Discrimination betwixt the Two Kingdom in the Article of Oat-meal, which is of the first Importance to the People of Scotland, equally subversive of the Meaning and Spirit of the Union, and their Rights as British Subjects, as contrary to Justice and sound Policy: That the Privilege granted by the Com Law at present in Force in that Country, of regulating the Importation by the Prices in each County separately, has had the most beneficial Consequences, has been proved not only by the Establishment and rapid Improvement of several valuable Branches of Manufacture in the West of Scotland, which give Bread to some Hundred Thousands of industrious People, for whose Subsistence Importation is always necessary, but also by a correspondent Improvement of Agriculture, and Rise in the Rent and Value of Land, to all which, as well as to the Peace and Quiet of the Country, the Petitioners are apprehensive of the most serious Consequences, if the District in which they are classed be not as much confined in Point of Extent as possible, and every Discrimination betwixt the Two Kingdoms removed; and that, independent of the Distress apprehended from the said Clauses to their Manufactures and Commerce, and the Danger of Scarcity and popular Commotions, the Petitioner beg Leave to represent, that subjecting that Part of the United Kingdom to a separate Regulation respecting Oat-meal, and especially when it is considered that such Regulation must have the same Effect to raise the Price of it in Scotland above that of England, is not only subversive of the Right which every Subject of Britain has to the Enjoyment of eqnal Laws, especially in Matters of Trade and Commerce, but may be drawn into a Precedent to justify a partial Tax of the raw Materials of their Manufactures (to which Grain, and all Kinds of Provisions, are precisely similar) or any other Commodity in particular Districts of the Kingdom, altogether irreconcileable to the Rules of Justice and sound Policy: And therefore praying the House to afford such Relief in the Premises as to the House shall seem proper.

A Petition of the Merchants House of Glasgow was also presented to the House, and read; Containing the same Allegations and Prayer as the preceding Petition.

30 Geo. III. 17° Man. 491

A Petition of the Annual Committee of the Convention of Royal Boroughs of Scotland was also presented to the House, and read; taking Notice of the said Bill; and Setting forth, That the same contains Regulations for Scotland, particularly relating to the Article of Oat-meal, not only different from those to be established in England, but obviously and essentially injurious to that Country: And therefore praying, That they may be heard, by Counsel, against the exceptionable Parts of the said Bill, and that such Relief may be afforded in the Premises as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the Magistrates and Town Council of the Borough of Greenock, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That by an Act, passed in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, the Importation of Oat-meal into Scotland was prohibited, unless where the Price of that Article exceeded Sixteen Shillings per Boll, while the same Commodity was allowed to be imported into England when the Price of middling British Oats amounted to Sixteen Shillings per Quarter; and that, by the said Bill, it is proposed to continue the 6ame Prohibition, and, as Oat-meal constitutes a principal Part of the Food of the Poor, the Labourer, and of those who are employed in the Fisheries in Scotland, the Petitioners submit it to the House, that it would be highly impolitic and unjust to continue the Import Price of that Commodity more than Twenty per Cent. higher to the Inhabitants of Scotland, than to their Fellow Subjects in England, and therefore the Importation of Oat-meal into Scotland ought to be permitted, in all Time coming, when the Price of middling British Oats amounts to Sixteen Shillings per Quarter; and that, by the aforesaid Act, the Importation and Exportation of Grain into the different Counties of Scotland were to be regulated by the Price of Grain in each particular County, but by the said Bill it is proposed to divide Scotland into Districts, and to regulate the Importation and Exportation of Grain by the Average Prices in each District: That, in particular, the District in which the Town of Greenock is to be comprehended is proposed to consist of the Counties of Lanark, Renfrew, Dumbarton, Argyle, Ayr, Bute, the Western

Island, and the West Coasts of the Counties of -vemess, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, but, the Petitioners submit it to the House, that the Price of Grain in the plentiful County of or in the

thinly Inhabited Western Islands, and the West Coasts of the Counties of Inverness, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, where the greatest Part of the Corn produced is of an inferior Quality, ought not to regulate the Importation of Grain into the County of which, though of small Extent, contains the populous Towns of Paisley, Renfrew, Po and Greenock, besides many Villages, and the Petitioners trust, that the House will see it just, that the Importation of Grain into the County of Renfrew ought either to be regulated by the Price in the County itself, or at least by the Average Price of Grain in Renfrew, Lanark, Dumbarton, Ayr, Argyle, and Bute, the Coun-

ties immediately adjoining; and that the Petitioners observe, that the Port of Greenock is omitted in the said Bill as a Port where Grain may be Warehoused when the Ports are shut, although by far the greatest Part of the Grain consumed on both Sides of the Frith of Clyde is imported at that Port, and for that Reason the Petitioners submit to the House the Propriety of appointing the Port of Greenock amongst those in which Gram may be Warehoused when the Ports are shut: And therefore praying the House to alter or amend the said Bill in the above Particulars, or to give the Petitioners such Relief as to the House shall seem just, and to allow the Petitioners to be Vol.4&

heard, by Counsel, at the Bar of the House, in Support of the Premises.

A Petition of the Merchants House of Greenock, Petition re* was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, *Pect'"8 t,e That by an Act, passed in the Thirteenth Year of laUon BiSl* His present Majesty, the Importation of Oat-meal into Scotland was prohibited, unless when the Price of that Article exceeded Sixteen Shillings per Boll, while the same Commodity was allowed to be imported into England when the Price of middling British Oats amounted to Sixteen Shillings per Quarter, which corresponds nearly to Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence per Boll in Scotland’, and that,

-by a Bill depending before the House, it is -proposed to continue the same Prohibition, and, as Oat-meal constitutes a very principal Part of the Food of the Poor, the Labourer, and the Manufacturer, and of those who are employed in the Fisheries of Scotland, the Petitioners submit to die House, that it would be highly oppressive and unjust to continue the Import Price of that Article more than Twenty per Cent. higher to the Inhabitants of Scotland than to their Fellow' Subjects in England, and that therefore the Importation of Oat-meal into Scotland ought to be permitted, as in England, when the Price of Oats is at Sixteen Shillings per Quarter; and that, by the aforesaid Act, the Importation and Exportation of Grain into the different Counties of Scotland was regulated by the Average Price of Grain in each County, but,

by the said Bill, it is proposed to divide Scotland into Three Districts, and to regulate the Importation and Exportation by the Average Price in each District:

That in particular the District, in which the Town of Greenock is to be comprehended, is to consist of no less than Seven whole Counties; viz. Lanark, Renfrew,

Dumbarton, Argyle, Ayr, Bute, and besides

the Western Islands, and Part of the distant Counties of Inverness, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness; and that the Price of Grain in the plentiful County of Wigton, or in the thinly Inhabited Northern Counties (where the Corn is of an inferior Quality) ought not to regulate the Importation of Grain into the County of Renfrew, which, though of small Extent, contains, besides many large Villages, the populous Towns of Paisley,

Retfrew, Port Glasgow, and Greenock, and from the Two last-mentioned Places the principal Fisheries in Scotland are. carried on, which, the Petitioners apprehend, the present Bill will materially injure, and therefore trust that the House will see the Justice of allowing the Importation of Grain into the County of Renfrew to he regulated by the Price of Corn in the County itself, or by the Average Price in Renfrew,

Lanark, Ayr, Dumbarton, Argyle, and Bute, the Counties immediately adjoining: And therefore praying the House to alter or amend the aforesaid Bill in the above Particulars, or to give the Petitioners such Relief as the House shall see just, and to allow the Petitioners to be heard, at the Bar, in Support of the Premises.

Ordered, That the said Petition be referred to the Consideration of the Committee of the whole House, to w'hom the Bill for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Corn imported, and of the Bounty on British Com exported, is re-committed.

Ordered, That the Serjeant at Arms attending Trial of Mr. this House, do go, with the Mace, into the Lobby, Hasting*, and Places adjacent, and the Passages leading to Westminster Hall, and summon the Members there to attend their Service in the House immediately.

And the said Order being read accordingly;

Mr. Frederick Montagu reported from the Com- Reasons for mittee, who were appointed to draw up Reasons to be disagreeing offered to the I-ords, at a Conference, for disagreeing t^II^>nr^entJ to such of the Amendments made by their Lordships to the ^ar-to the Bill, intituled, An Act for enlarging and better wick Gaol regulating the Gaol for the County of Warwick, as Bill, agreed this House hath disagreed to; That the Committee to-had drawn up Reasons accordingly, which they had directed him to report to the House; and he read the Report in his Place; and afterwards delivered it in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same Was read; and is as followeth; viz.

To the First Amendment made by your Lordships, in Press 19. Lines 30 and 31. which is to leave out the Words “ have been usually or,” the Commons disagree; because the restraining of the Proceeding directed by this Clause to the Provisions of the Act 12th Geo. II. (which is the Object of this Amendment) may, where the Usage has been otherwise, be attended with considerable Inconvenience and Difficulty.

To the Second Amendment made by your Lordships, ' in Press 19. Line 33. the Commons agree.

To the Third Amendment made by your Lordships, in Press 21. Line 7. the Effect of which Amendment appears to be to lay the Whole of the Expences to be incurred by this Bill on all the Persons liable to pay the County Rate, the Commons disagree; because it does not appear to them either necessary or proper, with respect to such Expences, to follow the Method prescribed by the Act of the 11 th and 12th of King William, for enabling Justices of the Peace to build and repair Gaols, unless in the common and ordinary Cases of repairing or re-building Gaols, in their ancient Form and Manner, at a moderate Expence, and where the other Regulations and Requisitions of that Act are complied with — Because also, That when any new and extensive Plan is adopted for building a Gaol, in which the Number of Cells and Apartments is to be greatly encreased, for the various Purposes of better securing or punishing of Offenders, and preserving the Health of the Prisoners confined therein, and Houses and Lands are to be purchased for the Scite of such Gaol, and other Conveniences adjoining thereto, by which a great additional Expence is to be incurred, so that the Provisions of the said Act of King William are insufficient for the Purpose of carrying such Plan into Execution, and it is therefore become necessary for the Parties to apply to Parliament for further Powers — the Commons think it proper to be attentive to the Method by which such Expence is to be defrayed; to the End that it may be imposed, not on the temporary Farmer or Occupier of the Land, but on those who have a more permanent Interest in the Subject, and are the best able to bear any extraordinary Burthen.

And as an additional Reason to induce your Lordships to waive such of your Amendments as the Commons have disagreed to, they think it right to state to your Lordships several Instances of Bills, for similar Purposes with the present, and of a recent Date, sent by the Commons to your Lordships, to which your

29 Geo. III. Essex Shire House. Tenants to deduct Half the Rate.

For these and other Reasons, which have induced the Commons to disagree as well to the First as to the Third of your Lordships Amendments, and which other Reasons the Commons decline offering at present, the Commons hope that your Lordships will not insist on such of the Amendments proposed by your Lords!tips as the Commons have disagreed to, as the Loss of the Bill will, as the Commons apprehend, be attended with considerable public Inconvenience.

The said Reasons being severally read a Second Time, were, upon the Question severally put thereupon, agreed to by the House.

Ordered, That a Conference be desired with the Lords, upon the Subject Matter of the Amendments made by their Lordships to the 6aid Rill.

directed to be reported to the House; which he nead in his Place; and afterwards delivered in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the same was read; and is as followeth; viz.

Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this Committee,

The said Resolution being read a Second Time, was, upon the Question put thereupon, agreed to by the House.

Ordered, That a Bill be brought in upon the said Resolution: And that Mr. Gilbet'i, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Edxoard James Eliot, the Earl of Mornington, the Lord Bayham, Mr. Attorney General,

Mr- Solicitor General, Mr. Rose, and Mr. Steele, do prepare, and bring in, the same.

Mr, Pole Carew reported to the House, That he The Lords having, according to Order, been with the Lords, to desire a Conference upon the Subject Matter of the Con erenec' Amendments made by their Lordships to the Bill, intituled, An Act for enlarging and better regulating the Gaol for the County of Warwick, the Lords do agree to a Conference, and appoint the same presently, in the Painted Chamber.

Ordered, That the Committee who were appointed Managers to draw up Reasons to be offered to the Lords, at a appointed. Conference, for disagreeing to such of the Amendments made by their Lordships to the said Bill, as this House hath disagreed to, do manage the Conference.

Ordered, That Mr. Burke, Mr. Francis, Sir Joseph Maxcbey, Sir William Young, Mr. Milford, and General Burgoyne, be added to the said Managers.

And the Names of the Managers were called over; and they went to the Conference.

And being returned;

Mr. Frederick Montagu reported, That the Managers Conference had been at the Conference, and had delivered to the reported. Lords the Reasons for disagreeing to such of the Amendments, made by their Lordships to the 6aid Bill, as this House hath disagreed to; and had left the Bill, and Amendments, with their Lordships.

A Petition of the Master, Wardens, and Com- Petition monalty, of Merchant Venturers of the City of Bristol, against the under their Common Seal, was presented to the House, and read; Setting forth. That, by a Bill depending in the House, for regulating the Importation and Exportation of Corn, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Com imported, and on British Corn exported, there' are contained Clauses subjecting to Forfeiture any Ship or Vessel, and all her Guns,

Furniture, Ammunition, Tackle, and Apparel, in which any of the Articles mentioned in that Act shall be found, contrary to the Provisions of it: and that Penalties like those, so very excessive, and which fail not on the Offender, but on the Innocent, cannot but injure the Commerce, and ultimately the Resources and Revenue «f the Kingdom, and the 02 Petitioners

30 Geo, III.

27° M

Petitioners conceive, that the Purposes of the Bill may be effected with equal Certainty by Penalties more adequate to the Offence, and involving in the Punishment those only who have committed it: And therefore praying, That those Clauses in the said Bill, which the Merchant and Shipholder cannot but have the justest Reason to dread, may not pass into a Law, but that the Bill may undergo such Alteration as the House shall deem expedient.

Petition A Petition of the Merchants and Buss Owners of

against the the Borough of Rothesay, was also presented to the House, and read; Setting forth, That, by an Act, passed in the Thirteenth Year of His present Majesty, the Importation of Oat-meal iuto Scotland is prohibited, unless when the Price of that Article exceeds Sixteen Shillings per Boll, while the same Article is allowed to be imported into England when the Price of Oats amounts to Sixteen Shillings per Quarter, which is nearly equal to Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence per Boll of Meal, and, by a Bill now depending in the House, the same Restriction is proposed to be continued; and that the Petitioners live in an Island, the Annual Produce of which, though indeed fruitful, is insufficient for the Maintenance of the Inhabitants of Rothesay for One-Fourth of the Year: That above a Hundred Vessels belong to the Port, most of which are employed in the British White Herring Fishery, and the Advantages derived to the Public from such a Nursery for Seamen are so well known, as to render them unnecessary to be enumerated: And, when it is considered how inadequate the Produce of the whole Island is to the Maintenance of that Place alone, what a vast Quantity of Provisions is necessary for so many Busses, and that Oat-meal, a principal Article, is only to be had at the highest Rate, which must prove highly prejudicial to the Fishing, as well as the Manufactures of Scotland in general, by raising the Wages of the Labouring Poor, it is presumed the House will be disposed to look upon the Difference between Scotland and England, in regard to the Importation of Grain, as truly impolitic and partial, and will, in future, permit the Importation of it into Scotland upon the same Terms it is allowed to be imported into England; and that by the above-mentioned Act the Importation into, and Exportation from, the different Counties is regulated by the Price of Grain in each County, whereas, by the said Bill, it is proposed to divide Scotland into different Districts, and to regulate the Importation and Exportation by the Average Price of Grain in each District; and that the District, in which the 6aid Borough is to be comprehended, is proposed to consist of the Counties of Lanark, Dumbarton, Argyle, Ayr, Bute, JVigton, the Western Islands, and

the West Coasts of the Counties of Inverness, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, but the Petitioners submit to the House, that the Importation of Grain to that Place, where there is so great a Demand for it, ought not to be regulated by the Prices either in the plentiful County of JVigton, or the thinly inhabited Western Islands, but by the Price in the County of Bute, or at least by the Average Price in it, and the adjoining Counties of Renfrew, Lanark, Dumbarton, Ayr, and Argyle, and, the Petitioners beg Leave also to submit, that in ca9e of any Importation when the Port is shut, that the Meal or Grain imported should be allowed to be Warehoused in joint Custody till the'--Port shall be opened: And therefore praying the House to alter or amend the aforesaid Bill in the Manner submitted by the Petitioners, or to give them such Relief as to the House shall seem just.

And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the Table, until the Report from the Committee of the whole House, to whom the Bill for regulating the Importation and Ex--Yol. 45.

portation of Cent, and the Payment of the Duty on Foreign Corn imported, and of the Bounty on British Corn exported, was re-committed, be taken into further Consideration.

Mr. Speaker spoke to him in the following Manner:

Mr. Scott,

The House have resolved that you, being the Author of a Letter, which the House have declared to be a scandalous and libellous Paper, reflecting on the Honour and Justice of this House, and on the Conduct of the Managers appointed to manage the Impeachment now depending against Warren Hastings, Esquire, are guilty of a Violation of your Duty as a Member of this IIo u?e, and of a high Breach of the Privilege of this House.

On the Nature and Magnitude of your Offence it is unnecessary for me to dwell: Whatever has a Tendency to depreciate the Honour and Justice of this House, particularly in the Exercise of its Inquisitorial

Functions,

520

28° M

A. 1700.

Functions, tends, in the same Proportion, to weaken and degrade the Energies and Dignity of the British Constitution.

The Privileges of this House have a Claim to the Respect of every Subject of this Country; as a Member of this House, it is your Duty, as it is a Part of your Trust, to support and to protect them. Had a Sense of these Obligations produced its due Influence on your Mind and Conduct, you would have avoided the Displeasure of the House, and I should have been spared the Pain of declaring to you the Result of it. The Moderation of the House is not, however, less manifest on this Occasion than their just Sense of their own Dignity, and of the Importance of their own Privileges. It is my Duty, in addressing you, to be guided by the Lenity which marks their Proceedings; and, in the Persuasion that the Judgment of the House will operate as an effectual Admonition to yourself and to others, I forbear to say more than that the House have directed, that I reprimand you for your said Offence: And, in Obedience to their Commands, I do reprimand you accordingly.

Mr. Scott's Whereupon Mr. Scott said,

Speech. *

Mr. Speaker,

I beg Leave to return you my warmest Acknowledgments for the very handsome and liberal Manner in which you have executed the Orders of the House.

I can only repeat, Sir, what I have Twice said before, that I had not the most distant Idea of violating any Privilege that the House in its Wisdom would chuse to enforce: Having diligently attended my Duty since I have been a Member, 1 have observed that Gentlemen of the first Consideration have been in the Habit of publishing to the World their Sentiments upon the most important Transactions in this House — If I have been led into an Error, it has been by taking these great Authorities for my Guide; I can only express my Concern that by so doing I have drawn upon myself the Censure of this House; and I again beg Leave, Mr. Speaker, to repeat my sincere Thanks to you for the polite and candid Manner in which that Censure has been conveyed.

And the Messengers were again called in; and Mr. Speaker acquainted them therewith.

And then the Messengers again withdrew.

Ordered, That Mr. Eliot, Mr. Burges, Mr. Powys, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Brett, Mr. Plumer, Captain Berkeley, Mr. Henry Hobart, and Mr. Steele, be added to the said Managers.

And the Names of the Managers were, called over; and they went to the Conference.

And being returned;

Mr. Comptroller of the Household reported, That they had met the Lords at the Conference, which was managed, on the Part of the Lords, by the Duke of Leeds, who acquainted the Managers that the Lords do insist upon their Amendments to the Bill, intituled, An Act for enlarging and better regulating the Gaol for the County of Warwick, which this House had disagreed unto; for which the Lords gave their Reasons, which Mr. Comptroller of the Household read in his Place, and afterwards delivered the same, with the Bill and Amendments, in at the Clerk’s Table: Where the said Reasons were read; and are as followeth; viz.

The Lords, earnestly desirous to cultivate a good Understanding with the Commons, embrace with much Satisfaction the Opportunity afforded by the present Conference, to explain the Grounds and Reasons of the Amendments proposed in the Bill sent up by the Commons, intituled, An Act for enlarging and better regulating the Gaol for the County of Warwick.

The Burden of building, re-building, and repairing County Gaols, upon Presentment of the Insufficiency thereof, was by the Statute of n, 12 W. III. C. 19. distributed among the Divisions of the County, to be levied by separate Rates on each res|>ectively.

The Manner of raising this, and other County Charges, by so many distinct Assessments being found inconvenient, the same were by the 12 II. C. 29. directed to be assessed upon each Parish, in such Pro-

portions as the same had been usually assessed thereon, and made payable out of the Money collected on the Poor Rates, or, there being none such, by Rates to be made in like Manner.

By tile Act of the 14th of His present Majesty, C. 59. the Charge of adding Infirmaries, Baths, and other Conveniences to be provided in Prisons, was to be defrayed in the like Manner out of the County Rates.

By the Act of the 34th of His present Majesty, C. 54. Provision was made for removing, enlarging, building, re-building, or repairing, and also, for providing separate Apartments for various Classes of Prisoners, and a Chapel, and other Accommodations — Power is also given for purchasing Lands, enabling disabled Persons to seH, and compelling Persons who refuse — Salaries are given to Gamers in lieu of their former Profits.

All the Money requisite for these extraordinary Purposes is to be raised in the same Manner as Rates are directed to be raised by the above-mentioned Act of the 12 G.II. C. 29. with this Provision, that when

the Sum required exceeds One Half of the Average Amount of County Rates for the last Five Years, the same' may be raised by Mortgage, to be paid off in Fourteen Years.

The Law therefore, as it now stands, has provided for all the Purposes of the present Bill, except in building across a Lane adjoining the present Gad, and of raising the Money requisite by the Sale of Annuities, which are Additions to the former Laws, and also in the Two Particular? now in Question, Wherein the former Laws are repealed, as to the County of Warwick.

As to the First, the Bill sent up by the Commons provides, That the Money shall be assessed, collected, received, levied, paid, and accounted for, as the County Rates have usually been, or may be by the Act of 12 G. II. C. 29.

The last-mentioned Act, confirmed and enforced by the 14th and 24th of the present King, must have been the indispensable Rule of such Proceedings — No Deviation can have happened, without supposing Error or worse Abuse — No such Deviations have been suggested, and if any such exist in pact, the Lords conceive it would be unfit to give them the Sanction of Law, especially without knowing them — Nor can the Lord? conceive what Sort of Inconveniency or Difficulty can attend the due Execution of the Laws in being: The Commons have pointed out none such.

As to the Second, the Bill provides, That all Tenants shall deduct their Payments from their respective Lessors: This, in the Case of what are commonly called Beneficial Leases, will probably exhaust the whole reserved Rent, and that in Favour of the Beneficial Proprietor — In spine Cases the Mesne Tenant may have a Term of nearly the same Extent; and of less Value, than the Estate of the Occupier who holds of him. And in all Leases the Bill rescinds the Contract, by compelling the Lessor to pay what he has bargained with the Lessee that the last shall pay.

It may be ti;ue, that where an extraordinary Sum is to be raised in any One Year, the Burden may fall heavier on the Occupier than, he might have expected, in Fact, although he must be presumed tp know that he became liable to it when he took the Farm — However, the Legislature has thought fit to enter so far into this Consideration, as to divide such Sums into Fourteen Years, in order to lessen the Yearly Burden — This the Lords think the utmost Relief which in Justice can be afforded on the Occasion.

These Reasons, with others which the Lords for the present forbear to urge, make it necessary for the Lords to insist on all, their Amendments. And if the Commons continue to think that the Loss of the Bill will be attended with, considerable public Incon-

ot

venince, that Coftflidefation will afford an additional Reason for their Concurrence.

Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That this House doth insist upon their Disagreement with the Lords to -the said Amendments.

Resolved, That a free Conference be -desired with the Lords, upon the Subject Matter of the last Conference.

His Majesty’s After which His Majesty was pleased to make a most Speech. Gracious Speech from the Throne to both Houses of Parliament, as followeth; viz.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

The necessary Public Business being now concluded, I think it right to put an End to this Session of Parliament.

I have not hitherto received the Answer of the Court of Spain to the Representation which I have directed to be made at that Court, in Support of the Dignity of My Crown, and of the Interests of My People. I continue to entertain the strongest Desire for the Maintenance of Peace on just and honourable Grounds; but, under the present Circumstances, I feel it indispensably necessary to proceed with Expedition and

Vigour in those Preparations, the Objects of which have already received your unanimous Concurrence.

The Assurances and Conduct of My Allies, on this interesting Occasion, have manifested in the most satisfactory Manner their Determination to fulfil the Engagements of the existing Treaties; and I trust, that our mutual good Understanding and Concert will be productive of the happiest Effects in the present Conjuncture of Affairs in Europe.

Gentlemen of the House of Commons,

I return you My particular Thanks for the Readiness with which you granted the Supplies for the current Service, and foryour Unanimity and Dispatch in enabling Me to take those Measures which the present Crisis has rendered necessary.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

As I think it may be of material Convenience that the Election of a new Parliament should take Place without Delay, it is My Intention forthwith to give Directions for dissolving the present, and for calling a new Parliament. But, in signifying to you this Intention, I cannot omit to assure you of the deep and grateful Sense which I must ever entertain of that affectionate and unshaken Loyalty, that uniform and zealous Regard for the true Principles of our invaluable Constitution, and that unremitting Attention to the Happiness and Prosperity of My People, which have invariably directed all your Proceedings.

The rapid Increase of our Manufactures, Commerce, and Navigation, the additional Protection and Security afforded to the distant Possessions of the Empire, the Provisions for the good Government of India, the Improvement of the Public Revenue, and the Establish- ment of a permanent System for the gradual Reduction of the National Debt, have furnished the best Proofs of your Resolution in encountering the Difficulties with which you had to contend, and of your Steadiness and Perseverance in those Measures which were best adapted to promote the essential and lasting Interests of My Dominions.

The Loyalty and Public Spirit, the Industry and Enterprize of My Subjects, have seconded your Exertions. On their Sense of the Advantages which they at present experience, as well as on their uniform ana affectionate Attachment to My Person and Government,

I rely for a Continuance of that Harmony and Confidence, the happy Effects of which have so manifestly appeared during the present Parliament, and which must at all Times afford the surest Means of meeting the Exigencies of War, or of cultivating with increasing Benefit the Blessings of Peace.

And afterwards the Lord Chancellor, by His Majesty’s Command, said.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

It is His Majesty's Royal Will and Pleasure* that Parliament this Parliament be prorogued to Tuesday, the 3d Day prorogued, of August next, to be then here holden; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to Tuesday, the 3d Day of August next.

Lord Lieutenant and Cuflos Rotulorum for the County of Middlesex.

• My LORD,

AS your Grace, amidR the many important Objects which must necessarily in-grofs the Time of a Person of your Rank and high Employments, humanely afforded your Attention to the Peace and Safety of the Inhabitants of this Metropolis in the Year *754, when our Streets, Lanes and Fields were infefted by Gangs of the most desperate and cruel

Robber's

DEDICATION.

Robbers and Murderers, by efta-blishing at that Time a Flan of a Police, for the more easy Detection and bringing such Offenders to Juf-tice, and for the Prevention of other Di(orders, which has been attended with the bed of consequences; whatever Improvements have been (ince made in that Plan, seem to claim your particular Patronage: And it is for this Reason, therefore, that the following Sheets are dedicated to your Grace.

They contain Extracts from mod of the Penal Laws provided by the Legislature for the Peace and good Order of this Metropolis ; and as the Ignorance of, and Inattention to, these Laws, have been and dill are the Occasion of many Dilorders and Irregularities, it is thought that this Method of pi; chilling them will he productive of very good iiffedis, and render their Execution, in a great Measure, unneceffiry, by

making the Pe6ple acquainted with them; and Prevention, I am per-fuadedj will ever be more pleasing to the Benevolent* than Punish-ment.

And I hope, at the same Time I make this OBering of Respedb to your Grace, it will be some Proof to you of my Fidelity in the Execution of that Trull with which you have fo long honoured me, by shewing your Grace that 1 Ipend my whole Time in an Employment more fatiguing, more dangerous, more confined, and less satisfactory than any can imagine, or mod will believe: An Office, which nothing but the exacteft Caution and strict-eft Integrity can render either easy or secure; and nothing but the high-ell Dilhonelly, meanelt Venality, or bafell Corruption, can make lucrative. For my own Part, I hope for the Continuation of your Grace’s valuable Protection, on no

A other

DEDICATION, other .Foundation, than a diligent faithful and impartial Execution of my Duty, nor wish for the Confidence of the Publick but from their own Experience of an active, unbiased and disinterefied Conduct: And to succeed in both these, will ever be the Object of his Ambition, who is, with the highest Gratitude and Respect,

My LORD,

Your Grace’s most Dutiful, And the PublkKs Faithful Servant^

AM O N G the various Grievances, which a false Notion of Liberty induces Men to complain of in this Kingdom, the Multiplicity of our Laws is one ; and more ef-pecially the great Number of penal Statutes, which inconsiderate Persons have deemed as Restraints upon Liberty.

And as some Men have been weak or wicked enough, to endeavour to diflatisfy the Minds of the People relative to those wholesome penal Laws, calculated for the Peace and good Order of this Town, and have thereby made the inferior Class of Men impatient of Authority, and rendered the Office of Magistrate more difficult; it is apprehended that it may be useful to explain the cause, Nature, Utility, nay, the Necessiity of them : From whence it will appear, that they are really no other Restraints upon true Liberty, than what every good and honest Man would wifii for for true Liberty can only consist with those Restraints, which pure Religion and good Government lay upon Mankind.

The Multiplicity of Laws, fays an ingenious Writer, should not be looked upon fo much

B as

*The INTRODUCTION.1

For this Purpose, therefore, I have in the following Sheets made Extra&s of all those penal Laws which relate to the good Government of this Metropolis, and will enable every Inhabitant to judge for hirnfdf when he has received any Injury, Inconvenience or. Infult from another, in what Manner he is to apply for Redress, and point out immediately to him the Punishment the Law has prescribed for the Offender.

What EngliJJman would wish any one of these Laws should be repealed, fo wifely calculated for the Safety, for the Security of the Lives, Property, Liberty, and Happiness of the Subject ? And it is the candid, diligent and impartial Execution of these Laws, that make a great Part of the English Police; which Word, as it has been greatly misunderstood and misrepresented, I shall endeavour to explain.

The belt Explanation I have ever met with of the Word itself, is what follows, viz. That it is the Regulation and Government of a City or Country, so far as regards the Inhabitants. And this must always be fuited to the Nature of the Government and Constitution of the Country where it is exercised. The Police of an arbitrary Government differs from that used In a Republic and a Police proper for England, must differ from them both •, as it muff; always be agreeable to the just Notion of the Libert/ of the Subject, as well as to the Laws of this Country.

In the Year 175.'), there were several large and dcfpcrate Gangs o"f Street-robbers, House-breakers, CdV. that infefted this Metropolis, and the Neighbourhood about it ; who com-R 2 mitted

4

The INTRODUCTION.

mitted the mod audacious Robberies, Cruelties.* and Murders.

His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, shocked at these Outrages on his Majesty’s Subjects, dire died the late Henry Fielding, to consider of some Plan for the speedy Removal of these Mif-chiefs, and for the more easy apprehending and bringing such Offenders to Justice; which was immediately laid before his Grace, approved and supported by him; and as it owed its Rife to his Humanity, fo does it its Continuance to his Care and Attention ; 2nd what happy Effedfcs have since arofe from this Police, the Public can best judge.

When these Adis of Violence were subdued, Prevention was the next Object in the Confi-deration of that Magistrate, who weighed and considered the cause and Increase of Robberies in general, and published them in a small Pamphlet, which has been the Occasion of many good and wholsome Taws, and the cause of many Advantages arising from this Institution of a Police; which is nothing more than enabling one or more Magistrates to give up their whole Time to the Public; to be watchful over Evils as they arise in Society, and to suppress them in their Infancy by a due Execution of the Laws : For by habituating Mankind to an Obedience to the Laws of .their Country, Peace and good Order imperceptibly arise : And, at the same Time, by bringing all Informations of Fraud and Felony into one Point, keeping a Register of Offenders, making quick Pursuit, opening a general Correspondence with all the active Magistrates in the Country, Escapes are icndered difficult, and Discoveries easy : A Circumstance perhaps

that

The INTRODUCTION.

without any Restraint on the Liberty of the Subject: For, let the weak or wicked laugh at or abuse this Police as they please, every true Briton rauft have this Satisfaction to refledf, that no private Person whatever, no Watchman, Beadle, Constable, or Magistrate, can unjustly deprive him of his Liberty or Property, with Impunity.

From an attentive Perufal of these Extracts it will appear, that it is scarce possible for a Subject! to suffer either Injury, Inconvenience, or even Infult, without speedy Remedy : And as the Ignorance of a Law is no Excuse for the Breach of it, it is greatly to be hoped and much to be wished, that this Publication of the penal Laws, will take away the disagree-able Neceflity of putting any of them in Execution ; — Prevention being in all Respedls more eligible than Punishment.

But that the above Plan may be executed with Effect, it is highly necessary that the Public should do their Part, viz. to give immediate Notice of all Frauds and Felonies, with exact Descriptions of Persons and Things, on which Account all Expresses and Messengers will be paid their Expences, and rewarded for their Expedition, and their Informations received at all Times: And if any Inhabitant is annoyed by disorderly or Gaming-houses, Flops, or illegal Assemblies, by their Children, Servants or Apprentices, haunting the fame; Information or Notice thereof being given by Letter or otherwise, due Enquiry will be made, and every Means used to lupprefs the Evil. In these Cafes, Inhabitants appearing

themselves,

The INTRODUCTION.

themselves, renders the Matter easy ;-

for it has been found by Experience, that nine out of ten of these irregular Meetings have been luppressed merely by the Magi-strates fending to the Parties, and making them acquainted with the Nature of the Offence, and the Penalties which the Laws in such Cafes prescribe.

It is much to he lamented, that the above Adt had not extended the Power of the Sessions to fixing the Rates and Fares of Carmen taking up Goods in the City and Liberty of Westminster, and Parts adjacent, as they are at present under no Regulation relative to their Fares; and it is also much to he wished, that the Fares of Porters, who carry Goods and Parcels from the Inns to different Parts of the ’Town, who are very apt to impose on the Parties to whom they carry them, vyere fettled and fixed •, as many Per fans have been obliged to pay more for little Presents of Game, &c. than the Value of the Things themselves.

Obs. AS Magifirates do every Year, at M»-chaelmas particularly, attend to the Execution of this Statute, the Publication of the following Clause may perhaps prevent some Inhabitants from falling under the Penalty of the Law. Indeed, in most of the publick trading Streets, the immediate Inter eft, as well as Safety, induces the Inhabitants to hang out Lights as soon as the Evenings become long and dark •, and it is much to be wiped, that the Lights were equally attended to in that Part of the Town where People of Fashion _ generally dwell; many of whom, not coining to Town till near Christmas, forget or neglebi to order their Lamps to be lighted, not ccnfidering that they are subjcH to the Penalty hereafter mentioned, nor the Inconvenience it is to Passengers, who may at p>re-fent walk up half a long Street, without seeing a Lamp.

eafter executed, and the Evils they were intended to remedy, easier removed. For it is from Experience I have observed, that for one Information made from the Motive of the Reward, twenty have been made from a Dejire only of removing a public Evil or Nuisance, without the leaf Regard to the Reward, which such Informers have generally applied themselves to charitable Uses, having first paid the Expence of the Prosecution: But as Gain is the common Idea of the Motive of all Informations, 'many even of these Persons have been inf tilted for their good Offices to the Public, which would not be the Cafe, if Rewards in general were taken away; and the Removal of Evils themf elves would always be found sufficient Motives for Complaint, and at the same Time it would give Weight and Dignity to the Laws themf elves.

As the above Acts only oblige Inhabitants to hang out Lights till Twelve o’CJock; and as the Manner in which many of them do hang out their Lights, is the Occasion of much Inconvenience, it were to be wished that one Law was made for enlightning the City of Westmin-fter and the adjoining Parishes, in the County of Middlesex, by which Lamps should be fixed on Ports on the Outside of the Footway or other-wife, and in Courts and Passages in the best Manner they will admit of, at such Distances as the Church-wardens and Overseers, for the Time being, of every Parish, and one Justice of the Peace (hall think proper; with a Power for every such Parish to make and raise a Rate for the Payment of the fame.

And as the Watch at present are of very little Use from the SmaHness of the Wages given, which puts the Trust into the loweft Hands, and from the Length of the Time which they watch, which makes them often leave their Stands to re-fresh. themselves, or subjects them to deep, it would be useful, if in the fame Law one Provi-fion was made for the Watch throughout the above-mentioned Pari fires, whereby each Parish might be enabled to make a larger Rate for the Watch; fo that there might be a double Number of Watchmen who might relieve one another in the middle of the Night, which would not much increase the present Expence, but would induce more reputable Persons to undertake this Duty, as they would be able by Means of this Relief to follow their ordinary Callings the next Day, which at present is impossible, as they are obliged to fit up the whole Night.

Obs. As the Ignorance of a Lave cannot he accepted either ly a Cornmijffioner or a Justice of the Peace, as an Excuse for the Breach of it-, it is apprehended, that if the Hackneymen would print these Extracts hi a Hand Bill, and diflribute them to their Drivers, who are a fluctuating Body, and conjlantly coming from the Country, it would prevent many or most of the above Offences -s for Experience Jhews, that the Iff ant of Reverence to Authority in the common People, is greatly owing to their Ignorance ofthofe Laws, fo wifely calculated to produce Peace and good Order in Society.

Obs. 2. As the Disputcs between Coachmen, Chairmen, and their Parcs, arc generally about a Six-pence, and seldom more than a Shilling, it is recommended to all Per fans to pry on these Occa-fions, what the Coachmen and Chairmen demand, and take their Plumber -, for by this Means they

English Police can only prevent by seasonable Cautions, and only punish on due Informations and legal Proofs. The Laws of England are not to be executed on Caprice or Fancy, but by the Adsni-niflralion of solemn Oaths ; and, as the Law itself ■ fays, by the Testimony of one or more credible Wit-nesses on Oath.

■ But Misrepresentatious and Credulity have fo strong a Foundation in the Depravity and Weak-ness of human Nature, that it is absurd for Per-fons in public Characters, who are every Day tried and condemned, or rather condemned and tried by the Public, to hope totally to avoid its Effects.

It has been often observed in the public Papers, and from thence generally believed, that all the Bawdy Houses in and near Ccvent Garden, had Licences from the Justice of Peace of that Par if to fell Liquors, consequently, were in that respeCi countenanced by him \ and this Mijlake has arofe, and been propagated by ignorant Enquirers, who when they have drank a Bottle of Wine at a Bawdy House, have afeed the Keepers thereof if they had not a License for felting that Liquor, to which the Bazvd might with Truth answer that floe had, and from hence the Enquirer concluded that it rnufl be a Justice of Peace’s Licence. But the FaCl is quite otherwise, for all or most of these Houses have Wine Licences granted to them by the Com-miflioners of the Stamp-Office, which is the only and true cause of their Continuance and of snaking them Nufances; and tho’ many Reflections have been wijtjily snade on Mr. Fielding on this Acer, uni, yet is it certain, that when the present Mr. Fielding firfl came to reflde in Covent-Oarden, he took aivay the Justice of Peace's Licence, as well from the Baguio's as these Houses,

nor has he neglected the faithful Execution of his "Duty on any one Information laid before him relative to them-% and here it may be proper to observe,. that one of the principal causes of the Number of Bawdy Houses being collected together in and near that Parish, is, there having been several Estates in the Courts and contiguous Streets where the Leases of the Houses were Jo near expiring, that it was not worth zvhile to repair them till they were out, by which means they were let for almost any thing to the loweft of Wretches, who hired three or four of them and filled them with common Prostitutes; this made Exeter-Screet, Change-Court, Eagle-Court, and little Catherine-Street fo infamous, that, it was dangerous fer Persons to pass or repafs thro’ those Streets ; and as the Pub-Hearts and inferior Shop-keepers in their Neighbourhoods were supported by thefie Houses, there could be little Hopes of their making Informations against them, and the Expence of Indibfmerits and Prosecutions upon them in the Courts of Justice prevented the Law being put in Execution ; but it is apprehended, that if a Power was given to tzuo or more Justices of the Peace to enquire into these Offences in a summary Way, and on the Convibiion of such Bawds, to commit them for three Months and make them pay a Penalty of \ol. it would suppress the Evil to a d finable Degree, for perhaps the total Supprefion of them might give Strength and Countenance to a worse Vice, already too common.

Extracts from the Penal Laws:

trhance and Combination of a few designing, avaricious Men, how can we sufficiently lament that the Pains and Attention of the Legislature to re-dress this Evil, has been hitherto frnitless ? Nay, I am informed that the Evil is rather grown worse than better It is therefore with great Deference and Ref pelt that I offer my Opinion on this, Subject, which 1 do rather that it may beget in some other a better Plan, than that I think the following one to be perfect: Put I do apprehend, that if the . Gentlemen belonging to the Free Pritish Herring Fishery, a large, able and respebiable Body., would (beftdes the catching of Herrings) become Fishermen for this Metropolis; which, as they have 'much Leifure from their other Fishery, are accustomed to, and conversant in, the building of Boats, making of Nets, and hiring of Fifloermen, they can carry on, with more Eafe, and less Expence to-themselves, and more Utility to the Publick, than any other Body whatever. By this Means an im-menfe Quantity of Fish would be brought to Bil-linfgate and Westminster Markets, yet not more than this Town would confmne, and would totally destroy the present Monopoly of different Fife, viz. Lobsters, Turbots, &c. as well as the little Com-, binations lately prabiifed to make an artificial Scarcity : And as the Conveniency of a Plenty of Fiji) in London and Westminster to all Ranks of People, is much easier to 1 be conceived tha?i expressed, I shall now mention what fecms farther necffary to the Furtherance of this Plan : And firjl, that the Legislature should enable the Members of the Free Britifif) Herring Fishery to apply a -necessary Part of their Capital to this proposed Fjhery„ which cannot be attended with any Hazard, as ready Money is always paid at the Fish-merkcts

fo that it will rather enrich the Body, and enable them to carry on the Herring Fishery itself with more Effect and Advantage, than obstruct it.

2dly. Besides the Provisions made by the late Statute relative to Sea Fiflj, an Officer shonU be appointed to attend both Markets to fee such Methods faithfully executed, as the Legislature shall think neccjfary, to prevent the engr offing or monopolizing of any Fish brought to the said Markets for Sale.

, 3dly, ‘That every P erf on felling Fife by Retail out of the said Markets, fall be obliged to expose to open View from Eight to Twelve in the Morning, whatever Fish he has to fell, with a Penalty for concealing any Part of the fame.

In this Plan, Publick Spirit and Ir.tereft will go Hand in Hand-, and as they will be enabled to fit out a larger Fleet of FiJ/.ing-Boats than was ever yet fent to Sea, great Plenty of Fish rnufi be the consequence, and Cheapness will naturally follow : and by little Bounties and Rewards which they themselves will be able to give to Fishertnen, it is hoped that the Evil now fo loudly complained of, will be most effectually cured; and the Fishmon-gers themselves, who have lately been the Dupes of the Fishermen, and the Monopolizers of particular Fish would have Rcafon to rejoice j for, by felling more Fiflo at reasonable Rates, their Gain would be the fame, if not greater.

But while Salcfincn and Fishmongers have Shares in, or perhaps the whole Properly of Fifing-Boats, it will always be in their Power to bring as few F'if to Market as they please, and consequently to raise the Price agreeable to this no less artful, than wicked Scarcity of their own making.

Loffes and Exfences necessarily attending the carrying on his Business, surely he cannot be too cautious to avoid the above Penalties, which mufi necessarily dijlrejs his Family, as well as take away the Refutation of his House. And as there are many Persons who are wicked enough to teaze a Publican to lend them Cards, or to fujfer them to game in their Houses, merely that they may have an Of-for Utility to inform against the House for the Sake of tic Reward, no Publican can be fafe who suffers Gaming of any kind in his House. But it is feared, that the too great Number of Public Houses is the great Cattfe of theje Evils, as it induces the Publican to make Use of these Teniftations to draw

This Diverfwn would then atsfwer the End of Relaxation to the Common People, without encouraging I dieness, or enervating Industry ; but Skittle Grounds in the Town are attended with much Mischief, and when they are kept open all Day in the Country they are equally obnoxious. And as I am now /peaking of Publicans, it may not be improper to observe the great Injuries they frequently occasion to Trade, by suffering the Combinations of Journeymen at their Houses, where they meet, enter into scandalous A-grcements to raise their Wages, lessen their Hours of Work, perplex their Mafias, put a fop tt>

idly. When Servants 'leave their Places, the Property of their Livery frequently begets very dif-agreeable Disputes, from the mistaken Opinion that a Servant's having wore his Livery a Tear intitles him .to it: Indeed it is the Cufiom of most Families to give their Servants the Old Livery, when they flay long' enough to have New •, but this is the Mafer's Pkafure, - not the Servant's Right, v.nless the Servant make it a■ Part of his Agreement when he hires himself \ a Servant carrying away his Livery without Consent of his Master or Mistress, is liable to an Action, and if he pawn, fell, or unlawfully dispose of any Part of the fame, he fub-jects himself to be taken up by a Warrant, to be tarried before a Justice of Peace, to pay a Penally of 20 s. or to be committed to Bridewell for fourteen Days, and to be publickly whipt.

Lajily, Moji of the Inconveniencies arising in-Families from the Misconduct of Servants, are owing to the partial and unjufi Characters given of them by their Masters or Mistrejes, either from false good Nature, or undeserved Resentment; and as it is the highest InjuJHce to fay less of good Servants than they merit, it is the greatest Cruelty to fay more in Favour of bad ones than they ought; and it is a Rule never to be broke, not to take the Character of any Servant but from the P erf on 'whom they served la ft, if that can be had, and that by Word of Mouth if poffblc, as written Characters are an Inlet to Lnposition.

PxtraSls from the Penal Laws, the great Scarcity of French Cooks, French Valet de Chambres, and French Milliners, now to he met with in the EnglilH Families of Rank and Fortune, and as they firji obtained a Footing here by their Artifice and our own Caprice, I hope that they have now loft 'it from a Conviction for ever to be establ’fhed in the Minis of oux Ladies and Gentlemen, that /fo.English Cook can dress Ragouts, the English Valet de Ch'ambre can dress Hair, and the English Milliner dress Caps better than any French Man or Woman whatever. The Mixttire of Foreign Servants with the English never fails to beget Jcalcifies, Quarrels .and Liftiirbances in the Families where they live ■, for as the former are too often beheld by the Master. or Mistress with a partial Eye, they consequently enjoy 'a greater Share of their Confidence, which they constantly abuse by making them dijfatisfted with the Behaviour of their own faithful Countrymen. Indeed I have now and then heard a jemmy Gentleman fay, that no Englishman could dress Hair in Tafte ; but when he recollects that Hair was never more wore -or better dress’d than at present, and thatchiefly hy English-men too, he may perhaps allow himself to be in the Wrong'for once ;' and it is clear to Demonstra-tion to every impartial Mind that' there cannot be a Conveniency that ought to be expected from a Servant, but what may be certainly found among those who are born and brought up in Great Britain : The itmnenfe Confufton that has arofe in the Families of Merchants and other Gentlemen who have Estates in the Weft-Indies, from the great Number of Negro Slaves they have brought into this Kingdom also deserves the most serious Attention many of theft Gentlemen have cither at a vast Expcuce caused feme of theft Blacks to be in-

it is therefore to be hoped that these Gentlemen will be extremely cautious for the future, how they bring Blacks to England, for besides that they are defeated in the Ends that they prop ofe by it, it is a Species of Inhumanity to the Blacks themselves, who while they continue Abroad in .a Degree of Ignorance fo necessary to render a State of Slavery flipper table, are in fane Measure contented with their Condition, and chearfully fiibmit to those severe Laws which the Government of such Pxrjons makes necessary, but they no foov.er come over, but the Sweets of Liberty and the Converfation with free Men and Chrifiians, enlarge their Mind', and enable them too soon to form such Comparifons of the different Situations, as only serve when they are fent back again to mbit ter their State of Slavery, to make them rcflless, prompt to conceive, and alert to execute the blackest Conspiracies against their Governors and Masters.

CAUTIONS to Shopkeepers and LradeJ-men in general, and to their Journeymen^ Apprentices, Errand Boys and Porters; and to Book-keepers, Inn-keepers, &c.

MISFORTUNES and Distresses have been observed to have very different Effects according to the Disposition of the Party on whom they fall: When well-disposed Perfom are afflicted, it is apt to make them mild, humble, grateful and resigned-, but when the Malevolent meet with Difficulties, it generally makes them envious, impatient, malicious and repining. Necessity, they fay, is the Mother of Invention •, and when that arises rather from Accident than Extravagance, the Invention is generally employed in what is useful to Mankind, and its Productions deserve the Name of Ingenuity •, but when the Necessity arises from extravagant Debaucheries, the Invention is then racked to the Injury of Mankind, to obtain their Property, as Fuel for their own Profufc-ness. The Produce of this Species of Invention is what 1 call Fraud ; and excelling in this Sore of Deceit is what conflitutes the Character of a (Ambler, whose various Devices are the Sub|edt o 1 what follows.

Doubtiefs there are Gamblers in every Rank ol Life, as well as Gameflcrs: As to those

who

2$l

Extracts from the Penal Laws.

Fho trick you out of your Knowledge, by what they commonly call Sucking your Brains, ior out of your Reputation, your Wife or your Daughter, under the specious Pretence of Friendfliip, they are out of the Reach of the Daw. The greater the Capacity of a Gambler, the more dangerous he is to Society, as his Abilities and Resolution enable him to execute great and destructive Schemes, while those of a lower Rank content themselves with smaller Acquisitions. But in Order to convey a just Idea of this Animals I {hall endeavour to shew him in all the different Spheres in which he exerts his Ingenuity, from the loweft to the highest.

A Pickpocket, though a Felon, seems to be in the loweft Class of Gamblers; but his Suc-pefs rather arises from the Dexterity of his Hands, than the Contrivance of his Head ; and like Rats and other ftjch Vermin, they appear rather to take the Advantage of your Negligence and Inattention, than to contend with your Understanding. The first and loweft Class of Gamblers then, who would cheat you with your Eyes open, are those who invite you to prick in the Belt or Garter for a Wager; and the Certainty of Winning at this Sort of DiverfiQn appears fo dear to the Novice, that he never fails to bite, if he be a proper Objedl. And here I mud premile, that these Gamblers are such cxquilite Judges of ihcir Prey, that they feldoin fail of Succcfs.

The next Class arc thole who find a Paper full of Gold Rings, which they take Care to pick up in the Sight of a proper Object, whole Opinion they afk. This Set appear very mean, b which

with which he decamps the Instant the Porter’s Back is turned. And as Tradesmen generally employ Country Fellows for Porters in their Houses, two or three of these Gamblers are generally waiting at the Corner of the Streets near some of the great Inns and if they hear one of the Porters, charged with a Box or Bundle, afk his Way to the Inn, one of them steps up to him very civilly, tells him that he is going that Way, and will shew him the House. The Countryman implicitly follows his Guide, whilst the Gambler’s Comrade takes the Hint, marches before and plants himself at some convenient Passage, puts his Hat into his Pocket, and hicks a Pen in his Wig to repre-fent a Book-keeper-, the Guide acquaints the Countryman, that that is the Book-keeper of the Inn, who immediately lays down his Burthen, and the Book-keeper desires him to go over the Way to his Wife for the Key of theWare-house, and in the mean Time the two Gamblers march off with the Goods.

The next Class ufe the Following Stratagem: One of them goes in the Drefs of a Footman, and desires some Tradesman to carry Goods to his Mailer, which are generally fent by the Journeyman, who is carried into a Parlour hired for that Purpose by the Footman, who tells him that he will carry the Goods up to his Mailer, and will bring down an Account of what he chufes ; but the Moment he has got PoiTefiion of the Goods, he fiiuts the Parlour Door, and marches out of the Passage ; or if the Mailer has a Mind to nfiiit the Servant, he fends the Tradesman back for other Sorts; but before he returns, makes off with what he has. Servants, who

have

Ext rads from the Penal Laws*

have lived with Taylors, Mantua-makers, Milliners, and other Trades that fend frequently to the Shops, have, when they have been dischargr ed, gone in the Name of their Matters and Mif-trelfes to the said Shops, and taken up great Quantities of Goods, in which they have fuc-ceeded the easier from their being known to the Shopkeeper. Might it not then be useful to give Notice to the Shopkeepers used by the said Trades-people of their Discharge of such a Servant ?

There is another Set who defraud Tradesmen by taking on themselves false Names, and by pretending to be related to, or connected with* some Persons of Credit and Fashion, and produce false Letters to prove their Intimacy. Some of these Gamblers attend most of the' Fairs in the Country, where they make it their Business to enquire at Inns who serves them with their Wines and Brandies from London j and fish out of Shopkeepers the Names of the Tradesmen here who supply them with Goods. Furnished with this Knowledge, they come to London, and one Day appearing in the Character of a Country Inn keeper, they go to the Distiller, whose Name they have learned, telling him he has taken an Inn in such a Country; that he was recommended to him by one of his Customers, whose Name he tells him, and deferibes his House and Family. The Dittiller’s Suspicion being lulled afleqp by this Stratagem, he chcarfully supplics his new Customer with some of his belt Goods, and fends them to some appointed Inn in Town, from whence they are conveyed by the Gambler and converted into Calh, by felling them as

Value of the said Goods, generally fall into their Trap.

1 he following Stratagem has been of late very successful. The Gambler goes to a Shop, and with great Coolness and Compofure, looks over many Goods, deals hard, calls himself a ready, money Customer, and experts for that Reason to buy cheaper; the Goods being pitched on and their Price fixed, he orders them to be packed up with a Bill and Receipt, and to be fenc to his House in about an Hour, where he promises to be and to pay for them. Suspicion being thus removed, the Porter carries the Goods, but the Gentleman is not come home, though the Wife is there, ready to receive all that comes, and who generally by Artifice baffles the Porter, and sets Possession of the Goods. The Tradesman

O

calls Time after Time, but the Gentleman is not at Home, and the Tru, th is, he lodges at some diffant Part of the Town, and makes Use of this Ploufe only as a Ware-house, to deposit such Goods as he can obtain by Fraud from Tradesmen.-

In the Cafes of such ready-money Customers as these, Porters should be directed not to leave the Goods till they have received the Money for them, on Pain of paying for them themselves.

The liigheff Rank of Cheats who attack the Understanding, have made Use of the following Stratagems : One of the Gang, who is happieft in his Person, and has the best Address, is pitched upon to take a House, which, by Means of the extreme good Character given of him by his Comrades to the Landlord, is soon accom-plished. The next' Consideration is to furnish

it,

it, when Mr. -------, a young Ironmonger ju$

fet up, is pitched upon to provide the ’Squire’s Grates who, glad of fo fine an Order, soon ornaments his Chimnies with those of the neweft

Falhion. This being done, Mr. --------;—, the

Upholder, is immediately applied to for other Furniture, and is brought to the House in Order that he may fee the Grates, which he no sooner beholds, than he tells his Honour that he could have furnished him likewise with Grates of the best Kind at the moll reasonable Rates ; to which ’Squire Gambler replies, that he intends taking some little Villa in the Country, where

Mr.--------shall furnish every Thing he can.

The House being now compleatly fuinished, the ’Squire drefies himself in his Morning Gown, Velvet Cap, and red Morocco Slippers, puts one or more of his Comrades into Livery, then fends for Taylor, Linnen-draper. Silversmith, Jeweller, C?c. takes upon him the Character of a Merchant, and by getting Credit of one by pawning the Goods the Moment he has got them, he is enabled to pay ready Money t6 others; by which Means he extends his Credit and increases his Orders till he is detested ; which sometimes does not happen till he has defrauded Tradesmen to a very considerable Value. Nay, 1 have known them sometimes carry their Scheme ib far, as to fix one of their Comrades at some Rendezvous in Wapptng, in the Character of a Captain of a Vessel lying at such Stairs, and bound to some of the American Plantations, by which Means the aforesaid Merchant procures Goods to be fent aboard ; and as his Credit advances, he makes Use of Draughts, which are constantly accepted by his Comrades, who have

Yards, in the Duflc of the Evening, at a Dif-tance from the Warehouse •, and if any Porter or Apprentice brings a Parcel, and enquires for the Book-keeper, his Hat in a Minute is whipt into his Pocket, and a Pen in his Mouth: The Porter is fent into the Tap-house of some Mef-fage, and the Sharper escapes. Sometimes they go into a Publick-house, and desire them to fend a Gallon of Beer to some Neighbour, whose Name they have enquired, and to bring Change for a Guinea, which is generally fent by the Maid or some little Boy. The Sharper takes Care to meet the Boy in the Way, receives the Change and Beer, fends him back for a Pipe, and then makes off. These Sharpers likewise, sometimes, take Portmanteaus frorri behind Stage-Coaches, when there are no outside Passengers, out of the Tails of Waggons, or from behind Post-Chai-fes, or out of Shops in the Evenings, where Goods lie near the Window, or out of Shew-Glaffes, by breaking the Glaffes. To prevent some of these Evils, the following Cautions would be useful *, nrft, for Book-keepers and Inn-keepers to keep their Yards clear from loitering Fellows, and to caution their Porters not to deliver Goods at the Outside of the Door of any House to which they are fent: To caution the Waggoners and Stage-Coachmen to watch their Coaches and Waggons off the Stones; Shop-keepers should remove Goods from their Windows or Shew-Glafies, early in the Evening, and to fix a Bell at their Shop-door at that Time : To direct their Porters, Apprentices and Errand-Boys, when fent with Parcels, to be cautious of aflcing their Way in the Streets, but at Houses or Shops; or of entering into any

Coals to be delivered at that Tradesman’s House for his Use. Thus far the Gambler who attacks the Understanding.

I shall now mention a Set of Cheats who make a Dupe of the Heart, and impose on the Benevolence and Compassion of the Charitable■, these are called Sky-Farmers, and execute their Schemes in the following Manner: One of them drefies himself extremely genteel, and takes upon himself either the Character of a private Gentleman or reputable Tradesman. He is attended by two Men in the Character of Country Farmers, with clumfey Boots, Horseman’s Coats, &V. The Objects pitched upon for Imposition, are good old charitable Ladies, to whom the Solli-citor tells a dreadful Story of Losses by Fire, Inundation, &c. to the utter Ruin of these two poor Farmers and all their Families; their Wives are big with Child, their Children down in the Small-Pox, &c. A Book is then produced by the Solicitor, who undertakes this disagreeable Office purely out of Good-Nature, knowing the Story to be true. In this Book are the Names of the Nobility and Gentry fet down by himself, who have contributed to this Charity ; and by setting out with false Names, they at length get real ones, which are of great Service to them in carrying on their Fraud j and well-disposed Persons are daily imposed upon by false Appearances of Distress. There are Persons in this Town who get a very good Livelihood by writing Letters and Petitions of this.Stamp, with which those Noblemen and Gentlemen, who are distinguished for their Generofity and Benevolence, arc constantly tormented, and these Wretches often obtain Relief for their false Dif-S 3 trefies.

treffes, whilst the really miserable suffer, from their Modefty, the acuteft Afflictions. A Woman fluffed up as iffhe was ready to lye in, •with two or three borrowed Children, and a Letter giving an Account of her Husband’s falling off a Scaffold and breaking his Limbs, or being drowned at Sea, &c. is an irreftftable Object.

Laftly, the following Cautions to Inns and Livery-Stables may not be useless ; it is become a Trick for a Man to hire a Horse at one Place, and at his Return to London to put him up at another as his own, and to borrow Money at that Place, and then give Notice to the Owner of the Horse where he is.

As Persons coming to London in a Stage-Coach from a Distance, are desirous of getting into a Hackney Coach as soon as they can, they flop at the first Stand, which is generally near some Inn; here the Sharpers attend, and by their pretending to be Porters, or by other Stratagems, frequently rob the Passengers of their Box or Portmanteau ; who being eager to fee their Friends, throw aside their Caution, and trusttoo much to the Care of the Coachman. These fort of Sharpers alio attend the unloading of Road Waggons, where Quantities of Goods are put into a Cart to be dispersed about Town ; this Cart they follow till they have an Opportunity of taking something out of it, while the Carter or Porter is making some Enquiry ; a Man riding in these Carts would prevent these Robberies. Fastening Portmanteaus behind Poll-Chaifes with Chains instead of Straps, will preserve them ; and Stable-keepers not letting their Saddle-Horses to Strangers, unless they bring some

'The former is intitled to his Pardon by Law, the latter may be tried himself, even after he has convicted his Accomplices, if he has been guilty of Offences in more Counties than one.

Pecic Constables, Peace and good Order mu ft ensue in this Metropolis. Constables are select-cd from the Inhabitants as able and reputable Men to execute this Trust, which is not reposed in them, without their being first bound by a solemn Oath well and truly to serve the said; Office* which though troublesome, and often dangerous, is very honourable. In Westminster there are fourfcore Constables; in the adjoining Parts of the County of Middlesex there are more these two Bodies united by Harmony, lengthened by a just sense of their Duty, and well instructed, encouraged and supported by the Magistracy, become a formidable Body, shews the Civil Power in its true and proper Light, and will ever be capable of supprefiing Evils of the most dangerous Nature. But nothing can conduce fo much to the preventing of Evils of every Kind arising to any considerable Height, as: the Care and Attention of each individual Constable in his own Ward. Here he may ob-serve Mischiefs and Breaches of the Laws on their first Appearance, and by proper Notices, friendly Persuasions, necessary Informations before the Magistrate, or by Presentment before the Grand Inquest when he makes his Returns, which last ought most conscientioufiy to be done without Favour or Affection, he may flop the Evil in its Infancy, and prevent the Repetition of it from confirming it into Habit, when it will be more difficult, if not irnpofiible, to suppress it; for I should not do Justice, if I did not declare, that a great Number of Inhabitants, who have beefi summoned before me for suffering Gaming and other Breaches of the Laws, the Moment they were Y 2 acquainted

If a Constable has a due Regard for Religion, the Oath he takes to do his Duty will have a proper Influence on his Conduct. If he considers the Re-fpedt that is due to the Laws of his Country, he will never connive at the Breach of any of them; and if he executes his Office with Diligence, Candour and Humanity, he will secure to him-felf. the Confidence of the People, strengthen his own Authority, and be esteemed a valuable, useful and worthy Member of Society. To which I (hall only beg Leave to add one Ob-fervation, that where Warrants are executed in this Metropolis, on Complaints of a trivial Nature, the Constable should always give his Prisoner Time to bring some of his Friends with him before the Magistrate, as this may prevent the Malice of Prosecutors; but where Cheats and Felons are apprehended, they should be immediately carried before a Justice of the Peace, as a Moment’s Delay may prevent Discoveries of the greatest Consequpnce, and give Accomplices Time to secrete themselves and their stolen Goods. And to prevent Escapes and Rescues in the Streets, it is always prudent to put- such Prison into a Hackney Coach, the Expence of which 1 shall ever be ready to defray, and at all Times rejoice as well to give my Advice and Aflfjftance to any Peace Officer who shall think proper to afk it, as to furniffi him by Night or Day with every Degree of Protection in his Office the Laws of his Country intitle him to.

A

TREATISE

O N T H E

OFFICE of Constable,

of F’lin'^ H E Office of Constable, whether we II agree with my Lord Coke in the Deri--JL vation of the "Word, or with the less honourable Etymology of Dr. Cowell, is certainly of great Antiquity in this Kingdom.

Anticntly there was a very high Officer of State, under the Denomination of the Lord Constable,; and several other Officers there areat this Day who are fo called ; as the Constable of the Tower, fsV.but with such we concern not our-selves in this Treatise, in which we intend only to speak of those Officers, who are at present known by the Name of High and Petit Con-stables.

Both these Officers were at common Lav/ in the Time of the Saxons. The best Account of their original is given by Fincnx, in the Book of 12 II. 7. who makes them as old as the Division of Counties into Hundreds, and again of these Hundreds into Boroughs or Towns; over the

latter

How chosen.

A ’Treatise on the Office of Constable.

The Constables of Hundreds, or the High Constables, were at first chosen and sworn as appears in the Sheriff’s Torn (a); but in the Time of Mr. Dalton, they were usually chosen at the Sessions, or by the Majority of the Justices of the Division, and were either sworn at the Sessions or by Warrant from the Sessions. A cause, he fays, which was often allowed and commended by the Judges of Assize (b).

And in the same manner as they are chosen, they are upon fit cause to be removed from their Office (c).

The High Constables, by their original In-ftitutions, were to take View of Armour twice every Year, and to present before the Justices the-Defaults of Armour, of Watches, of Highways, and of Hue and Cries, and also such as lodged Strangers, for whom they could not an-fwer (d).

Constables of Hundreds are compellable to attend- at the Assizes, and present Offenders upon Oath, but not fo at the Quarter-Sessions

(0-

By the Common Law, fays the Lord Coke, the Constables are to be chosen at the Leet or Torn (/). In some Books, it is said, that the Constables are to be chosen by the Sheriff; and in others by the Decennary ; but it is agreed, that he must then be sworn into his Office by the Sheriff: But where there is a Court-Leer, this Power of chusing Constables seems to belong to

the Lord of that Leet-, and such, fays Mr. Hawkins, must be understood to have been the Sen fe of the Makers of that Statute in 13 & 14 Car. 2. (a) ^

Writers agree in giving to Justices of Peace a Power to appoint a Constable in Default of the Lord at his Leet, or of Che Sheriff at his Torn, before the Statute of 13 14 Car. 2.

And this Power seems to have the Sandtion of Time, though it may be, perhaps, difficult to shew from what legal Authority it was at first derived.

And not only when the Leet have failed to appoint a Constable, but where unable or unfit Persons have been chosen, the Justices of Peace have interfered and have removed them, (b) So if & Constable die or remove out of the Parish, and the Time of the Leet be far off, his Place is to be supplied by the Sessions; and if they be not near, by the next Justices.

This Jurisdiction the Justices exercised at Common Law, but now the Statute (reciting that whereas the Laws and Statutes for the apprehending of Rogues and Vagabonds have not been duly executed, sometimes for Want of Officers, by Reason Lords of Manors do not keep Court-Leets every Year for the making them) enadfs, That in cafe any Constable, Head-borough or Tythingman, shall die or go out of the Parish, any two Justices of the Peace may make and swear a new Constable, Headborough or Tythingman, till the said Lord shall hold a Court, or till the next Quarter-Sessions, who

(«) Hawk. P. C. b. z.c. 10. f. 37. (i) Dalt. c. 28.

And ir any Officer ih^ll continue above a Year in his or their .Oi^ce, .that then ’in fetch cafe the Justices of the Peace in their .Quarter-Sessions may difei^arge such Officers, and may put another fit P,er-fon in his or ^their PJace, till the Lord of the said Manor shall hold a Court as afore-said.

And if in Default of holding Co urts-Lee t, they continue above a Year, they may be ,dif-charged at the Sefiions, and.others put.in (f ).

If Leets chopfe unable or unfit Petit Constables, it is a good cause or the Forfeiture of the Leet. And upon a Complaint to the Assizes.or Selfionj;, -the Justices of the Peace shall fie authorized to . choose new ones.

Since the Statute, therefore it is clear that two Justices of Peace may, -in Defaultrof the Lord ; of the Leet, make and swear a newCpnftable, Ac.

A \Treatise'on the Office of Constable,

Persons qualified to be Constables, are not ab» folutely excused from taking upon themselves that Office, by being of the Rank of Gentlemen (tho’ of Quality faith Dalton); nor will the Pro-session of a Physician excuse them ; .yet, if there be other sufficient Persons within the District, they will possibly have Relief in the King's Bench: But a sworn Attorney of any Court in Wefimhn jler Hall may be discharged by a- Writ of Privi-lege, even though he were chosen by reason of his Estate according to the Cuflom, &c. for he is obliged to give his Attendance on his Court, And for like Reason it hath been adjudged, that an Alderman of London cannot be chosen Constable •, . for that as Alderman, he is bound to be present in the City for the good Government thereof (a).

By two Statutes made in the Reign of Hen. 8. the Wardens and Fellowship of the Mystery of Surgeons, are exempt from the Offices of Constables, Watch, C?c. provided they do not exceed the Number of twelve *, and the PreCi-dent and Fellows of the College of Physiciani are not to be chosen Constables, nor any other Officers in London, nor in the Suburbs of the fame (h).

It hath. been held, that all the Surgeons in England are within the Equity of the former Statute but that the Privilege arising from the latter is confined to those Physicians who are Fellows of the College.

To consider and explain the Duty which the Law enjoins on this Office* and the Authority with which he is vetted, that he may be enabled to: perform such Duty. And here I shall endeavour to' lay down every Point in the plainest- and clearest Manner ; so as to be intelligible to almost every Capacity.

The Office of. a Constable is two fold:

1. Original or Primitive.

2. Ministerial, or relative to the Justices of the Peace, Coroners, Sheriffs, t'dc. (a)

in his Pre- 18 apparent Danger or Death, be given m his fence. Presence, he is to arrest the Offender (b). And in either of these Cafes he may break open' Break open Doors, if denied Entrance, and if the guilty Doors. Person be there (c). Again in these Cafes he

may justify killing the Offender, if he flies or refills, fo that he cannot otherwise be apprehended ; but this he ought never to do when the Offenders may be otherwise taken (d).

3. He may arrest any one whom he shall see going about to commit a Treason or Felony, or "any other Aft which would manifestly ,en~ danger the JLife of another (e). And there+ fore, if a Man leave an Infant in the Cold,*

r. That a Felony was actually done ; for this is issuable in an Action of false Imprisonment* (Ac. (a).

2. That the Person from whom he receives his Information was actually preterit alt the Felony committed-, for the Juflification is, that the Constable did aid A in talcing the Party suspect-ed (b). And an Information at thefecond Hand is too remote and dangerous.

3. The Constable ought to be well satisfied that the cause of Suspicion is a good one. And such Circumstances and causes of Suspicion may appear on the Examination, (tho’ this cannot be on Oath) that the Information, fays Lord Hale, may carry over the Suspicion even to theConfla-ble, whereby it may become his Suspicion as well as the Suspicion of A (c).

And it behoves the Constable to adt with great Discretion in this Matter; for as on the one Hand if the cause of Suspicion was light and trivial if the Party informing was not himself present; but principally if the Felony was not actually committed, the Constable will be in Danger of answering in an Action : So on the ocher Hand if he should be remifs and negligent in his Duty, or refuse to arrest a Felon, where the above Circumstances all concur, he will be liable to be very severely punished for his Omifiion ; for.

or for Fear, or for any Manner of Affinity, conceal, consent or procure to conceal, the Felonies done in their Liberties, or otherwise, will not attach nor arrefl such Felons there (as they may) or otherwise will not do their Office fur Favour born to such Mifdoers, and be attainted thereof, they shall have one Year’s Imprison-ment, and afterwards make a grievous Fine at the King’s Pleasure ; and if they have not whereof to be fined, they (hall suffer three Years Im-prisonment.

And by the 5 Edw. 3. c. 14. it is expressy declared, That if any Man has any evil Suspicion of Felons, either by Night or by Day, they shall be incontinently arrested by the Constables of the Town.

The first and second Points are sufficiently clear; and as to the third, though it may be difficult, or indeed, impossible, to fet down minutely every Circumstance which may induce a juflifiable Suspicion; it may be however, proper to mention the mod common and obvious ; and especially those which have already undergone the Sanction of a Court of Justice, or which good Authorities have established.

g* Ptr" Felony upon just Grounds of Suspicion, and

where a Felony is actually committed, tho’ he be innocent, yet if he refill the Officer, after Notice that he is the Officer, and assault him, if the Officer kill him, this is no Murder (a).

But more questionable is it, fays Lord Hale, whether if he fly and, cannot be apprehended, the Officer may kill him, where he is suspected and innocent, if he cannot otherwise be taken, as he may a Felon, as before is ffiewn ; but it seems (fays he) that he may, and that it is no Felony, no more than in the former Cafe, for these Reasons :

1. Btcause the Constable is obliged to do his Office in Case of a probable Suspicion, as well as in case of an actual Felony.

2. Because he cannot judge whether the Party be guilty or not till he come to his Trial, which cannot be till he is apprehended.

3. Because the Party draws upon himself this Inconvenience, and makes himself suspected by his very Flight from the Officer (b).

of, may arrell the Offender ; and if he flies into a Floufe and shuts the Doors, and will not open them, the Constable may break them open to take him (r).

And in this Cafe likewise it will be Murder if the Constable be killed ; but if the Offender,

who could not otherwise be taken, should be killed, it would be no Felony, but justifiable by theNeceffiry which arofe from his own Ob-ftinacy (a).

But in case of an Affray where no dangerous Affray. Wound is given, if the Constable be not him-felf present, I hold it too dangerous for him to arrest the Party on an Information after the Affray is over, even though the Informer should alledge that he is in Danger of his Life •, for in such cafe, though some Resolutions seem to favour it, yet there are many on the other Side (b).

5. If an Affray be in a House whereby there Affray in a is a Likelihood of Bloodfhed, and the Doors^°u^‘ of the House are fhur, if the Constable of the Vill having Notice thereof demand Entrance, and they within not only refuse to open the Doors, but continue the Affray, the Constable may break open the Doors to keep the Peace and prevent the Danger (c). And this will be justifiable, though no Hurt was actually done (d).

And if the Affray be begun without Doors, and the Affrayers fly into another iVlan’s House, the Constable on fresh Pursuit may break open the House and apprehend them (e). But this I apprehend nuift be understood only of violent Affrays, and where some great Hurt hath been done.

By 5 E. 3. c. 14. the foregoing is briefly recited, and it is farther enacted, That because there hath been divers Manslaughters, Felonies and Robberies, done in Time past, by People that be ca'le-l *-Roberdfmen, Waftors and Draw-latches, it is accorded, that if any Man have any evil Suspicion of such, be it by Day, or by Night, they dial 1 be incontinently arrested by the Constables of the Towns.

Upon these Statutes it hath been held, that Night-walk-it is lawful to arrest a Night-walker, at a prohi-ers-bited Time of Night, though no Felony had been committed (<2).

In an Action of Trespass of Assault, Battery Bawdyhouses. and false Imprisonment at Dale, the Defendant pleaded, that one Alice kept a House in the laid Town of Dale, and kept suspicious Persons in it, to wit, a common Bawdy-House, and the Plaintiff often resorted to the laid House fuf-piciously with Women of evil Fame, (naming them) for which one J. Nokes, Constable of the Paid Town, came to the Defendant, and desired him to aflift him in arresting the Plaintiff to find Surety for his good Behaviour, on which Account the Defendant came with the said J. N. at the Hour of Twelve in the Night, and found

him suspiciously in the laid Place, by Force of which they took him and put him in Ward, which is the fame Assault, Battery and Impri-fonment for which the Action is brought. This was held a good Justification by all the Justices ; for they said, it is lawful for every Constable to arrest suspected Persons who walk by Night and deep by Day, or who keep fuf-picious Company. And if they cannot of them-selves arrest them, they may demand the Assist-ance of others, and they are by Law obliged to aflift them (a).

In all the Cafes above-mentioned, and in some which follow hereafter, the Constable may arrest the Party without any Warrant.

And yet the Advice given by Lord Hale, viz. If the Time and Nature of the Fa£t, and the Condition of Things will bear it, to complain to a Justice of the Peace and have his Warrant for apprehending the Criminal, will be very wifely followed by the Constable as often as he possibly can; for by such Means he will be put to much less Difficultty in his Justification.

But it must be likewise observed. That in all the Cafes before recited, and especially with regard to the apprehending of Felons, he is obliged to perform his Duty without any Warrant, and will be punishab’e for Negktft of it. He must therefore take Care that no Mischief intervene, nor any Feion escape by his waiting for the Authority of the Justice.

Hue and Cry may be raised by the Warrant of a Justice. It may likewise be raised by a Peace Officer, and even by a private Person (a).

1. It may likewise be against a Person certain by Name.

2. Against a Person uncertain by Description; or,

3. Upon a Murder, Robbery or Burglary committed, where the Pc-rfon is neither known nor describable (h).

As to the Manner of raising it, take the following Rules:

1. The Constable ought to receive good Afturance, that the Felony hath actually been committed.

2. The Party who levies the Hue and Cry, or at whose Complaint it is levied by the Constable, ought to give him all the Information in his Power of the Number of Persons by whom the Fact was committed, with their Names, Habits, Horses, and every other Circumstance •, but if he should know none of these, the Constable, being sufficiently af-fured of the Fact, is to levy the Hue and Cry (c).

3. The Hue and Cry being levied, the Constable is first to make Search in his own

5. The Constable and those with him may Break open search in suspected Places •, and if the Doors ofDoorsonHue a House be (hut, and those within refuse to openand Cry-them on Demand made by the Constable and Notification of his Business, he may break them

But here this Difference must be noted ; that if the Doors be open, he may search any suspected Place or House, and a probable cause of Suspicion will be sufficient for his Justification ; but otherwise is it in case of breaking open the House •, for he will only be justifiable when the Felon is actually there (d).

6. He may apprehend a Person suspected of the Fa<ft, and against whom the Flue and Cry be railed ; and tho’ such Person should prov'e innocent, his Apprehension would be justifiable in the Constable (e). And if the Hue and Cry be levied on the Felony only, without any Notification or Description of the Person, he may justify arresting all suspicious Persons (f). As for instance, lays Lord Hale: Vagrants that cannot give any Account of themselves where they live, or whence they are, or such suspicious

Power by I come now to the third Method of arresting .Warrant. by _ a Constable, viz.' by Virtue of a Warrant tinder the Hand and Seal of a Magistrate lawfully authorized.

t Whenever a Warrant is granted lawfully, and directed to the Constable of B. or to all Constables, or to all Peace Officers, the Constable must execute it, or he will be liable to an Indiftment.

And

And though the Warrant itself hath been ao-ainft Law, yet the Officer hath been allowed to justify under it (a).

Mr. Lombard, fpealdng of the Power of a Justice of Peace, faith, If he make any Warrant, though it be beyond his Authority, yet it is not disputable by a Constable or other inferior Mini-fter, but must be obeyed. Lamb. 6y and 94.

And Erudenell, in the Book of Hen. 8.

(14 Ii. 8. 16. a) tho’ he denied the Authority of the Justice to make the Warrant, admits that the Officer who executed it, could not be punished; for every Justice of Peace, fays he, is a Judge of Record, and he hath a Seal of his Office; and when he makes a Warrant under his Seal to the Officer,' now the Officer ought to give Credit to the Seal; for this is his Authority, and being but an Officer, he can no more dispute the Authority of the Judge than the Sheriff can ours.

If a Warrant be directed by a Justice of Peace Constable e£-to the Constable of D. to arrest a Felon, &c. t^r" he is not bound to get out of the Vill to ‘execute y0^ the Warrant; but yet if he do execute it in another Vill, it is good enough ; for he acts herein not Amply as Constable of D. but by virtue of the Justice’s Warrant; and fo it was ruled in my Time (fays Lord Hale) at the Affixes at Norfolk, about 1668 (b).

or upon Suspicion of Felony, if the Felony be in his own House (a).

So, and a fortiori, if he be in the House of another (for here the Sheriff may do it on a civil Process) but this is at his Peril that the Felon be there; for otherwise he will be guilty of a Trespass (£).

Upon a Warrant to search for stolen Goods, Search War the Constable likewise may break open the rant.

Doors, if they be shut, and upon Demand made, those within refuse to open them (r) ; yet note, my Lord Hale here seems doubtful if the Goods were not there. In which he only fays, it seems the Officer is excused j and in another Place he expressy fays, on such Warrant I think the Doors cannot be broke open (d).

Upon a Warrant of the Peace, the Constable Peace War-may break open the Doors (e) -, but this must berant-understood where Security of the Peace is required, and not in case of an Assault or any common Breach of the Peace.

Yet it is to be noted, that if the outward Breaking Door be open, the Constable in any cafe may open Doors, justify breaking the inward Door; for fo may the Sheriff or his Bailiff, though the Process be without a non omittas (f).

The Constable in executing a Warrant against a Felon, may justify killing him, if, before or after the Arrest, he flies and defends himself.

fo that the Officer must give over his Pursuit and cannot otherwise take him (a). And this,

as hath been seen before, he might have done, in case of an Arrest, virtute officii, or by Hue and Cry.

The fame J-aw is it if in Truth he were no Felon, but yet a Warrant is against him on Suspicion of Felony, and he, having Notice thereof, flies and refills for the Officer or Minister must pursue his Warrant, or other-wife he is punishable ; and the Party by his Flight or Refiftance is accessary to his own Death (b).

But in this cafe the Officer must be extremely pautious, and in his Justification it ought to appear.

That he was a lawful Officer; for though a private Person may arrest a Felon, and if he flies, fo that he cannot otherwise be taken, the killing will be excufable; yet this is at his Peril, viz. that the Party be really a Felon ; for if he be innocent of the Felony, the killing, at leaf before the Jrreji, seems at least Manslaughter, for the Reason above given, for an innocent Person is not bound to take Notice of a private Person’s Suspicion (c).

In all Cafes whatever, the Constable or other Peace Officer will be justified in the Execution of the 'Warrant.

If the Matter be within the Jurisdiction of the Justice, * though it may want some Circum-llances of Formality, for, as Mr. Dalton fays, the Warrant of a Justice of the Peace, though it be beyond his Authority, is not disputable by a Constable or other inferior Minister, but must be executed by them (a).

But the Warrant must be, i . For an Offence within the Jurisdiction ofDefcnPtl0n the Justice, otherwise an Action will lie againftof ^rarrar,t‘ the Officer who executes the Precept (b) •, as is expressy adjudged in the Cafe of the Marshal-fea (c) where a Difference is taken when a Court hath Jurisdiction of a cause and proceeds erro-neously, then no Action lies against the Officer who executes the Precept or Process of the Court; but when the Court hath no Jurisdiction of the cause, then the whole Proceeding is coram non judice (before one who is no Judge of the cause; and an Action will lie without any Regard to the Precept or Process.

4. The Warrant ought to express some Crime •, but if it do not, yet, if the true cause were Felony or any Misdemeanor within the Cognizance of the Justice, it may, fays Lord Hale, excuse the Officer, in false Imprisonment(£). Hence it follows, that if, in such cafe, the cause were really not within the Cognizance of the Justice, the Arrest would be illegal, and the Officer liable to an Action of false Im-prisonment.

A Warrant obtained after the Arrest will not justify the preceding Arrest by Authority of that Warrant.

Wherever the Constable hath a Power to arrest, either ex officio, or by Warrant, he may charge as many as he (hall think necessary to his Assistance (c). And all, who are thus charged., are by Law obliged to assist him, and have, at the same Time, the fame Protection of the Law, which the Constable himself hath. 3 Hen. 7. 1. where, what is said of the Sheriff, may be applied to the Constable. 10 H. 7. 6.

If a Constable, having received a Warrant from a Justice of the Peace, to apprehend the putative Father of a Bastard Child, if he suffers him to escape, may be bound to the good Behaviour, and fo over to the next Gaol Delivery or Quarter- Seftions, and may be there ordered to contribute towards the Maintenance of the Bastard, or be fined.

Constables are the proper Officers to a Justice of Peace, as Sheriffs are to the higher Courts of Justice; and they, as well as Headboroughs, Tythingmen and other Officers of the Peace, are obliged to execute the Warrants either generally or specially directed to them by the Justices of the Peace : And when the Warrant is lawfully granted for a Matter within the Ju-rifdiction of the Justice, they may always safely execute it in a legal Manner.

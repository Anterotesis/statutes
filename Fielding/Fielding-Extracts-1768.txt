My Lord,

IF Self-interefi under the Masque of Public Spirit has been the general Plan of Dedications to Persons in Authority, as foiiie have afferted; I rejoice that unfeigned Truth allows me to declare, I am in this In-Fance actuated by no such Motive The plain Matter of Fad is, that in the Year 1754. a Plan of Police for the general Prevention of Fraud and Felony in this Kingdom, and for the A 2 better

better Preservation of Peace and good Order in this Metropolis and its Environs, was fet on foot by his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, which from its manifest Utility has ever since been constantly encouraged and supported by that RightHonorable Board where your Grace now fo ably presides. Time and Experience have added many useful Improvements to this Plan, amongst which the Publication of Extracts of those Laws particularly provided by the Legislature, for the Government of this populous City, is none of the least: For fo fluctuating are the Inhabitants of London, especially the laborious Part of them, and fo amazing is the Increase of Commerce, Carriages and Buildings, that it’s Streets and the Highways in its neighbourhood would scarce be paflable with Safety, were it not for the constant Promulgation as well as Execution of them. The Penal Laws made since the publication

Who, as it were, has put the finishing Hand to this admirable and useful Plan of Police, by affording me such Afliftance that one Ma-gistrate at least will be constantly fitting in Bow Street, to attend to the Complaints of his Majesty’s Subjects. For the drawing of all Informations of Fraud and Felony into one Point, registering Offenders of all Kinds* quick Notice and sudden Pursuit, and keeping up a Correspondence with all the a&ive Magistrates in England, wanted nothing to make it Complete but to be inceffant; and for this Obligation the Public is indebted to your Grace; and if faithfully executed, Pofterity will Feel its happy Effe&s; but even its present Services to the Community A 3 must

must be pleasing both to Wisdom and Humanity, as it renders it impossible for Offenders to continue their Outrages for any Time, or, as usual, to colled themselves into large and dangerous Gangs; the Certainty therefore of speedy Detection, muff deter some at leaff from this Course, and thereby .fave the Lives of many of his Majesty’s Subjects, and prevent the aifagreeable Expence to Government, of paying Rewards for apprehending of Robbers. And I am confident that within these 14 Years, much of this Expence has been faved, as will easily appear to your Grace, should you please to direct an Examination of the Account of the Monies issued for this Purpose to the Sheriff of Middlesex. If this be true, what can be more pleasing to good Sense and Humanity, than a Plan calculated to fave both Life and Expence. For whenever a becoming Regard for

At the end of this Work is added, an Account of forne Evils ft ill fiib-fifting which the Nature of my Em-

The Observations interspersed through the whole, are such as occurred on the Execution of those Laws, to which they are annexed-, and as fame of them point out Remedies as well as defeats, it is to be hoped that those Hints will receive fuel: Improvement from abler Hands as may make them effectual-, but as the chief Motive of publishing these Ext rails of the Penal Laws, was to inform, and thereby prevent Punishment, from a Perfuafon that most of the common People offend against them from Ignorance; and that many Persons of a superior Rank Jub-mit riot, only to Inconveniences, but even Infults, from being Stra?igers to the easy Remedy the Laws of their Country afford

THE

INTRODUCTION.

AMONG the various Grievances, which a falf: Notion of Liberty induces Men to complain of in this Kingdom, the Multiplicity of our Laws is one ; and more especially the great Number of penal Statutes, which inconsiderate Persons have deemed as Restraints upon Liberty.

And as some Men have been weak or wicked enough, to endeavour to diffatisfy the Minds of the People relative to those wholesome penal Laws, calculated for the Peace and good Order of this Town, and have thereby made the inferior Class of Men impatient of Authority, and rendered the Office of Magistrate more difficult; it is apprehended that it may be useful to explain the cause, Nature, Utility, nay, the Necessity of them: From whence it will appear, that they are really no other Restraints upon true Liberty, than what every good and honest Man. would wish for; for true Liberty can only con lift with those Restraints, which pure Religion and good Government lay upon Mankind.

The Multiplicity of Laws, fays an ingenious Writer, should not be looked upon fo much B as

The INTRODUCTION.

as a Grievance, as the Mark of a declining People and ‘Tacitus fays. In pejfima Republica plurim£ leges.

Indeed, when one Considers this City as the Metropolis of a Country of Freedom, a Country of Commerce, abounding with Inhabitants, increasing in Buildings, one may easily account for the Number of penal Laws made for its Government; for in all free Countries, the Increase of Laws must keep pace with Luxury. But in this Kingdom, the common People enjoy the peculiar Happiness of being governed by such Laws only, as they themselves have a Share in making. For when any Evil of a public!: Nature arises in Society to such a Height as to become visible, and to threaten Mischief, Application is made to Parliament, where, when the Existence of the Evil itself, and the Certainty of its consequences are satisfactorily proved, some Remedy is proposed by the Wif-dom of the Legislature ; which, when it has received the Royal Affent, pafies into a Law; and the very Inil ant this is done, the Law becomes iacred, and challenges implicit and universal Obedience.

It was the Remark of a Foreigner, that the common People of England seemed to have no ideaof an Offence lefsthan Fraud or Felony; and considered the Laws of their Country, which were calculated for Peace and good Order, merely as Restraints and Hardships.

If this be true, it is not doubted but that a Review of these Laws will have a due Influence on their Minds, and beget a more ready Obedience to them ; for it is clear from Experience, that they are oftener offended against from ignorance than Obilinacv. For

s

!

•i

The INTRODUCTION.

For this Purpose, therefore, I have in the following Sheets made Extracts of all those penal Laws which relate to the good Government of this Metropolis, and which will enable every Inhabitant (for whose Use they are particularly calculated) to judge for themselves when they have received any Injury, Inconvenience or In-fult from another, in what Manner they are to apply for Redress, and will point out immediately to them the Punishment the Law hath prescribed for the Offender.

What Englishman would wiili any one of these Laws should be repealed, fo wifely calculated for the Safety, for the Security of the Lives, Property, Liberty, and Happiness of the Subject? And it is the candid, diligent and impartial Execution of these Laws, that makes great Part of the English Police which Word, as it has been greatly misunderstood and misrepresented, I (hall endeavour to explain.

The bell; Definition I have ever met with of the Word itself, is what follows, viz. That it is the Regulation and Government of a City, or Country, so far as regards the Inhabitants. And this must always be fuited to the Nature of the Government and Constitution of the Country where it is exercised. The Police of an arbitrary Government differs from that used in a Republic -, and a Police proper for England, must differ from them both; as it must always be agreeable to the just Notion of the Liberty of the Subject:, as well-as to the Laws and Constitution of this Country; and is principally obtained by keeping up a Diligence and Adlivity of that noble Institution the Civil Power.

In

The INTRODUCTION.

r In the Year 1754, there were several large and desperate Gangs of Street-robbers, House-breakers, &£. that infefted this Metropolis, and the Neighbourhood about it; who committed the most audacious Robberies, Cruelties and Murders.

His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, shocked at these outrages on his Majesty’s Subjects, directed die late Henry Fielding, to consider of some Plan for the speedy Removal of these Mif-chiefs, and for the more easy apprehending and bringing such Offenders to Justice; which was immediately laid before his Grace, approved and supported by him, but the Execution of it on his Death fell to my Lot; and what happy Effects have fmce arofe from this Police, the Public can belt judge. 4§>

When these Acts of Violence were subdued. Prevention was the nextObjedt of Consideration as an essential Part of the Police; which was the enabling one or more Magistrates in this great Metropolis to give up their whole Time to the Public; to be watchful over Evils as they arofe in Society, and to suppress them in their Infancy by a due Execution of the Laws; for by habituating Mankind to an Obedience to the Laws of their Country, Peace and good Order imperceptibly arise: And at the same Time, by bringing all Informations of Fraud and Felony into one Point, keeping a Register of Offenders, making quick pursuit, opening a general Cor-respondence with all the active Magistrates in the Country, and defraying little Expences of Enquiries, Messengers, and of Pursuit in the first Instance, Escapes are rendered difficult, and Discoveries easy.^ Circumstances perhaps

;s

The INTRODUCTION.

that may deter many a one from these dangerous Enterprizes, and induce them rather to make a Trial of Industry for an honest Livelihood.

It was intended that these Magistrates should^ compose and reconcile the Differences among the Poor, and thereby prevent litigious Suits, which, as they make rich Men poor, muff . make the common People and their Families Burdens to their Parishes.

That they should be attentive by Day and Night to all Informations of Fraud and Felony, and be vigilant and indefatigable in the purfuic of Offenders, by encouraging, inffrufting, and preserving Harmony among the Peace Officers, and by rewarding them, and all other Persons assisting them in fatiguing and dangerous Undertakings : And by all Means that they should dif-courage common Informers, who are aptto trepan the Subject into Offences for the fake of the Penalty ; for when an Evil is not sufficient in itself to produce credible Witnesses for the Execution of the Law intended to remove it, it may truly be said to be no Evil at all.

That they should, by Publication and every other Means in their Power, make the penal Laws known, and enforce ,an Obedience to them by a due Execution thereof; for by making Punishment less frequent, its Effect is strengthened.

For this Trouble a competent Salary for Life should be allowed, that they may be truly Independent and feek for no other Advantage either from the Poor or the Rich, than that of the happy Opportunity of reconciling the Differences of the former, and the pleasing Taflc of pre-B 3 > venting

venting Infults on the latter; and let the weak or wicked laugh at or abuse this Police as they please, every true Briton must have this Satis-faction to refled, that no private Person whatever, no Watchman, Beadle, Constable, or Ma-gistrate, can unjustly deprive him of his Liberty or Property with Impunity.

From an attentive Perufal of these Extrads it will appear, that it is scarce possible for a Subjed to suffer either Injury, Inconvenience, or even Infult, without speedy Remedy. And as the Ignorance of the Law is no Excuse for the Breach of it, it is greatly to be hoped and much to be wished, that this Publication of the penal Laws, will take away the disagreeable Necessity of putting any of them in Execution;—Prevention being in all Respeds more eligible than Punishment.

But that the above Plan may be executed with EfFed, it is highly necessary that the Public should do their Part, by giving immediate Notice of all Frauds and Felonies, with exad Descriptions of Persons and Things ; on which Account all Expresses and Messengers will be paid their Expences, and rewarded for their Expedition, and their Informations received at all Hours. And if any Inhabitant is annoyed by disorderly, or Gaming-houses, Hops, or illegal Assemblies, by their Children, Servants or Apprentices, haunting the fame; Information or Notice thereof being given by Letter or otherwise, due Enquiry will be made, and every Means used to suppress the Evil. In these Cafes, Inhabitants appearing them-

selves, renders the Matter easy ;-for ir has

been found bv Experience, that nine out of ten

of

of these irregular Meetings have been suppressed merely by the Magistrates fending to the Parties, and making them acquainted with- the Nature of the Offence, and the Penalties which the Laws in such Cafes prescribe. For which Purposes, by Means of the late friendly Attention to the Police of his Grace the Duke- of Grafton, one Magistrate at lead: attends daily in. Bow Street from Ten to Two, and from Five to-Nine; and on every Wednesday three or more Justices fit there from Ten to Three, in Order to re-examine all such Prison as have been committed in the preceding Week, that they may have Time to fend for Friends and Wit-nesses to shew their Innocence, and prevent their being unwarrantably precipitated into Trials for Fraud or Felony ; and also to transact such public Business relative to Nufances, Apprentices, and the Wages of Artificers, as requires the Presence of more than one Justice, to execute which is a singular Convenience to this Metropolis,

Observ. It is much to be lamented, that the above AR had not extended the Power of the Sejfions to fixing the Rates and Fares of Carmen taking up Goods in the City and Liberty of Westminster, and Parts adjacent, as they are at present under no regulation relative to their Fares; and it is alfio much to be wished, that the Fares of Porters, who carry Goods and Parcels from the Inns to different Parts of the Town, who are very apt to im-pose on the Parties to whom they carry them, were fettled and fixed •, as many Persons have been obliged to pay more for little Presents of Game, Sec. than the Value of the Things them].elves.

CHAP. V.

Extracts from 2 W. Sc M. fe(T. 2. c. 8. for enlightning the Streets.

Obs. /tS Magiflraies do every Year, at Mi-chaelmas particularly, attend to the Execution of this Statute, the Publication of the following Clause may perhaps prevent fame Inhabitants from falling under the Penalty of the Law. Indeed, in most of the publick trading Streets, the immediate Inter eft, as well as Safety, induces the Inhabitants to hang out Lights as soon as the Evenings become long and dark; and it is much to be wished, that the Lights were equally attended to in that Part of the Town where People of Fafhioh generally dwell-, many of whom, not coming to Town till near Christmas, forget or neglect to order their Lamps to be lighted, not considering that they are subject to the Penalty hereafter mentioned, nor the Inconvenience it is to Passengers, who may at pre-fent walk up half a long Street, without seeing a Lamp:

Inhabitants to I. By the above Statute it- is enacted, That hang oat every Houfholder, within any of the Parishes, '®hts‘ Places, or Precincts, in the Counties of Mid-

dlesex

Extracts from the Penal Laws.

dlesex and Surrey, and the City and Liberty of Westminster, comprized within the weekly Bills of Mortality, whose House adjoins unto, or is near the Street, from Michaelmas unto Lady Day yearly, shall every Night fet or hang out Candles or Lights in Lanthorns on the Outside of the House next the Street, to enlighten the fame for the Convenience of Passengers, from Time to Time, as it shall grow dark, until Twelve o’Clock in the Night, upon Pain to forfeit the Sum of z s, for every default; excepting such Person or Persons as shall agree to make Use of Lamps of any Sort, to be placed at such Distances in the Street as shall be approved of by two or more Justices of the Peace,

One half of this Penalty to be paid to the Informer, the other Part to the Poor of the Parish, to be levied by Distress and Sale of the Offender’s Goods.

N. B. This Part of this Act only relates to those Streets that are not new Paved by the Com-missioners.

Obs. The Legislature, hy giving one half of She Penalty to the Informer, doubtless intended to facilitate the Execution of the Penal Laws •, but it certainly has a contrary Effeli \ for those who make Informations before Magistrates from the mere Motive of the Reward, are of the difrepu-table Kind; and the Advantages annexed to Informers, have rendered the Office itself odious, ,and deterred many reputable Persons from redressing Injuries and Inconveniences they have laboured under, for Fear of the odious Imputation of an Informer. And it is believed, that if Rewards in general, given to Informers by penal Laws,

were

44

ExtraBs from the Penal Laws.

were taken away, and the whole Penalty given to the Poor, &c. the Laws themselves would be easier executed, and the Evils they were intended to remedy, easier removed. For it is from Experience I have observed, that for one Information made from the Motive of the Reward, twenty have been mads from a Desire only of removing a public Evil or Nufance, without the least Regard to the Reward, which such Informers have generally applied themselves to charitable Uses, having first paid the Expence of the Pro-fecution: But as Gain is the common Idea of the Motive of all Informations, many even of these Per-fons have been infilled for their good Offices to the Public, which would not be the Cafe, if Rewards in general were taken away and the Removal of Evils themselves would always be found sufficient Motives for Complaint, and at the fame fime it would give Weight and Dignity to the Laws themselves.

As the above Acts only oblige Inhabitants to hang out Lights till Twelve o’Clock; and as the Manner in which many of them do hang out their Lights, is the Occasion of much Inconvenience, it were to be withed that one Law was made for enlightning the City of Westmin-fter and the adjoining Parishes, in the County of Middlesex, by which Lamps should be fixed on Pofts on the Outside of the Footway or other-wife, and in Courts and Passages in the best Manner they will admit of, at such Distances as the Church-wardens and Overseers, for the Time be-ing,*of every Parish, and one Justice of the Peace shall think proper; with a Power for every such Parish to make and raise a rate for the Payment of the fame. The said Lamps to be lighted by Five in the Evening, from Michaelmas to Lady-Dry, and during the other Part of the Year, by

Obs. I'he Injunction in this Clause was made in the Infancy of Reformation, when the Remains of Bigotry and Superflition, the consequences of Ignorance, influenced the Minds of the then English Subjects; but by the long Prablice of the left of Religions, and by the great Pains that have been ftnce taken, by many excellent Divines, to open and enlarge the Minds of their Hearers, and to convince them of the Happittefs that arises from the Practice of our established Religion •, float is now become Matter of Inclination, which the Legislature before thought an Objebl of Force; and tho’ it be some-what inconvenient, yet it is a Pleasure to reflect that many of the Churches in this Metropolis are now too smallfor the Reception of the Parishioners, which has given Rife to the Building of many Chapels of Eafe, and it were much to be wifloed that they were under the proper Regulations of the Mini-fters of each Parish, as it would be more confluent. ■ with Decency and true Religion, than the present Mode of theatrical Preaching.

As the Ignorance of a Law cannot be accepted either by a Commissioner or a Justice of the Peace, as an Excuse for the Breach of it; it is apprehended, that if the Hackneymen would print these Extratls in a Hand Bill, and distribute them to their Drivers, who are a finSluating Body, and constantly coming from the Country, it would prevent many or most of the above Offences; for Experience Jhews, that the Want of Reverence to Authority in the common People, is greatly owing to their Ignorance of tbofe Laws, fo wifely calculated to produce Peace and good Order in Society.

Obs. 2. As the Disputes between Coachmen, Chairmen, and their Fares, are generally about a Six pence, and seldom more than a Shilling, it is recommended to all Persons to pay on these Occa-ftons, what the Coachmen and Chairmen demand, and take their Humber-, for by this Means they

ExlraBs from the Penal Laws', secure to themselves an Opportunity of enquiring into, and a Power of pimishing, any such Impo-fition ■, whereas, whoever shall offer or pay any Hackney Coachman or Chairman less than his Fare, they may be fare of receiving a Summons, or perhaps being taken up with a Warrant from some Justice of the Peace, and obliged not only to pay the Fare, but also the Mar'* Expence: For Hackney Coachmen and Chairmen, never apply to Magif rates before they are certain they are in the right; well knowing the Certainty of their Punishment, if they have demanded more than their Fare.

ExtraSls from the 25 Geo. 2. c. 36. for punishing Persons keeping disorderly Houses.

,or any other disorderly House, in such Parish or Place •, the Constable or such Officer as afore-said, fo receiving such Notice, shall forthwith go with such Inhabitants to one of his Majesty’s Justices of the Peace of the County, City, Riding, Division or Liberty, in which such Parish or Place does lie; and shall, upon such Inhabitants making Oath before such Justice, that they do believe the Contents of such Notice to F be

Oes. The Rewards mentioned in this Clause, joined to the Nufance that disorderly Houses must be to the Neighbours, should, as one would imagine, be a sufficient Incentive to the Execution of this Act.

over36 k°Uaii H. That upon such Constable or other Officerentering into such Recognizance to prosecute as aforesaid, the said Justice of the Peace shall

forthwith make out his Warrant to bring the Person fo accused of keeping a Bawdy-house, Gaming-house, or other disorderly House, before him, and (hall bind him or her over to appear at such General or Quarter-Sedion or Af-sizes, there to answer to such Bill or Indictment as (hall be found against him or her for such Offence; and such Justice (hall and may, if in his Discretion he thinks fit, likewise demand and take Security for such Person’s good Behaviour in the mean Time, and until such Indictment (hall be found, heard and determined, or be returned by the Grand Jury not to be a true Bill.

Obs. It is observable, from these Clauses, what Oaths and Informations are necesjary to be laid before the Magistrate, before he can take any Step ■whatever.

III. That in cafe such Con (table (hall neglect Constable or refuse, upon such Notice, to go before any ^2leflinS Justice of the Peace, or to enter into such Re- uty' cognizance, or (hall be wilfully negligent in carrying on the said Prosecution; he (hall for every such Offence forfeit the Sum of 10I. to each of such Inhabitants fo giving Notice as aforesaid.

Obs. From these Entrails of the above recent Statute, the Method of suppressing disorderly Houses is most clearly explained, tho’ by the fiy and wicked Injimiations to be met with in the public Papers, which are too often the Vehicles of Ignorance, Calumny and Falftsood, one would imagine that a Justice of the Peace could as cafily suppress a Bawdy-house as difcba'rge a domestic Servant. By the Police in an arbitrary Government, this, perhaps, might be done; ' but an F 2 English

66

Extracts from the Penal Laws,

English Police can only prevent by seasonable Cautions, and onlypunish on due Informations and legal Proofs. The Laws of England are not to be executed on Caprice or Fancy, but by the Administra-tion of solemn Oaths ; and, as the Law itself fays, by the Testimony of one or more credible Witnesses on Oath.

But Misrepresentations and Credulity have fo flrong a Foundation in the Depravity and Wtakness of human Nature, that it is absurd for Persons in public Characters, who are every Day tried and condemned, or rather condemned and tried by the Public, to hope totally to avoid its Effects.

It has been often observed in the public Papers, and from thence generally believed, that all the Bawdy Houses in and near Covent-Garden, had Licences from the Just ice of Peace of that Parish to fell Liquors, consequently, were in that respect countenanced by him ; and this Miflake has arofe, and been propagated by ignorant Enquirers, who when they have drank a Bottle of Wine at a Bawdy-house, have asked the Keepers thereof if they had not a Licence for felling that Liquor, to which the Bawd might with Truth answer that Jhe had, and from hence the Enquirer concluded that it must be a Ju-ftice of Peace's Licence. But the FaCl is quite other-wife, f.r all or mod of these Houses have Wine Li ■ cences granted to them by the Commissuners of the Stamp-Office, which is the only and true cause of their Continuance and of making them Nufances; and tho' many Reflections have been unjustly made on Sir John Fielding on this Account, yet it is certain, that when the present Sir John Fielding/r/? came to reside in Covent-Garden, he took away the Ju-flice of Peace's licence, as well from the Bagnio's as these Houses, nor has be negleCIed the faithful

Execution of his Duty on any one Information kid before him relative to them; and here it may be proper to Observe, that one of the principle causes of the Number of Bawdy-houses being collected together in and near that Parish, is, there having been feve-ral Estates in the Courts and contiguous Streets where the Leases of the Houses were fo near expiring, that it was not worth while to repair them till they were out, by which means they were let for almost any thing to the loweft of Wretches, who hired three or four of them and filled them with common Profti -tutes •, this made Exeter-Screet, Change Court, Eagle-Court, and little Catherine-Street fo infamous, that it was dangerous for Persons to pass or repafs thro’ those Streets; and as the Publicans and inferior Shop-keepers in their Neighbourhoods were supported by these Houses, there could be little Hopes of their making Informations against them, and the Expence of Indictments and Profecuiions upon them in the Courts of Justice prevented the Law being put in Execution; but it is apprehended, that if a Power was given to two or more Justices of the Peace to enquire into these Offences in a summary Way, and on the Conviction of such Bawds, to commit them for three Months and make them pay a Penalty of to I. it wouldfupprefs the Evil to a deferable Degree, for perhaps the total Suppreffwn of them might give Strength and Countenance to a worse vice, already too common.

As to those poor Wretches the Profiitutes them-selves, most of whom are decoyed into these Houses by the most shameful Stratagems, and continued in the Service of the Bawds by every Species of Cruelty and Persecution; they have been Time after Time apprehended and committed to Bridewell,

without producing any good Effect either to them-fives cr the Public, for the Houses are soon fup~ plied with ethers, and the Evil instead of lessening rather increases; and as every year adds to the Number cf common Projlilutes, many of them must be in the iitmoji Dijlrefs, and being at first either deluded by their own Passions, or debauched by the Arts of others to become Proflitutes, and the great Number of Wretches in the fame Cafemaking Business in their dreadful Way scarce, many of them addtheThief to the Proftituie; but if once in two or three Tears these superflucus Women, fo miserable in themselves, such a Nufance to the Public, and fo dangerous to Society, were to be taken up, their diseases cured, and themselves fent Abroad as Indenture Servants for four Tears to America, allowing them proper Wages, and paying their Pajfage, it might be of infinite Service to the Inhabitants of that Country who want women Servants, put a flop to the Evil here, and prevent many of these unhappy Wretches from dying, under the most afflicted Circumstances -, and nothing but the cccafional Removal of superfluous Proflitutes can possibly either remove the Evil itself cr prevent its consequences; and as the Method here proposed partakes of Humanity, and is therefore preferable to Severity, it is to be hoped that under the Direction of feme of cur worthy Merchants it will take place, as they, by their Corre-spondence in America, may have an Account of many Families who want domestic Servants, may be impowered by them to hire such, and fend them over with cafe in their own Ships ; for, as many of these Women continue in their unhappy way of Life, more from Necessity than Inclination, there is every Reefer, to hope, that such would reform,

CHAP. XI.

ExtraBs from 1 W. & M. c. lo. and i Geo. i. c. 5. relating to the disturbing Divine Worfiip.

WHEREAS many evil-disposed and immoral Persons have of late disturbed, or caused to be disturbed, several diflenting licensed Congregations, and have thereby brought themfeives and their Friends into Difficulties and Inconveniencies •, and as the Weak are too often made the Instruments of the Wicked on these Occasions, it is to be hoped that the Publication of the following Clauses will for the future preserve Decency and Tranquillity in all lawful Assembles for Divine Worlhip, and secure an Obedience to, and a ft rift Observance of these Laws; The first of which enacts,

I. That if any Personor Persons do and shall wil- Disturbing-lingly and of Purpose maliciously and contemptu- Lo"^rf^a[3i_ ously come into any Cathedral or Parish Church, worihip. Chapel or other Congregation, for Divine Wor-ihip permitted by Law, and disquiet or disturb the fame, or milufe any Preacher or Teacher, such Person or Persons, upon Proof thereof, before any Justice of the Peace, by two or more fuf-ficient Witnesses, (hall find two Sureties to be f 4 bound

Personj pul- II. By i Geo. 1. c. 5. / 4. It is enacted, That ChurchcT ^any Persons unlawfully, riotouQy and tumultu-

Chspd'^&c. ou% assembled together, to the Disturbance of the public Peace, shall unlawfully, and with force, demolish or pull down, or begin to de-molish or pull down, any Church or Chapel, or any Building for religious Worlhip, certified and registered according to the above Statute, or any Dwelling-house, Barn, Stable or other Out-house, that then every such demolishing or pulling down, or beginning to demolish or pull down, shall be adjudged Felony without Benefit of Clergy, and the Offenders therein shall be adjudged Felons, and shall suffer Death, as in case of felony, without Benefit of Clergy.

Obs. As many Persont’from Bigotry, Prejudices, Caprice, Resentment and Drunkenness, have /offered themselves to be drawn aside by Mobs and Tumults, and inconsideralely to commit the above-mentioned Outrages, an Attention to the above Clau/e may be useful. Englishmen have no Ex-cufe to do themselves Justice by Force and Violence, as there are fo many excellent Laws provided for the Safety of their Lives, Defence of their Liberties, and the Security of their Property; and the Want of this Consideration is too frequently the cause of Rejiftance to Peace and Civil Officers, and was lately the cause of a most horrid Murder. It is always right to fiibmit to Constables, and ad

WHEREAS much Mischief hath lately-happened by throwing, calling add firing of Squibs, Serpents, Rockets, and other Fireworks, some Persons have thereby loft their Lives, others their Eyes, &c. And, indeed, every Marls Experience must Jhew him the Necessity of ibis Law, as it is Jlill very common for inconftderate Persons to throw Squibs, Serpents, Crackers, &c. into Coaches, Hottfes, and at Passengers, (especially at Women) by way of Diverson; it is to be hoped, therefore, that the Publication of this Law will awaken the Attention of such Offenders, and shew them the Cruelty of such Entertainmem.

It is apprehended', that it would he found very useful, if every Par if: would keep two strong Fire Ladders of different Lengths, to be carried on the fir ft Notice to the Place of the Fire, as it might be the Means of saving many Lives and much Property-, and though there be no Reward, allowed by Law for this Purpose, there would be no Danger but that the Carriers of such Ladders would be well rewarded, either by the Infu-ance-Office, Sufferers or Parish, though the Confcious-ness of being Useful in such Calamities is in itself a Reward-, and if Mr. Godfrey’s approved Method of extinguishing Fires should lake place, such Ladders would become more necessary than ever.

Penalty for every Neglect.

Obs. When one reflects as an Englishman what a Bleffmg the Seas on our Coasts have in Store for us, what a peculiar Benefit the Plenty of Sea Fish would he to the Poor, what a Conveniency to the Rich of this Metropolis, and that this immense Bleffmg is intercepted from us by the Contrivance and Combination of a few designing, avaricious Men, how can we fuf-ficiently lament that the Pains and Attention of the Legislature to redress this Evil, has been hitherto fruitless ? Nay, I am informed that the Evil is rather grown worse than better; It is therefore with Deference and Ref petti that I offer my Opinion on this Subjell, which I do rather that it may beget in fame other a better Plan, than that 1 think the following one to be perfect: But I do apprehend, that

ExiraBs from the Penal Laws.

if the Gentlemen belonging to the Free British Herring Fishery, a large, able and respefiaile Body, would (btfidts the catching of Herrings) become Fish-ermen for this Metropolis; which, as they have much Leifure from their other Fishery, are accustomed to, and conversant in, the building of Boats, making of Nets, and hiring of Fishermen, they can carry on, with more Eafc, and lejs Expence to themselves, and more Utility to the Publick, than any other Body, whatever. By this Means an immense Quantity of Fifi would be brought to Billingsgate and 'Westminster Markets, yet not more than this Town would cotifime, and would totally defray the present Monopoly of different Fish, viz. Lobjlers, Turbots, See. as well as the little Combinations lately practised to make an artifeial Scarcity: And as the Conveniency of a Plenty of Fish in London and Westminster to all Ranks of People, is much easier to be conceived than expressed, Ijhall now mention what seems farther necessary to the Furtherance of this Plan; And fir ft, that the Legislature should enable the Members of the Free British Herring Fishery to apply a neccf-fary Part of their Capital to this proposed Fishery, which cannot be attended with any Hazard, as ready Money is always paid at the Fish-markets; fo ibat :t will rather enrich the Body, and enable them to carry on the Herring Fishery itself with more Effect end Advantage, than obstruct it.

zdly. Besides the Provisions made by the late Statute relative to Sea-Fish, an Officer should be appointed to attend both Markets to fee such Methods faithfully executed, as the Legislature shall think necessary, to prevent the engrossing or monopolizing of any Ffo brought to the said Markets for Sale.

3dlv,

Extract from the Penal Lanes.

gdly, that every Person felling Fish by Retail out of the said Markets, shall be obliged to expose to open Few from Eight to twelve in the Mornings •whatever Fish he has to fell, with a Penalty for concealing any Part of the fame.

In this Plan, Public Spirit and Interefi will go Hand in Hand -, and as they -will be enabled to fit out a larger Fleet of Fishing-Baats than -was ever yet fent to Sea, great Plenty of Fish must be the Conference, and Cheapness will naturally follow -, and by little Bounties and Rewards which they themselves will be able to give to Fishermen, it is hoped that the Evil now fo loudly complained of, will be most effectually cured-, and the Fishmongers themselves, who have lately been the Dupes of the Fishermen, and the Monopolizers of particular Fife would have Reason to rejoice for, by felling more Fish at reasonable Rates, their Gain would be the fame, if not greater.

But while Salesmen and Fiftmongers have Shares in, or perhaps the whole Property of Fishing-Boats, it will always be in their Power to bring asfezo Fish to Market as they please, and consequently to raise the Price agreeable to this no less artful, than wicked Scai'city of their own making. In what an amazing Manner do the Fish of the Sea multiply, and how shamefully is this Bleff.ng intercepted, as well from the Poor as the Rich ; and yet how easy the Remedy, if this Plan be practicable-, thl the bringing Sea Ft.lh by Land Carriage to London bids fair to reduce the Evil.

ExtraBs from the 17 Geo. 2. c. 5. relating to Vagrants and disorderly Persons.

Obs. As the great Number of Beggars and other Vagrants that infeft the Streets of London, to the great Nitfance of Passengers and Shopkeepers, owe their Continuation as well to the Neglect of the Peace Officers and others, as to the Want of knowing who are and who are not deemed Vagabonds by Law, it is apprehended that the following Description of Vagabonds, together with the Power of apprehending them when known, may leffien the Evil-, particularly that of frightful Beggars, fo common in the Streets, fo offensive to Passengers in general, and fo dangerous to pregnant Women.

And as any Person may apprehend a Vagrant, bow commendable it would be for Gentlemen, when withered Arms, Stumps, and other disfigured Parts of the Body are exposed to Ladies in Coaches, to direA their Footmen immediately to carry such Offenders before a Jufiice of the Peace, which would soon put an End to this shameful Practice; and it were to be wished for the Sake of the really di-ftrejfed Poor, who are obliged to beg, and who have frequently perished in the Streets of this Metropolis for Want, notwithstanding their Settlement was in some of the Parishes of London or Westminster, that the cruel Cufiom of Vejlry J Clerks rejecting their own Poor, unless brought by a Pafs was abolished, fer it is contrary to Law, contrary to Jufiice, and Inhuman to the lafi Degree.

Obs. When it is con flier ed by the Publican how much he pays yearly for his feverr.l Licences, that he is subject to quarter Soldiers, and we other Lof'cs and Expenses nccejjarily attending the carrying on his Business, surely he cannot be too cautious to avoid the above Penalties, which must r.ecejfarily dijlrefs his Family, as well as take away the Reputation of bis House. And as there arc many Pcrfcns who

are wicked, enough to teaze a Publican to lend them Cards, or to fuffler them to Game in their Houses, merely that they may have an Opportunity to inform against the House for the Sake of the Reward, no Publican can be fafe who fuffcrs Gaming of any kind in his House, whether by ILufe-keepers or not. But it is feared, that the too great Number of Public Houses is the great cause of these Evils, as it induces the Publican to make Use of these ‘Temptations to draw Custom to his House; which would not be the Cafe if their IS umber was lessened.

Tf the Magistrates of the County of Middlesex and City and Liberty of Westminster, would unani-mously agree to reduce the Number of Alehouses, by suppressmg t'oofe that appear to be unnecessary, from the Number there are in the Neighbourhood, who only Jlarve one another, and would make it a con-stant Rule to ref ufe a Licence to any Publican that has either Billiard Table, Mifflfflppi Table, Shuffle Board, or Skittle Ground in their Houses, allowing Skittle Grounds only to tbofe Publicans, who live in the Villages round this Metropolis, on Condition of Their not opening these Grounds till fix o'Clock in the Evening, it would be productive of infinite good Effects to Society. This Diversion would then answer the End of Relaxation to the Common People, without encouraging Idleness, or enervating Indufiry \ but SGttle Grounds in the Town are attended with much Mischief, and when they are kept open all Day in the Country they are equally obnoxious. And as I am now speaking of Publicans, it may not be improper to observe the great Injuries they frequently occasion to Trade, by ftiffering the Combinations of Journeymen at their Houses, where they meet, enter into scandalous Agreements to raise their Wages, lessen their Hours of Work,

perplex their Majlers, put a Jlop to "Trade, impo-verijh themselves and Families to enrich the Publican : this ought to be deemed a good cause for the refusal of a Licence.

Tradesmen paying their Workmen at Public Houses commonly called Pay Tables, are very injurious, as the Men are too often kept out of their Money ’till late on Saturday Night, out of Indulgence to the Publican, by 'which Means the Mechanic goes Home drunk and empty handed to his Family, where Bifirefs begets Words, then Blows.

* Obs. As Masters frequently lofe their Apprentices at the laiter Part of their Time, when they become most useful, it is recommended to all Persons taking Apprentices, to take Care that the Indentures of such Apprentices be made for seven Tears, and the said Indentures be indented, duly Jlamped, and that the Buttes to be paid for the Money taken with fitch Apprentices, be duly paid. An eyatt Observance of these Directions will prevent many In-conveniencies to both Majlers and Apprentices.

Masters also frequently lofe their Apprentices by their Enlisting and tho’ an Apprentice may be dif-charged by a Justice of Peace when enlified, yet, as recruiting Officers frequently give large Bounties for the raijing of Men to compleat their Corps, if they are careful to examine fuel young Men, whether.

they be Apprentices or not, I apprehend they may in-dibi such Apprentices for this species of Fraud $ and an Example or two of this fort would most certainly put an End to this Imposition, for an Officer cannot recover this Money by Action from the Master.

Obs. If instead of Servants in Husbandry as above-mentioned, it had been /aid Servants in general, it would have extended that Law to all do-meftic Servants whatever, and have subjected them as well as their Masters and Mijlrejfes, to have their Miscondubl and Misbehaviour, and Disputes about Wages, &c. to be enquired into by Ma-gistrates. The Body of domestic Servants is very large, and at present without any Regulation •, but it is apprehended, that if a Register-Office, founded on the fame Principles, and executed by the fame Methods as that in the Strand, fo long carried on by Mr. Fielding and Co. were to be under Servants i> Parliamentary Sanction, to have all Imitators fup- general. pressed, to be executed by Commissioners, and the Profits arising to go to the Government, it would be a great Bleffmg to Mankind; as it would open a fair Channel for Preferment for every faithful, industrious and diligent Servant, and would effectually prevent diffolute Servants from Admission into quiet worthy Fami lies.

One great cause of Disputes between Servants and their Masters or MiJlreJJes, is, the latter hiring the former, and engaging to give them a Month’s Warning, or a Month's Wages; this is a manifefi Disadvantage to both Parlies, is attended with 2 very

very evil Conferences, and often the Occasion of Servants having unjufi Characters.

idly. When Servants leave their Places, the Property of their Livery frequently begets very dif-agreedble Disputes, from the mistaken Opinion that a Servant's having wore his Uvay a Tear intitles bim to it: Indeed it is the Cujlcm of most Families to give their Servants the Old Livery, when they flay long enough to have New; but this is the Majler's Pleasure, not the Servant's Right, unless the Servant make it a Part of his Agreement when he hires himself; a Servant carrying away his Livery without Consent of his Master or Mistress, is liable to an Action, and if he pawn, fell, or unlawfully dispose of any Part of the fame, be subjects himself to be taken up by a Warrant, to be carried before a Justice of Peace, to pay a Penalty of 20 s. or to be committed to Bridewell for fourteen Days, and to be publickly whipt.

Lafily, Most of the Inconveniencits arising in Families from the MifeonduCl of Servants, are owing to the partial and unjufi Characters given of them by their Masters or Mifireffes, either from false good Nature, or undeserved Resentment; and as it is the bigbeft Injujlice to fay less of good Servants than they merit, it is the greatest Cruelty to fay more in Favour of bad ones than they ought; and it is a Rule never to be broke, not to take the Character of any Servant but from the Person whom they served last, if that can be had, and that by Word of Mouth if possible, as written Char alters are an Inlet to Imposition.

And here I cannot avoid taking Notice, that among the various Infiances of domefiic Reformations, which we have lately experienced in this Kingdom, none gives me fo ferfible a Pleasure as

the

the great Scarcity of French Cooks, French Valet de Chambres, and French Milliners, new to be met with in the English Families of Rank and Fortune, and as they first obtained a Footing here by their Artifice and our own Caprice, I hope that they have now loft it from a Conviction for ever to be established in the Minds of our Ladies and Gentlemen, that the English Cook can dress Ragouts, the English Valet deChambre can dress Hair, and the English Milliner dress Caps better than any French Man or Woman whatever. T,be Mixture of Foreign Servants, with the English never fails to beget Jealouftes, Quarrels and Disturbances in the Families where they live for as the former are too often beheld by the Master or Mistress with a partial Eye, they confe-quently enjoy a greater Share of their Confidence, which they frequently abuse by making them dift'atisfied with tRe Behaviour of their own faithful Countrymen. Indeed I have now and then heard a Jemmy Gentleman fay, that no Englishman could dress Hair in Fafte-, but when he recoUeCls that Hair was never more wore and better dress’d than at present, and that chiefly by Englishmen too, he may perhaps allow himselftobe in the Wrong for once; and it is clear to Demonstration to every impartial Mind that there ■ cannot be a Conveniency that ought to be expected from a Servant, but what may be certainly found among those who are born and brought up in Great Britain; The immense Confujion that has arofe in the Families of Merchants and other Gentlemen who have EJtales in the Weft-Indies, from the great Number of Negro Slaves they have brought into

this Kingdom, also deserves the most serious Attention •, many of these Gentlemen have either at a vast Expence caused feme of these Blacks to be inJlruCfed

Servant that comes to England; first, by getting them cbriftened or married, which they inform them makes them free, (tbo’ it has beat adjudged by our most able Lawyers, that neither of these Cir-cumfiances alter the Majler's Property in a Slave.) However it so far answers their Purpose, that it gets the Mob on their Side, and makes it not only difficult but dangerous to the Proprietor of these Slaves to recover the Possesswn of them, when once they are jpirited away, and indeed it is the less Evil of the two, to let them go about their Bufi-r.efs, for there is great Reason to fear that those Blacks who have been fent back to the Plantations, after they have lived some Stime in a Country of Liberty, where they have learnt to write and read, been acquainted with the Use, and entrufied with the Care of Arms, have been the Occasion of those Insurrections that have lately caused and threatened jncb Mischiefs and Dangers to the Inhabitants of, and Planters in the Islands in the Weft-Indies;

< it

*45

Extracts from the Venal Lancs, it is therefore to be hoped that these Gentlemen mil be extremely cautious for the future, how they bring Blacks to England, for besides that they are defeated in the Ends that they propose by it, it is a Species of Inhumanity to the Blacks themselves, who while they continue Abroad in a Degree of Ignorance fo necessary to render a State of Slavery suppartable, are in fame Measure contented with their Condition, and chearfully submit to those fevers Lwas which the Government of such Persons makes necessary; but they no sooner come over, but the Sweets of Liberty and the Converfafm with free Men and Christians, enlarge their Minds, and enable them too soon to form such Comparifons of the different Situations, as only serve when they are fent back again to imbitter their State of Slavery, to make them rejlless, prompt to conceive, and alert to execute the blackeft Conspiracies against their Governors and Majlers. Magistrates are frequently applied to, to cause such Negroes as run away to be apprehended, this is a Mistake, for Ju-Jlices have nothing to do with Blacks but when they offend against the Law, by the commission of Fraud, Felony or Breach of the Peace.

Oes. The Master Taylors in this Metropolis have repeatedly endeavoured to break and suppress the Combinations of their Journeymen to raise their Wages and lessen their Hours of Work, but have ever been defeated, notwithstanding the excellent Provifton of the above Statute; and this has been in fame Measure owing to the Infidelity of the Masters themselves to each other; feme of whom, taking the Advantage of the Confufton, have collected together some of the ableft of the Journeymen, whose exorbitant Demands they have complied with, while many other Masters have bad a total Stop put to their Business, because they world not be guilty of a Breach of fo necessary a Law ; but the success of the Journeymen in these Disputes, and the Submiftion of their Masters, is chiefly owing to the Custom the Masters now have got of charging extra Wages in their Bills, by which Meaxs they relieve themselves, and the Impofttion is thro wn entirely on the Public, who can alone redress it, by throwing it back again upon the Master Taylor.* for whose Benefit and Security the Legislature has taken such Pains as leaves him without Room for Complaint For ether Matters, fee Appendix, under Title ‘ Taylors.’

But as the feizr ing of Goods is a dfagreeable Circttmftance, and the getting rid of troublesome Tenants is always attended with much Difficulty, frequent Quarrels and Dif-puies, it is impoffble to be too careful and exact, in enquiring into the Characters of fitch as are admitted Tenants to Houfts or Lodgings, and more particularly the latter; whose Charactersfhould be enquired ft the Place where they lajl lodged.

Obs. Nctwillflanding this excellent Provision, the good Intention of the Legislature is f ill defeated, by the Pawnbrokers requiring Bills of Sale of their Cujinrers, end feme Times, for a very short Time, which, as it has more the appearance of taking the Advantage of the unwary than any Thing else, no Pawnbroker should, on any Account whatever, de-Jtrc, induce or persuad, any Cujlomer to give a Bill

197

ExtraBs from the Penal Laws, of Sale of Goods tinder the Value of 101. Indeed,

•when they lend larger Sums, a Bill of Sale may then be proper; but even then it jheuld not be made for less than 12 Months, unkfs the Goods arc pe-rifltabk. But for small Sums, the Parly had much better fell the Goods at first, than pawn them, and give a Bill of Sale, as in all Probability they -will then be in a better Stale, and fetch more.

Perhaps the Pawnbroker may fay, that these Bills of Sale for Goods pledged for less than 10 1. are lawful-, but fire he can never fay they are equitable, or in any Ref peel agreeable to the Intention of the law itself-, and fhotdd they continue this Practice, it may pofftbly beget fame new Clause to provide against it.

IX. That if the Pawn or Pledge of Goods Goods rear Chattels (hall remain unredeemed, for £he "’ae!"^uJlrc-Space of two Years, then every such Pawn or, years °r Pledge (hall be forfeited •, and the Person to forfeited, and whom such Goods or Chattels have been pawned may be fold, or pledged, may sell the same •, subject, never-

theless, to account for the Overplus of the Produce of all such Goods or Chattels,

Provided that every Person, to whom any Entry to be Goods or Chattels shall have been pawned or ma‘if of.Sa^3 pledged, shall enter in a Book, to be kept for p‘aw°.^or that Purpose, a true and just Account of the Sale 2 j nf 1!p. of all Goods and Chattels pawned tor 2 I. or up- wards, wards, expressing the Day when the Money for

Sammor.fe XI. Provided always, That no Fee or Gratuity and Warrants whatsoever shall be had, taken or received, for rithoutTec anf Summons or Warrant granted by any Justice of the Peace in any of the aforesaid Cafes.

Obs. Besides the Restraints laid upon the Pawnbrokers by this Act, the reputable Part of them agreed, for the more easy detection of Frauds and Felonies, to observe several Rules that have been recommended to them, which the Reader may find at the End of the Ex trails.

Obs. The Manner of recovering the above Penalty will always -prevent the Execution of this Law, fo necessary to preserve the Credit of that Trade both at Home and Abroad; but it is apprehended, if the Offence was to be heard in a summary Way before one or more Justices of the Peace, and the Penalty to be raised by Warrant of Bistress, it would recover the Utility of the AS ; but the great Expence of Suits in the Courts of Justice at present reduces all Penal Laws, however useful in themselves, to a mere dead Letter.

AN D whereas a Doubt hath arisen whether the solemn Affirmation or Declaration of the People called Quakers, prescribed by 8 Geo. 1. can be allowed and taken instead of an Oath, in any Case wherein by any Act or Acts of Parliament an Oath is required, unless the said Affirmation or Declaration be by such Aft or Ads particularly and expressly directed and allowed to be taken instead of such Oath: By reason of which Doubt, the Testimony of the laid People called Quakers, is frequently refused, whereby the said People, and others requiring their Evidence, are fuejected to great Inconveniences: Therefore, to remove the said Doubt, it is, by Affirmation of the said Act of 22 Geo. 2. enacted, That in Quakers ai- ^ ajj Cafes wherein by any Aft or Acts of Parlia-ofan Oath men!: now 'n f orce, or hereafter to be made, an Oath is or shall be allowed, authorized, directed or required, the solemn Affirmation or Declaration of any of the People called Quakers, in the Form prescribed by 8 Geo. shall be allowed and taken instead of such Oath, although no particular or express Provision be made for that Pur-pose in such Aft or Acts; and all Persons who are or (hall be authorized or required to admi-nifter such Oath, shall be, and are hereby authorized and required to administer the said Affirmation or Declaration : And the said solemn

CAUTIONS to Shopkeepers and Trades-meii in general, and to their Journeymen, Apprentices, Errand Boys and Porters-, and to Book-keepers, Inn-keepers, &c.

ISFORTUNES and Distresses have been

observed to have very different Effects according to the Dispositions of the Party on whom they fall: When well-disposed Persons are afflicted, it is apt to make them mild, humble, grateful and resigned •, but when the Malevolent meet with Difficulties, it generally makes them envious, impatient, malicious and repining. Necessity, they fay, is the Mother of Invention ; and when that arises rather from Accident than Extravagance, the Invention is ge-

O' D

nerally employed in what is useful to Mankind, and its Productions deserve the Name of Ingenuity ; but when the Necessity arises from extravagant Debaucheries, the Invention is then racked to the Injury of Mankind, to obtain their Property, as Fuel for their own Profufe-ness. The Produce of this Species of Invention is what I call Fraud; and excelling in this Sort of Deceit is what constitutes the Character of a Gambler, whose various Devices are the Subject of what follows.

Doubtless there are Gamblers in every Rank of Life, as well as Gamesters: As to those who trick you out of your Knowledge, by what they commonly call Sucking your Brains, or out of your Reputation, your Wife or your

Daugh-

Extracts from the Penal Laws. Daughter; under the Specious Pretence of Friendflhip, they are out of the Reach of the Law- The greater the Capacity of a Gambler, the more Dangerous he is to Society, as his Abilities and Resolution enable him to execute great and dedruftive Schemes, while those of a lower Rank content themselves with smaller Acquisitions. But in Order to convey a just Idea of this Animal, I shall endeavour to (hew him in all the different Spheres in which he exerts his Ingenuity, from the lowed to the highest.

A Pickpocket, though a Felon, seems to be in the lowed Class of Gamblers •, but his Suc-cefs rather arises from the Dexterity of his Hands, than the Contrivance of his Head ; and like Rats and other such Vermin, they appenrr rather to take the Advantage of your Negligence and Inattention, than to contend with your Understanding. The first and lowed Class of Gamblers then, who would cheat you with your Eyes open, are those who invite you to prick in the Belt or Garter for a Wager and the Certainty of Winning at this Sort of Diversion appears fo clear to the Novice, thac he never fails to bite, if he be a proper Object. And here I mud premife, that these Gamblers are such exquisite Judges of their Prey, that they seldom fail of Success.

The next Class are those who find a Paper full of Gold Rings, which they take Care to pick up in the Sight of a proper Object, whose Opinion they a(k. This Set appear very mean, which gives them an Opportunity of saying they ' had rather have found a good Piece of Bread

The Cull immediately bites, and thinking to make a cheap Purchase of an ignorant Fellow, gives him 20 s. for four or five Brafs Rings washed over- Or what is more frequent, and yet more successful, is the picking up of a Shilling or a Half-Crown, before the Face of a Countryman, whose Opinion of it is immediately asked, whether it be Silver or not, and he is invited to Share the Finder’s Good-luck in a Glafs of Wine or Pot of Ale. The harmless Countryman, pleased at such an Invitation in a strange Place, is carried to an Ale-house, where the Sharper’s Friends are waiting for him, and where cutting or playing at Cards is soon pro-posed, and the Countryman mod certainly tricked out of all his Money, Watch and every Thing valuable he has about him.

The next Sett attend at Inns •, and as Porters are instructed to carry Boxes and Parcels that come from the Country, the Gambler takes Notice of the Directions, and fends his Comrade immediately to the House, where he waits for the Arrival of the Porter ; meets him within a few Doors of the House, or if the Door be shut he (lands on the Steps, and begins immediately to abuse the Porter for his Delay, Damns him, and tells him he was just coming for it; that he had a great Mind to give him nothing: The Porter aftts Pardon, the Gambler pays him and takes Possession of the Goods, with which lie decamps the Instant the Porter’s

Back

Back is turned. And as Tradesmen generally employ Country Fellows for Porters in their Housesj two or three of these Gamblers are generally waiting at the Corner of the Streets near some of the great Inns; and if they hear one of the Porters, charged with a Box or Bundle, afk his Way to the Inn, one of them -steps up to him very civilly, tells him that he is going that Way, and will shew him the House. The Countryman implicitly follows his Guide, whilst the Gambler’s Comrade takes the Hint, marches before and plants himself at some convenient Passage, puts his Hat into his Pocket, and flicks a Pen in his Wig to repre-fent a Book-keeper; the Guide acquaints the Countryman, that that is the Book-keeper of the Inn, who immediately lays down his Burthen, and the Book-keeper desires him to go over the Way to his Wife for the Key of the Ware-house, and in the mean Time the two Gamblers march off with the Goods.

The next Class ufe the following Stratagem: One of them goes in the Drefs of a Footman, and desires some Tradesman to carry Goods to his Mailer, which are generally fent by the Journeyman, who is carried into a Parlour hired for that Purpose by the Footman, who tells him that he will carry the Goods up to his Mailer, and will bring down an Account of what he chufes •, but the Moment he has got Possession of the Goods, he (huts the Parlour Door, and marches out of the Passage or if the Mailer has a Mind to assist the Servant, he fends the Tradesman back for other Sorts; but before he returns makes off with what he has. Servants, who S 2 have

Extracts from the Penal Laws'. have lived with Taylors, Mantua-makers, Milliners, and other Trades that fend frequently to the Shops, have, when they have been discharg-ed, gone in the Name of their Matters and Mif-treffes to the said Shops, and taken up great Quantities of Goods, in which they have fuc-ceeded the easier from their being known to the Shopkeeper. Might it not then be useful to give Notice to the Shopkeepers used by the said Trades-people of their Discharge of such a Servant ?

There is another Sett who defraud Tradesmen by taking on themselves false Names, and by pretending to be related to, or connected with, 1‘ome Persons of Credit and Falhion, and produce false Letters to prove their Intimacy. Some of these Gamblers attend most of the Fairs in the Country, where they make it their Business to enquire at Inns who serves them with their Wines and Brandies from London; and fish out of Shopkeepers the Names of the Tradesmen here who supply them with Goods. Fumiflied with this Knowledge, they come tp London, and one Day appearing in the Character of a Country Inn-keeper, they go to the Distiller, whose Name they have learned, telling him he has taken an Inn in such a Country; that he was recommended to him by one of his Customers, whose Name he tells him, and describes his House and Family. The Distiller’s Suspicion being lulled afleep by this Stratagem, he chearfully supplies his new Customer with some of his bell: Goods, and fends them to some appointed Inn in Town, from whence they are conveyed by the Gambler and converted into Calh, by felling them as

Run Goods for half Price, The very fame Scheme is practised on Grocers and other Shopkeepers, only by changing their Charader into that of a Country Shopkeeper: It is immaterial to them what Goods they purchase. A Gambler the other Day bought of a Farmer ten Ton of Potatoes, to be delivered one Ton at a Time, and when two Tons were delivered, they were to be paid for; but when the second Ton came, the Gambler difappeared, and had not the Farmer been a Man of Spirit, he would have loft his Property, but finding himself defrauded he took Possession of the Gambler’s Warehouse, and rescued his Goods out of his Hands.

There is another Set of Gamblers, commonly called Duffers, who attend at Chari ng-Cr ofs, ac St. Clements-Churchy and Ludgate-IIil!, and invite you to go down some Alley, and buy some cheap India Handkerchiefs and Waistcoats; but this Cheat growing ftale, they ufe another Method, which of late has been very fuccefsfu!: They apply themselves to some young Publican to borrow 20 or 301, to make up a Sum ; and to shew they do not want Money in general, they produce a large Purse well crammed with Counters and Bral's Medals, which they give the Publican a distant View of, that he may take it for Money; they then produce some Silk Waistcoats embroidered with Tinfel, which if noc strictly examined, may pass for Silver; these Waistcoats they propose with other India Goods made in Spital-Fields, to leave in the Hands ot the Publican or his Wife, as a Security for the Money they want, who ignorant of the S 3 Value

ExtraBs from the Fenal Laws.

Value of the said Goods, generally fall into their Trap.

The following Stratagem has been of late very successful. The Gambler goes to a Shop, and with great Coolness and Compofure, looks over many Goods, deals hard, calls himself a ready-money Customer, and expects for that Reason to buy cheaper 5 the Goods being pitched on and their Price fixed, he orders them to be packed up with a Bill and Receipt, and to be fent to his House in about an Hour, where he promises to be and to pay for them. Suspicion being thus removed, the Porter carries the Goods, but the Gentleman is not come home, though the Wife is there, rbady to receive all that comes, and who generally by Artifice baffles the Porter, and gets Pofifeffion of the Goods. The Tradesman calls Time after Time, but the Gentleman is not at Home, and the Truth is, he lodges at some dit'tant Part of the Town, and makes Use of this House only as a Warehouse, to deposit such Goods as he can obtain by Fraud from Tradesmen.

In the Cafes of such ready-money Customers as these, Porters fflould be directed not to leave the Goods till they have received the Money for them, on Pain of paying for them themselves.

The highest Rank of Cheats who attack the Understanding, have made Use of the following Stratagems: One of the Gang, who is happieft in his Person, and has the bell: Address, is pitched upon to take a House, which, by Means of the extreme good Character given of him by his Comrades to the Landjord, is soon accom-plished. The next Consideration is to furnish

it, when Mr.--------, a young Ironmonger just

fet up, is pitched upon to provide the Squire's Grates; who glad of fo fine an Order, soon ornaments his Chimnies with those of the neweft

Falhion. This being done, Mr.-----------, the

Upholder, is immediately applied to for other Furniture, and is brought to the House in Order that he may fee the Grates, which he no sooner beh •Ids, than he tells, his Honour that he could have furnished him likewise with Grates of the bell: Kind at the moll: reasonable Rates; to which 'Squire Gambler replies, that he intends taking some little Villa in the Country, where

Mr.---------shall furnish every Thing he can.

The House being now compleatly Furnished, the 'Squire drefies himself in his Morning Gown, Velvet Cap, and red Morocco Slippers, puts one or more of his Comrades into Livery, then fends for Taylor, Linen-Draper, Silversmith, Jeweller, &c. takes upon him the Character of a Merchant, and by getting Credit of one by pawning the Goods the Moment he has got them, he is enabled to pay ready Money to others-, by which Means he extends his Credit and increases his Orders till he is detected which sometimes does not happen till he has defrauded Tradesmen to a very considerable Value. Nay, I have known them sometimes carry their Scheme so far as to fix one of their Comrades at some Rendezvous in Wrapping, in the Character of a Captain of a Vessel lying at such Stairs, and bound to some of the American Plantations, by which Means the aforesaid Merchant procures Goods to be lent Aboard ; and as his Credit advances, he makes ufe of Draughts, which are conlfantly accepted by his Comrades, who have S 4 con-

262

Extracts from xoe Penal Laws. constantly changed their Lodgings when the laid Draughts have become due.

There is a Sett of Sharpers, who have lately purchased several Estates without Money, in the following manner: They make a Bargain with the Seller or his Agent for the Estate, in Con-sequence of which they draw Articles of Agreement, by which they oblige themselves to pay the Purchase Money at such a Time, and give a Bond for the Performance of Covenants They then immediately go to the Tenant, to lliew him the Articles of Agreement, and tell him that he will soon have a new Landlord; upon which the Farmer begins to complain of the old One, and hopes his Honour will repair this, rebuild that, and alter something else, which the new Landlord promises to do. Credit being thus gained with the Tenant, the new Landlord falls in Love, perhaps, with the Farmer’s Daughter, or with a fine Horse, or else borrows Money of him, and gives him a Draught upon his Banker in Town, who seldom has any Calh in Hand, and often is not to be found.

There are a Sett of Cheats, who constantly attend at Inns, to which Coaches and Waggons come; and if any Balkets, Bundles or Portmanteaus, are put into Hackney Coaches, or fent from thence by Porters, they immediately follow them, and take the nrft Opportunity of getting them into their Possession, either by fending the Porter on some Message, for a Bottle of Wine, &c. pretending to take Care of their Goods the while, or else by following them to the Door where they are going, and pretending to be the Servant of the House, or by some such Trick. At other Times they walk up and down in Inn-2 Yards,

xixtraEis from the renut Jutivis.

Yards, in the Dusk of the Evening, at a Distance from the Warehouse; and if any Porter or Apprentice brings a Parcel, and enquires for the Book-keeper, his Hat in a Minute is whipt into his Pocket, and a Pen in his Mouth; The Porter is fent into the Tap-house of some Mef-fage, and the Shaper escapes. Sometimes they go into a Publick-house, and desire them to fend a. Gallon of Beer to some Neighbour, whose Name they have enquired, and to bring Change for a Guinea, which is generally fent by the Maid or some little Boy. The Sharper takes Care to meet the Boy in the Way, receives the Change and -Beer, fends him back for a Pipe, and then makes off. These Sharpers likewise, Sometimes, take Portmanteaus from behind Stage-Coaches, when there are no outside Passengers, out of the Tails, of Waggons, or from behind Post-Chai-fes, or out of Shops in the Evenings, where Goods lie near the Window, or out of Shew-Glaffes, by breaking the Glasses. To prevent some of these Evils, the following Cautions would be Useful ■, first, for Book-keepers and Inn-keepers to keep their Yards clear from loitering Fellows, and to caution their Porters not to deliver Goods at the Outside of the Door of any House to which they are fent; To caution the Waggoners and Stage Coachmen to watch their Coaches and Waggons off the Stones j Shop-keepers (hould remove Goods from their Windows or Shew-Glasses, early in the Evening, and to fix a Bell at their Shop-Door at that Time: To direct their Porters, Apprentices, and Errand-Boys, when fent with Parcels, to be cautious ofafking their Way in the Streets, but at Houses or Shops; or of entering into any

Con?

Extracts from the Penal Laws.

Converfation with Strangers •, or to carry Mef-fages for them, always to deliver the Goods in the Infide of a Warehouse or Inn, or the Infide of a House whither they are fent to: Sometimes these Sharpers, when Families are out of Town, carry some old insignificant Books to the Servant, and tell them they are come for the lecond Sub-fcription; which, if they do not pay now’, their Mailer or Lady will never have their Books; by which they obtain of some a Guinea, and some less •, or else they find out the Servant’s Name and Country ; come and tell them there lies a Parcel at some Inn, directed for them till called for, demand the Money for Carriage, and then give them a Note to fetch the Goods •, or else they watch the Mailer out, and come as a Waiter from a Coffee House, to fetch their Maf-ter’s Great Coat, or else as a Taylor’s Apprentice or Journeyman, to fetch a Suit of Cloaths to alter. Some of these Sharpers make it their Business to deceive young Women, and obtain their Money and Cloaths under Pretence of marrying them; by which lad Stratagem many young Women have loll their Places, their little Money, and all their Apparel.

A new Species of Cheat has lately been pra«-tifced by a Gambler and his Gang, who, to my Knowledge, have practised every other with Impunity, and is what follows The Head of the Party calls himself a Coal-Merchant, in which Character he applies to some Tradesman. to buy Goods in his Way ; tells him he is out of Calh, but if he chufes, will pay him in Coals, of which he is rather overstocked. The Tradesman approving of this, the Gambler goes down to some Wharf, and orders one or more Chaldron of

Coals

ExtraBs from the Penal Laws.

Coals to be delivered at thatTradefman’s House for his Use. Thus far the Gambler who attacks the Understanding.

I shall now mention a Set of Cheats who make a Dupe of the Heart, and impose on the Benevolence and Companion of the C. haritable j these are called Shy-Farmers, and execute their Schemes in the following Manner ; one of them dreffes himself extremely genteel, and takes upon himself either the Character of a private Gentleman or reputable Tradesman. He is attended by-two Men in the Character of Country Farmers, with clumfey Boots, Horseman’s Coats, &c. The Objects pitched upon for Imposition, are good old charitable Ladies, to whom the Solicitor tells a dreadful Story of Lolfes by Fire, Inundation, &c. to the utter Ruin of these two poor Farmers and all their Families; their Wives are big with Child, their Children down in the Small-Pox, &?r. A Book is then produced by the Solicitor, who undertakes this disagreeable Office purely out of Good-Nature, knowing the Story to be true. In this Book are the Names of the Nobility and Gentry fet down by him-feif, who have contributed to this Charity ; and by setting out with false Names, they at length get real ones, which are of great Service to them in carrying on their Fraud; and well-disposed Persons are daily imposed upon by false Appearances of Distress. There are' Persons in this Town who get a very good Livelihood by writing Letters and Petitions of this Stamp, with which those Noblemen and Gentlemen, who are distinguished for their Generofity and Benevolence, are constantly tormented, and these Y*Trecthes often obtain Relief for their false Dif-

trefies,

trefles, whilst the really miserable suffer, from their Modefty, the acuteft Afflictions. A Woman fluffed up as if fhe was ready to lye in, with two or three borrowed Children, and a Letter giving an Account of her Hufoand’s falling off a Scaffold and breaking his Limbs, or being drowned at Sea, &c. is an irrefiftable Object.

Laftly, the following Cautions to Inns and Livery Scabies may not be useless; it is become a Trick for a Man to Hire a Horse at one Place, and at his Return to London to put him up at another as his own, and to borrow Money at that Place, and then give Notice to the Owner of the Horse where he is.

As Persons coming to London in a Stage-Coach from a Distance, are desirous of getting into a Hackney Coach as soon as they can, they flop at the first Stand, which is generally near some Inn ; here the Sharpers attend, and by their pretending to be Porters, or by other Stratagems, frequently rob the Passengers of their Box or Portmanteau-, who being eager to fee their Friends, throw aside their Caution, and trust too much to the Care of the Coachman. These fort of Sharpers also attend the unloading of Road Waggons, where Quantities of Goods are put into a Cart to be dispersed about Town; this Cart they follow till they have an Opportunity of taking something out of it, while the Carter or Porter is making some Enquiry; a Man riding in these Carts would prevent these Robberies. Fastening Portmanteaus behind Post-Chailes with Chains -inllead of Straps, w ill preserve them; and Stable-keepers not letting their Saddle-Horses to Strangers, unless they bring some

267

A PLAN for the further ■ Prevention of Frauds and Felonies committed on FradcJ~ men and Shopkeepers.

AS Shopkeepers are more subject to the In* roads of Cheats and Thieves than other Persons, from the Neceflity they are under of exposing their Goods in apublick Manner; and as the Expence and Loss of Time in Prosecutions, added to the Loss of their Goods, deters many from bringing i'uch Offenders to Justice, by which Lenity they are encouraged to continue their villainous Practices, to the Injury of Trade? it is apprehended that an Association of Trades-men and Shopkeepers, under the following Restri&ions, will, by rendering the Deteclioa and Punishment of the said Offenders more easy, be a great Security to Property, and deter evil-disposed People from fixing on Shopkeepers as the Objects of their Prey. Experience has proved the great Utility of the Subscription among the Merchants, for the preventing of Robberies on the Keys out of Ships, Lighters, &c. The Subscription among the Nobility and Gentry for the Preservation of the Game, has also proved that the united Endeavours of many, when formed into a Body, by lessening the Expence of each Individual, is more likely to suppress a publick Evil, than each Man afting for himself; it is therefore proposed, That as many Trades-

V. That the Solicitor shall be impowered to disburfe such Money for the purfuing or adver-tifing such Offenders before they are taken, as the Magistrate shall direct; and that no Bill of this Kind shall be paid the said Solicitor, unless signed by the Magistrate.

Vllf. The Chairmen of the said Committee shall take it by Turns according to their Seniority, as they (land on the Lift of Subscribers; and the Day before the Meeting of such Committee, the Solicitor shall lend Notice to the twelve Members, and acquaint them whose Turn it is to be in the Chair.

That a'Register of the Prosecutions carried on by the said Society, shall be kept by the Secretary, containing a short Abstract of every Cafe, subject to the Examination of every Member of the Society •, and that no Aft or Order shall be put in Execution without the Consent of the Majority of the Committee.

Ods. Notwithstanding the Promises of Fidelity which Thieves and other Offenders make to each other when formed into a Gang, daily Experience Jhews, that when one of the Gang is apprehended, he cone Jlantly facrifices the rest to fave himself-, and this too often happens to be the Ring-leader and greatest Op-fender, who by bullying and terrifying the rest, prevents them, however they may repent of their Practices, from impeaching him, till he has an Of-portunity, by this misplaced Confidence, of discover-ing his Companions to his own Advantage; and as the abovementioned Laws have humanely given such ample Encouragements to all Offenders to fur-render themselves, it must be for Want of Conftde-ration only, that they do not more frequently embrace this Indulgence; for there is a wide Difference between an Evidence for the Crown who surrenders himself, and one who is admitted an Evidence after he is taken. The former is intitled to bis Pardon by Law, the latter may be tried himself, even after he has convitied his Accomplices, if he has been guilty of Offences in more Counties than one. It is therefore Y earnestly

earncfily recommended to those •who are unhappy enough to be persuaded into Vice, and to be threatened into the Continuation of it, to liften to thefirft Re-morfes of their Conscience, and give the most unfeigned Earnejl of their Penitence, by separating from the Gang, and by privately surrendering themselves to feme Magistrate, where they will always find Protection and Countenance; for that Fidelity which Thieves promise to each other is as picked as it is weak.

the lowed of Attornies, who are ready on all Occasions to point out any Irregularity committed by a Peace Officer, and to made their Advantage of it, to the Injury, nay, often to the Ruin of the Officer, resolved to draw up and pubiiffi a plain and complete Account of the Office of Constable, which he begun; but by a lingering Illness, which put a Period to his valuable Life, he was prevented from perfecting this useful Work; and as several Constables have of late subjected themselves to Prosecutions from Errors in their Judgment, I have carefully collected and revifed the Observations found among my Brother’s Manuscripts on this Sub-jeft, and have made such Additions as may possibly render the Work more useful, though I am far from offering it to the Public as a perfect Treatise •, yet if it should be the Means in any Resped of rendering the Office of Constable more easy and intelligible, or of preventing either Trouble to, or the Prosecution of any Peace Officer, it will fully answer my Purpose -, for though I am fenlible there are already very useful Trails of this Sort, yet I think they cannot have too many Guides to direct them, provided they are fo perfect as not to miflead, as their Office is only for a Year, a Time much too short for them to be thoroughly acquainted with the Nature of their Duty. And here I must beg Leave to put those Gentlemen, who have the Honour to be chosen into this important Office, in Mind of the Dignity and consequence of their Station -, for if the several High Constables are adive, diligent and attentive in their Duty, carefully instruct, and live in Harmony with the 4 Petit

A ’Treat!fe on the Office of Constable. Petit Constables, Peace and good Order must ensue in this Metropolis. Constables are ielcdt-ed from the Inhabitants as able and reputable Men to execute this Trust, which is not rcpoled in them, without their being first bound by a solemn Oath well and truly to lerve the laid Office, which though troublesome, and often dangerous, is very honourable. In Westminster there are fourfcore Constables •, in the adjoining Parts of the County of Middlesex there are more-, these two Bodies united by Harmony, strengthened by a just fenl'e of their Duty, and well instrufled, encouraged and supporred by the Magistracy, become a formidable Body, (hews the Civil Power in its true and proper Light, and will ever be capable of suppressing Evils of the mod dangerous Nature. But nothing can conduce fo much to the preventing of Evils of every Kind arising to any considerable Height, as the Care and Attention of each individual Constable in his own Ward. Here he may ob-serve Mischiefs and Breaches of the Laws on their first Appearance, and by proper Notices, friendly Persuasions, necessary Informations before the Magistrate, or by Preferment before the Grand Inquest when he makes his Returns, which last ought most conlcientiously to be done without Favour or Affection, he may stop the Evil in its Infancy, and prevent the Repetition of it from confirming it into Habit, when it will be more difficult, if not impossible, to iup-press it •, for I (hould not do Justice, if I did not declare, that a great Number of Inhabitants, who have been summoned before me for buffering Gaming and other Breaches of the Laws, the Y 3 Moment

Moment they were acquainted with the Illegality and evil Tendency of such their Practices, immediately put a Stop to them without forcing the Magistrate to the disagreeable Necessity of executing a Penal Law. If a Constable has a due Regard for Religion, the Oath he takes to do his Duty will have a proper Influence on his Con-dust. If he considers the Respect that is due to the Laws of his Country, he will never connive at the Breach of any of them •, and if he exe-ecutes his Office with Diligence, Candour and Humanity, he will secure to himself the Confidence of the People, {Lengthen his own Authority, and be esteemed a valuable, useful and worthy Member of Society. To which I shall only beg Leave to add one Observation, that where Warrants are executed in this Metropolis, on Complaints of a trivial Nature, the Constable should always give his Prisoner Time to bring some of his Friends with him before the Magistrate, as this may prevent the Malice of Prosecutors; but where Cheats and Felons are apprehended, they should be immediately carried before a Justice of the Peace, as a Moment’s Delay may prevent Discoveries of the greatest consequence, and give Accomplices Time to fe-crete themselves and their stolen Goods.

A

TREATISE

ON THE OFFICE of Constable.

Th: Office of v H E Office of Constable, whether we Conibble. § agree with my Lord Coke in the Deri-JL vation of the Word, or with the less honourable Etymology of Dr. Cowell, is certainly of great Antiquity in this Kingdom.

Anciently there was a very high Officer of State, under the Denomination of the Lord Constable* and several other Officers there are at this Day who are fo called; as the Constable of the fewer, &c. but with such we concern not ourselves in this Treatise, in which we intend only to speak of those Officers, who are at present known by the Name of High and Petit Con-stables.

Its Origin. Both these Officers were at common Law in the Time of the Saxons. The best Account of their priginal is given by Ftneux, in the Book of 12 If. 7. who makes them as old as the Division of Counties into Hundreds, and again of these Hundreds into Boroughs or Towns* over the

latter

latter of which were placed the Petit Constables, as the High Constabks were over the former. (a)

As well the Petit as the High Constable, were, by their Offices, Conservators of the Peace at the Common Law, within the Limits of their Hundreds, Towns, Tythings and Boroughs; (b) and their Authority is as antientas the Turns or Courts Leet •, and did not, as some have fup-posed, begin in the Times of Ediv. 3. (c) nor even by the Statute of Winchester made in the 13th Year of Edw. t. * And what that Statute ordains concerning Con (fables, is to be understood in Affirmance of the Common Law

(4

This Statute of Winchester appoints two Con-(tables to be chosen in every Hundred or Fran-chife; but gives no farther Direction.

Mr. Dalton thinks that these were the High Constables of Hundreds; but this seems to combat with the Opinion of Fineux before-mentioned, which Dalton himself a little afterwards cites and approves.

* This is inexcufeable Ignorance; for Constables are mentioned before this Time in Wtjlm. 1. c. 1$. in which Statute he is placed between the Under Sheriff and the Bailiffs of Fee. So that there were then, faith Lord Coke in his Notes on that Statute (2 Inft. 190) Constables in Fee who had the keeping ofPrifons. Though, perhaps, the Words of Fa ought only to be coupled to the Word Bailiffs; and means no more than the Bailiffs ef Franchises; and this agrees belt with the Context in the laid Statute.

The

How chosen.

A Treatise on the Office of Constable.

The Constables of Hundreds, or the High Constables, were at first chosen and sworn as appears in the Sheriff's Torn (a) ; but in the Time of Mr. Dalton, they were usually chosen at the Sessions, or by the Majority of the Justices of the Division, and were either sworn at the Sessions or by Warrant from the Sessions. A Clause, he fays, which was often allowed and commended by the Judges of Assize {b).

And in the same manner as they are chosen, they are upon fit cause to be removed from their Office (c).

The High Constables, by their original In-ftitutions, were to take View of Armour twice every Year, and to present before the Justices the Defaults of Armour, of Watches, of Highways, and of Hue and Cries, and also such as lodged Strangers, for whom they could not an-fwer (d).

Constables of Hundreds are compellable to attend at the Assizes, and present Offenders upon Oath, but not fo at the Quarter-Sessions

W-

By the Common Law, fays the Lord Coke, the Constables are to be chosen at the Leet or Torn (f). In some Books, it is laid, that the Constables are to be chosen by the Sheriff; and in others by the Decennary; but it is agreed, that he mull then be sworn into his Office by'the Sheriff: But where there is a Court-Leet, this Power of chusing Constables seems to belong to

the Lord of that Leet; and such, fays Mr. Hawkins, must be understood to have been the Sense of the Makers of that Statute in 13 &? 14 Car. 2. (a)

Writers agree in giving to Justices of Peace a Power to appoint a Constable in Default of the Lord at his Leet, or of the Sheriff at his Torn, before the Statute of 13 6? 14 Car. 2. And this Power seems to have the Sanction of Time, though it may be, perhaps, difficult to shew from what legal Authority it was at first derived.

And not only when the Leet have failed to appoint a Constable, but where unable or untit Per-fons have been chosen, the Justices of Peace have interfered and have removed them. (I) So if a Constable die or remove out of the Parish, and the Time of the Leet be far off, his Place is to be supplied by the Sessions; and if they be not near, by the next Justices.

This Jurisdiction the Justices exercised at Common Law, but now the Statute (reciting that whereas the Laws and Statutes for the apprehending of Rogues and Vagabonds have not been duly executed, sometimes for Want of Officers, by Reason Lords of Manors do not keep Court-Leets every Year for the making them) enacts, That in Cafe any Constable, Head-borough or Tythingman, shall die or go out of the Parish, any two J ustices of the Peace may make and swear a new Constable, Headborough or Tythingman, till the said Lord shall hold a Court, or till the next Quarter-Sessions, who

shall

A Treatise on the Office of Constable.

^iall approve of the said Officers fo made and {worn as aforesaid, or appoint others as they shall think fit. And if any Officer shall continue above a Year in his or their Office, that then in such cafe the Justices of the Peace in their Quarter-Sessions may discharge such Officers, and may put another fit Per-fon in his or their Place, rill the Lord of the said Manor (hall hold a Court as aforesaid.

And if in Default of holding Courts-Leer, they continue above a Year, they may be dif-charged at the Sessions, and others put in (a).

If Leets choose unable or unfit Petit Confta-bles, it is a good cause of the Forfeiture of the Leet. And upon a Complaint to the Assizes or Sessions, the Justices of the Peace shall be authorized to choose new ones.

Since the Statute, therefore it is clear that two Justices of Peace may, in Default of the Lord of the Leet, make and swear a new Constable, &fr. But this is a special Authority, and must be ftri&ly purfued; and therefore an Order of Sessions, reciting a Complaint made by the Petit Constables of A. that they had served above a Year, and that at a Leet holden for the Manor of B. these Constables with the Homage present-ed D. E. F. G. four able Persons of the Town of A. in Order that two might be nominated, {ic. and that the Steward refused to nominate them, &c. but continued the Complainants in their said Offices; and upon Examination of the said Complainants upon Oath, the

Selfions discharged them, and appointed D. and E. Petit Constables of the said Town for the Year ensuing, or till others are legally appointed. This Order was quashed by the whole Court, because the Sessions have not purified the Restriction of the Statute by appointing the said Constables till the Lord shall hold a Court (a).

By the Statute of Hen. 8. (b) two Justices of the Peace (one Quorum) shall appoint and name in every Hundred within the Limits of their Commission, two sufficient Gentlemen or Yeo. men to be Chief Constables of the Hundred wherein they inhabit, which Chief Constables are to have the fame Power with High Constables of Hundreds in England.

A Custom in a Town that the Inhabitants shall serve the Office of a Con liable by Turns, according to the Situation of their several Hou-fes, hath been allowed to be Good of later Times,

(c) though there are ancient Authorities to the contrary (d).

No Man is qualified to be a Constable who is Who not an Inhabitant of the Place for which he is tochofe"' serve that Office (e).

Nor is every Inhabitant a fit Person to be chosen into this Office. He ought, faith Mr.

Dalton, to be of the abler Sort of Parishioners; and if a very ignorant or poor Person be chosen, he may, by Law, be discharged, and an abler Person placed in his Room (f).

Refilling to be sworn.

A 'Treatise on the Office of Confable.

Persons qualified to be Constables, are not ab-folutely excused from taking upon themselves that Office, by being of the Rank of Gentlemen (tho’ of Quality faith Dalton); nor will the Pro-session of a Physician excuse them; yet, if there be other Efficient Persons within the District, they will possibly have Relief in the King's Bench : But a sworn Attorney of any Court in V/eftmin-fier Hall may be discharged by a Writ of Privilege, even though he were chosen by Reason of his Estate according to the Custom, &c. for he is obliged to give his Attendance on his Court. And for like Reason it hath been adjudged, that an Alderman of London cannot be chosen Constable; for that as Alderman, he is bound to be present in the City for the good Government thereof (a).

By two Statutes made in the Reign of Hen. 8. the Wardens and Fellowlhip of the Mystery of Surgeons, are exempt from the Offices of Constables, Watch, &c. provided they do not exceed the Number of twelve, and the Prefi-dent and Fellows of the College of Physicians are not to be chosen Constables, nor any other Officers in London, nor in the Suburbs of the fame {b).

It hath been held, that all the Surgeons in England are within the Equity of the former Statute; but that the Privilege arxCng from the latter is confined to those Physicians who are Fellows of the College.

If a Person duly elected refuses to be sworn, he may be indicted either before Justices of the

Peace at their Seffioris, or before Justices of Oyer and Terminer (a); or if he be present, he may be fined by the Court before whom he is to be iworn; or upon a Presentment of his Refusal, with all proper Circumstances, the Court may amerce him. But the Indiftment is the more usual Way •, and in such Indidtment it is necessary ro fet out specially the Manner of the Election, Appointment, Notice and Refu-fal (b).

If a Constable lawfully chosen, refuses to be sworn, one Justice may bind him over to the Sessions; but he cannot commit him till he will take on him the Office U).

Where any Person is duly appointed to the Office of Constable, and the Steward, &c. refuses to swear him; or where one, having a Right to be privileged from serving this Office, is elected, he may, in either Cafe, be relieved, by applying to the Court of King's Bench.

It hath been resolved, That a Constable may make a Deputy, because, as Mr. Crompton fays, he may be sick •, but the better Reason is, be-cause it is a Ministerial Office. And yet, faith Dalton, some have held that this is rather by Toleration than by Law (,i).

Having premiled thus much concerning the Antiquity of this Office, the Persons who are properly qualified for, and not privileged by Law from it, with the Manner of appointing Constables, and those who are by Law authorized to appoint them; I come next to the

2. If a grievous Wound, from which there is apparent Danger of Death, be given in his Presence, he is to arred the Offender (b). And in either of these Cafes he may break open Doors, if denied Entrance, and if the guilty Person be there (c). Again in theie Cafes he may judify killing the Offender, if he flies or refids, io that he cannot otherwise be apprehended ; but this he ought never to do when the Offenders may be otherwise taken (d).

3. He may arred any one whom he shall see going about to commit a Treason or Felony, or any other Aft which would manifedly endanger the Life of another (e). And therefore, if a Man leave an Infant in the Cold,

In all these Cafes the Constable may aft with the utmost Security ; and, indeed, every private Person not only may, but ought to do the fame, though he is less questionable for the Neglect; for the Constable being present at an Affray, ought in the King’s Name to command the Affrayers to ccafe and deparc on Pain of Imprisonment; and if he doth otherwise he shall be severely fined (e>.

6. He may likewise, virtute officii, arrest on Suspicion of Treason or Felony. And therefore if Job'/i Jones be robbed, and suspects Edward James of having committed the Robbery, the Constable on the Information of John Jones, may apprehend the Body of Edward James without any Warrant (d).

1. That a Felony was actually done •, for this is issuable in an Action of faife Imprisonmentj &c. (a).

2. That the Person from whom he receives his Information was actually present at the Felony committed 5 for the Jollification is, that, the Constable did aid A. in taking the Party suspect-ed (b). And an Information at the second Fland is too remote and dangerous.

3. The Constable ought to be well satisfied that the cause of Suspicion is a good one. And such Circumstances and causes of Suspicion may Appear on Examination, (though this cannot be on Oath) that the Information, fays Lord Hale, may carry over the Suspicion even to the Constable, whereby it may become his Suspicion as well as the Suspicion of A (c).

And it behoves the Constable to a£t with great Discredon in this Matter •, for as on the one Hand if the cause of Suspicion was light and trivial; if the Party informing was not himself present; but principally if the Felony was not actually committed, the Constable will be in Danger of answering in an Action : So on the other Hand if he should be remifs and negligent in his Duty, or retufe to arrest a Felon, where the above Circumstances all concur, he will be liable to be very severely punished for his Omission; for,

And if a Person thus charged with Suspicion of Felony upon just Grounds of Suspicion, and where a Felony is actually commited, tho’ he he innocent, yet if he refill the Officer, after Notice that he is the Officer, and assault him, if the Officer kill him, this is no Murder (a).

But more questionable is it, fays Lord Hale, whether if he fly and cannot be apprehended, the Officer may kill him, where he is suspected and innocent, if he cannot otherwise be taken, as he may a Felon, as before is lliewn ; but ic seems flays he) that he may, and that it is no Felony, no mere than in the former Cafe, for these Reafjns:

1. Because the Constable is obliged to do his Office in Case of a probable Suspicion, as well as in case of an aftuai Felony.

2. Eecause he cannot Judge whether the Party be guilty or not till he come to his Trial, which cannot be till he is apprehended.

3. Because the Patty draws upon himself this Inconvenience, and makes himself Impeded by Ins very Flight from the Officer {b).

4. Though the Constable was not present at the Affray, yet if a dangerous Wnilnd be given, die Constable, upon receiving Information thereof, may arrest the OFender ; and if he flies into a House and !i ms the Boors, and will not open them, the Ccr.ftab'e may break them open to take him (r).

But in case of an Affray where no dangerous Affray. Wound is given, if the Constable be not him-

felf p'efent, I hold it too dangerous for him to arrest the Fatty on an Information after the Affray is over, even though the Informer should alledge thac he is in Danger of his Life -, for in such case, though feme Refoludons seem to favour it, yet there are many on the other Side (b).

5. If an Affray be in a House whereby there Affray in a is a Likelihood of Bloodshed, and the Doors of the House are Unit, if the Constable of the Vill having Notice thereof demand Entrance, and they within, not only refuse to open the Doors, but continue the a ft ray, the Constable may break open the Doors to keep the Peace and prevent the Danger (c). And this will be justifiable, though no Hurt was actually done '(d).

And if the Affray be begun without Doors, and the Affrayers fly into another Man’s House, the Constable on fresh Pursuit may break open the Eloufe and apprehend them (e). But this I apprehend must be understood only of violent Affrays, and where some great Hurt hath been done.

This was held a good Jollification by all the Justices; for they laid, it is lawful for every Constable to arrest suspeded Persons who walk by Night and Deep by Day, or who keep fuf-picious Company. And if they cannot of them-selves arrest: them, they may demand the Assist-ance of others, and they are by Law obliged to alii ft them (a).

If the Time and Nature of the Fad, and the Condition of Things will bear it, to complain to a Justice of the Peace and have his Warrant for apprehending the Criminal, will be very wifely followed by the Constable as often as he possibly can; for by such Means he will be put to much lei's Difficulty in his Justifica-tion.

But it mull: be likewise observed. That in all the Cafes before recited, and especially with regard to the apprehending of Felons, he is obliged to perform his Duty without any Warrant, and will be punishable for Neglect of it.

A iecond Manner in which Persons are to be arrested by the Constable, is by Hue and H ean(jCry Cry ■, which, as the Words import, is a pub-lick Alarm raised after the Felon over the whole County, and sometimes, faith the Statute of Winchester, over two, three or four Counties, when the Felony is committed near the Borders.

This Process lay at Common Law, and is mentioned by BraRon, &c. [a). It is enforced likeaife by many Statutes:

1. By U'inton, c. 9. All are to be ready at the Summons of the Sheriff, and the Cry of the County, to arrest Felons as well within Fran-rhifes as without, on the Pain of being indicted and fued.

2. By 4 E. 1. Hue and Cry is to be levied for all Murders, Burglaries, Men flain, or in Peril of being flain, and all are to follow it.

3. By the Statute of Winlon, c. 1. on Robberies and Felonies, fresh Suit shall be made from Town to Town, and from County to County ; and by c. 4. Hue and Cry is ordered to be raised on such as will not obey the Arrefl: of the Town where Night-walkers pass-, and for arresting such Strangers; none shall be pu-nished.

Laftly, by 8 G. 2. c. 16. If any Constable, Headborough, £s?r. within the Hundreds, wherein any Robbery shall happen, shall refuse or negedt to make Hue and Cry after the Felons with the utmost Expedition, as soon as he shall receive Notice thereof, he shall, for

And though the Warrant itself hath been against Law, yet the Officer hath been allowed to justify under it {a).

Mr. Lombard, fpealcing of the Power of a Justice of Peace, faith, if he make any Warrant, though it be beyond his Authority, yet it is not disputable by a Constable or other inferior Minister, but must be obeyed. Lamb. 67. and 94.

And Britdenell, in the Book of Hen. 8.

(14 H. 8. 16. a.) tho’ he denied the Authority of the Justice to make the Warrant, admits that the Officer who executed it, could not be punished; for every Justice of Peace, fays he, is a Judge of Record, and he hath a Seal of his Office; and when he makes a Warrant under his Seal to the Officer, now the Officer ought to give Credit to the Seal; for this is his Authority, and being but an Officer, he can no more dif-pute the Authority of the Judge than the Sheriff can ours.

If a Warrant be directed by a Justice of Peace Constable «-to the Constable of D. to arrest a Felon, &c. renting War-he is not bound to go out of the Vill to execute ™tsv°Jjt the Warrant; but yet if he do execute it in another Vill, it is good enough : for he afts herein not Amply as Constable of D. but by virtue of the Justice’s Warrant; and fo it was ruled in my Time (fays Lord Hale) at the Af-sizes at Norfolk, about 1668.

If a Felon, after he is arrested, escape into another County, the Constable may pursue and take him by virtue of his Warrant •, but if he escape before the Arrest, the Constable ought to pursue him into the other County by Hue and Cry. But if the Warrant be only for a Mifde-meanor, and the Offender escape out of the County before he is arrested, the Constable cannot pursue him ; yet even in this Cafe, if he escape after the Arrest, he may be purftjed and re-taken on fresh Suit (a).

The Constable mult execute the Warrant himself, and cannot make a Deputy as a Sheriff may ; but he may charge others to his Assist-ance (b).

A Constable being a known Officer in the Till, need not (hew his Warrant, tho’ it be demanded ; but it is reasonable for him to acquaint the Party for what cause he arrests him—As, I arrest you for Felony, lyc. {c).

or upon Suspicion of Felony, if the Felon be in his own House (a).

So, and a fortiori, if he be in the House of another (for here the Sheriff may do it on a civil Process)-, but this is at his Peril that the Felon be there; for otherwise he will be guilty of a Trespass (b).

Upon a Warrant to search for flolen Goods, Search the Constable likewise may break open the Warrant. Doors, if they be shut, and upon Demand made, those within refuse to- open them (c) yet note, my Lord Hale here seems doubtful if the Goods were not there. In which he only fays, it seems the Officer is excused •, and in another Place he expressy fays, on fucii Warrant I think the Doors cannot be broke open (d).

Upon a Warrant of the Peace, the Constable Peace may break open the Doors (e)but this mutt be Warrant-understood where Security of the Peace is required, and not in case of an Assault or any common Breach of the Peace.

fo that the Officer must give over his Pursuit and cannot otherwise take him (a). And this, as hath been seen before, he might have done, in case of an Arrest virtute officii, or by Hue and Cry.

The fame Law is it if in Truth he were no Felon, bur yet a Warrant is against him on Suspicion of Felony, and he, having Notice thereof, flies and refills; for the Officer or Minilter mull pursue his Warrant, or other, wife he is punishable •, and the Party by his Flight or Refiftance is accessary to bis own Death (b).

But in this cafe the Officer must be extremely cautious, and in his Justification it ought to appear.

That he was a lawful Officer •, for though a private Person may arrest a Felon, and if he flies, fo that he cannot otherwise be taken, the killing will be excufable •, yet this is at his Peril, viz. that the Party be really a Felon; for if he be innocent of the Felony, the killing, at least before the Arrest, seems at least Manslaughter, for the Reason above given, for an innocent Person is not bound to take Notice of a private Person’s Suspicion (c).

4. The Warrant ought to express some Crime; but if it do not, yet, if the true cause were Felony or any Misdemeador within the Cognizance of the Justice, it may, fays Lord Hale, excuse the Officer, in false Imprisonment (6). Hence it follows, that if, in such cafe, the cause were really not within the Cognizance of the Justice, the Arrest would be illegal, and the Officer liable to an Action of false Imprisonment.

A Warrant obtained after the Arrest will not justify the preceding Arrest by Authority of that Warrant.

Wherever the Constable hath a PoweT to ar rest, either ex officio, or by Warrant, he may charge as many as he shall think necessary to his Assistance (c).

But till the Constable can conveniently carry the Prisoner before a Justice, he may in all Cafes justify detaining him in some fafe Place, as in the Stocks; or if there be no Stocks in his Vill, he may carry him to the Stocks in the Vill adjacent; or he may detain him in any other Place of Custody, as his or their Quality requireth, fays Mr. Dalton, c. i. f. 7.

The Constable may carry his Prisoner before ^Pcc‘a* what Justice of the Peace he pleases (for this Wafrant" is at his Ele&ion, and not at the Prisoner’sJ; but in common Cafes it is most adviseable to go to the nearest Justice, as it gives the Prisoner an Opportunity of fending for his Friends, unless the Warrant be special, and may be to bring him before that Justice only who granted it.

Dalt. c. 28. / 4.

This is iiowever, rarely done; and the usual Way, especially in Middlesex and Westminster, is to detain the Prisoner, if he be arrested by Night, in the Watch-House; or if by Day, either in some publick House, or in the Con-stable’s own House, till the Witnesses are ready to go together before the Justice. And this seems well enough, and, indeed, a much more eligible Method than to fet the Prisoner in the Stocks, which would be exposing him to Shame and Punishment before it can be known whether he is gudty or not.

But by the Statute of 22 E? 23 Car. 2. c. 20. it is enabted, That if any Under-Sheriff, Bailiff',

If a Constable, having arrested a Prisoner by Authority of a Statute, doth not lawfully discharge himself of him, but suffers him to escape, it seems, by the Book of ioEdw. 4. («),

If a Constable, having received a Warrant from a Justice of the Peace, to apprehend the putative Father of a Ballard Child, if he suffers him to escape, may be bound to the good Behaviour, and fo over to the next Gaol Delivery or Quarter-Selfions, and may be there ordered to contribute towards the Maintenance of the Ballard, or be fined. The like in Case of the.

The Prisoner being committed to Gaol, the Peace Officer, in whose Custody he is, ought to carry him thither directly.

Constables are the proper Officers to a Justice of Peace, as Sheriffs are to the higher Courts of Justice; and they, as well as Headboroughs, Tythingmen and other Officers of the Peace, are obliged to execute the Warrants either generally or specially directed to them by the Justices of the Peace: And when the Warrant is lawfully granted for a Matter within the Ju-rifdidtion of the Justice, they may always safely execute it in a legal Maimer.

But to conclude: An attentive Regard to the following general Observations on the Duty of a Constable, it is apprehended, will be of

Use:

First then, let them be industrious to acquaint themi'cives with the Powers given them as Peace Officers by the Common Law, the Statutes, and by the Warrants of Magistrates, Let them exert this Authority with Caution, Integrity and Moderation; conGdering well before they deprive any Subject of his Liberty. When they have taken any Person in Custody, let Safety, Humanity, and an expeditious Conveyance before the Magistrate, be their chief Confi-deration; for voluntary Escapes are Impeachments of a Constable’s Integrity, and lay him under the odious Suspicion of Corruption. Harlhness and Severity to Prison call the Officer’s Humanity in Question. Delay in going before a Magistrate, and entering into the Merits of the Complaint, is often the Occasion of Oppression, and sometimes makes the Officer liable to become the Instrument of the Prolocutor's Malice ; for, as lie cannot administer an Oath, he is liable to be imposed on; and a Constable is to remember that he is to apprehend

Offenders,

4-

A Treat ife on the Office of Co fable* 367

Offenders, and not to determine Offences that being the Office of the Magistrate only ; before whom every Prisoner taken into Custody for any Offence should be carried, in the Officer’s Justi-fication, who cannot otherwise discharge hirn

' O

with Safety. Support your Office with Spirit, but never ufe any indecent Language, or any ways insult your Prisoner, and never strike but on the utmost Necessity ; for whenever you meet with Difficulty or Refiftance in the Execution of your Office, charge the Standers-by in the King’s Name to aid and affifl you, and, if poffi-ble, those whose Names you know; for on their Refusal they are liable to be indicted.

Thus you may multiply your own Power, as often as you may find necessary, and Occasion requires.

OBSERVATIONS on feme fapposed Evils not fujjicuntly provided for by Law.

j. O I NI N G Portugal Money is only v_y misprision of Treason; and Punishment, Portugal Fine and Imprisontnent; and Diminishing Per- Money. tugal Coin is scarce any Offence, none by Statute, and indiftable only as a Misdemeanor or

Fraud when uttered ----Obs. As this Coin is

become fo frequent in this Kingdom, the ccunt erf citing or diminishing it, as to the injury of the Public is almofi as great as coining or diminishing Guineas.

2. It is apprehended, that at present, no Per- Witnesses fon can be called out of Scotland to give Evi- from Scotland dence, in a criminal Cale, in any of our Courts "ot 10 of Justice, by Virtue of a Writ of Subpoena, or EnSd d C° by Warrant from a Secretary of State, unless it ° be to give Evidence in Affairs of State; a great Inconvenience this, and may make Scotland a lafe Market for Thieves, and will enable them to fell what they Ileal with Impunity there, as the Buyer may refuse to give Evidence in England.

William Page, the Highwayman committed a Robbery in Middlesex in the Year 1757, and fold a Brace of Piftois he took in that Robbery, at Edinburgh : the Receiver of these Piftois could not be obliged by Subpoena, or otherwise, to attend his Trial in Miudlesex, though Lord Hol-derness then Secretary of State used all possible

APPENDIX.

Mean? for that Purpose. Page was therefore acquitted.

3. Bigamy, by the Laws now in Being, is Felony with Clergy.—Obs. It is a common Obfer-valion, that the Punishments in England are very unequal to the Offences. How far this may be true in general, I will not pretend to fay; but I am very fare it is egregioujly fo in this Instance: For I have ?ic! an Idea of a much higher Offence, either in its Nature or Ccrfequences, than that of a Man’s marrying several virtuous Women at the fame I'ime, spending their Fortunes, exposing than to Shame, and dejircying the Peace of fo many Fomilies. V/iihin tkefe few 1 'cars this Critne has been carried to a g-reat Excefs; for I 'myftlf know a Person who remains anpunished, though he has, at leaf, married and plundered a dozen Women. Query, Should not Clergy be taken from this Offence, or feme more infamous Punishment than the present be provided for fetch Offenders ?

4. In moll of our Penal Laws a Part of the Penalty is given to the Informer; this has made the Character of an Informer not only odious but dangerous, and leldom or ever produces any but the molt difreputa'ole Witnesses, and has proved a material Ob ft rut; ion to the Execution of many wholesome Penal Laws; whereas if all Rewards were taken from Informers, other more laudable Motives than that of Gain would take place, and more reputable Witnesses would appear: for I know from Experience, that for one Information laid before me for the Sake of the Reward, I have received ten from Public Spirit; for, at present, the most reputable Witnesses, sharing the Fate of common Informers, are deterred from doing their Duty to the Public •, but the Expence

pence of such Prosecutions being allowed out of the Penalty would remove the Evil, and render the Execution of these Laws more eal’y.

5. On the ift of January 1761, a Man was Cutting decoded in maliciously cutting the Cloaks and Cloathr. Gowns of several Women in the Gallery at Covent Garden Play-House, and brought before me;

but by 6 Geo. 1. c. 27. the Punishmcntfor cutting of Apparel is confined to the Streets and Highways only.—Obs. If tbs Words, or elsewhere, were to be added to this Clause, it would put 0, total Slop to this contemptible Diverfisn of Bucks, as well as to a malicious Practice used by fame Footmen, who frequently cut and spoil their Liveries, whets their Majlers refuse to give ’em them.

6. Wine Licences are at present granted by Wine the Commissioners of the Stamp-Office, indif- Licences, criminately to all that apply for them, and without any Restri&ion whatever by the 30 Geo. 2.

c. 15. This puts it in the Power of the mod: disorderly Persons to keep a Species of Tavern or Publick House, in Defiance of the Ma-gistrate, and is the chief Support ("Robbery excepted) of the low and infamous Bawdy Houses.

Query. Should not Persons taking out Wine Licences, either be obliged to produce proper Certificates of their sober Life and Convention, from the Magistrate in or near the Parish where they relide, or else to produce'a Justice of Peace’s Licence, as is done in the Cafe of selling Spirituous Liquors ?

For by 16 Geo. 2. c. 8. it is enatted, That no Licence for retailing Spirituous Liquors (hall be granted to any Person or Persons cvhatfoever, except to such Persons only who (hall keep

4i4 APPENDIX.

Taverns, Victualling-houses, Inns, CofFee-houses, or Ale-houses.

Public hoafea 7. The coo great Number of Publick Houses their Number, in and near London is one of the great causes of the Gaming and other Disorders in them; for there not being fair Custom enough tor them

D O

all, some of them suffer Gaming and other Irregularities, to decoy Customers to their Houses; If this be an Evil, the Removal of it is absolutely in the Power of the Magistracy; and it is very well known that many Persons obtain Licences to keep Publick Houses merely with an Intention of selling Spirituous Liquors, of which they vend treble the Quantity they do of Beer, which is absolutely establishing Gin-Shops.

Parish 4p- 8. Poor Children bound out by Parishes,

prentices and are too often put at a great Distance from the infants. Parish to which they did belong, where, perhaps, they might have some Friends or Relations, and generally to the lowed: Trades; the chief View of the Overseer being to get rid of the

O O

Object, and to fix his Settlement in another Place. If when these Children are put

our, a little more was to be spent in cloathing them, and something more given with them, by which they would be received in more reputable Families, would it not in some Measure remove the Evil ? Perhaps it would be better to apprentice these Children in their own Parish, as often as may be, and always to Housekeepers, as Lodgers often take Apprentices for the Sake of the Money, and not till they are 14 Years of Age, as they would then be under the Eye of

.the Overseer, the Father-in-law of the Poor.* g. The very scanty Price given by Parish Officers for the Maintenance of Nurse-Children, efpeciall.y from the Month to the Age of two Years, occasions the Loss of an amazing Number of his Majesty’s Subjects yearly; for the Party who takes the Child does it from the Motive of Interest, not of Alfe&ion, and to get any Thing by it from the present Price, Neglect of, and starving the Infant must be the consequence; for Infants are less capable of bearing Hard (hips than any other Animal; and it is observable that Parish Children generally die within the Year. Query, Would not the fixing a certain Price for such Nurse-Children weekly, to the Age of two or three Years, by Law', remove this Evil, and five many Lives ? and Half a Crown a Week instead of Eighteenpcnce, would, in all ..Probability, answer the Purpose ; and what is a Shilling a Week, when to be paid by a whole

Parish ?--N.B. Parish Children are to be

Bound out by the Content of two Justices, and it often happens that rhefe Indentures are lent by the Beadle to two different Magistrates to get them signed, without producing before them either Matter, Mistress, Apprentice or Parish Officer-, by which Means poor Children are frequently put out to improper Persons, and surely it was intended by the Legislature that all the Parties should appear before the Justices, when they sign the Indentures.

Jews for buying Cloaths, kept at different Parts of the Town, makes, the Disposal of stolen Goods easy. Query, Should not a certain Place be appointed as a Market^ or Shopkeepers li-censed for this Purpose ?

Barkers are Persons usually employed by Salesmen in Monmouth-Street, and Rosemary-Lane, who walk before the Doors of the Shops, and by Artince, and often by Force, oblige the unwary to enter into their Shops, which occasions much ImpoGtion, and hurts the fair Trader.

n. The Difficulty of prosecuting those Robbers who steal Portmanteaus, Trunks, Boxes, fsV. from behind Post-Chaifes, Coaches, out of Waggons, Carts, (Sc. and the Lenity of their Punishment, being only Transportation, encourages and encreases this Gang. Query, If Healing to the Value of 401. in this Manner was made capital, would it not flop the Practice ? The Healing to the Value of 40 a. out of any Lighter, or from any Key, being made a capital Offence, has been found of great Use. A Principal of the Gang of Portmanteau Stealers being admitted as an Evidence, was asked by the Magistrate, what would be the belt Method to cure this Evil ? he replied, that nothing 'would do it erfeftually, but making the Offence capital.

12. Many Disputes arise between Publicans and Soldiers in the Foot Guards in Wejlmmjler, on Account of small Beer, Fire, (Sc. for as these Words are not particularly expressed in that Part of the Ail of Parliament that relates to the Quartering of the Guards, some Justices have con-ilrued this Part of the Aft in Favour of the Landlord, and others in Favour of the Soldiers ;

diers ; and the want of Uniformity in the Opinion of Magistrates on this Part of the Adt railes great Diffatisfadiion: But it has been lately unani-mously agreed by the Magistrates of Westmin-fter, to enforce the Law in this particular, it being clearly within the Adt of Parliament -, but it would be better if the Words were more explicit.

13. The Difficulty of convidiing Pawnbrokers of taking in Soldiers Linen and Shoes, arises from the Want of a (landing Mark to be fixed on the said Linen and Shoes.

14. Pawnbrokers not being obliged to give Duplicates for all the Goods they receive, is a great inconvenience to the Subject, as it puts it in the Power of a Pawnbroker to deny receiving such Goods-, and Pawnbrokers not being obliged to shut up their Shops at eight o’Clock in the Winter and nine in the Summer, within the Bills of Mortality, gives Thieves an Opportunity to pawn Goods immediately after they have committed Robberies, and before they can have any Warnings by Papers or otherwise.

15. The Accident of firing Chimneys, as they . are very frequent, occasions great Expence to Parifties relative to bringing of Engines, and as those Fires arise from the Neglect of House-keepers, Query, Would it not be right to oblige such Inhabitants on these Occasions to pay the Rewards prescribed by Law to the different■ Engines ?

16. There is at present no way to remove bad Removing Lodgers but that expensive one of Ejectment; Codgers, the Miferies brought on many reputable Families by the artificial Methods of getting Pofief-

fion of Lodgings both Furniflied and Unfur-nished, are very great within the Bills of Mor-E e 2 tality.

taiity. Query, Would it not be useful to enable the Landlords to double the Rent, when Personsfiay after they have received due Notice to go out, viz. weekly Lodgers a Week’s Notice, monthly Lodgers a AlonlPs Notice, and yearly Lodgers a Quarter's Notice ?

17. There is a great Difficulty in the present Houses. Method of suppreiTwg Bawdy Houses by Indictment. Query, Would it not be a more effectual Method of reducing this Evil within -proper and political Bounds, by enabling two Jttjlices of the Peace to bear this Matter in a fmnmary IPay, to convict the Offender in a Penalty of five Pounds and Impri-fonment for a Month, allowing appeal to the Quar-ter-Sefftons.

The unfortunate Women commonly called Street Walkers, is an Evil of the molt dreadful Nature, as it daily conveys Distress and Diftem-per to the Families of the Industrious, and for-row to the Brealts of Parents; for these Women by taking their Hands in the Streets in the Night, are indefatigable to miflead the young, unwary or drunken Pafienger to some common BrotheJ; the number of these Women is amazing, their mcrease beyond the Necessity of them prodigious; urged by Necefity and accustomed to Extravagance, they frequently add Robbery to Whoredom ; a Remedy for this Evil is very Difficult, but were there a Poffibility of puniffiing the very common Brothels in a summary Way, it would be the Means of suppressing in lopie Degree, theMif-chief of Street Walkers, at least by keeping them within Doors, and if a Power was given to the Magistrate tocommit them in Executionfor any Time not exceeding a Month, or to the Quarter-Sefiion, to hard Labour, it would facilitate the Work; in-1 deed

deed I was in hopes that these poor Wretches would have found a Passage to America through the Magdalen, where they might be made uie-ful Servants, and being cut off from their- Connexions, become reputable Members of Society; their Cafe at prefenc is pitiable to the last Degree.

18. The Justices of the Peace for the City Licences to and Liberty of Westminster, have for several Years Publicans in licensed the Public Houses in the Parishes where Westminster. they reside, and not otherwise, but lately when

the Justices of one Parish have refused Licences to Publicans for very substantia] Reasons, Ma-gistrates from other Parishes have licensed those Houses; by which Means the Restraints laid by the Legiftature on the Conduct of Publicans is totally removed. Query, Should not this Prablice be prevented by confining the Magistrate’s Jurisdiction in this Behalf to the Parish where he rejfides, making all other Licences void■ and of no Effebi?

19. Livery Servants are very apt on sudden Livery Disputes to go away and take their Cloaths with Servants, them, for which Offence they are scarce liable to Punishment, being only subject to an Action.

Query, Should not■ this be made a Misdemeanor ?

and punishable by Imprisonment.

20. Porters at Inns have long imposed on the Powers at Public, by the exorbitant Demands for ParcelsInns-brought from those Inns where Stage Coaches

and Waggons put up in this Metropolis; But if a Price were to be fixed for these Parcels, according to the Weight and Diflance, with a Penalty for taking more, this great Evil would be remedied; perhaps 6 d. for any Parcel not exceeding 6 lb. brought from any Diflance not exceeding one Mile, and fo in -

21. The State of the Watch in Westminster is The Watch in notoriously bad and ineffectual, arifmg princi-Westminster. pally from the following Caul'es; first the Acts of Parliament make the Power of the Commif-fioners parochial; this occasions too great a Par-fimony and causes Confusion on fixing the Watch at the Borders of each Parish; the pay of the Watchmen is much too little, their Duty tco hard, and they generally lodge out of the Parish at a great Dillance. As the Watch is a Part of the Civil Power, this Commisswn should be executed by the Magistrates, the Reflcrs of the Parishes as the Representatives cf such Parishes, and any other Gentleman residing in Westminster having an Estate cf ioo 1. a Tear-, the Regulations that this Alteration would produce, would be the Means of establish-ing an effectual Watch, and perhaps at the fame Expence as at present, and yet the Watchmen would be paid better and relieved once in the Night, and it would answer the End, if the Constables of the Night wet e to be allowed fame thing for that Trouble, provided they executed that Trujl with Fidelity, by flaying at the Watch-House the stated Hours. Bread. 22. By the Statute of 8 Ann. Ch. 18. The Ju-

ftices of the Peace had Power given them to enter into Bakers Shops and weigh their Bread; this was a great Security to the fair Trader, from the inroads of common Informers, and a terror to the dilhonelt Baker; but by the Statute of 31 Geo. 2. c. 29. containing general Regulations relative to Bread, the whole of the former Statute was repealed, and consequently that useful Clause which seems to have been overlooked; at present one half of the Penalty is given to the Informer,

421

APPENDIX, former, the other half to defray the Expences of the Prosecution of the Aft; this has been a great Temptation to common Informers, and has occasioned much Perjury. ’Tis to be wished therefore, that the former Clause relative to the Ju-ftices could be revived.

23. By the 6th of Ann. Ch. qi. Servants who p;res(,y tt,e occasion Fires by their Neglect, are liable to 18 Neglect of Months Imprisonment, or to pay a Fine of 100/. Servants, and though there are few Fires in London but

what arise from tins cause, yet this Law from its great Severity is seldom or never put in Execution. I remember only one Instance of it myself: But if this Penalty were to be altered to 40s. and the Imprisonment to a Month-, there •would be more Examples made, consequenlly it would excite Care and Caution in Domejlicks.

24. If the Revenue arising from these Li- Hawkers and cences could be supplied by a Tax on open Pedlars. Shops or any other Means, it would not only be beneficial to the fair Trader, but prevent Impo-

fitions, Frauds and Thefts; for thele Licences give the word fort of Men Pretence to go to lone Houses in the Country, give them an Opportunity of felling Rolen Goods, of Smuggling; in a Word, it is fruitful of Evils of every Kind.

25. The letting out Horses to Hire to Stran- stable gers in this Metropolis is a great cause of Rob-Keepers.' bery. If professed Stable Keepers were obliged to

keep a Book to enter the Names of Persons to whom they let Horses; if they were never to let Horses but to thdfe whom they know, unless they bring some Person with them, known to the Stable Keeper, on a small Penalty -, and if any Stable Keeper, who shottld have let his Horse to a ftfpiciotts P erf on, givesNoticc to the Public Office in Bow-Street, before his Horse

Watermen. 26. The present Method of punching Watermen for exacting more than their Fare, and other Misdemeanors in' their Employment, is in a great Measure ineffectual, from the Trouble it occasions.

If the Drivers of Oxen from Smilbfield to the .Slaughter Houses were Subject to the same Penalties for the like Offence, it might be the Means of saving the Lives of many of his Majesty's Subjects who are fo frequently gored by what they call over-drove Oxen-, for these Mischiefs generally arise from the cruelty or folly of the Driver, and if every Butcher was obliged to put a round smooth Knob of Wood with a Stem to it in the Form of a Mujhootn Button, and a Hole made in the said Stem to fix upon the Horn cf every Beast fo pur chafed-, it would in feme Measure prevent the Effects of their Horns, when they attempt to gore.

28. The Poor are Subject to many Inconveniences in this Town, amongst which the fob

lowing is not the lead; it has been unfortunately fixed as a Rule by some Parish Officers, that a poor Person is not to be received even into their own Parish when they apply for Relief, unless Relieving the they are brought by a Pais, which is as much asPoor-to fay go beg in the Streets, be taken up, carried before a Justice, be whipped or committed to Bridewell, and then you will be fent by a Pals to us, and then we can receive you; for no Person can be palled till they become a Vagrant and a Criminal; surely this is adding to the Distress of the moll: miserable, and I have great Reason to believe, that many poor Wretches have pe-rished in our Streets for want of seasonable Relief ; to my Knowledge a poor lame Woman, in order to enforce her Settlement in Westminster, walked from Overseer to Overseer, and from Vestry Clerk to Vestry Clerk in two different Parishes, and from thence to the War Office,

(her Husband being ,a SoldierJ near five Miles in one Day, and must have lain in the Street at last, had not a Magistrate fent for the Overseer of the Parish where her Settlement was, and delivered her into his Hand. Surely there should be some Penalty on Parish Officers thus refu-fmg Relief to .the Poor. Phe humane Method preferred by Law for the Removal of the Poor, is by an Order of two Jufliccs, in which Cafe the Pauper is first relieved, and then carefully delivered to the Overseer of the Parish which they belong to.

29. The common Gaol for the City and Li- Gatehouse. berty of Westminster is the Gatehouse ; to this Place Debtors, Felons, Cheats and all other common Offenders in the said City and Liberty, are liable to be committed, and by the Account of the present Gaoler, for some few Years back F f there

APPENDIX.

there have been 700 or 800 Prison in a Year confined in the said Gaol, and what is astonishing to tell, there is no kind of Provision made for the Subsistence of these Prison, except a few trifling Legacies not amounting to 5/. in the Year; indeed they have the Advantage of a begging Box which hangs under the Gateway, but produces a meer Trifle, from a Supposition that there is some Provision for the poor Prison; other wife I am fure in a Country of Humanity like this, no one would pass by the Gate-house without putting in his Mite; this Gaol might formerly have been large enough and fuf-ficiendy convenient, but from the increase of Buildings and Inhabitants in this Metropolis, it rather deserves the Name of a Dungeon than a Gaol, and I am convinced that had it not been for the Humanity the prefer.t Keeper, Mr. Matthew Clark, many Prison must have been star-ved to Death ; a good common Gaol where Offenders may be kept fafe and healthful, and be separated according to the Nature of their Offences, is a Matter of great consequence to a Metropolis like this, where Offences of every Kind are fo frequent, and truly deserving the public Attention. This Gaol is in a Franchise and belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, who appoint the Gaoler; the Magistrates of Westminster {hocked at the Sickness and Diftrels of the Prison there, have already applied to that respectable Body relative to this Grievance, from whom they have received every Allurance of Concurrence and Assistance in an application to the Legislature, to redress this Grievance, by giving them Ground for the erection of a new Gaol in Tothill Fields, which might be executed

ted at a moderate Expence, by joining it to the Bridewell situated at that Place, and by other Concefiions and Indulgencies in their Power to grant. And as the new Method of paving and opening the Streets, has given great Beauty and Convenience to this City, taking down the Gate-honfe will open that End of Tothill Street, which when paved in the new Manner will make a fine Road to the Queen’s Palace, Chelsea, &c. I mention this because I would leave no Motive unnoticed that could forward the Execution of a Plan fo necessary to the good Order of the City and Liberty of Westminster, and for which Policy and Humanity call fo loudly. It is apprehended that a Gaol for answering this Pur-pose might be built for 1500 or 2000/. and when built, the County Rate, to which Westminster pays fo largely, might endow it.

30. The easy Elcape of Offenders of the most notorious Kind out of this Kingdom at our Sea- Escapes Ports, especially at Harwich and Dover, is a ve- Abroad, ry great Evil; several Murderers have escaped

by this Means within these Twelvemonths.-

Query, Should not Persons going out of the Kingdom as Poffenders, be obliged to give an Account to the principal Officer of the Customs at these Ports, at kail give their Names, or bring some Voucher in Writing, if common Persons, from the Place whence they came ? Many of our useful Manufacturers are carried out of England from Inattention through this Channel; a Penalty on the Master of a Ship for raking in any Paflenger from these • Ports, who had not given their Name to such Officers, might perhaps be useful.

3 r. Gaming among the common People is at this Time carried to great Excels, to the ruin of

their families, and to the injury of the Public; the artful, idle and extravagant are constantly deluding; and preying upon the weak and unwary as it were with Impunity ; the Laws against Gaming being Calculated to punish those who win large Sums. Query, If Per fins who win or lofi at one sitting not less than 5 s. nor more than jol. at Cards, Dice, Billiards, Shuffle Board, Miflifflppi, Skittles, or any other Game or Device now in Use, or hereafter to be invented, were liable to be convicted before two Justices of the Peace, to pay double-,the Sum fo won or loft, one Half to the Poos-, the other to the Party injured, and to be imprifined for any Time not exceeding one Month, with an appeal to the Session: Would not this in a great Measure reduce this Evil, so fatal to Industry?

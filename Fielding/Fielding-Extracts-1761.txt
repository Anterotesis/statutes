My LORD,

AS your Grace, amidst the many important Objects which must necessarily in-grofs the Time of a Person of your Rank and high Employments, humanely afforded your Attention to the Peace and Safety of the Inhabitants of this Metropolis, in the Year 1754, when our Streets, Lanes and Fields were infefted by Gangs of the moil desperate and cruel

DEDICATION.

Robbers and Murderers, by efta-blishing at that Time a Plan of a Police, for the more easy Detection and bringing such Offenders to Justice, and for the Prevention of other Disorders, which has been attended with the belt of Confe-quences; whatever Improvements have been iince made in that Plan, seem to claim your particular Patronage : And it is for this Reason, therefore, that the following Sheets are dedicated to your Grace.

They contain Extracts from moll of the Penal Laws provided by the Legislature for the Peace and good Order of this Metropolis; and as the Ignorance of, and Inattention to, these Laws, have been and ftiil are the Occasion of many Disorders and Irregularities, it is thought that this Method of publishing them will be productive of very good Effects, and render their Execution, in a great Measure, un-

And I hope, at the same Time I make this Offering of Relpedl to your Grace, it will be some Proof to you of my Fidelity in the Execution of that Trust with which you have fo long honoured me, by {hewing your Grace, that I spend my whole Time in an Employment more fatiguing, more dangerous, more confined, and less fatisfadfory than any can imagine, or mod will believe: An Office, which nothing but the exacteft Caution and strictest Integrity can render either easy or secure; and nothing but the highest Diffionefty, meanest Venality, or bafeft Corruption, can make lucrative.

THE

INTRODUCTION.

MONG the various Grievances, which

a false Notion of Liberty induces Men

.... to complain of in this Kingdom, the Multiplicity of our Laws is one; and more ef-pecially the great Number of penal Statutes, which inconsiderate Persons have deemed as Restraints upon Liberty.

And as some Men have been weak or wicked enough, to endeavour to clififatisfy the Minds of the People relative to those wholesome penal Laws, calculated for the Peace and good Order of this Town, and have thereby made the inferior Class of Men impatient of Authority, and rendered the Office of Magistrate more difficult; it is apprehended that it may be useful to explain the cause, Nature, Utility, nay, the Necessity of them: From whence it will appear, that they are really no other Re-fhraints upon true Liberty, than what every good and honed Man would wish for; for true Liberty can only consist with those Restraints, which pure Religion and good Government lay upon Mankind.

The Multiplicity of Laws, fays an ingenious Writer, should not be looked upon fo much

B

as

The INTRODUCTION,

as a Grievance, as the Mark of a declining People *, and Tacitus fays, In pejftma Republica piurim<£ leges.

Indeed, when one considers this City as the Metropolis of a Country of Freedom, a Country of Commerce, abounding with Inhabitants, increasmg in Buildings, one may easily account for the Number of penal Laws made for its Government: For in all free Countries, the lucrease of Laws mull keep Pace with Luxury. But in this Kingdom, the common People enjoy the peculiar Happiness of being governed by thole Laws only, which they themselves make: For when any Evil of a public Nature ariles in Society to such a Height as to become visible, and to threaten Mischief, Application is made to Parliament, where, when the Exif-tence of the Evil itself, and the Certainty of its consequences are fatisfaclorily proved, fame Remedy is proposed by the Wisdom of the Legislature ; which, when it has received the Royal Aflent, paiTes into a Lav/; and the very Instant this is done, the Law becomes sacred, and challenges implicit and universal Obedience.

It was the Remark of a Foreigner, that the common People of England seemed to have no Idea of an Offence less than Fraud or Felony; and considered the Laws of their Country, which were calculated for Peace and good Order, merely as Restraints and Hardships.

If this be true, it is not doubted but that a Review of these Laws will have a due Influence on their Minds, and beget a more ready Obedience to them ; for it is clear from Exr perience, that they are oftener offended against from Ignorance than Obfljnacyo

For

3

The INTRODUCTION.

For this Purpose, therefore, I have in the following Sheets made Extracts of all those penal Laws which relate to the good Government of this Metropolis, and will enable every Inhabitant to judge for himself when he has received any Injury, Inconvenience or Infult from another, in what Manner he is to apply for Redress, and point out immediately to him the Punishment the Law has prescribed for the Offender.

What jEnglijhman would wish any one of these Laws should be repealed, fo wifely calculated for the Safety, for the Security of the Lives, Property, Liberty, and Happiness of the Subject ? And it is the candid, diligent and impartial Execration of these Laws, that make a great Part of the English Police ; which Word, as it has been greatly misunderTtood and misrepresented, I shall endeavour to explain.

The bed Explanation I have ever met with of the Word itself, is what follows, viz. That it Is the Regulation and Government of a City or Country, so far as regards the Inhabitants, And this mud always be fuited to the Nature of the Government and Conditution of the Country where it is exercised. The Police of an arbitrary Government differs from that used in a Republic; and a Police proper for England., mud differ from them both; as it muff always be agreeable to the jud Notion of the Liberty of the Subjebf, as well as to the I ,aws of this Country.

In the Year 1754, there were several large and desperate Gangs of Street-robbers, House-breakers, &V. that infeded this Metropolis, and the Neighbourhood about it ; who com-B 2 m it ted

The INTRODUCTION.

mitted the mod audacious Robberies, Cruelties and Murders.

His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, shocked at these Outrages on his Majefcy’s Subjects, directed the late Henry Fielding, to consider of some Plan for the speedy Removal of these Mif-chiefs, and for the more easy apprehending and bringing such Offenders to Justice; which was immediately laid before his Grace, approved and supported by him; and as it owed its Rife to his Humanity, fo does it its Continuance to his Care and Attention ; and what happy Effects have fmce arofe from this Police, the Public can belt judge.

When these Adis of Violence were subdued? Prevention was the next Object in the Confederation of that Magistrate, who weighed and considercd the cause and Increase of Robberies in general, and published them in a small Pamphlet, which has been the Occifion of

A ?

many good and wholsome Laws, and the cause of many Advantages arising from this Institution of a Police; which is nothing more than enabling one or more Magistrates to give up their whole Time to the Public; to be watchful over Evils as they arise in Society, and to suppress them in their Infancy by a due Execution of the Laws: For by habituating Mankind to an Obedience to the Laws of their Country, Peace and good Order imperceptibly arise: And, at the same Time, by bringing all Informations of Fraud and Felony into one Point, keeping a Register of Offenders., making quick Pursuit, opening a general Correspondence with all the adlive Magistrates in the Country, Escapes are rendered difficult, ep:'.i i nk:ovaries easy ; A Circumstance perhaps

that

The INTRODUCTIO N.

(hat may deter many a one from these dangerous Enterprizes, and induce them rather to make a Trial of their Industry for an honed Livelihood.

It was intended that this Magiffrate should compose and reconcile the Differences among the Poor, and thereby prevent litigious Suits; which, as they make rich Men poor, muff make the common People and their Families Burdens to their Parishes: That he should be attentive by Day and Night to all Informations of Fraud and Felony, and be vigilant and indefatigable in the Pursuit of Offenders, by encouraging, instructing, and preserving Harmony among the Peace Officers, and by rewarding them and all other Persons shilling them in fatiguing and dangerous Undertakings. For this Trouble a competent Salary should be allowed, that he might feek for no other Advantage either from the Poor or the Rich, than that of the happy Opportunity of reconciling the Differences of the former, and the pleasing Talk of preventing Infults on the latter.

That he should, by Publication and every Other Means in his Power, make the penal Laws known, and enforce an Obedience to them by a due Execution thereof; for by making Punishment less frequent, its Effedl is strengthened.

And, it is not doubted, but that, when the brft Promoter of this Plan of a Police has Lei-fure from Matters of greater Importance to complete it, the Government of this Metropolis will become as easy as that of a Country t illage, and many happy Effects arise from it B 3 without

The INTRODUCTION,

without any Restraint on the Liberty of tbs’ Subject: For, let the weak or wicked laugh at-or abuse this Police as they please, every true Briton must have this Satisfaction to reflect, that no private Person whatever, no Watchman, Beadle, Conliable, or Magistrate, can unjustly deprive him of his Liberty or Property, with Impunity.

Fsom an attentive Perufal of these Extracts it will appear, that it is scarce possible for a Subject to fuller either Injury, Inconvenience, or even Infult, without speedy Remedy : And as the Ignorance of a Law is no Excuse for the Breach of it, it is greatly to be hoped and much to be wished, that this Publication of the penal Laws, will take away the disagree-ble Necefiky of putting any of them in Execution ;—Prevention being in all Respe&s more eligible than Punishment.

But that the above Plan may be executed with Effect, it is highly necessary that the Public iliould do their Part, viz. to give immediate Notice of all Frauds and Felonies, with exaCl Descriptions of Persons and Things, on which Account all Exprefies and Messengers will be paid their Expences, and rewarded for their Expedition, and their Informations received at all Times: And if any Inhabitant is annoyed by Disorderly or Gaming-houses. Hops, or illegal Assemblies, by their Children, Servants or Apprentices, haunting the lame, Information or Notice thereof being given by Letter or otherwise, due Enquiry will be made, and every Means used to suppress the Evil. In thele Cafes, Inhabitants appearing

themfeives, renders the Matter easy*,-

for it has been found by Experience, tbit nine out of ten of these irregular Meetings have been suppressed merely by the Magi-flrates fending to the Parties, and making them acquainted with the Nature of the Offence, and the Penalties which the Laws in such Cafes prescribe.

the following Clanfe may perhaps prevent some Inhabitants from falling under the Penalty of the Law. Indeed, in most of the public trading Streets, the immediate Interest, as well as Safety, induces the Inhabitants to hang out Lights as soon as the Evenings become long and dark ; and it is much to be wished, that the Lights were equally attended to in that Part of the Town where People of Fashion generally dwell \ many cf whom not coming to Town till near Christmas, forget or regie£1 to order their Lamps to be lighted, not considering that they are subjeSl to the Penalty hereafter mentioned, ?wr the Inconvenience it is to PaffengerSy who may at present walk up half a long Street, without seeing a Lamp.

Inhabitants to ^ By the above Statute it is enacted. That hang out every Houfholder, within any of the Parishes, Lights. Places or Precincts, in the Counties of Middle fex and Surrey, and City and Liberty of JVefiminster, comprized within the weekly Bills of Mortality, whose House adjoins unto, or is near the Street, from Michaelmas unto our Lady Day yearly, shall every Night fet or hang out Candies or Lights in Lanthorns on the Outside of the House next the Street, to enlighten the fame for the Convenience of Paf-fengers, from Time to Time, as it shall grow

One half of this Penalty to be paid to the Informer, the other Part to the Poor of the Parish, to be levied by Diflrefs and Sale of the Offender’s Goods.

Obs. The Legislature, by giving one-half of the Penalty to the Informer, doublless intended ta facilitate the Execution of the penal Laws; but it certainly has a contrary Effeli •, for those who make Informations before Magistrates from the mere Motive of the Reward, are of the difrepu-table Kind; and the Advantages annexed to Informers, have rendered the Office itself odious, and deterred many reputable Persons from re dr effing Injuries and Inconveniencies they have laboured under for Fear of the odious Imputation of an Informer. And it is believed, that if Rewards in general, given to Informers by penal Laws, were taken away, and the whole Penalty given to the Poor, &c. the Laws themselves would be eafter executed, and the Evils they were intended to remedy, eafter removed. For it is from Experience I have observed, that for one Information made from the Motive of the Reward, twenty have been trade from a Defre only of removing a public Evil or Nufance, without the leaf Regard to the Reivard, which such Informers have generally applied themselves to charitable Uses, having firfi paid the Expence of the Pro-jscution: But as Gain is the common Idea of the C Motive

Extracts from the Penal Lems,

Motive of all Informations, many even of these Persons have been insulted for their good Offices to the Public, which would not be the Cafe if Rewards in general were taken away ; and, the Removal of Evils themselves would always be found sufficient Motives for Complaint, and at the fame dime it would give Weight and Dignity to the Raws themselves.

To be more fully informed of these Particulars, fee 2 W. & M. feffi. 2. c. 8.

As the above Adds only oblige Inhabitants to hang out Lights till Twelve o’Clock; and as the Manner in which many of them do hang out their Lights, is the Occasion of much Inconvenience, it were to be wished that one Law was made for enlightning the City of Westmin■■ fter and the adjoining Parishes, in the County of Middlesex, by which Lamps should be fixed on Polls on the Outside of the Footway, and in Courts and Passages, in the belt manner they will admit of, at such Diflances as the Churchwardens and Overseers for the Time being of every Parish and one Justice of the Peace shall think proper, with a Power for every such Pari fh to make and raise a Rate for the Payment of the fame. The said Lamps to be lighted by Five in the Evening from Michaelmas to Lady-Day^ and during the other Part of the Year by Nine. And as the Watch at present are of very little Use from the Smallness of the Wages given^ which puts the Trufl into the lowed: Hands, and from the Length of Time which they watch, which makes them often leave their Stands to refresh themselves, or subjects them to fieep, it would be useful if in the fame Law one Provider: was made for the Watch

through

Extracts from the Penal Laws,

throughout the above-mentioned Parishes, whereby each Parish might be enabled to make a larger Rate for the Watch, fo that there might be a double Number of Watchmen who might relieve one another in the middle of the Night, which would not much in-crease the present Expence, but would induce more reputable Persons to undertake this Duty, as they would be able by Means of this Relief to follow their ordinary Callings the next Day, which at present is impofilble, as they are obliged to fit up the whole Night.

IV. Extracts from the 29 Ch. 2. c. 7. See, relating to the due Observance of the Sabbath.

IN the best of Christian Countries in the Uni-verse, and where Examples of Piety and Virtue abound amongst all Ranks in Life, one should imagine that the Divine Law, fo ftridly enjoining us to keep Eloly the Seventh Day, would be observed with more Decency and Reverence than it is*, tho’, indeed, in the Country, where the Inhabitants of small Towns and Villages, and their Actions, are respectively known to each other, there is no great Reason to complain*, and it were to be wished, that even the fame Degree of Decency was observed in this Metropolis. Perhaps, because, the Breach of fo ftrid a Command of God him-felf, is not immediately followed by the Pu-nishment it deserves. Mankind are apt to abuse that Long-suffering and Forbearance which C 2 arise

' The Legislature, fenfible of this, out of their great Wisdom and Piety, endeavoured to enforce the Observance of this Command of God by a human Institution.

Obs. Fho'3 from the present Plenty of Money, 5 s. may appear to be but a small Fine, yet at the 'Lime when this Law was made* it was a confi-derable Sum; and it is for this Reason, we hear, that this Penalty is under Consideration for Amendment.

Shew forth, or expose to wares to Sale. gajej any Wares, Merchandizes, Fruit, Herbs, Goods or Chattels whatsoever, upon the Lord’s Day, or any Part thereof, upon Pain that every Person fo offending, Shall forfeit the fame Goods fo cried or shewed forth, or ex-posed to Sale.

recommended to all Per fans to pay on these Occa~ Jions what the Coachmen and Chairmen demand, and take their Number *, for by this Means they secure to them].'elves an Opportunity of enquiring into, and a Power of punishing any such Impo* fition \ whereas, whoever shall offer or pay any Hackney Coachman or Chairman less than his Fare, they may be Jure of receiving a Summons, or perhaps being taken up by a Warrant from fGme Justice of the Peace, and obliged not only to pay the Fare, but also the Man’s Expence: For Hackney Coachmen and Chairmen never apply to Magistrates before they are certain they are in the right, well knowing the Certainty of their Punishment, if they have demanded more than their Fare.

Obs. A he Rewards mentioned in this Clause^ joined to the Nufance that disorderly Houses mu ft be to the Neighbours, should, as one would imagine % be a fnfficient Incentive to the Execution of this Act.

II. That upon such Constable or other Officer entering into such Recognizance to pro-fecute as aforesaid, the said Justice of the Peace shall forthwith make out his Warrant to bring the Person fo accused of keeping a Bawdy House, Gaming House, or other disorderly House, before him, and shall bind him or her over to appear at such General or Quarter Session or Assizes, there to answer to such Bill of Indictment as (hall be found against him or her for such Offence; and such Justice shall and may, if in his Discretion he thinks fit, likewise demand and take Security for such Perlori’s good Behaviour in the mean Time, and until such Indictment shall be found, heard

and determined, or be returned by the Grand Jury not to be a true Bill.

Obs. It is observable, from these Clauses, what Oaths and Informations are necessary to be laid before the ' Magifirate, before he can take any Step whatever.

III. That in cafe such Constable shall neg- Constable neg~ 3e6t or refuse, upon such Notice, to go before le&ing Duty. any Justice of the Peace, or to enter into such Recognizance, or shall be wilfully negligent in carrying on the said Prosecution, he shall for every such Offence forfeit the Sum of 20/. to each of such Inhabitants fo giving Notice as aforesaid.

Obs. From these Extralls of the above recent Statute, the Method of suppressmg disorderly Houses is most clearly explained, tho9 by the fly and wicked Insinuations to be met with in the public Papers, which are too often the Vehicles of Ignorances Calumny and Falfoood, one would imagine that a Justice of the Peace could as eajtly suppress a Bawdy-House as discharge a domestic Servant. By the Police in an arbitrary Government, this, perhaps, might be done\ but an English Police can only prevent by seasonable Cautions, and only punish on due Informations and legal Proofs. ‘The Laws of England are not to be executed on Caprice or Fancy, but by the Jdminift ration of solemn Oaths \ and, as the Law itself fays, by the Testimony of one or more credible PVitnesses on Oath.

But Misrepresentations and Credulity have fo strong a Foundation in the Depravity and Weak-ness of human Nature, that it is absurd for Per-fons in public Characters, who are every Day tried and condemned, or rather condemned and D 3 tried

VIIL ExtraBs from i W. Sc M. c. 18. and i Geo. i. e. 5. relating to the di-fiurbing Divine War flip.

WHEREAS many evil-disposed and immoral Persons have of late disturbed3 or caused to be disturbed, several diflenting licensed Congregations, and have thereby brought themselves and their Friends into Difficulties and Inconveniencies; and as the Weak are too often made the Instruments of the Wicked on these Occasions, it is to be hoped that the Publication of the following Clauses will for the future preserve Decency and Tranquillity in all lawful Assemblies for Divine Worship, and secure an Obedience to, and a strict Observance of, thele Laws: The first of which enacts,

Disturbing I. That if any Person or Persons do and

Congrega- shall willingly and of Purpose maliciously and

tions. contemptuously come into any Cathedral or

Parish Church, Chapel or other Congregation, permitted by Law, and disquiet or disturb the lame, or mifufe any Preacher or Teacher, such Person or Persons, upon Proof thereof, before any Justice of the Peace, by two or more fuf-Bcient Witnesses, shall find two Sureties to be bound by Recognizance in the penal Sum of 50/. and in Default of such Sureties, shall be committed to Prison; there to remain till the

hext General or Quarter Sessions *, and if there convicted of the said Offence, shall forfeit 20/. to his Majesty.

II. By 1 Geo. 1. c. 5. f 2. it is enadfed, Persons pul-That if any Persons unlawfully, riotously and d?wn tumultuously assembled together, to the Diftur- chapCeisS’&c bance of the public Peace, shall unlawfully, * and with Force, demolish or pull down, or begin to demolish or pull down, any Church Or Chapel, or any Building for religious Wbrship, certified and registered according to the above Statute, or any Dwelling-house, Barn,

Stable or other Out-house, that then every such demolishing or pulling down, or beginning to demolish or pull down, shall be adjudged Felony without Benefit of Clergy, and the Offenders therein shall be adjudged Felons, and shall suffer Death, as in case of Felony, without Benefit of Clergy.

Ob s. As many Persons from Bigotry, Prejudices, Caprice, Resentment and Drunkenness, have suffered themselves to be drawn aside by Mobs and ’Tumults, and inconjiderately to commit the above-mentioned Outrages, an Attention to the above Clause may be useful. Englishmen have no Ex-cufe to do themselves jufiice by Force and Violence, as there are fo many excellent Laws provided for the Safety of their Lives, Defence of their Liberties, and the Security of their Property; and the Want of this Consideration is too frequently the cause of RefiHance to Peace and Civil Officers^ and was lately the cause of a mofi horrid Murder*

It is always right to submit to Constables, and all other Officers armed with proper Authority; who, if they do any Thing illegal, are liable to be punched for it> but refifting them is dangerous.

Obs. It is apprehended, that it would be found very useful, if every Parish would keep two strong Fire-Ladders of different Lengths, to be carried on the fir ft Notice to the Place of the Fire, as it might be the Means of saving many Lives and much Property; and though there be no Reward allowed by Law for this Purpose, there would be no Danger but that the Carriers of such Ladders would be well rewarded, either by the Insurance-Office, Sufferers or Parish, though the Confcious-ness of being useful in such Calamities is in itself a Reward.

IV. That the Turn-cock belonging to Reward to such Water-Work, whose Water shall be found Turnon, or first come into the Main or Pipe where cock* the first Plug shall be opened at any Fire, shall be paid ioj, by the Church-wardens of such respective Parish where the Fire shall happen.

Obs. Is it not rather necessary than useful, that the Proprietors of Water-Works should direct all their Furn-cocks to have their Names and the Word Turn-cock painted on a Board in large Characters on the Outjide of their Dwelling House or Lodging, and that they give Notice in Writing to the Church-wardens of the neighbouring Parishes of the Place of their Residence, and when they change the fame \ and that the Churchwardens of every Parish should cause the Names and Directions of such Furn-cocks living in and contiguous to their Parish, to be fixed on the Church-Doors, in the Round-House, and in every

been the cause of Fires gaining Ground, which might otherwise have been flopped on their first Appearance; and a Reward might be given to that Watchman who first calls the Furn-cock.

Obs. When one reflects as an Englishman what a Blessing the Seas 071 our Coafis have in Store for us, what a peculiar Benefit the Plenty of Sea Fish would he to the Poor, what a Con-veniency to the Rich of this Metropolis, and that this immense Blejjing is intercepted from us by the Contrivance amd Combination of a few designing 1 avaricious

Extracts from the Penal Laws,

avaricious Men, how can we sufficiently lament that the Pains and Attention of the Legislature to redress this Evil, has been hitherto fruitless? Nay, I am informed that the Evil is rather grown worse than better \ it is therefore with great Deference and RespeF that I offer my Opinion on this SubjeF, which 1 do rather that it may beget in some other a better Plan, than that I think the following one to be perfect: But I do apprehend, that if the Gentlemen belonging to the Free British Herring Fishery, a large, able and respeliable Body, would (besides the catching of Herrings) become Fishermen for this Metropolis ; which, as they have much Leifure from their other Fishery, are accustomed to, and conversant in, the building of Boats, making of Nets, and hiring of Fiffer-men, they can carry on, with more Eafe, and less Expence to themselves, and more Utility to the Public, than any other Body whatever. By this Means an immense Quantity of Fish would be brought to Billingsgate and Westminster Markets, yet not more than this Fown would consume, and would totally deftrcy the present Monopoly of different Fff, viz. Lobfiers, Furbots, &c. as well as the little Combinations lately pr a Fifed to make an artificial Scarcity : And as the Conveniency of a Plenty of Fish in London and Westminster to all Ranks of People, is much easier to be conceived than expressed, IJhall now mention what seems farther necesfary to the Furtherance of this Plan: And firfl, that the Legislature ffould enable the Members of the Free Brit iff Herring Fishery to apply a necessary Part of their Capital to this proposed Fishery, which cannot be attended with aiiy Hazard, as ready Money is always paid at the Fiff-market s\ fo that it will rather enrich

the

59

- Extracts from the Penal Laws,

the Body, and enable them to carry on the Herring Fishery itself with more Effefi and Advantage, than obflrufi it.

2dly, Besides the Provisions made by the late Statute relative to Sea Fish, an Officer should be appointed to attend both Markets to fee such Methods faithfully executed, as the Legislature shall think necessary, to prevent the engrossing or imonopolizing of any Fish brought to the said Markets for Sale.

3<lly, F'hat every Person felling Fish by Retail out of the said Markets, shall be obliged to expose to open View from Eight to Fwelve in the Morning, whatever Fish he has to fell, with a Penalty for concealing any Part of the fame.

In this Plan, Public Spirit and Interest will go Hand in Hand; and as they will be enabled to fit out a larger Fleet of Fishing-Boats than was ever yet fent to Sea, great Plenty of Fish must be the consequence, and Cheapness will naturally follow ■, and by little Bounties and Rewards which they them [elves will be able to give to Fishermen, it is hoped that the Evil now fo loudly complained of, will be most effefinally cured; and the Fi[mongers themselves, who have lately been the Dupes of the Fishermen, and the Monopolizers of particular Fish would have Reason to rejoice ; for, by felling more Fife at reasonable Rates, their Gain would be the fame.

cautious to avoid the above Penalties, which must necessarily distress his Family, as well as take away the Refutation of his House. And as there are many Persons who are wicked enough to teaze a Publican to lend them Cards., or to suffer them to game in their Houses, merely that they may have an Opportunity to inform against the House for the Sake of the Reward, no Publican can be fafe who fujfers Gaming of any kind in his House. But it is feared, that the too great Number of Public Houses is the great cause of these Evils, as it induces the Publican to make Use of these Temptations to draw Custom to his House; which would nqt be the Cafe if their Number %v#s lejjened.

Obs. Notwithstanding this excellent Provision, the good Intention of the Legiftature is ft ill defeated, by the Pawnbrokers requiring Bills of Sale of their Cnftomers, and some Times for a very short Time, which, as it has more the Appearance of taking the Advantage of the Unwary than any Thing else, no Paivnbroker should, on any Account whatever, desire, induce or persuad, any Customer to give a Bill of Sale of Goods under the Value of iol. Indeed, when they lend larger Sims, a Bill of Sale may then be proper; but even then it should not be made for lejs than 12 Months, unless the Goods are perishable. But for small Sums, the Party had much better fell the Goods at first, than pawn them, and give a Bill of Sale, as in all Probability they will then be in a better State, and fetch more.

Perhaps the Pawnbroker may fay, that these Bills of Sale for Goods pledged for less than iol. are lawful; but fure he can never fay they are equitable, or in any Respelf agreeable to the Intention of the Law it [elf \ and should they continue this Practice, it may pofftbly beget some new Clause to provide again ft it.

'ISFORTUNES and Distresses have been observed to have very different Effects according to the Disposition of the Party on whom they fall: When well-dispoied Persons are afflicted, it is apt to make them mild, humble, grateful and resigned ; but when the Malevolent meet with Difficulties, it generally makes them envious, impatient, malicious and repining. Necessity, they fay, is the Mother of Invention ; and when that a hies rather from Accident than Extravagance, the Invention is generally employed in what is useful to Mankind, and its Productions deserve the Name of Ingenuity; bur when the Necdiity ariics from extravagant Debaucheries, the Invention is then racked to the Injury of Mankind, to obtain

their Property, as ’Fuel for their own Profufe-ness. The Produce of this Species of Invention is what I call Fraud ; and Excelling in this fort of Deceit is what conflitutes the Chara&er of a Gambler, whose various Devices are the Subject of what follows :

Doubtless there are Gamblers in every Rank of Life, as well as Gamesters: As to those who trick you out of your Knowledge, by what they commonly call Sucking your Brains, or out of your Reputation, your Wife or your Daughter, under the specious Pretence of Friendlhip, they are out of the Reach of the Law. The greater the Capacity of a Gambler, the more dangerous he is to Society, as his Abilities and Resolution enable him to execute i p-reat and destructive Schemes, while those of i a lower Rank content themselves with smaller j Acquisitions. But in Order to convey a just j Idea of this Animal, I shall endeavour to shew j him in ail the different Spheres in which he | exerts his Ingenuity, from the lowed: to the j hisheic. i

A Pickpocket, though a Felon, seems to be in the lowed Clals of Gamblers; but his Suc-ctfs rather arises from the Dexterity of his Hands, than the Contrivance of his Head ; and like Rats and other such Vermin, they appear ; rather to take the Advantage of your Negligence and Inattention, than to contend with your Undemanding. The ffrd and lowed: Oafs of Gamblers then, who would cheat you with your Eyes open, arc those who invite you to prick in the Belt or Garter for a Wager; and the Certainty of Winning at this Grt of Liverlion appears fo clear to the Novice, that

he never fails to bite, if he be a proper Object.

And here I mufl premife, that these Gamblers are such exquisite Judges of their Prey, that they seldom fail of Success.

The next Class are those who find a Paper full of Gold Rings, which they" take Care to pick up in the Sight of a proper Gbjecft, whose Opinion they afk. This Set appear very mean, which gives them an Opportunity of saying they had rather have found a good Piece ot Bread and Cheese, for that he had net broke his Fait for a whole Day; then willies the Gentleman would give him something for them, that he might buy himself a Pair of Shoes, a Coat,

GtV. The Cull immediately bites, and thinking to make a cheap Purchase of an ignorant Fellow, gives him 20 j. for four or five Brafs Rings washed over; or what is more frequent, and yet more successful, is the Picking-up of a Shilling or a Half-Crown, before the Face of a Countryman, whose Opinion of it is immediately asked whether it be Silver or not, and he is invited to {bare the Finder’s Good-luck in a Glafs or Wine or a Pot of Ale, The harmless Countryman, pireased at such an Invitation in a strange Place, is carried to an Aie-house, where the Sharper’s Friends are waiting for him, and where cutting or playing at Caros is soon proposed, and the Countryman met! certainly tricked out of all his Money, Watch and every Thing valuable he has about him.

The next Set attend at Inns; and as Porters are intruded to carry Boxes and Parcels that come from the Country, the Gambler takes Notice of the Directions and fends his Comrade immediately to the House, where he waits

22 $ "Extracts from the Penal Laws.

For the Arrival of the Porter; mees him within a few Doors of the House, or if the Door be shut, he stands on the Steps, and begins immediately to abuse the Porter for his Delay; damns him, and tells him he was just coming for it; that he had a great Mind to give him nothing: The Porter afks Pardon, the Gambler pays him and takes Possession of the Goods, with which he decamps the Instant the Porter’s Back is turned* And as Tradesmen generally employ Country Fellows for Porters in their Houses, two or three of these Gamblers are generally waiting at the Corner of the Streets near some of the great Inns; and if they hear one of the Porters, charged with a Box or Bundle, afk his Way to the Inn, one of them steps up to him very civilly, tells him that he is going that Way, and will shew him the House. The Countryman implicitly follows his Guide, whilst the Gambler’s Comrade takes the Hint, marches before and plants himself at some convenient Passage, puts his Flat into his Pocket, and flicks a Pen in his Wig to repre-fent a Book-keeper; the Guide acquaints the Countryman, that that is the Book-keeper of the Inn, who immediately lays down his Burthen, and the Book-keeper desires him to go over the Way to his Wife for the Key of the Ware-house, and in the mean Time the two Gamblers march off with the Goods.

The next Class ufe the following Stratagem : Gne of them goes in the Drefs of a Footman, and desires some Tradesman to carry Goods to his Matter, which are generally lent by the Journeyman, who is carried into a Parlour hired for that Purpose by the Footman, who

Extracts from the Penal Laws.

tells him that he will carry the Goods'up to his Mailer, and will bring down an Account of what he chufes ; but the Moment he has got Possession of the Goods, he shuts the Parlour Door, and marches out of the PalTage; or if the Mailer has a Mind to afiiil the Servant, he fends the Tradesman back for other forts; but before he returns, makes off with what he has. Servants, who have lived with Taylors, Mantua-makers, Milliners, and other Trades that fend frequently to the Shops, have, when they have been discharged, gone in the Name of their Mailers and Mistreffes to the said Shops, and taken up great Quantities of Goods, in which they have succeeded the easier from their being known to the Shopkeeper. Might it not then be useful to give Notice to the Shopkeepers used by the said Trades-people of their Discharge of such a Servant ?

There is another Set who defraud Tradesmen by taking on themselves false Names, and by pretending to be related to, or connected with, lome Persons of Credit and Fashion, and produce false Letters to prove their Intimacy. Some of these Gamblers attend moil of the Fairs in the Country, where they make it their Business to enquire at Inns who serves them with their Wines and Brandies from London and fish out of Shopkeepers the Names of the Tradesmen here who supply them with Goods. Furnished with this Knowledge, they come to London, and one Day appearing in the Character of a Country Inn-keeper, they go to the Distiller, whole Name they have learned, telling him he has taken an Inn in such a Country ^ that he was recommended to him

by one of his Customcrs, whose Name he tells him, and deferibes his House and Family. The Diftiiler’s Suspicion being lulled alleep by this Stratagem, he chearfully supplies his new Customer with some of his bell Goods, and fends them to some appointed Inn in Town, from whence they are conveyed by the Gambler and converted into Cafh, by felling them as Run Goods for half Price. The very fame Scheme is practised on Grocers and other Shopkeepers, only by changing their Charabier into that of a Country Shopkeeper: k is immaterial to them what Goods they purchase. A Gambler the other Day bought of a Farmer ten Ton of Potatoes, to be delivered one Ton at a Time, and when rwo Ton were delivered, they were to be paid for-, but when the ftcond Ton came, the Gambler difappeared, and had not the Farmer been a Man of Spirit, he would have loll his Property, but landing himself defrauded, he took Possession of the Gambler’s Warthouse, and refeued his Goods out of his Hands.

There is another Set of Gamblers, commonly called Duffers, who attend at Charing-cross, at St. Clemen?s-church, and Ludga-te-hill,, and invite you to go down some Alley, and buy some cheap India Handkerchiefs and Waifccoats but this Cheat growing ftale, they life another Method, which of late has been very successful: They apply themselvesto some young Publican to borrow 20 or 30/. to make up a Sum, and to shew they do not want Money in general, they produce a large Purse well crammed with Counters and Brafs Medals, which they give the Publican a distant View of,

that

that he may take it for Money; they then produce some Silk Waistcoats embroidered with Tinfel, which if not strictly examined, may pass for Silver; these Waistcoats they propose with other India Goods made in Spital-fields, to leave in the Hands of the Publican or his Wife, as a Security for the Money they want, who, ignorant of the Value of the said Goods, generally fall into their Trap.

The following Stratagem has been of late very successful. The Gambler goes to a Shop, and with great Coolness and Compofure, looks over many Goods, deals hard, calls himself a ready-money Customer, and expebls for that Reason to buy cheaper; the Goods being pitched on and their Price fixed, he orders them to be packed up with a Bill and Receipt, and to be fent to his House in about an Flour, where he promises to be and to pay for them. Suspicion being thus removed, the Porter carries the Goods, but the Gentleman is not come home, though the Wife is there, ready to receive all that comes, and who generally by Artifice baffles the Porter, and gets PoiTcflion of the Goods. The Tradesman calls Time after Time, but the Gentleman is not at Home, and the Truth is, he lodges at some distanr Part of the Town, and makes Use of this House only as a Warehouse, to deposit such Goods as he can obtain by Fraud from Tradesmen.

In the Cafes of such ready-money Cuflomers

as these, Porters should be directed not to leave the Goods till they have received the Money for them, on Pain of paying for them them Selves. The hio-hefu Rank of Cheats who attack the

lowing Stratagems : One of the Gang, who is happieft in his Person, and has the best. Ad-dr els, is pitched upon to take a House, Which, by Means of the extreme good Character given of him by his Comrades to the Landlord, is soon accomplished. The next Consideration is

to furnish it, when Mr. •----------, a young

Ironmonger iufc fet up, is pitched upon to provide the’Squire’s Grates; who, glad of lb line an Order, soon ornaments his Chimnies with those of the neweft Fashion. This being done, Mr. <------- , the Upholder, is imme-

diately applied to for other Furniture, and is brought to the House in Order that he may fee the Grates, which he no sooner beholds, than he tells his Honour that he could have furnished him likewise with Giates of the best Kind, at the molt reasonable Rates; to which ’Squire Gambler replies, that he intends taking some little Villa in the Country, where Mr.

*------ shall fur nidi every Thing he can. The

House being now compieatly furnished, the ’Squire dreffes himself in his Morning Gown, Velvet Cap, and red Morocco Slippers, puts one or more of his Comrades into Livery, then fends lor Taylor, Linnen-draper, Silversmith, Jeweller, OV. takes upon him the Character of a Merchant, and by getting Credit of one, by pawning the Goods the Moment he has got them, he is enabled to pay ready Money to others ; by which Means he extends his Credit and increases Ids Orders till he is detected ; winch fomeilmes does not happen till he has •defrauded Tiudehnen to a very considerable Wine.

Comrades at some Rendezvous in Wapping, in the Character of a Captain of a Vessel lying ae such Stairs, and bound to some of the American Plantations, by which Means the aforesaid Merchant procures Goods to be fent aboard ; and as his Credit advances, he makes Use of Draughts, which are constantly accepted by his Comrades, who haye constantly changed their Lodgings when the said Draughts have become due.

There is a Sett of Sharpers, who have lately' purchased several Estates without Money, in the following Manner: They make a Bargain with the Seller or his Agent for the Estate, in consequence of which they draw Articles of Agreement, by which they oblige themselves to pay the Pur chafe Money at such a Time, and give a Bond for the Performance of Covenants: They then immediately go to the Tenant, to fnew him the xArticles of Agreement, and tell him that he will soon have a new Landlord ; upon which the Farmer begins to complain of the old one, and hopes his Honour will repair this, rebuild that, and alter something else, which the new Landlord promises to do. Credit being thus gained with the Tenant, the new Landlord falls in Love, perhaps, with the Farmer’s Daughter, or with a fine Horse, or else borrows Money of him, and gives him a Draught upon his Banker in Town, who fe.ldom has any Cafh in Hand, and often is not to be found.

There are a Sett of Cheats, who constantly attend at Inns, to which Coaches and Waggons come-, and if any Baikets, Bundles or Portmanteaus, are put into Hackney Coaches, or fent from thence by Porters, they immediately follow them, and take the fir ft Opportunity of

getting them into their Possession, either by fending the Porter on some Melfage, for a Bottle of Wine, &c. pretending to take Care of their Goods the while, or else by following them to the Door where they are going, and pretending to be the Servant of the Ploufe, or by some such Trick. At other Times they walk up and down in Inn Yards, in the Dusk of the Evening, at a Distance from the Warehouse; and if any Porter or Apprentice brings a Parcel, and enquires for the Book-keeper, his Hat in a Minute is whipt into his Pocket, and a Pen in his Mouth : The Porter is fent into the Tap-house of some Melfage, and the Sharper escapes. Sometimes they go into a Publick-house, and desire them to fend a Gallon of Beer to some Neighbour, whose Name they have enquired, and to bring Change for a Guinea, which is generally fent by the Maid or some little Boy. The Sharper takes Care to meet the Boy in the Way, receives the Change and Beer, fends him back for a Pipe, and then makes oft. These Sharpers likewise, sometimes, take Portmanteaus from behind Stage-Coaches, when there are no outside Passengers, out of the Tails of Waggons, or from behind Post-Chaifes, or out of Shops in the Evenings, where Goods lie near the Window, or out of Shew-Glasses, by breaking the Glalfes. To prevent some of these Evils, the following Cautions would be useful ; fir ft, for Book-keepers and Inn-keepers to keep their Yards clear from loitering Fellows, and to caution their Porters not to deliver Goods at the Outside of the Door of any House„to which they are fent: To caution the Waggoners and Stage Coachman

men to watch their Coaches and Waggons off the Stones; Shop-keepers should remove Goods from their Windows or Shew-Glaftes, early in the Evening, and to fix a Bell at their Shop-door at that Time : To direct their Porters, Apprentices and Errand-Boys, when fent with Parcels, to be cautious of asking their Way-in the Streets, but at Hcufes or Shops 5 or of entering into any Converlation with Strangers *, or to carry Messages for them, always to deliver the Goods in the Infide of a Warehouse or Inn, or the Infide of a House whither they are fent to: Sometimes these Sharpers, when Families are out of Town, carry some old insignificant Books to the Servant, and tell them they are come for the second Suhfcription •, which, if they do not pay now, their Maker or Lady-will never have their Books; by -which they obtain of some a Guinea, and some lels*, or else they find out the Servant’s Name and Country; come and tell them there lies a Parcel at some Inn, directed for them till called for, demand the Money for Carriage, and then give them a Note to fetch the Goods *, or else they watch the Maker out, and come as a Waiter from a Cokee-house, to fetch their Maker’s Great Coat, or else as a Taylor’s Apprentice or Journeyman, to fetch a Suit of Cloaths to alter. Some of these Sharpers make it their Business to deceive young Women, and obtain their Money and Cloaths, under Pretence of marrying them, by which lafc Stratagem many young Women have loft their Places, their little Money, and all their Apparel.

A new

ExtraFls from the Venal Laws.

A new Species of Cheat has lately been practised by a Gambler and his Gang, who* to my Knowledge, have praclikd every other with Impunity, and is what follows : The Head of the Party calls himself a Coal-Merchant, in which Character he applies to some Trades-man to buy Goods in his Way; tells him he is out of Cash, but if he chufes, will pay him in Coals, of which he is rather over-flocked. The Tradesman approving of this, the Gambler goes down to some Wharf, and orders one or more Chaldron of Coals to be delivered at that Tradesman’s House for his Use. Thus far for the Gambler who attacks the Understanding.

I Hi all now mention a Set of Cheats who make a Dupe of the Heart, and impose on the Benevolence and Companion of the Charitable; these are called Sky-Farmers, and execute their Schemes in the following; Manner: One of them dr dies himself extremely genteel, and takes upon himfllf either the Character of a private Gentleman cr reputable Tradesman. He is attended by two Men in the ( haradler of Country Farmers, with clumfey Boots, Horse-man’s Coats, &c. The Objedls pitched upon for Imposition, are good old charitable Ladies, to whom'the Sollicitor tells a dreadful Story of Lodes by Fire, Inundation, &c. to the utter Ruin of these two poor Farmers and all their Families ; their Wives are big with Child, their Children down in the Small-Pox, &c. A Book is then produced by the Sollicitor, who undertakes this disagreeable Office purely out of Good-Nature, knowing the Story to be true, in this Book are the Names of several of the Nobility and Gentry fet down by himself, who

have

ExtraBs from the Fenal Laws,

have contributed to this Charity *, and by setting out with false Names, they at length get real ones, which are of great Service to them in carrying on their Frauds and well-disposed Persons are daily imposed upon by false Appearances of Distress. There are Persons in this Town who get a very good Livelihood by-writing Letters and Petitions of this Stamp, with which these Noblemen and Gentlemen, who are distinguished for their Generofity and Benevolence, are constantly tormented, and thele Wretches often obtain Relief for their false Diflreffes, whilst the really miserable suffer, from their Modefty, the acuteft Afflictions. A Woman fluffed up as if fhe was ready to lye-in, with two or three borrowed Children, and a Letter giving an Account of her Husband’s falling off a Scaffold and breaking his Limbs, or being drowned at Sea, &c. is an irrefiftable Object.

Laftly, The following Cautions to Inns and Livery-Stables may not be useless *, it is become a Trick for a Man to hire a Horle at one Place, and at his Return to London to put him up at another as his own, and to borrow Money at that Place, and then give Notice to the Owner of the Horse where he is.

As Persons coming to London in a Stage-Coach from a Distance, are desirous of getting into a Hackney Coach as soon as they can, they flop at the first Stand, which is generally near some Inn *, here the Sharpers attend, and by their pretending to be Porters, or by other Stratagems, frequently rob the Passengers of their Box or portmanteau; who being eager to

and trust too much to the Care of the Coachman. These fort of Sharpers also attend the unloading of Road Waggons, where Quantities of Goods are put into a Cart to be dispersed about Town ; this Cart they follow till they have an Opportunity of taking Something out of it, while the Carter or Porter is making some Enquiry ; a Man riding in these Carts would prevent these Robberies. Fattening Portmanteaus behind Post-Chaifes with Chains instead of Straps, will preserve them •, and Stable-keepers not letting their Saddle-Horses to Strangers, unless they bring some Persons with them known to the Stable-keeper, will prevent many Highway Robberies.

^ PLAN for the further Prevention cf Frauds and Felonies committed on Fradtj-men and Shop-keepers.

S Shop-keepers are more Subject to the Jd\ Inroads of Cheats and Thieves than other persons, from the Necefiity they are under of exposing their Goods in a publick Manner : and as the Expence and Loss of Time in Tro-feoutions, added to the Loss of their Goochs deters many from bringing inch Offenders to Justice, by which Lenity they are encouraged to continue their villainous Practices, to the Injury of Trade, it is apprehended that an Association of Tradesroen and Shop-keepers, under the following Restrictions, will, by rendering the Detection and Pimishment of the

laid Offenders more easy, be a great Security to Property, and deter evil-disposed People from fixing on Shop-keepers as the Objects of their Prey. Experience has proved the great Utility of the Subscription among the Merchants, for the preventing of Robberies on the Keys out of Ships, Lighters, &c. The Sub-fcriptions among the Nobility and Gentry for the Preservation of the Game, has also proved that the united Endeavours of many, when formed into a Body, by lessening the Expence of each Individual, is more likely to suppress a publick Evil, than each Man ading for him-felf; it is therefore proposed, That as many Tradesmen and Shop-keepers, as shall approve of this Plan, shall form themselves into a Society, by the Name and Title of A Society for the Security of Trader by bringing Cheats and Felons to Jufiice.

I. That out of the Society three Persons be chose as Treasurers, to whom all Subscriptions shall be paid once a Month by the Secretary.

II. That the Secretary keep a Book at his Eloufe for the Entry of the Names and Subscriptions, as they are paid in.

III. That out of the Lift of the Society, the Names of twelve Persons shall be taken according to their Seniority, the three firift of which shall be the Treasurers, as a Committee; this Committee to last tor a Year, and to execute the Bufintfs of the Society for that Year.

V. That the Solicitor (hall be impowered to difburfe such Money for the purfuing or ad-vertising such Offenders before they are taken, as the Magistrate shall direct; and that no Bill of this Kind shall be paid the said Solicitor, unless signed by the Magistrate.

VI. That the Money subscribed shall be paid into a Banker’s Hand, or into the Bank, from whence no Part of it shall be taken, but by a Draught signed By the three Persons appointed Treasurers for the Time being *, but the Solicitor shall always have 20/. in his Hands for immediate Use, to be accounted for.

VII. That the Committee shall meet once a Month, and be allowed 1 s. each for their Ex-pence*, and that any Member of the Society may be present at the fame Committee, but they shall not be allowed any Thing for their Expence, nor have any Vote in the .Business going forward, and not less than five of the Committee to be a Board.

VIII. The Chairmen of the said Committee shall take it by Turns according to their Seniority, as they (land on the Lift of Subscri-bers *, and the Day before the Meeting of such Committee, the Solicitor shall fend Notice to the twelve Members, and acquaint them whose Turn it is to be in the Chair.

IX. That a Register of the Prosecutions carried on by the said Society, shall be kept by the Secretary, containing a ftiort Abstraa of every Cafe, subject to the Examination of

X. That any Member of the Society, attended by the Solicitor, shall always be inti -tied to Mr. Fielding9s Opinion, gratis, on any Cafe relating to the said Society. No Person to be benefited by the Society that is not a Subscriber, or who shall defer the Payment of their second or any subsequent Subscription, more than a Month after it is due.

XI. That twice a Year, as many of the Society as think proper to attend, be called together by Means of an Advertisement put in the Paper a Week before the Day of the Meeting, in Order to hear the Transactions of the Society, together with the Bills of Prole -cution, read over; at which Times only, new Laws for the Government of the Society (hall be proposed and confirmed by the Consent of the Majority of the Members then present.

OFFICE of Constable. * *

To the High Conjiables and Petit Constables of the County of Middle-fex and City and Liberty of Westminster.

Gentlemen,

* gT"^ H E late Henry Fielding, who for some 9 Time executed the important Office JIL of principal acting Magistrate for the County of Middlesex and City and Liberty of U^eftminster^ fo much to his own Honour and fo much to the Advantage of his Country, observing from daily Experience the great Difficulties and Dangers to which the Peace Officers were exposed in the Execution of their Office, either from the desperate Behaviour of Felons, the Cunning of Cheats, or what is worse than both, the Attacks of litigious Persons under the Influence and Directions of R 3 the

the lowed of Attornies, who are ready on all Occasions to point out any Irregularity committed by a Peace Officer, and to make their Advantage of it, to the Injury, nay, often to the Ruin of the Officer, resolved to draw up and publiffi a plain and complete Account of the Office of Constable, which he begun, but by a lingering Illness, which put a Period to his valuable Life, he was prevented from perfecting this useful Work; and as several Constables have of late subjected themselves to Prosecutions from Errors in their Judgment, I have carefully collected and reviled the Observations found among my Brother’s Manuscripts on this Subject, and have made such Additions as may possibly render the Work more useful, though I am far from offering it to the Publick as a perfect Treatise; yet if it should be the Means in any Respedl of rendering the Office of Constable more easy and intelligible, or of preventing either Trouble to, or the Prosecution of any Peace Officer, it will fully answer my Purpose ; for though I am fenfible there are already very useful Tradts of this fort, yet I think they cannot have too many Guides to direct them, provided they are fo perfect as not to miflead, as their Office is only for a Year, a Time much too short for them to be thoroughly acquainted with the Nature of their Duty. And here I mull beg Leave to put those Gentlemen, who have the Honour to be chosen into this important Office, in Mind of the Dignity and consequence of their Station ; for if the feve-ral Pligh Constables are active, diligent and attentive in their Duty, carefully iaftrudl, and

live in Harmony with the Petit Constables, Peace and good Order mud ensue in this Metropolis. Constables are selected from the Inhabitants as able and reputable Men to execute this Trust, which is not reposed in them, without their being first bound by a fo-lemn Oath well and truly to serve the Lid Office, which though troublesome, and often dangerous, is very honourable. In Westminster there are fourfcore Constables ; in the adjoining Parts of the County of Middlesex there are more ; these two Bodies united by Harmony, strengthened by a just Sense of their Duty, and well instructed, encouraged and supported by the Magistracy, become a formidable Body, Hews the Civil Power in its true and proper Light, and will ever be capable of suppressing Evils of the most dangerous Nature. But nothing can conduce fo much to the preventing of Evils of every Kind arising to any con-fiderable Height, as the Care and Attention of each individual Constable in his own Ward. Here he may observe Mischiefs and Breaches of the Laws on their nr ft Appearance, and by proper Notices, friendly Persuasions, necessary Informations before the Magistrate, or by Preferment before the Grand Inquest when he makes his Returns, which last ought most con-feientiously to be done without Favour or Affection, he may stop fhe Evil in its Infancy, and prevent the Repetition of it from confirming it into Habit, when it will be more difficult, if not impossible, to suppress it; for I should not do Justice, if I did not declare, that a great Number of Inhabitants, who have been fum-moned before me for buffering Gaming and

other Breaches of the Laws, the Moment they were acquainted with the Illegality and evil Tendency of such their Practices, immediately put a Stop to them without forcing the Magi-strate to the disagreeable Necessity of executing a Penal Law. If a Constable has a due Regard for Religion, the Oath he takes to do his Duty will have a proper Influence on his Conduct. If he considers the Respect that is due to the Laws of his Country, he will never connive at the Breach of any of them ; and if he executes his Office with Diligence, Candour and Humanity, he will secure to himself the Confidence of the People, (Lengthen his own Authority, and be esteemed a valuable, useful and worthy Member of Society. To which I (hall only beg Leave to add one Observation, that where Warrants are executed in this Metropolis, on Complaints of a trivial Nature, the Constable should always give his Prisoner Time to bring some of his Friends with him before the Ma-gistrate, as this may prevent the Malice of Prosecutors; but where Cheats and Felons are apprehended, they should be immediately carried before a Justice of the Peace, as a Moment’s Delay may prevent Discoveries of the greatest consequence, and give Accomplices Time to secrete themselves and their stolen Goods. And to prevent Escapes and Rescues in the Streets, it is always prudent to put such Prison into a Flackney Coach, the Expence of which I (hall ever be ready to defray, and at all Times rejoice as well to give my Advice and Assistance to any Peace Officer who (hall think proper to afk it, as to furnish him by Night or Day with every Degree of 1 Protection

The Office Constable.

Its Origin,

A

ON THE OFFICE of Constable.

H E Office of a Constable, whether 8 we agree with my Lord Coke in the

M Derivation of the Word, or with the

less honourable Etymology of Dr. Cowell, is certainly of great Antiquity in this Kingdom.

Antiently there was a very high Officer of State, under the Denomination of the Lord Constable; and several other Officers there are at this Day who are fo called ; as the Constable of the <Toweri &c. but with such we concern not ourselves in this Treatise, in which we intend only to speak of thole Officers, who are at present known by the Name of High and Petit Constables.

Both these Officers were at Common Law in the Time the *Saxons. The best Account of their Original is given by Fineitx, in the Book of 12 H. 7. who makes them as old as the Division of Counties into Hundreds, and again of these Hundreds into Boroughs or Towns;

over

251

over the latter of which were placed the Petit Constables, as the High Constables were over the former, (a)

As well the Petit as the High Constable, were, by their Offices, Conservators of the Peace at the Common Law, within the Limits of their Hundreds, Towns, Tithings and Boroughs; (b) and their Authority is as antient as the Toms or Courts Leet; and did not, as some have supposed, begin in the Times of Edw. 3. (c) nor even by the Statute of Whichever made in the 13th Year of Edw. 1. * * And what that Statute ordains concerning Constables, is to be understood in Affirmance of the Common Law. (d).

This Statute of Winchester appoints two Constables to be chosen in every Hundred or Franchise; but gives no farther Direction.

Mr. Dalton thinks that these were the High Constables of Hundreds; but this seems to combat with the Opinion of Fineux before-mentioned, which Dalton himself a little afterwards cites and approves.

(a) Dalt. c. 28. [h) Dalt. c. 1. c. 28. (c) 4lnft. 265. (d) Dalt. c. 28.

* This is inexcusable Ignorance; for Constables are mentioned before this Time in Weflm. 1. c. 1 q. in which Statute he is placed between the Under Sheriff and the Bailiffs of Fee. So that there were then, faith Lord Coke in his Notes on that Statute (2 Inft. 190) Constables in Fee who had the keeping of Prisons. Though, perhaps, the Woids of Fee ought only to be coupled to the Word Bailiffs; and means no more than the Bailiffs of Franchises; and this agrees best with the Context in the laid Statute.

The

252 A ’Trecitife on the Office of Constable.

How chosen. The Constables of Hundreds, or the High

Constables, were at first chosen and sworn, as appears in the Sheriff’s Torn (a); but in the Time of Mr. Dalton, they were usually chosen at the Sessions, or by the Majority of the Ju-ftices of the Division, and were either sworn at the Sessions or by Warrant from the Sessions. A cause, he fays, which was often allowed and commended by the Judges of Assize {b).

And in the same manner as they are chosen, they are upon fit cause to be removed from their Office (V).

The High Constables, by their original In-fhitutions, were to take View of Armour twice every Year, and to present before the Ju(dices, the Defaults of Armour, of Watches, of Highways, and of Hue and Cries, and also such as lodged Strangers, for whom they could not answer {d).

Constables of Hundreds are compellable to attend at the Aftizes, and present Offenders upon Oath; but not fo at the Quarter-Sefiions «•

By the Common Law, fays the Lord Coke, the Constables are to be chosen at the Leet or Torn (f). In some Books, it is said, that the Constables are to be chosen by the Sheriff; and in others by the Decennary; but it is agreed, that he must be then sworn into his Office by the Sheriff: But where there is a Court-Leet, this Power of chusing Constables

seems to belong to the Lord of that Leet *, and such, fays Mr. Hawkins, must be under-stood to have been the Sense of the Makers of that Statute in 13 6? 14 Car. 2. (a).

Writers agree in giving to Justices of Peace a Power to appoint a Constable in Default of the Lord, at his Leet, or of the Sheriff at his Torn, before the Statute of 13 14 Car. 2.

And this Power seems to have the Sanction of Time, though it may be, perhaps, difficult to shew from what legal Authority it was at first derived.

And not only when the Leet have failed to appoint a Constable, but where unable or unfit Persons have been chosen, the Justices of Peace have interfered and have removed them, (b) So if a Constable die or remove out of the Parish, and the Time of the Leet be far off, his Place is to be supplied by the Sessions; and if they be not near, by the next Justices.

This Jurisdiction the Justices exercised at Common Law; but now the Statute (reciting, that whereas the Laws and. Statutes for the apprehending of Rogues and Vagabonds have not been duly executed, sometimes for Want of Officers, by Reason Lords of Manors do not keep Court-Leets every Year for the making them) enadls, That in cafe any Constable, Head-borough or Tythingman, shall die or go out of the Parish, any two Justices of the Peace may make and swear a new Constable, Head-borough or Tythingman, till the said Lord shall hold a Court, or till the next Quarter-

Sessions, who shall approve of the said Officers fo made and sworn as aforesaid, or appoint others as they shall think fit. And if any Officer shall continue above a Year in his or their Office, that then in such cafe the Judices of the Peace in their Quarter-Sessions may discharge such Officers, and may put another fit Person in his or their Place, till the Lord of the said Manor shall hold a Court as aforesaid.

And if in Default of holding Courts-Leet, they continue above a Year, they may be dif-charged at the Sessions, and others put in (a).

If Leets choose unable or unfit Petit Con-flables, it is a good cause of the Forfeiture of the Leet. And upon a Complaint to the Af-sizes or Sessions, the Justices of the Peace shall be authorized to choose new ones.

Since the Statute, therefore, it is clear that two Justices of Peace may, in Default of the Lord of the Leet, make and swear a new Constable, &c. But this is a special Authority, and must be strictly purfued ^ and therefore an Order of Sessions, reciting a Complaint made by the Petit Constables of A. that they had served above a Year, and that at a Leet holden for the Manor of B. these Constables with the Homage presented D. E. F. G. four able Persons of the Town of A. in Order that two might be nominated, &c. and that the Steward refused to nominate them, &c. but continued the Complainants in their said Offices; and upon Examination of the said

{a) Dalt. c. 28.

Complainants on Oath, the Sessions discharged them, and appointed D. and E. Petit Confta-bles of the said Town for the Year ensuing, or till others are legally appointed. This Order was quashed by the whole Court, because the Sessions have not purfued the Restriction of the Statute by appointing the said Constables till the Lord (hall hold a Court (a).

By the Statute of Hen. 8. {b) two Justices of the Peace (one Quorum) shall appoint and name in every Hundred within the Limits of their Com million, two sufficient Gentlemen or Yeomen, to be Chief Constables of the Hundred wherein they inhabit, which Chief Constables are to have the fame Power with High Constables of Hundreds in England.

A Custom in a Town that the Inhabitants shall serve the Office of a Constable by Turns, according to the Situation of their several Houses, hath been allowed to be good of later Times (c) though there are antient Authorities to the contrary (d).

No Man is qualified to be a Constable who Who shall be is not an Inhabitant of the Place for which he is chosen. to serve that Office (e).

Nor is every Inhabitant a fit Person to be chosen into this Office. He ought, faith Mr.

Dalton, to be of the abler fort of Parishioners $ and if a very ignorant or poor Person be chosen, he may, by Law, be discharged, and an abler Person placed in his room (f).

A 'Treatise on the Office of Constable.

Persons qualified to be Constables, are not absolutely excused from taking upon themselves that Office, by being of the Rank of Gentlemen (tho5 of Quality, faith Dalton) ; nor will the Profeffion of a Physician excuse them •, yet, if there be other sufficient Persons within the District, they will poftibly have Relief in the King's Bench: But a sworn Attorney of any Court in Westminster Hall may be discharged by a Writ of Privilege, even though he were chosen by reason of his Estate according to the Custom, &c. for he is obliged to give his Attendance on his Court. And for like Reason it hath been adjudged, that an Alderman of London cannot be chosen Constable; for, that as Alderman, he is bound to be present in the City for the good Government thereof (a).

By two Statutes made in the Reign of Hen. 8. the Wardens and Fellowship of the Mystery of Surgeons, are exempt from the Offices of Constables, Watch, &c. provided they do not exceed the Number of twelve ; and the Prefi-dent and Fellows of the College of Physicians are not to be chosen Constables, nor 2ny other Officers in London, nor in the Suburbs of the fame (h).

It hath been held, that all the Surgeons in England are within the Equity of the former Statute ; but that the Privilege arising from the latter, is confined to those Physicians who are Fellows of the College.

Refufing to If a Person duly elected refuses to be sworn, be sworn. he may be indicted either before Justices of the

Peace at their Sedlons, or before Justices of Oyer and 'Terminer (a)-, or if lie be prefenr, he may be fined by the Court before whom he is to be sworn; or upon a Presentment of his Refusal, with all proper Circumstances, the Court may amerce him. But the Indictment is the more usual Way ; and in such Indibi.ment it is necelury to fet out specially the manner of the Election, Appointment, Notice and Refusal (b).

If a Confcable, lawfully choffin, refuses to be sworn, one Juffiice may bind him over to the Sessions; but he cannot commit him till he will take on him the Office {c).

Where any Person is duly appointed to the Office of Conihible, and die Steward, Ac. refuses to swear him; or where one, having a Right to be privileged from serving this Office, is elecfed, he may, in either (. ale, be r iffived* by applying to the Court of King’s Bench.

It hath been refoived. That a Constable may make a Deputy, because, as Mr. Crompton lavs, he may be sick; but the better Reason is, because it is a Ministerial Office. And yet, faith Dcltofty some have held that this is rather by Toleration than by Law (d).

And here I shall endeavour to lay down every Point in the plainest and cleared Manner •, so as to be intelligible to aim oft every Capacity.

The Office of a Constable is two-fold :

2. Ministerial, or relative to the Justices of the Peace, Coroners, Sheriffs, &c. (a)

Fir ft then of his original Power. By 'this he is,

1. To arrest all Persons, who in his Presence are guilty of any Treason or Felony.

2. If a grievous Wound, from which there is apparent Danger of Death, be given in his Presence, he is to arrest the Offender (b). And in either of these Cafes he may break open Doors, if denied Entrance, and if the guilty Person be there (c). Again in these Cafes he may jufifty killing the Offender, if he flies or refills, fo that he cannot otherwise be apprehended ; but this he ought never to do when the Offenders may be otherwise taken (d).

3. He may arrest any one whom he shall see going about to commit a Treason or Felony, or any other Act which would manifellly endanger the Life of another (e). And therefore, if a Man leave an Infant in the Cold,

Note however, that there can be no Affray without an actual Breach of the Peace, as Weapons drawn. Blows struck or attempted, &c.

1. That a Felony was actually done ; for this is issuable in an Action of false Imprisonment, &c. (a).

2. That the Person from whom he receives his Information was actually present at the Felony committed; for the Justification is, that the Constable did aid A in taking the Party suspected {b). And an Information at the fe-cond Hand is too remote and dangerous.

3. The Constable ought to be well satisfied that the cause of Suspicion is a good one. And such Circumstances and Caufts of Suspicion may appear on the Examination, (tho* this cannot be on Oath) that the Information, fays Lord Hale, may carry over the Suspicion even to the Constable, whereby it may become his Suspicion as well as the Suspicion of A. (e).

And it behoves the Constable to act with great Discretion in this Matter; for as on the one Hand, if the cause of Suspicion was light and trivia]; if the Party informing was not himself prefenf; but principally, if the Felony was not actually committed, the Constable will be in Danger of answering in an Action : Soon the other Hand, if he should be remifs and negligent in his Duty, or refuse to arrest a Felon, where the above Circumstances all concur, he will be liable to be very fevercly pu-nished for his Omiftion •, for.

But in case of an Affray where no dangerous Affray. Wound is given, if the Constable be not him-felf prefenr, I hold it too dangerous for him to arrest the Party on an Information after the Affray is over, even though the Informer should alledge that he is in Danger of his Life; for in such cafe, though some Resolutions seem to favour it, yet there are many on the other Side (b).

If an Affray be in a House whereby there Affray in a is a Likelihood of Bloodfhed, and the Doors JI°uk. of the Lloufe are shut, if the Constable of the Vill having Notice thereof demand Entrance, and they within not only refuse to open the Doors, but continue the Affray, the Constable may break open the Doors to keep the Peace and prevent the Danger (c).

And if the Affray be begun without Doors, and the Affrayers fly into another Man’s House, the Constable on fresh Pursuit may break open the House and apprehend them [e). But this I apprehend must be understood only of violent Affrays, and where some great Hurt hath been clone.

So if the Affrayers fly into another County, the Constable may pursue them into another County, and apprehend and carry them before a Justice of Peace of that County (a). If they fly into a Franchise in the same County, the Constable may pursue them into the Franchise, and take them out of it (b).

Constables have an express Power given them to execute this A 61, by the A6t itfeif.

In this A61, faith my Lord Coke, there are three special Exceptions ; and these fuffi-ciently appear above; but the Law, faith he, maketh another Exception ; for any Man may ufe Force to defend his House, and may af-femble his Friends and Neighbours to keep it against those who come to rob or to kill him, or to offer him any Violence therein *, but he cannot assemble Force to go with him to Church or Market, or any other Place, for that is prohibited by the Adi (a).

And in Easter Term 39 Eliz. it was resolved by all the Judges, that not only every Justice of the Peace, Sheriff and other Minister, but every other Subject of the King, may arm themselves to refill Riots, Rebellions or pub-lick Diffurbers of the Peace and Quiet of the Realm ; but the Judges there recommended it as the more difereet Way for every one in Rich a Cafe to attend and be afliftant to the Justices, Sheriffs or other Ministers of the King in doing it (b).

and for the Arrestment of such Strangers, none shall be punished.

By 5 E. 3. c. 14. the foregoing is briefly recited, and it is farther enacted, That because there hath been divers Manslaughters, Felonies and Robberies, done in Time pair, by People that be called * Roberdfmen, Waiters and Drawlatches, it is accorded, that if any Man have any evil Suspicion of such, be it by Day or by Night, they shall be incontinently arrdted by the Constables of the Towns.

Upon these Statutes it hath been held, that Night-walk-it is lawful to arrefl: a Night-walker, at aers-prohibited Time of Night, though no Felony hath been committed (a).

In an Action of Trespass of Afiaulf, Battery Bawdy-houses. and false Imprisonment at Dale, the Defendant pleaded, that one Alice kept a House in the said Town of Dale, and kept suspicious Persons in it, to wit, a common Bawdy-house, and the Plaintiff often retorted to the said House suspiciously with Women of evil Fame,

Night, and found him suspiciously in the said Place, by Force of which they took him and put him in Ward, which is the fame Afthulr, Battery and Imprisonment for which the A&ion is brought. This was held a good Justiftcation by all the Justices-, for they said it is lawful for every Constable to arrest suspected Persons who walk by Night and deep by Day, or who keep suspicious Company. And if they cannot of themselvLS arrest them, they may demand the Assistance of others, and they are by Law obliged to assist them (a).

In all the Cafes above-mentioned, and in some which follow hereafter, the Constable may arrest the Party without any Warrant.

And yet the Advice given by Lord Hale, viz. If the Time and Nature of the Facl, and the Condition of Things will bear it, to complain to a Justice of the Peace and have his Warrant for apprehending the Criminal, will be very wifely followed by the Constable as often as he possibly canj for by such Means he will be put to much less Difficulty in his Justification.

But it must be likewise observed, That in all the Cafes before recited, and especially with Regard to the apprehending of Felons, he is obliged to perform his Duty without any Warrant, and will be punishable for Neglect of it. He must therefore take Care that no Mischief intervene, nor any Felon escape by his waiting for the Authority of the Justice.

A second Manner in which Persons are to Hue and Cry, be -arrested by the Constable, is by Hue and Cry •, which, as the Words import, is a pub-lick Alarm railed after the Felon ov^r the whole County, and sometimes, faith the Statute of Winchester, over two, three or four Counties, when the Felony is committed near the Borders.

This Process lay at Common Law, and is mentioned by Bratton, (a). It is enforced

likewise by many Statutes :

1. By Winton, c. 9. All are to be ready at the Summons of the Sheriff, and the Cry of the County, to arrest Felons as well within Franchises as without, on the Pain of being indicted and fued.

2. By 4 A. 1. Hue and Cry is to be levied for all Murders, Burglaries, Men flain, or in Peril of being (lain, and all are to follow it.

3. By the Statute of TVinton, c. 1. on Robberies and Felonies, fresh Suit shall be made from Town to Town, and from County to County ; and by c. 4. Hue and Cry is ordered to be railed on such as will not obey the Arrest of the Town where Night-walkers pass, and for arresting such Strangers, none shall be puniftied.

And though the Warrant itself hath been sgainft Law, yet the Officer hath been allowed Co justify under it (a).

Mr. Lambard, speaking of the Power of a Justice of Peace, faith, If he make any Warrant, though it be beyond his Authority, yet is it not disputable by a Constable or other inferior Mini-fter, but mu ft be obeyed. Lamb. 67 and 94.

And Brudenell, in the Book of Hen. 8. fi4 H. 8. 16. a), tho* he denied the Authority of the Justice to make the Warrant, admits that the Officer who executed it, could not be punished *, for every Justice of Peace, fays he, is a Judge of Record, and he hath a Seal of his Office^ and when he makes a Warrant under his Seal to the Officer, now the Officer ought to give Credit to the Seal*, for this is his Authority, and being but an Officer, he can no more dispute the Authority of the Judge than the Sheriff can ours.

If a Felon, after he is arrested, escape into another County, the Constable may pursue and take him by virtue of his Warrant*, but if he escape before the Arrest, the Constable ought to pursue him into the other County by Hue and Cry. But if the Warrant be only for a Misdemeanor, and the Offender escape out of the County before he is arrested, the Constable cannot puifue him; yet even in this Cafe, if he escape after the Arrest, he may be purfued and re-taken on fresh Suit (a).

The Constable must execute the Warrant himself, and cannot make a Deputy as a Sheriff may ; but he may charge others to his Af-fiftance (bj.

A Constable, being a known Officer in the Vill, need not shew his Warrant, tho’ it be demanded; but it is reasonable for him to acquaint the Party for what cause he arrests him—As I arrest you for Felony, &c. (c).

But if the Warrant be directed to a private Person, as it may be, and he (as he may) arrests the Party thereon, he is bound to produce his Warrant in cafe it be demanded, other-wife not (d).

A Warrant of a Justice of Peace to arrest for Felony, may be executed in a Franchise within the County ; for it is the King’s Suit, in which a non omittas is virtually included (e).

or upon Suspicion of Felony, if the Felon be in his own House (a).

So, and a fortiori, if he be in the House of another, (for here the Sheriff may do it on a civil Process) but this is at his Peril that the Felon be there ; for otherwise he will be guilty of a Trespass (b).

Upon a Warrant to search for stolen Goods, Search War* the Constable likewise may break open therant*

Doors, if they be shut, and upon Demand made, those within refuse to open them (c) ; yet note, my Lord Hale here seems doubtful if the Goods were not there. In which he only fays, it seems the Officer is excused ; and in another Place he expressy fays, on such Warrant I think the Doors cannot be broke open (d),

Upon a Warrant of the Peace, the Confta- Peace War* ble may break open the Doors (e); but thisran£> must be understood where Security of the Peace is required, and not in case of an A {fault or any common Breach of the Peace.

Yet it is to be noted, that if the outward Breaking opes Door be open, the Constable in any cafe may Doors, justify breaking the inward Door ; for fo may the Sheriff or his Bailiff, thos the Process be without a non cmittas (f).

and cannot otherwise take him (a)• And this* as hath been seen before, he might have done, in case of an Arrest, virtute officii, or by Hue and Cry.

The fame Law is it if in Truth he were no Felon, but yet a Warrant is against him on Suspicion of Felony, and he, having Notice thereof, flies and refifts* for the Officer or Minister must pursue his Warrant, or other-wife he is punishable; and the Party by his Flight or Refiftance is acceflfary to his own Death (b).

But in this cafe the Officer must be extremely cautious, and in his Juflification it ought to appear.

That he was a lawful Officer ; for though a private Person may arrest a Felon, and if he flies, fo that he cannot otherwise be taken, the killing will be excufable; yet this is at his Peri], viz. that the Party be really a Felon; for if he be innocent of the Felony, the killing, at leaji before the Arrest9 seems at least Man-slaughter, for the Reason above given, for an innocent Person is not bound to take Notice of a private Person’s Suspicion (c).

Hence it follows, that if, in such cafe, the cause were really not within the Cognizance of the Justice, the Arrest would be illegal, and the Officer liable to an Action of false Imprisonment.

A Warrant obtained after the Arrest will not justify the preceding Arrest by Authority of that Warrant.

Vffiich Peace Officers have, of old Time, been Veiled, as they are none of them necessary to be used, and must, if used, subject the Officers to great Hazard in the Nicety of their Execution. But till the Constable can conveniently carry the Prisoner before a Justice, he may in all Cafes justify detaining him in some fafe Place, as in the Stocks; or if there be no Stocks in his Vill, he may carry him to the Stocks in the Vill adjacent; or he may detain him in any other Place of Custody, as his or their Quality requireth, fays Mr. Dalton, c. i.

/ 7-

The Constable may carry his Prisoner before Sped what Justice of the Peace he pleases, (for this rant, is at his Election and not at the Prisoner’s) unless the Warrant be special, and may be to bring him before that Justice only who granted it. Dalt. c. 28. f 4.

This is, however, rarely done; and the usual Way especially in Middlesex and Weft-fninster, is to detain the Prisoner, if he be ar-rested by Night, in the Watch-house ; or if by-Day, either in some publick House, or in the Constable’s own House, till the Witnesses are ready to go together before the Justice. And this seems well enough, and, indeed, a much more eligible Method than to fet the Prisoner in the Stocks, which would be exposing them to Shame and Punishment before it can be known whether he is guilty or not.

But by the Statute-of 22 & 23 Car. 2. c. 20. it is enacted, That if any Under-Sheriff, Bailiff, Serjeant at Mace, or other Officer or Minister whatsoever, shall convey, cr e.rjfe to be conveyed, any Persons in their Custody, by Virtue

Constables are the proper Officers to a Justice of Peace, as Sheriffs are to the higher Courts of Justice; and they as well as Headboroughs, Tythingmen and other Officers of the Peace, are obliged to execute the Warrants either generally or specially, directed to them by the Justices of the Peace : And when the Warrant is lawfully granted for a Matter within the Ju-rifdiction of the Justice, they may always safely execute it in a legal manner.

But to conclude: An attentive Regard to the following general Observations on the Duty of a Constable, it is apprehended, will be of Use :

First then, let them be industrious to acquaint themselves with the Powers given them as Peace Officers by the Common Law, the Statutes, and by the Warrants of Magistrates. Let them exert this Authority with Ca-ution, Integrity, and Moderation ; considering well before they deprive any Subjed of his Liberty. When they have taken any Person in Custody, let Safety, Humanity, and an expeditious Conveyance before the Magistrate, be their chief Consideration; for voluntary Escapes are Impeachments of a Constable’s Integrity, and lay him under the odious Suspicion of Corruption. Harfhness and Severity co Prison, call the Officer’s Humanity in Question. Delay in going before a Magistrate, and entering into flie Merits of the Complaint, is often the Occasion of Oppreftion, and sometimes makes the Officer liable to become the Instrument of the Prosecutoi’s Malice; for, as he cannot administer an Oath, he is liable to be imposed

on :

rA Treat fe on the Office of Constable.

bn 5 and a Constable is to remember, that he is to apprehend Offenders and not to determine Offences; that being the Office of the Magi-strate only, before whom every Prisoner taken Jnto Custody for any Offence should be carried, in the Officer’s Justification, who cannot other-wife discharge him with Safety. Support your Office with Spirit, but never ufe any indecent Language, or any ways insult your Prisoner, and never strike but on the utmost Necessity; For whenever you meet with Difficulty or Re-fiftance in the Execution of your Office, charge the Standers-by in the King’s Name to aid and assist you, and, if possible, those whose Names you know; for on their Refusal they are liable to be indicted.

Thus you may multiply your own Power as often as you may find necessary, and Occasion requires.

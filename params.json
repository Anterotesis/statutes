Right now, the former contains the text of some of the volumes of Pickering's Statues At Large; the latter the whole run of Ruffhead's similarly named series. The text has been OCR'd, using Abbyy FineReader 12,  from scanned volumes, and is in the process of being run through word checking and normalizing software. Check the folders and the changelogs for more detail and current status.\r\n\r\n",

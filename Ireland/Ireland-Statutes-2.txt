And because there are several persons who pretend themselves able to discover much land which is detained and concealed by the adventurers and souldiers, their heirs or afiigns, by false admeasurement, although it be probable that after fo long a trad of time such difeoveries may not produce any great effect; nevertheless, for the avoiding the scandal of such frauds, and to give just satisfaction to all persons and interests, who may pretend themselves to be prejudiced by such concealments, beit enacted by the authority aforesaid.

4. Where any new survey is ordered, the same shall be taken by two surveyors to be chosen for that purpose, one by the informer, the other by the defendants, and both surveyors shall be sworn.

$. Where the books of diftribudon and the Down survey agree in the satisfactions, which have been allotted to any regiments, troops, societies or persons, or do not differ more than in one tenth, there no refurvey shall be ordered* notwith(landing such information.

6. What overplus soever (hail appear upon the new survey, if the same exceed not one tenth part of what Is due to the defendant or defendants, no retrenchment shall be made.

7 If the overplus exceed a tenth, it shall be lawful to and for such defendant or defendants possessed of the overplus, to retrench the same where they think fir, fo as such retrenchments be contiguous, and of unprofitable land together with the profitable, but is hereby discharged of all accompts for the meafn profits of the lands fo retrenched .

Whereas foiue lots for Satisfying the army fell in a good and bad county or barony, such as Kerry arid Liirve-rick, and Dowhallow and <Orrery, and whereas the fool-diers, before they came fo a particular dividend Of their general lot, did mutually content, that when a Jot ftooild fall in a had county “or hafony, the perforii, to whom it there fell, (hould have more acres, and when it fell in a good county, they mould-have Jess acre$, or that the acres in the bad county (hould fcavc a lei* rate or Iraida fet on

11. No defendant or defendants, whose lots are not to be found within the books of distribution, books of debentures, or books of Grocers-hall, shall be liable to any new survey or readmeafurement, his evidences being loft.

Twelfthly and lastly, all proceedings in order to a new survey or readmeafurement, which shall not be finiftied and perfected within nine months next after passing this act, ft all cease and be void, and the defendant to be discharged of all such inquiries for concealments upon such informations.

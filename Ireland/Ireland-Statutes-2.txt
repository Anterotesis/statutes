And because there are several persons who pretend themselves able to discover much land which is detained and concealed by the adventurers and souldiers, their heirs or assigns, by false admeasurement, although it be probable that after so long a trad of time such discoveries may not produce any great effect; nevertheless, for the avoiding the scandal of such frauds, and to give just satisfaction to all persons and interests, who may pretend themselves to be prejudiced by such concealments, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid.

$. Where the books of diftribudon and the Down survey agree in the satisfactions, which have been allotted to any regiments, troops, societies or persons, or do not differ more than in one tenth, there no resurvey shall be ordered* notwithstanding such information.

6. What overplus soever shall appear upon the new survey, if the same exceed not one tenth part of what Is due to the defendant or defendants, no retrenchment shall be made.

and conforming him, her, or themselves to the church of Ml the pare* Ireland as by law aftablished, it shall and may be lawful for

the high court of Chancery, upon a bill founded upon this of real and per-a€t, to oblige the said popish parent or parents, to discover foo*! dUto, upon oath the full value of all his, her, or their estate, as weH personal as real, clear over and above all real incumbrances and bebts contracted bona side for valuable consider-

afion before the enrolment of such certificate, and thereupon to make such order for the support and maintenance and an order of ftfch protestant child or children, by the distribution ma^c for

of the said real and personal estate to and among such pro-£*inunADCC' teflant child or children, for the present support of such 2^protestant child or childreri, and also to and for the portion

or portions, arid future maintenance or maintenances, of such protestant child or children, after1 the decease of such popish parent or parents, as the said court findl judge fit; by tvhich* order the real and personal estate of such popish parent shall be charged with such portion and portions, future maintenance and maintenances, and support, from the time of the enrolment of such certificate as aforesaid, notwithstanding NotwiA-tny fraudulent gift or sale, or voluntary disposition, or any voluntary charge or incumbrance by statute staple, judg- nr^|f ment, bond, devise, or otherwise made, entered into, acknowledged, foffered or done, after the enrolment in the high court of Chancery of the certificate aforesaid: provided that such order and distribution among the protestant Such order children of such popish parent shall not exceed one third not part of the personal and real estate, for the maintenance parent* life and support of such protestant child or children during the life of such popish parent.

make their estate real and personal appear small and of little value, in order to deprive such of their children, as shaft become proteftanta, of a reasonable support and maintenance, and such devices are earned on and concealed with so much fubtility, that it is difficult to discover the same, so that the lord chancellor, lord keeper, or coirttnissioners of the great feai, not htfvfngf the truth of tfre matter laid before him or them, may often decree lets I portio*

That notwithstanding any such decree made up or enrolled, it shall and may be lawful for the high court of Chancery from time to time, upon a new bill or bills founded upon this act, to encrease or augment such portion or portions, maintenance or maintenances, formerly decreed or allowed to such protestant child or children of such popish parent or parents, according to the value of the estate real or personal of such parent or parents at the time of such new bill or bills preferred.

An Act to explain amt amend the ABs for the Encouragement, of the Eijheries of this kingdom, and for promoting the good Ends proposed by said Laws.

WHEREAS great national bounties are granted for the purpose of encouraging the fisheries of this kingdom, but by experience it has been found that considerable frauds have been practised in obtaining the fame; and whereas a doubt has been entertained whether the commissioners of his Majesty's revenue are authorized tn pay the said bounties in cases where the vessel in the course of her fishing voyage shall founder at sea, or by distress of weather be driven on shore, and wrecked, by reason that the re-quifites prescribed to be done on the return of said vessel after the fishing season, cannot be complied with, to remove such doubts, and for the better encouragement of persons to engage in said flfiieries notwithstanding the risks that may attend the fame: be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That where any vessel on her fishing voyage, shall founder at sea, or by distress and hardship of weather be forced on shore and wrecked, or that from unavoidable misfortunes the requisites prescribed by the said acts cannot be performed, it shall and may be lawful for the commissioners of his Majesty's revenue, upon satisfactory proof thereof, to order payment of the said bounty to the owners of said vessels; or in case of their being loft, to the legal representatives of laid owners.

II. And whereas the principal season for taking herrings on the coast of this kingdom, is during the months of November and December, in which months, owing to tempestuous weather, the fishermen are frequently prevented from fishing for many nights in the week, and as the law now Hands are prohibited from shooting their nets on Saturday night: therefore be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from henceforth it shall and may be lawful for the said fishermen to llioot their nets, and filli on every night in the week, during said lifliing season on said coasts: provided the boats which go out on Saturday night, return into port early on Sunday morning.

III. And whereas contrary to the intent of said aits, bounties have been fraudulently obtained by persons not resident in this kingdom, and who therefore cannot be punished for frauds prac.

IV. And whereas many mailers of fishing vessels are incapable of writing and keeping journals; for remedy whereof, be it cn-acted by the authority aforesaid, That to intitle him to the bounty, the owner or mailer of every fishing vessel, as he shall proceed to fish, shall at all such times have amongst the number of hands and men by any law now required, one person on board of the age of fourteen years at least, who shall keep the rough journal of said vessel, and shall within eight days transcribe the lame into the fair journal, to be sworn to, and returned by the matter; any law or statlitc to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

V. And for the better encouragement of the curing of red herrings, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That for every barrel of full red herrings, containing thirty two gallons, which shall be exported from any port in Ireland; by any person or persons to any parts beyond the fcas, there shall be paid one shilling and nine pence.; and for every barrel of clean lliotten herrings, containing thirty two gallons, one shilling, and so in proportion for a linaller quantity; said bounty to be paid in like manner, and under the fame regulations, as the bounties are payable by the laws now in force for granting bounties on the export of fish caught on the coasts of this kingdom, or within thirty five leagues of the same.

VI. And whereas it is necessary for the better encouragement of persons to erect (lores and buildings for the curing and preserving the fish, and also to build houses for accommodating the people employed in fiiid business to give them permanent tenures in the grounds on which buildings necessary to accommodate such people may he built: and whereas such improvements mutt be of great benefit to the cllates on which they arc made, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful to and for all persons who are seized in fee tail, or for life, with remain-

An Act for the Relief of the several Persons intercjled in the Ship Vriendfcap, and her Cargo, which were captured by Two British Privateers, and brought as a Prize into the Port of Cork, in the Year One thousand seven hundred and seventy nine.

J!.Pirtd. ttt I-IEREAS two British privateers in the year one thousand seven hun-W dred and seventy nine, captured a ship called the Vriendfcap on her voyage from Rotterdam to the island of Saint Euftatius, and brought the said ship as a prize into the port of Cork in this kingdom, and the cargo of the said ship, which consisted of a great variety of goods, were shortly after the arrival of the said ship in the said port, landed and lodged in his Majesty's stores: and whereas a considerable part of the said cargo is not by the laws of this realm admissible to an entry in any of his Majesty's custom-houses in this kingdom, and other parts thereof are admissible to an entry only upon the payment of large foreign duties which exceed in amount the value of such goods: and whereas the said ship and cargo were shortly after being captured as aforesaid claimed before the court of admiralty in Great Britain, and after a very long course of proceedings being had in the said court, the said ship and cargo were condemned in the payment of the said captors costs and the charges by them expended thereon, for the payment of which costs and charges the said ship was fold, but the produce arising from the falc of the said ship is several thousand pounds deficient of the amount of the said captors costs and charges; and whereas the said cargo during the whole time the said proceedings were carrying on in the said court of admiralty, remained in his Majesty's said store-hotifes in the city of Cork, and by renfon of the said cargo lying unpacked for several years in the said stores, the greatest part thereof is very much damaged and rendered unfit for exportation j and whereas there is no law in this kingdom for adjusting the sale of prize goods or goods condemned to pay costs to the captors thereof, and in as much as the said cargo is not admissible to entry, save as herein before is mentioned, the proprietors thereof will not only suffer a very great loss therein, but his Majesty's subjects who were the captors of the said cargo will be deprived of their costs duly adjudged to them as aforesaid, to the great dtfeouragement of all enterprtze against his Majesty's enemies in future time unless relieved by the aid of Parliament.

II. Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That at any time within the space of six months from and after the passing of this a£k, the said car-goof the said ship Vriendfcap and all and every part thereof, shall and may be admitted to entry and discharge in any of his Majesty's custom-houses in this kingdom upon payment of duties thereon to his Majesty, his heirs or successors, at the rate of ten pounds for the value of every hundred pounds thereof, the value of the said cargo to be ascertained in the like manner as goods which by the laws of this realm

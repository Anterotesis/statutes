WHEREAS great national bounties are granted for the purpose of encouraging the fisheries of this kingdom, but by experience it lias been found that considerable frauds have been practised in obtaining the fame; and whereas a doubt has been entertained whether the commissioners of his Majesty’s revenue are authorized tn pay the said bounties in cases where the vessel in the course of her fishing voyage shall founder at sea, or by distress of weather be driven on shore, and wrecked, by reason that the re-quifites prescribed to be done on the return of said vessel after the fishing season, cannot be complied with, to remove such doubts, and for the better encouragement of persons to engage in said flfiieries notwithstanding the risks that may attend the fame: be it enaflred by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament afieinbled, and by the authority of the same, That where any vessel on her fishing voyage, shall founder at sea, or by distress and hardship of weather be forced on shore and wrecked, or that from unavoidable misfortunes the requisites prescribed by the said acts cannot be performed, it shall and may be lawful for the commissioners of his Majesty’s revenue, upon satisfactory proof thereof, to order payment of the said bounty to the .owners of said vessels; or in case of their being loft, to the legal representatives of laid owners.

WHEREAS it is expedient effectually to prevent the counterfeiting the current coin of this kingdom, and the uttering and paying of false or counterfeit coin: be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons in this .present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any person whatsoever shall, after the first day of June, in the year-of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and .eighty four, walh, gild, or colour any of the lawful silver coin called a .Hulling,'dr any six pence, or a counterfeit or false (lulling or sixpence, or add to or alter the impression, or any part of the impression of either fide of such lawful, or counterfeit shilling or six pence, with intent to make such (lulling referable or look like, or pass for a piece of lawful gold coin called a guinea, or with intent to make such (tx pence referable or look like, or pass for a piece of lawful gold coin called an half guinea, or shall file, or any wife alter, wadi, or colour any of the brass money called halfpence or farthings, or add to or alter the impression or any part of the impression of ei-.ther fide of an halfpenny or farthing, with an intent to make an halfpenny resemble or look like, or pass for a lawful (lulling, or with an intent to make a farthing resemble or look like, or pass for a lawful six pence, the person and persons so offending in any of the matters aforesaid, their counsellors, aiders, abettors, and procurers, shall be, and is and are hereby adjudged to be guilty of high treason.

II. And whereas the uttering of false money, knowing it to be false, is a crime frequently committed, and the offenders therein, are not deterred, the fame being only a misdemeanour, and the punishment very often but small, though there be great reason to believe that the common utterers of such false money are either themselves the coiners, or in confederacy with the coiners thereof: for preventing whereof, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person whatsoever, shall after the said first day of June, utter or tender in payment any false or counterfeit money, knowing the lame to be false or counterfeit, to any

III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person whatsoever shall, after the said first day of June, utter or tender in payment any false or counterfeit money, knowing the fame to be false or counterfeit, to any person or persons, and shall either the fame day, or within the space of ten days then next, utter or tender in payment any more or other false or counterfeit money, knowing the fame to be false or counterfeit, to the same person or persons, or to any other person or persons or shall at the time of such uttering or tendering have about him or her in his or her custody, one or more piece or pieces, of counterfeit money, besides what shall have been so uttered or tendered, then such person so uttering or tendering the fame, shall be deemed and taken to be a common utterer of false money, and being thereof convicted, shall suffer a year’s imprisonment, and shall find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said year; and if any person having been once so convicted as a common utterer of false money, shall afterwards again utter or tender in payment any false or counterfeit money, to any person or persons, knowing the fame to be false or counterfeit, then such person being thereof convicted, shall for such second offence be, and is hereby adjudged to be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.

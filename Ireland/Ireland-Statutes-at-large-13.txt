And whereas several persons, prisoners for debt have fcciningly chosen to continue for a considerable length of time in prison, (pending and consuming their substance there, and living in a manner bespeaking an ability to make satisfaction in the whole or in part to their just creditors, but from whom they have contrived to conceal or withhold their estates and effects, to the great injury'of many of his Majesty’s, honest and industrious subjects, to the great scandal of publick justice, and to dimunition of private credit: for remedy whereof, and to prevent so great an evil, as far as may be, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the passing of this act, it shall and may be lawful c to and for any one creditor, or any two or more being partners,

IV. And whereas many offences against acts of Parliament for^ fffj' the preservation of fish in rivers, lakes, and inland waters, continue to be committed with impunity, from the collusion of the inhabitants adjoining such lakes and rivers, who may derive benefit from the destruction of iifli taken in an undue leafon, or in a prohibited manner, and from their unwillingness to give information against offenders, though they mull be from their situations acquainted with the fiidts so committed, and by whom; for remedy whereof, be it enacted, That where information upon oath of ir;nrormi.

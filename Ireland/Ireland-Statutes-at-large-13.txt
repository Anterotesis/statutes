WHEREAS certain clauses in the act passed in the twenty-

third and twenty-fourth years of his present Majesty King C.j. c. 40. George the third, for the protcBion and improvement of the inland fishcries of this kingdom, require explanation; and certain cases may occur which do not seem to be i’ufficiently provided for by said act, nor by the act passed in the seventeenth and eighteenth years of his present Majesty, entitled, An a'3 for the better pre- jtiSC.j, servation of ffi in rivers, lakes, and inland waters; which by the c- '9- last receited act is continued in force for ten years: be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-six, no person or persons having a fishing

said opening or king’s share in such weir aforesaid, of a greater length than twenty feet from the back of said weir; and if any tail weirm person shall after receiving notice from any justice of the peace, to J1"','",’k pull down or lhorten said spur-wall or spur-walls, or tail-wall or jj!’" " tail-walls so built and erected, refuse or neglect to pull them down, of said weir, or lhorten them to the length of twenty feet from the foundation of said weir, for the space of one calendar month, he shall be liable to a penalty of ten pounds, by distress and sale of the often- penalty aider's goods, by virtue of a warrant under the hand and seal of any justice of the peace before whom information shall be given; one moiety of said penalty to be paid to the treasurer of the infirmary of the county, county of a city, or county of a town, for the use of said infirmary, and the other to the informer; cr if he will not accept the fame, to the constable or constables who shall serve the notice, and shall be aiding in levying the aforesaid penal-

Provided nevertheless, That if such spur-walls or tail-walls with the king’s share, or open in the said weir, shall have been originally constructed at the time of the building or erecting of such weirs, or shall hereafter, as is hereafter in particular cases allowed, be constructed oil one side of the river adjoining the bank, that then such wall as may have been built close along the bank-fide for the support of said hank, shall remain untouched; any tiling herein contained to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

III. And whereas the destructive practice of killing salmon and salmon peal when ipcilt, and out of season, which tends not only to the great injury of fisheries, but the health of such as eat them, is generally carried on in the night, and by persons disguised, who frequently aflcmhle with arms, and thus deter water-keepers and others from approaching them to discover their names, or prevent their intended mischievous practices: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when two or more such persons shall be found together with lights, spears, or other instruments, or engines for the purpose of killing salmon or trout, or other fish in the night, on any river, lake, or lilliery, such person or persons so offending as aforesaid, and being convicted thereof, on the oath of one or more credible witness or witnesses, before any one justice of the peace, shall be liable to a penalty of five pounds, to be paid forthwith by each and every person so offending as aforesaid, to the person or persons who gave the information, or to any person he or they may direct to receive the same; and if such sum or sums shall not be immediately paid as aforesaid, by such offender or offenders, he or they shall he committed by such justice to the county gaol, there to remain without bail or mainprize for a time not exceeding six months for the first offence, nor Iefs than three months, unless such fine shall be sooner paid, and for a time

IV. And whereas many offences against acts of Parliament for^ fffj the preservation of fish in rivers, lakes, and inland waters, continue to be committed with impunity, from the collusion of the inhabitants adjoining such lakes and rivers, who may derive benefit from the destruction of iifli taken in an undue leafon, or in a prohibited manner, and from their unwillingness to give information against offenders, though they mull be from their situations acquainted with the fiidts so committed, and by whom; for remedy whereof, be it enacted, That where information upon oath of ir;nrormi.

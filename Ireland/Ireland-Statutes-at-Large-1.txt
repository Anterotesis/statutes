HisMa jESTY’sMoftHonourablepRiVYCouNCiL. My Lord,

DEDIC ATI O N.

to Your Lordship. Accept then, my Lord, my most Heartfelt Thanks j and be assured that every Attention and Assiduity in my Power has been exerted in the Execution of it $ considering that Conduct as the best Mode of convincing Your Lordship of the Sincerity of my Professions. With ardent Wishes for an uninterrupted Series of Happiness to Your Lordship,

I remain,

Your Lordship’s Most Obedient and Devoted Very Humble Servant,

TO HIS EXCELLENCY

JOHN, Lord Baron Bowes of Clonfyon,

Lord CHANCELLOR,

One of the Lords Justices,

AND OF

His Majesty’s Molt Honourable Privy Council in Ireland.

My LORD,

THIS Edition of the Acts, passed in the several Parliaments of Ireland, being undertaken at the Delire of that august Assembly in which Your Lordship 'prelides, and carried on under Your Patronage, has a natural Claim to Your Protection: but other Considerations also induce Vol. I. [b] - the

DEDICATION.

the Editor to request Permission to inscribe this Collection to Your Lordship. Many of these Statutes have been prepared and framed with Your Assistance, and' under Your InfpeCtion; and these Laws have been explained, intorced, and carried into Execution by Your Lordship, for above twenty-five Years, •in both Courts of Equity; where Your Decisions have given Authority to Law, and Y our Behaviour •to it’s Professors justifies them in looking up to Your Lordship with a Degree of filial Duty and Affection, as a political Parent to them and a Support of their Profession.

Rare and various are those Talents, my Lord, which constitute a great judicial Character! a ready and clear Apprehension! a found, distinguishing, and exaCt Judgment! a comprehenlive Understanding! Freedom and Liberality of Thought and Rea-foning! Sagacity to investigate the great Principles of Justice, and Discernment to fee where those Principles lead! yet these; Qualities, however improved by Experience and Learning, though sustained by spotless Integrity and ftriCt Impartiality in the most unremitted Application, would not have been sufficient, were not Your Lordship also blessed with a Zeal and Warmth, and with (if I may be allowed the Expression) a Passion for Justice. It is this great Spring, which animates the judicial Character, and gives to the Dictates of an honest Heart the natural Glow of a graceful and manly Eloquence !

Abilities, such as these, have enabled Your Lordship to lay open and clear the Sources of Equity;

to

DEDICATION.

to establish the ConftruCtion of our Laws upon plain and. solid Foundations 3 and to make the High Court of Chancery a Terror to Fraud, and a Protection and Comfort to every honest Man.

Your Lordship hath successively supported several great Offices in the Law with the general Approbation of all Parties 3 while it hath been Your peculiar Felicity never to have been connected with any. Your Mind raised You above the Prejudices, Your Abilities needed not the Assistance, of Party. The Constitutional Connection of Great Britain and Ireland, and the mutual Interests resulting. from thence, have been the unvaried Principles of Your ConduCh: what Satisfaction then must all, who have the Well-being of both at Heart, have felt on feeing the Great Seal of this Kingdom committed to Your Lordship ? In Addition to the Dignity of the Peerage, our Gracious Sovereign had but one further Mark of Favour and Confidence to bellow $ by imparting His Mercy to those Hands, in which His Justice had been so long intrusted, for the Happiness of a loyal, grateful, People 3 by whom Your true and real Regards for their Welfare are universally acknowledged.

Permit me, my Lord, to lay hold of this publick Opportunity to express the deepest Sense of my particular Obligations to Your Lordship. This is a Subject, upon which I wish to enlarge 3 but dare not offend the Delicacy of Your Sentiments: though what may be deemed Adulation in one, may be but a cold Expression of Gratitude, in another.

DEDICATION.:

Publick Characters are the proper ObjeCts of publick Disquisition; and those Virtues, which contribute to the Happiness of Mankind, should be pointed out to Imitation, that the Example may remain, when the Possessors of those Virtues shall be ho more. May that Period in the present Instance be far distant! And may it be very long, before the unanimous Voice of the Sovereign and his People shall inscribe the Stone with this Honourable Testimony,

“ Well done, thou good and faithful Servant”

I have the Honour to be Your Lordship’s most dutiful, Most devoted, and Obedient Servant,

READER.

AS this Edition of the Acts, passed in the several Parliaments held in this Kingdom, may be considered as a Publick Work, in Part obtained at their Expence, and which could not have been executed without such Assistance; it may be proper to shew the Necelfity of this Undertaking from the preferit State of the printed Statutes in Ireland, and also the Advantages proposed by what is now done,- in attempting to supply former Defects, and to render this Impression useful and commodious to the Reader.

' The Ir'ijh Statutes now in Print, consist of those collected by Sir Richard Bolton, in one Volume in Folio, printed in 1621, by the Society of Stationers, then Printers to his Majesty: reprinted by Benjamin Toole, in 167S, with the Addition of the subsequent Acts to the Session of the 17th and 18th of King Charles the Second inclusive : from which Time to the Revolution, no Parliament was held in Ireland. To this Impression was annexed a thin and incompleat Index. And it has been lince reprinted, in 1723, without any Additions.

The several Acts which passed in the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, and those of Queen Anne and the succeeding Kings, were printed by the King’s Printers, at the Clofc of each respective Session; in different Volumes, of different Sizes, and in different Types, without Indexes, or any Aid to find the Contents or even the Titles, but by inspedting the Volumes of the Sessions in which they passed: which Volumes were become too numerous for Use; and even those so dispersed, that at present, compleat Sets arc with Difficulty to be procured, to answer the Purposes of Justice, especially at the Affiles held in the several Counties.

Vol. I. [ c ]

T HESE

TO THE READER.

These Considerations, it is presumed, induced the House of Lords to address His Excellency the Earl of Halifax, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, by their Resolution of the aoth of April 1762, to give DiredHons, “ That “ the Statutes ai large of this Kingdom be forthwith printed and pub-“ lifted, under the Inspedtion of the Lord Chancellor and Judges; and that “ as an Encouragement to the Printer, a copy thereof be given to each “ Member of both Houses of Parliament,” In consequence whereof, His Excellency, by His Order dated the 27th of April 1762, directed Hugh, Boulter Primrose Grierson H,is Majesty’s Printer General in this Kingdom, to Print and Publift the said Statutes at large, under the Inspection of the Lord Chancellor and Judges; and to cause a Copy thereof to be given to each Member of both Houses of Parliament.

Which Order being signified to the Lord Chancellor and Judges, they were pleased to approve of a Specimen of the Paper, Size, and Type, to be made Use of on the Occasion ; and their Lordftips were farther pleased to honour the Editor with their Appointment to carry their Directions into Execution.

The Acts as before printed by the King’s Printers, having received the Sandtion of the Courts of Justice as the Statute Law of Ireland; the Editor considered them as authentic, and made them the Copy from which He printed, without variation, favc that where He, on reading, apprehended Errors of the Press, He had rc-course occasionally to the Records now in the Office of the Rolls, and from thence rectified those Errors; the collating them at large being thought needless, and rather a Matter of Curiosity, which would have been attended with very great Expence.

T11 e Statutes in this Collection arc ranged in Order of Time, including all whose Titles are mentioned in any of the former printed Statutes, though not there printed at large; distinguishing, however, the Acts or Parts of Acts expired or repealed, by a finaller sized Type; except in some few Instances where Acts have been repealed in Part, of which due Notice is given in the Margin.

The Acts, whereof the Titles only were mentioned in the Statutes of former Impressions, have been copied at large, for this Work, from the original Records. Some Instances there may be of Rolls, before the Reign of Queen Elizabeth (but not since) with the Titles of Acts of Parliament not before printed, which the Editor did not think himself authorized to insert as Part of the Statutes of Ireland; they never having received the Sandtion of being printed by Authority or even mentioned iti any Statute ib printed, nor authenticated by judicial Determinations.

The

TO THE READER.

The Editor-was aware, that the inferring expired or repealed Acts at • large, would increase the Bulk of this Collection: But it is hoped, the Publick will dispence with that Inconvenience, as they may afford Light and be useful for the Construction of subsisting Laws; and will remain curious and authentic Documents in the Publick History of this Kingdom.

It has been usual, especially of late Years, to insert in the fame Act different Matters not expressed in the Title of such Act. This has been the Cafe particularly in those intitled ASts for Amendment of the Law ; which has rendered it difficult to find the several Clauses when wanted. To remedy such Inconvenience, the Editor has, besides the General Index, added, but in a different Character, to the Table of the Titles of those Acts, the different Matters therein contained.

Indexes are absolutely necessary to Works of this Kind: the Editor has therefore endeavoured to make His General Index to this collection useful and compleat.

The Acts of Settlement and Explanation, though relating to a great Part of the landed Property in Ireland, may be considered as a separate Code of Laws, and as such rather to be consulted on particular Occasions, than as Part of the General Statute Law. The Editor has therefore added a .separate Index for the readier turning to the several Matters contained in those Acts.

The ihort Abstracts and References in the Margin, will, it is hoped, be found accurate: and, upon the whole, the Editor is not conlcious of having omitted any Care or Pains in Discharge of the Trust he has been honoured with; and hopes this will, upon Perusal, be found a correct and useful Edition of The Statutes at large, agreeblc to the Intention of that respettable Authority, at whose Delire this Work was ordered and undertaken.

xff 77jc Corrc&ar of the present Edition, has, at the beginning of the Eighth Volume, (which contains an Index to the whole JVork,) given an Account of such Alterations or Additions, as have been found necessary in the Prosecution osso variable a JVork ; and an Explanation of the Method he has ptirftted in forming the Index; which be hopes will meet the Approbation of the Publick in general, and of the Bar in particular, for whofc Convenience it is principally adapted.

Our soveraigne lord the King having privie intelligence thereof, willed secretly the said earle of Kyldare,

Our said foveraigh lord having notice of this and other his treasons, haynous offences, murders and extortions by him committed, and willing the reformation of the said land, and the relief and comfort of his subjects there, ad-dressed his most gracious letters-to the said earle of Kyldare, then being deputie lieutenant of his said land, commanding him by the fame, to repayr to his highnesse presence into his realm of England, leavyeing such a person for the furniture of his realm, and governance of the said land in his absence, for whose doings he would answer. That notwithstanding at his said departure into England, he admitted and instituted in his place for the governance of the King’s said land and subjects, as vicedeputy, not onely his son and heyre, named Thomas fitz Gerald, but also contrary to the King’s express commandment, declared unto the said earle by John Aleu master of the rolls, and one of the King’s most honourable counfail, in the presence ofthebishop ofMieth, and the prior of Saint John’s Jerusalem in-Ireland, he conveyed out of the King’s castell of Dublin all his graces gunnes, powder,.

After whole departure into England, he at his thither coming perceiving upon the manifestation of his offences, that the King’s majestie entended to remove him from the governance of the said land, such persons as were known to be chief of counfaii with the said earle and under him had not onely the governance of his said son, servants and people, with the custodie of his substance and goods, but also of all his lands, manors, cattles and garrisons, afwell counfailed the said Thomas fitz Gerald to rebell against our said soveraign lord, as for the maintenance of liim therein, delivered unto hirn the said earls goods, substance, manors, lands, castles and'garrisons, together with the King’s said ordnance and artillerie. Whereupon the said Thomas fitz Gerald immediately, being assisted and ayded by his father’s brethren, kinsmen, servants, and followers,-falsly and trayteroufly rebelled against our said soveraign lord, refu-sing and disobeying all commandments of his grace and his counfaii, concluded and determined most cruelly to murder, put to death, and exile all those that were reliant within the land, being born within the realm of England, and to conquer and take the fame from the possession of our laid soveraign lord and his hey res, reviling his grace

Qm-n Anne. anj C0tli!n0ns in this present Parliament assembled in your land of Ireland, That fithence it is the natural inclination of every man gladly and willingly to provide for the fuertie of both his title and succession, although it toucheth his onely private cause: We therefore, most rightful and dreadful soveraign lord, rccken our selves much more bounden to beseech and instant your highness, although we doubt not of your princely heart and wisdom, mixed with natural affection to the fame, to foresee and provide for the perfect fuertie of both you and your most lawful succession and heyres, upon which dependeth all our joy and wealth, in whom also is united and knit the only mere true inheritance and title of this realm without any contradidion: Wherefore, we your said most humble and obedient subjects in this present Parliament assembled, calling to our remembrance the great divisions which in time past have been by reason of feverall titles pretended to the imperial crown of the realm of England, whereunto this your land of Ireland is appending and belonging, which some times, and for the most part, ensued the occasion of ambiguitie and doubts, then not so perfidy declared, but ' that men might upon froward intents expound them to any man’s sinister appetite and affection after their fence, contrary to the right legalitie of the succession and poftcritie of the lawful Kings and Emperours of the said realm of England and of this land of Ireland, whereof hath ensued great effusion and destrudion of man’s blood, afwell of a great number of the nobles, as of other the subjects, and specially inheritours of the fame: And the greatest occasion thereof hath been, because no perfect and substantial provision bath been made, when doubts and questions have been moved and proponed of the certainty and legalitie of the succession ‘ and

and posterity of the crown : by reason whereof, the Bilhop of Rome, A. B. and the fee apoftolique, contrary to the .great and inviolable graunts ^5.1Tr^ of jurisdictions given by God immediately to Emperours, Kings and Princes, in succession to their heyres, hath presumed, in times past, to invest who should .please them, to inherit in other mens’ kingdomes and dominions, which thing, we your most humble subjects, both spiritual and temporal, doe most abhor and deleft. And sometime other forrein princes and potestates, of sundry degrees, minding rather dissention and discord, to continue as well in the said realm of England, as in your said land of Ireland, to the utter desolation thereof, then charitie, equitie, or unitie, have many times supported wrong tales, whereby they mouglit the more easte and facilie aspire to the fuperiorltie of the fame; the continuance and sufferance whereof deeply considered and pondered, were too dangerous and perilous to be suffered any longer, and too much contrary to the unity, peace, and tranquilitie of the said realm of England, and of this your said land of Ireland, being greatly reproachable and dilhonourable to the said whole realm and land.

In coufideration whereof, your said most humble and obedient fub-jcfts, the nobles and commons in this your said land of Ireland, considering that there is a good act made within the realm of England, for the furetie of your highness, and your succession in the imperial crown of the fame: and calling further to their Temembrance, that the -good unitie, peace, and wealth of the said realm of England and of this land, and the succession of the fame, most specially and principally above all worldly things, confifteth and refteth in the certainty and surety of the procreation of posterity of your highnefe, in whose most royall person, at this present time, is no manor of doubt nor question; do therefore most humbly beseech your hignefs, that it may plcai'e your Majesty, That it may be enacted The rasr-by your highness, with the aflentof the lords spiritual and tempo-ral, and the commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by .K:,t>icri"c h“

And the separation thereof made by the said arclibifliop, shall be good and effectual to all intents andpurposes, any licence, dispensation or any other act or acts, going afore or ensuing the fame, or to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding, and that every such licence, dispensation, act or acts, thing or things heretofore had, made,

Ma-jeftie your crown and dignitie, imagining and compassing thereby to deprive your Highnefle, your heires and succesl'ors, from the reall and actuall possession of this your Majesties kingdom of Ireland, your true, just, and auncient inheritance to you by fuudrie difeents, and authentike strong titles rightfully and lawfully de-voluted, as to the very indubitate and lawful heire thereof by pretext of keeping to him and his surname the dominion and te-ritories of Ulster, unjustly claimed as their foile and ancient inheritance, being the fist and one of the largest partes of this your realm, and Handing in the moll perilous place of the fame ; and forasmuch, most gracious soveraign lady, as for the manifold hey-nous offences committed by the said traytour and his confcde-rats, our intent and earnest desire is to intitle your Majestie, uifter, the your heires and successours, by Parliament, to the dominion and u,;, realm,0 territories of Ulster, as a foundation layd for your Highnefle to plant and dispose the fame for increasing of your revenue, lous place strengthening of us, arid confirmation of this your realm, wee shut 0-tliink it not unneccflaric first to open unto your Majestie and your nobilitie of England, by this our humble supplication ad- t« forth, dressed unto your most princely estate, the fall and trayterous attempt of that archrebell and arrant trSytor, as an introduction to so great and good a purpose, to the intent that like as wee your people are replenished with incredible joy and gladncfs for being delivered from the perill of so great and cruell a tyrant, so your Majestie would vouchsafe to expresse your just deferred indignation by matter of record against the bloud, progeny and linage of so vile, abhominable, and fedifious person.

And therefore to begin, it may please your Majestie to under-lland, that after that your most famous father, King Henry the Conn: eighth, hath upon the humble submission of the late Coun Oneyle, father to the said traytour, created the said Coun carle r“b* ( of Tyrone, and his soone Matthew Oneyle, baron of Dungannan, «ltyK./f.8. the remainder of the said earldome, to the said baron and his heires 'J'ff males of his bodie, lawfully begotten, the said Shane Oneyle of pre- f<j" tenced malice, to prevent that English creation and order of fuccef- of Uungm-fion, did falsly and tryteroufly, in his said father’s life time, murder j™’,",™"1" the said baron, being a faithfull fuhjcft to the crown of England, “ddom to and after the dcccafe of his laid father, usurped and tooke upon him heirs male of the name of Oneyle, with the whole superiority, rule and govern- '"s^j to 4 M 2 ance rrc«nt lh“

Odonils countrey and people at commaundement, hee began to for-Iteyle’scoun- tifie a strong island in Tyrone, which for the strength and force of hurtaget fimn ^lc P'ace> hee caused to bee called in despite Fooghnegall, which is him, as much to say as, the hate of Englishmcn. And further for mani-O’Uonnei:"1' fellation of this rancour and cancred heart to that nation, hee cruel-onii^mim°a ^ hanged one of his country by the feet, onely upon bare suspicion that he Ihould be a fpie for Englishmen, another he hanged hecaule he was found with English bilket about him, the third being one of the captaines of your Majesties galloglalfes, named Fardorogh Mac DoniU, falling infortunately into his hands, hee so crulhed by torture and durefle of binding, that he brack his backe bone, and so aided his .life miserably. And albeit that these and other the actions and doing of the said Shane Oneyle, hath been fithence .that time, so manifest, rebellious, and trayterous against your moll-excellent Majcllie, your estate, crown and dignitie, as each member of this commonwealth and kingdome hath well felt the fame, by his arrogant, undutifull .and trayterous attempts, untill the .arrivall of Sir Henry .'Sidney, your Majesties deputie of this realm ; yet for the more evident declaration of your Majesties clemencie, and of his un-naturall, ingrate and detestable conspiracies and treason, the said lord deputy, with the advise of the couucell heerc, hath thought good to publish and denounce by .proclamation, what hope your Highnelfe • had of his dutifullncfle and .conformity, and how worthily his deserts hath heaped .upon him your Highnelfe utter indignation, correction and incurable difpleasure, and namely, fithence the said lord deputie, accepted the deputation and government .of tills kingdome, before which time his dillimulation and hypocrilie was such, as in humble and repentant manner, he .promised his loyaltie and faithfull obedience with such subjedtion hecreafter, as he obteined at your Majcf-his petiti- tlcs ^an^s> uot onely peace, but pardon to his offences against your mu by the Highnelfe and your crow.ne, and after that exhibiting certamc pe-

And when after these tyrannous, felonious, and tray-terous attempts he urged again a Parliament and meeting the five and twentieth of July in the yeare aforesaid, profcfling by the humilitie of his letters as though he had been glad of peace and tranquilitie, forasmuch as the lord deputie and councell were truly advertised, that he repaired to the confines in warrelikc manner with all the force and power he was able to make, it was thought meet, that a convenient force to refill: his invalions should at that day bee assembled at Dondalke aforesaid: and albeit that by the space of two daies the said lord deputie remained in the frontiers of Ulster, readie to heare any request that he should humbly have offered, yet hee not onely refused to repaire unto him, or to fend any man inilrudted in his griefes, but caused his people to begin Warre and Ikirmilh contrary to his oath and dutie of a subject; and after stich time as the said lord deputie had dispersed his force for the commoditic and case of the people, the fame Qncyle hath with banners dlfplayed, as an open cncmic, traytor, and rebell entered into the Englifti pale, and with fire and i'wonl wafted part of Vol. I. 4.

D. said Irifltmen’s comming into Ireland, one King Gunnonde, sonne to the noble King Belan King of Great Britaine, which now is called England, was lord of Bayon, as many of his fucceil'ours were to the time of King Henry the second, first conqueroiir of this realm, and therefore the Irilhmen should be the King of England his people, and Ireland his land. Another title is, that at the lame time that Second. Irilhmen came out of Biscay as exiled persons in fixtie ships, they met with the fame King Gurmond upon the lea, at the yles of Orcades, then coming from Denmark with great victory, their captaines called Hiberus and Herrnon, went to this King, and him told the cause of their comming out of Biscay, and him prayed with great instance, that he would graunt unto them, that they might inhabite some land in the Weft. The King at the last, by advise of his counsel, granted them Ireland to inhabit, and aligned unto them guides for the lea to bring them thither: and therefore they Ihould and ought to bee the King of England’s men.

Another title is, as the clerke Gcraldiis Cambrcnjis, writeth at large the hiftorie of the conquest of Ireland, by King Henry the second, your famous progenitor, how Dermot Mac Morch prince of Lein- Third, fter, which is the first part of Ireland, being a tyraunt or tyraunts Gc^‘|j"’y by banished, went over the sea into Normandie, in the parts of France, Cambienlii, to the said King Henry, and him befely besought of succour, which Clttk' bee obtayned, and thereupon became liegeman to the said King Henry, through which he brought power of Englishmen into the land, and maried his daughter named Eve, at Waterford, to Sir Richard Fitz Gilbert, earl of Stranguile in AVales, and to him graunted the reversion ofLeinster, with the said Eve his daughter.

And after that the said earl granted to the said King Henry, the citie of Dublin, with certaine cantredes of lands next to Dublin, and all the haven-townes of Leinster, to have the rest to him in ■quiet, with his Grace’s favour. Another title is, that in the year of FmmIi, the our Lord God, one thousand one hundred fixtie two, the aforesaid King Henry landed at the citie of Waterford, within the realm of aN the Kings Ireland, and there came to him Dermet King of -Corkc, which is of |untaril>- hc-the nation of the Mac Carries, and of his own proper will became c,mc fubici‘" liege tributorie, for him and his kingdom, and upon that made his oath, and gave his hostages to the King. Then the King rode to Cashell, and there came to him Donaldc King of Limcricke, which is of the nation of the O Brencs, and became his liege, as the other did. Then came to him Donalde King of Oflorie, Mac Shaghlin King of Ophaly, and all the priuccs of the South of Ireland, and became his liege men as aforesaid. Then went the said King Henry to Dublin, and there came to Him O Kirnill King ol Uriel), O Rowcke King of Meth, and Rothoriek King of all Irilhmen of the land, and of Connaght, with all the princes, and Yol.

and default of the very inheritors, after this manner loft, may bee

good example to your Majestie, intending by the grace of God,

shall not ensue hereafter. Therefore the three estates of this reahn, EarWomof

And albeit, most gracious soveraign Lady, that this your present conquest atchieved, is the confum-mation of foure hundred foure yeares travaile in this realm, yet is there of late, to the great gloric of God, your immortall fame, and good encouragement,’ a greater conquest then this wrought in this your land of Ireland, which is, the abolishing and extirpation Advantages of that horrible and most dctcftable coync and liveric, which was ”hc"xtcrm;- the very nurse and teat that gave such and nutriment to all difobc-diences, enormities, vices, and iniquities of this realm, over foule ami filthie here to be cxprclTcd, and such as did jtiftly provoke the wrath and vengeance of Almighty God upon the people of this land, and to be feared, hath bred l’omc pcrill of God’s displeasure to your most noble progenitors, the Princes of England, for so long suffering of the fame.

A.

This is the -handy worke of God, extending his great mercy and compassion .upon your poore and long afflicted people of this land. This is the favour -which-your Majaftie have found in the fight of God, to augment, ftrenghten, and honour your imperiall .crown of England, •by the thorough reformation of this your realm of Ireland now -present at hand, if it please your highnelTe to accept the fame. -This is the diligent and painfull indultry of your good servant. Sir ■Henry Sydney, whole part wee may not leave unreported, without breach of coni’cience ; who, laying God for his foundation, hath -proceeded by the direct line of justice, according your HighnelTe in-ftruftion, without corruption or respect of persons, to bring these great things to pafle. And upon the humble knees of our hearts, doe render endlefle thankes to the omnipotent God, which hath thus -blefied this worke in the hands of your Majestie, and your said •faithfull servant, and doc moll lovdy and humbly beseech your most excellent Majestie, that like as to your great charges, and-ours partly, according to-our most bounden duty, all impediments to the •reformation of this your realm, is nowr taken away. So it would please-your-HighnelTc to-take such fall hold thereof, as w’ee may bee from henceforth conserved and kept in order by due administration of justice, which istheonely wray, warranted by God,-to make Princes raigne profperoully, and their subjects to live in due obedience, wealth, and tranquilitie, whatsoever the thoughts or devises •of men .are-to the contrarie.

II. And forasmuch as the name of G Neyle, in the judgments of the uncivill people of this realm, doth Carrie in it selfe so great a foveraigntie, as they suppose that all die lords and people of Ulster should rather live in servitude to that name, than in fubjcftion to the crown of England; bee it therefore, by your Majestie, with the afTent of the lords spiritual and temporall, and the commons in this guilhed; with present Parliament assembled, and by the authoritie of the lame, Xf&Va That the fame name of O Neyle, with the manner and ceremonies cr^‘‘°()"(.'at;I.B of his creation, and all the superiorities, titles, dignities, prehemi- thereof hfeh nences, jurisdittions, authorities, rules, tributes, and expences,

used, claymed, usurped, or taken by any O Neyle, as in right of that name, or otherwise, from the beginning, of any the lords, eaptaines, or people of Ulster, and .all maner of offices given by the said N Neyle, shall from henceforth cease, end, determine, and be utterly abolished and extinct for ever. And that what person soever he bee that shall hereafter challeng, execute, or take upon him that name of O Neyle, or any fuperioritie, dignitie, prcliemiiience and jurisdiction, authoritie, rule, tributes, or expences, used, claymed, usurped, or taken heretofore by any O Neyle, of the lords, captains, or people of Ulster, the fame shall bee deemed, adjudged, and taken high treason against your Majestie, your crown and dignitie ; and the person or persons therein offending, and being thereof attainted, shall suffer and sustain such pains of death, forfeiture of lands and goods, as in cases of high treason by the laws of this realm hath been accustomed and used.

III. And for the better extirpation of that name, be it further unicros-

enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all the lords, captains, and 0f0m

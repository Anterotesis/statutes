Preamble. "VT THERE AS a traitorous conspiracy for the fubverlion of the W authority of his Majesty and the parliament, and for the ' dcftru£lion of the established constitution and government, hath unfortunately exiiled within this kingdom for a considerable time, and hath broken out in acts of the moil daring and open .rebellion : And whereas his excellency earl Camden, then lord lieutenant general and general governor of Ireland, did, on the thirtieth of March, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight, by and

The thirty-ninth Year of George III. 177

with the advice of the privy council of this kingdom, issue his A.D. .most direct and positive orders to the officers commanding his Ma- *799-jelly’s forces, to employ them with the utmost vigour and decision for the immediate suppression of the said rebellion, and did by his proclamation of the fame date, by and with the advice of the privy council, notify the fame: And whereas notwithstanding the said orders so issued as aforesaid, the said rebellion did very considerably extend itself, insomuch that large bodies of armed traitors did openly array themselves, and make the most daring and violent attacks upon his Majesty’s forces, and committed the most horrid excesses and cruelties on the properties and persons of his Majesty’s loyal subjects: And whereas for the effectual effectual suppression of the said daring and unprovoked rebellion, his excellency the said earl Camden did, on the twenty-fourth of May, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight, by and with the advice of the privy council, issue his orders to all general officers commanding hi*

Majesty’s forces, to punish all persons atting, aiding, or in any manner assisting in the said rebellion, according to martial law, either by death or otherwise, as to them should seem expedient, for the punishment and suppression of all rebels in their several districts ; and did by his proclamation of the fame date, by and with the advice of the privy council, notify the fame: And whereas his excellency the said earl Camden did by message duly communicate his said orders and proclamations, notifying the fame respectively to the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons then in parliament assembled, who did by their addresses to his excellency express their cordial acknowledgments for his said messages, and their entire approbation of the decisive measures so taken by his excellency, by and with the advice of the privy council, however deeply they lamented the necessity by which they were dictated, and the said lords spiritual and temporal and commons did by their addresses pledge their full engagement of support of every measure of firmness and vigour which might be necessary for the speedy and eftectual suppression of the said rebellion: And whereas by the wife and salutary exercise of his Majesty’s undoubted prerogative in executing martial Jaw, for defeating and dispersing such armed and rebellious force, and in bringing divers rebels and traitors to puniffitnent in the most speedy and summary manner, the peace of this kingdom has been so far restored as to permit the course of the common law partially to take place ; but the said rebellion still continues to rage in very considerable parts of this kingdom, and to desolate and lay waste the country, by the most savage and wanton violence, excess and outrage, and has utterly Vol. XIX.

fvcan.b’.e. TT THERE AS various notes, bills of exchange, and \- drafts for money, have been for fume time pafi circulated and negociated in lieu of cnfii within‘ this kingdom,

to the great prejudice of trade and public credit, and many

of such bills, notes and drafts, arc made payable under ccr- tain terms and restrictions which the poorer class of manu-

fadaurers, artificers, ‘ labourers, and others cannot comply with, unless by submitting to great extortion and abuse: -And whereas the issuing of such small notes,'bills of exchange, and drafts, has very much tended'to extend the

; pernicious crime of forgery. Be it therefore enabled by the

King’s mofl excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and

consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority

Ait-promis- of the fame. That nil promissory or other notes,'or under-d^/guLtas t2kings in writing being negociable Or transferable ‘ for the L^h'uilnotw Pa>'ment any sum less than five guineas, or on which any v JO"-j sum less than five guineas, ilia 11 remain undischarged, save

HEREAS since the eighth of December, one thousand seven hundred and Expired, ninety-seven, this kingdom has been dillurbed by trcasonable infurretflion# and open rebellion, and the lives of many of his Majesty’s loyal subje£t$ have been Joft in said rebellion, and several oflicers, sheriffs, justices of peace and others, have been obliged, in order to suppress the said rebellion, to do many acts not justifiable by law ; and whereas by an act of the thirty-eighth year of his Majesty’s reign, entitled.

An at7 for the King’s mrfi gracious, general and free pardon, it is enacted by the Ring’s most excellent Majesty, that he being always desirous to shew his inclination to mercy, therefore his Majesty was well pleased and contented that it be enacted, that all and every his subjects are thereby acquitted, pardoned and released from all treasons and other crimes perpetrated, and from all suits and executions incurred in consequence of the said rebellion, or in suppressing, counteracting or putting down \ the fame ; and whereas another act of the thirty-eighth year of his Majesty’s reign, entitled, An act for indemnifying such persons as have aBed ftnee the fifth day of November, one thousand seven hundred and nimty-fven, for the preservation of the public peace, and suppression of the infurreBions prevai ittg in some parts of this kingdom, did receive the royal afTent on the sixth day of Odtcber, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight: And whereas it is necessary to remove doubts touching the said acts, and to prevent vexatious suits, and that a time be limited for the bringing of private actions, for or on account of any words spoken, or of assault, battery or false imprisonment, committed or done within the period aforesaid; be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and tenlporal, and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the fame, That in all cases where a trial shall be had upon any action now depending, or hereafter to be brought against any such sheriffs, officers or other persons for any acts done by them or any of them for suppressing said rebellion or insurrections, for the preservation of the public peace, and for the safety of the state, during the time they were engaged in fjppreffmg of the said rebellion or infurre&iQns, for the preservation of the publick peace, and for the safety of the Vol. XIX. 4 N ' state

slate, in every such case, if the jury shall find for the plaintiff, they shall also find that such act for which the said action has been or shall have been so brought, was done maliciously, and not with an intent of lupprefling rebellion or insurrections, or for the preservation of the public peace, or for the safety of the date, as the case may be, otherwise the said verdict shall be null and void.

II. And be it also enacted, That in every case in which the jury shall find for the plaintiff, and that such act for which the said action has been or may be brought, was done maliciously as aforesaid, the judge or judges before whom such action shall Joe tried, may be at liberty to certify against such verdict, and upon such certificate the verdict so had shall be set aside, and a nonSuit entered in lieu thereof.

,111. Provided always, That in every such case where the judge or judges shall so certify as aforesaid, whereby the said verdict shall be so set aside, and a non-iuit entered in lieu thereof as aforesaid, that in every such case the plaintiff shall not be subject to double colts; any thing in the said act contained to the contrary thereof .notwithstanding.

V. And whereas during the wicked and unnatural rebellion which lately broke out in this kingdom, the civil power was in many counties within the same, infus-iicient for the due execution of the law, and many sheriffs and other officers were thereby prevented from executing the writs of our lord the King to them directed, without any default in said ftieriifis or other officers, *4^ it w^culd be unjust that such sheriffs or other officers lhculd be made respoiihble for not executing such V'rits: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be law'ful to and for all sheriffs and other officers to whom any writs of our lord die King have b^en dn edict! and delivered in all cases whatever, in which said sheriffs or other officers have been hindered and prevented from executing any such writs by any body or bodies of rebels and traitors to our lord the King, w ithout the default of such sheriffs or officers to return and certify to the court out of which any such w rit shall'have issued, such hindrance and prevention by rebels and traitors, against the will and without the default of such flieritf or other officer, and that such return shall be good and lawful excuse to the court or courts out of which any such writ or -writs shall have issued, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.

Dublin, where associations are entered into* oaths administered,

and other illegal acts committed, which if not timely prevented may be productive of very ill consequences: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that every person or persons, who shall knowingly permit such clubs or societies to be kept and held in his, her, or their house or apartments, shall upon conviction thereof before any two or more justices of peace for the county, wherein such person or persons shall be rciident, upon the oath of two or more credible witnesses forfeit and pay for every such offence the sum of twenty pounds, one moiety thereof to be paid to the informer, and the other moiety to be applied to the use of the blue coat hospital in the city of Dublin; and if such offender shall not be able to pay such fine, that it shall and may be lawful for the said justices by warrant under their hands and seals to commit such offender to the common gaol of the county, there to be kept without bail or main-prize for three months.

after the ascertaining of the said rent in arrear to make any such 1775-6. demand thereof, and if the same should be necessary, it is appre-Chap. 27. hended, that the greatest part; if not all, of the evictions, which have been had under ejectments for nonpayment of rent since the making of the said last mentioned act, may be impeached, which may be productive of great litigation, and throw the landed oritviflion property of this kingdom into great confusion: for remedy by whereof be it enacted by the king’s most excellent Majesty by and

IV. And whereas tenants before the expiration of their leases,

being in arrear to their landlords or Mors, frequently abscond, and leave the demised premisses waste and untenanted, lb that no summons or notice in ejectment for nonpayment of rent can be loved for the recovery of the demised premises, ’till an application is made, and an order obtained from one of the courts of common' law, for substituting some other mode of service thereof, whereby a great delay is often occasioned to such landlords or leilors, and the arrear of rent due to them becomes consequently greatly increased, before they can evict such leases under the al’oresaid laws: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in where te. all cases where the tenant or tenants of any demised premisses "b:

WHEREAS great numbers of journeymen taylors in and about the city of Dublin and liberties thereof and in and about the county of Dublin, who have served apprenticeships, or have been brought up in the art or mystery of a taylor, have lately departed from their services without just cause, and have entered into combinations to advance their wages to unreasonable prices, and lessen their usual hours of work, which manifestly tends to the prejudice of trade, to the encouragement of idleness, and to the great increase of the poor of this metropolis: ahd whereas these disorders principally arise from clubs and societies formed and held in different parts of the said city and county of

Dublin, where associations are entered into* oaths administered,

and other illegal acts committed, which if not timely prevented may be productive of very ill consequences: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the fame, that every person or persons, who shall knowingly permit such clubs or societies to be kept and held in his, her, or their house or apartments, shall upon conviction thereof before any two or more justices of peace for the county, wherein such person or persons shall be rciident, upon the oath of two or more credible witnesses forfeit and pay for every such offence the sum of twenty pounds, one moiety thereof to be paid to the informer, and the other moiety to be applied to the use of the blue coat hospital in the city of Dublin; and if such offender shall not be able to pay such fine, that it shall and may be lawful for the said justices by warrant under their hands and seals to commit such offender to the common gaol of the county, there to be kept without bail or main-prize for three months.

CHAP. XXXVIII.

An Act for giving Relief in Proceedings upon Writs of Mandamus, for the Admission of Freemen into Corporations.

WHEREAS divers persons who have a right to be Preamble, admitted citizens, burgesses, or freemen of divers cities, towns corporate, boroughs, and corporations in this kingdom, being refused to be admitted thereto, have in many cases no other remedy to procure themselves to be admitted to the franchises of being citizens, burgesses or freemen, than by writs of mandamus, the proceedings on which are very dilatory and expensive, and although any such writ of mandamus is obeyed, the person applying is nevertheless put to great and unnecessary trouble, delay, and expence: and whereas by the laws now in being, in many cases no provision is made for giving costs to the party suing out any such writ, where the fame is obeyed; for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and eommon6 'in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after the frnm ' Alls-

And in order that it may be known what persons are, from time to time admitted freemen or burgesses of any city, corporation, or borough, be it enacted, That the mayor, bailiff, town clerk, or other officer of any city, corporation, or borough, having the custody of, or power over the re-fmmih a copy COrds of the fame, shall, upon the demand of any two free-

111. And whereas by collufton with persons having the custody of corporation books, divers persons have obtained their names to be entered therein, as burgesses or freemen, as if they had been duly elected, although such persons were never elected by the corporation; and in order to avoid the trial of their right by mandamus, or judgment of sujler against them, such persons have never sued forth any writ of mandamus, or otherwise applied to be sworn or admitted burgesses or freemen, whereby informations in the nature of quo warranto, cannot be obtained, to try the validity of their elections: and whereas such persons may hereafter disturb the peace of such corporations, at a remote period, when it may be impossible to produce the evidence of their fraudulent elections; for remedy whereof, be it enacted, That from and after the first day of August, which shall be in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-four, no writ of mandamus shall in any case issue, for the admission of any such bnrgefs or freeman as aforesaid, unless such burgess or freeman shall sue forth such writ, within seven years after such entry of his or their elcdtion as aforesaid.

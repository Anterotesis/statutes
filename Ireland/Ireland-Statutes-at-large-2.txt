An Act of moji joyful Recognition of his Majestics undoubted Title to the Crown of Ireland.

MOST gracious and dread Sovereign; we your Majestic’s loyal and faithful subjects of all estates and degrees within this your Majestie’s kingdom of Ireland, do with all possible joy from the very bottom of our hearts, offer up our unfeigned thanks unto Almighty God, for his gracious and wonderful providence, in rc-storing of your sacred Majesty unto the exercise of your royal po-.ver and authority over us, and making us happy under the government of a King adorned with so rare accomplishments of piety, wisdom, and tender-heartedness towards the good and welfare of all your Majestie’s subjects: Your Majestie’s abundant piety and religious care, in restoring the church of this your kingdom to her ancient, wholesom and legal rights and discipline, and not onely your great goodness in preserving, but also your royal bounty in increasing the revenues thereof, particularly manifested by your Majestie’s gracious letters of the twentieth day of November last, your Majestie’s great wisdom, gracious condescension, and indefatigable personal labour and pains in finding out a way, and contriving means to reconcile the many different interests among your Majestie’s subjcifts here, your transeendent care to secure the lives, confirm the liberties, and settle the estates of your Majestie’s subjects (even at so great a price, as the freely parting with almost all the great forfeitures in this kingdom, belonging to your Majestie, as we find in your Majellic's gracious declaration of the thirtieth of November last, for the settlement of this kingdom) do abundantly manifest to all the world your Majestie’s great care and goodness toward us your Majestic’s

liege people, and the many blessings we receive by your Majestie’s A.D. wonderful and moll happy restauration: the stories and records of 1660. some years pall, can amply testifie what our miseries have been, and were there no writings to transmit the said memorial of them to posterity, yet the fad and mournful condition of our church, the contempt in a manner of the whole worship of God, the tyranny of those who bore rule over us to the oppression of all good men, the murther, rapine and spoil of multitudes of your Majestie’s faithful subjects, are as so many monuments to deliver over the knowledge of our sufferings to all succeeding generations, and that now by the most happy access of your royal Majesty unto the exercise of your regal government in this kingdom, we should have, as in a moment, the true worship of God restored, our churches adorned with order and good discipline, the civil government rc-established upon the ancient fundamental laws of the land, in which is founded safety to our lives, and security to our liberties and estates; how are we obliged in all integrity to render our moll; humble and hearty thanks to Almighty God, who hath sent us so great a deliverance, so gracious and so good a King, and to honour and serve your sacred Majesty truly and faithfully with the utmost of our lives and estates: and most gracious and dread Soveraign, as we do mod; humbly and thankfully acknowledge that Almighty God hath extended his unspeakable mercy towards us in this deliverance, so tve do most cheerfully and heartily acknowledge that he hath magnified the righteousness of his judgment, in bringing to nought the councels, machinations and strength of those who role up against your sacred Majesty, and in restoring of your most sacred Majesty unto the possession of this your kingdom, unto which your Majesty, without ail doubt, feruple, question or ambiguity, hath an undoubted right by lawful defeent and inheritance, as our onely lawful and rightful supreme Liege-lord and King: and however

recognitions of this nature may seem unnecessary where your Majestie’s title unto this your realm is so clear, as that it is avowed in sundry acts of Parliament, heretofore made within this kingdom, in the times of your Majestie’s royal progenitors of famous memory, and so ancient, as it is deduced not onely from the dayes of King Henry the Second, your Majestic’s royal anccftor, but also from The King’i times far more ancient, as by sundry old and authentick evidences mentioned in the said acts and records of this your Majestie’s king- Hm. 2. lmi dom may evidently appear; yet finding what traiterous declarations m0tc ancient, have flown abroad of late yeares within this your Majestie’s kingdom, and being dutifully and zealously affected to remonstrate unto your Majestie and the world that wc are none of that seditious and rebellious rabble, whom it hath pleased the Almightie to suppress by the might of his own power, hut a part of that remnant of your Majestie’s loyal subjects, whom it hath pleased God to preserve alive amidst all those flames and (forms of perfection, and that being L 11 2 now

Xis Majesie's gracious Declaration for the Settlement of his Xing-dome of Ireland, and Satisfaction of the several Interesls of Adventurers, Souldiers, and other his Subjects there.

CHARLES the second, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, tsfe. T-o all our loving subjects of our kingdom of Ireland, of what degree or quality soever, greeting; It having pleased Almighty God out of his great mercy and compassion towards us, and all our subjects, to restore us in so wonderful a manner to each other, and with so wonderful circumstances of aflfeftion and confidence in each other as must for ever fill our hearts (if we are in any degree sensible of such blelfings) with an humble and gratefull acknowledgment of the obligation we owe to his Divine Providence, that he would voucli-safe to work that miracle for us himself, which no endeavours of-our own could bring to pass: We think it agreeable to the just sense we have, and ought to have of the good affection of all our good subjects, who have contributed so much in bringing this unspeakable blessing upon us and themselves, that we acknowledge that our good subjects in our kingdome of Ireland have born a very good part in procuring this happiness, that they were early in their duti-full addresses to 11s, and made the fame professions of resolution to return to their duty and obedience to us, during the time of our being beyond the seas, which they have lincc so eminently made good and put in practise; however it was not cafy for us to make any publick declaration with reference to that our kingdome, there being many difficulties in the providing for, and complying with the fevc-ral interests and pretences there, which we were bound in honour and justice in some degree to take care of, and which were different from the difficulties we were to contend within this kingdom: we well knew the acts of Parliament which had formerly past for the security of the adventurers in that kingdom, and had heard of the proceedings which had been thereupon, by which very many officers, Von.

fouldievs and others, as well of this, as that our kingdome were in 1662. possession of a great part of the lands of that our kingdom, and of whose interests we resolve to be very careful.

£*. in poifcf- II. We well remember the cessation, and the peace which our of the* royal father of blessed memorie had been forced, during the late ^eVatiun tr'0UMesi to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom, and by and peace bp which he was compelled to give them a full pardon for what they Mi subjects, had before done amiss upon their return to their dutie, and their pro-d"n u on re" m'Ie of giving his Majestie a vigorous assistance, and that from that turn to duty, time divers persons of honour and qualitie had not (that we know or nffiftnn °e?US have heard of) swerved from their allegiance towards him or ns.

lity bad not to make with our said subjects, in the time when they who wickedly I’wcc by usurped the authoritie in this kingdom, had erected that odious C. 2. to pre- court for f],e taking away of the life of our dear father; and then

of his father, no bodie can wonder that we were desirous, though upon difficult conditions, to get such an united power of our own subjects, ss might have been able, with God’s blessing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible parricide.

III. And therefore we could not but hold our self obliged to pei-form what we owe by that peace, to those who had honestly and faithfully performed what they had promised to us, though we and

Nottvith-/lauding (lie disappoint-went the king

bound1 to per- ^’cy were miserably disappointed of the effect of those promises, by formauce. an unhappy part of them which foolishly forfeited all the grace which they might have expected from us.

Affection IV- And in the Iaft place, we did and must ahvaies remember the flwmty F'(h Srcat affection a considerable part of that nation exprest to us, during subjects while the time of our being beyond the leas, when with all cheerfulness and yaudfea.^ obedience, they received and submitted to our orders, and betook themselves to that service which we directed as most convenient and

behoofeful at that time to us, though attended with inconveniencie enough to themselves; which demeanour of theirs cannot but be thought verie worthie of our protection, justice and favour.; and yet causes of all these important considerations and obligations appeared lb oFfefttment many contradidions to the present interest of our good subjects in of the king- that our kingdom, who had at this time likewise merited very much from us, and for whose securitie and advantage we held our self obliged to provide as well as for their inderopnitie, and lo the good settlement of that our kingdom appeared much the more difficult unto us, and even lelfened and abated much of that joy of heart we found our self possessed with, for the great blessings wc enjoy in the peace and quiet of this our kingdom of England.

V. But we raised our spirits again with the comfortable assurance that God who had wrought so much for us in England would graciously bring his work to the fame perfection in Ireland, and not suffer our good subjects to weep in the-one kingdom, whiled they re-joyccd in the other; and our satisfaction was much inercafed, when

upon

The fourteenth and fifteenth Years of Charles II. 247

Upon conference with several of our good subjects of that nation A.D. of quality and Interest, who were concerned both as soldiers and 1662. adventurers, we found that they had a due sense of the obligations Fll2l.fl which lay upon our honour and justice and were Tery willing, that we should comply with both, and that the foundations of the peace and security of that kingdom should be raised upon our discharge of those obligations; and after they had Ipent much time among!): others, who were as much or more concerned than theinielves, they freely consented to such conclusions as to our understanding may reasonably take with all just interests; and we cannot doubt but that all who have merited from us, will con-fcfs that we have been so far from being failing to them, that we have as well provided for them, as after so great troubles and confuiions, and after such blessed circumstances of our reftau-ration they could reasonably expect, and that they \vill patiently wait for further instances of our favour and kindnef6 towards them, from the peace, unity, and settlement of that kingdom, and from their contributing to it by a full submission to these our determinations herein, and hereafter more particulary expressed and declared.

VI. And therefore in the first place, in order to a settlement of that interest claimed by the adventurers, although the present estates and possessions they enjoy, if they were examined by the ftritt letter of the law, would prove very defective and invalid, as being no ways pursuant to those acts of Parliament upon which they pretend to be founded, but rather seem to be a structure upon their subsequent assent, both to different mediums and ends than the observance of those; yet we being always more ready to consult (where the prejudice can onely relied upon ourself) with our natural inclinations to mercy (we praise God we can say so) than with the positive reason of law; wc do hereby declare, that all the lands, tenements and hereditaments, of which all or any of the adventurers were possessed the seventh day of May, one thousand six hundred fifty nine, having been allotted or set out to them, or enjoyed by them as adventurers in satisfinftion of and for their adventures shall be confirmed and made good to them, their heirs and assigns for ever, with allowance or correction of the admeasurement, according to the tenor and directions of the respective acts of Parliament of XVII and XVIII Cmoiias to English or plantation measure, except as is hereafter excepted; and that the deficient adventurer, either in part or in whole, shall be satisfied out of the moiety of the counties of Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford, in the province of Muiifter; the King’s county, the Queen’s county, and the counties of Eall-Meath and West-meath, in the province of Leinster; and the counties of Down, Antrim, and Qj] q 2 Armagh

And whereas we underhand, that by the late usurped powers, during the distempers of these times, several Irish proprietors of the popish religion, have been dispossessed of their estates, meetly for being papists, and have sued out decrees, and are possessbd of lands in the province of Connaught, and county of Clare, in compensation of their former estates, which being an act of their own, we might without any injustice deny to relieve them in, yet so willing we arc that any interest intituling itself to equitable mercy might not be disappointed, that we declare, that innocent all innocent papists, being such as shall prove themselves to have creesfueddC* keen faithful and loyal unto, and never acted against our royal father or our self since the two and twentieth day of October, one thousand six hundred forty one, though they have filed out decrees, and are possessed of lands in the province of Connaught, "WcUhcy^ or county of Clave, in lieu of their former estates, shall notwith-fcir«i, shall bc Handing be restored to their said estates by the second of May, tbckrelloring one- thousand six hundred sixty one; provided that the said lands fi!<t lands ^to in ..Connaught and Clare, so allotted to the said papists, bc reftor-rcpriCc others, ed unto us to rep rife others, or for satisfaction of such Irish pro-Irish propne-' prietors thereof, so far as this declaration excludes them not; or 't0&Vdi. i *an^s Connaught and Clare, or any part thereof,

Wherefore as we do most humbly and justly acknowledge God’s justice in our deserved punishments in those calamities, which, from the counsels and actions of those conspirators and their adherents, have fallen upon us in this kingdom in general, so we do in like manner acknowledge, that even in exercising of that his justice lie remembered mercy also, and magnified his mercies to us in those great blcflings which we humbly confcfs to have proceeded mecrlv from his infinite goodness and mercy, and therefore to his most holy Name we do aferibe all honour, glory and praise: and to the end this unfeigned thankfulness may never be forgotten, but may be had in a perpetual remembrance, that all ages to come may yield praises to his Divine Majestie for the fame, and have in memory that joyful day of deliverance; be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, with the assent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That the twenty-third day of October shall be kept and celebrated as an anniversary holy day in this kingdom anniwifaiy for ever, and that all persons do at that day forbeare all bodily for labour, and the exercise of their trades; and that all and singular

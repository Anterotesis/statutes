An Act agahfl the fraudulent Aininnfration of hitfates Goods.

FORASMUCH as it is often put in ure, to the defrauding of 43 s-creditors, that such persons as are io have the administration of ^ftaud pne-the goods of others dying intestate committed unto them, if they ^‘"|{^Ins require it, will not accept the fame, but suffer or procure the ad- tiontodcceive ministration to be granted to some stranger of meane estate, and debts, not of klnne to the intestate, from-whom themselves or others, by their meanes, doe take deeds of guifts and authorities by letter of attumey, whereby they obtaine the state of the intestate into their hands, and yet stand not subject to pay the debts owing by the fame intestate, and so the creditors, for lack of knowledge of the place of habitation of the administrator, cannot arrest him or sue him, and if they fortune to find him out, yet for lack of ability in him to satisfie of his owne goods, the value of that he hath conveyed away of the intestates goods, or relcafed of his debts by way of wafting, the creditors cannot have or recover their just and due debts: be it p,fMSOj,. enacted by the authority of this present Parliament, That every per- taininggoodi ion and persons that hereafter shall obtaine, receive, or have any reieafingdehn goods or debts of any person intestate, ora release or other discharge ,r

CHAP. I.

An Act of moji joyful Recognition of his Majestics undoubted Title to the Crown of Ireland.

MOST gracious and dread Sovereign; we your Majestic’s loyal and faithful subjects of all estates and degrees within this your Majestie’s kingdom of Ireland, do with all possible joy from the very bottom of our hearts, offer up our unfeigned thanks unto Almighty God, for his gracious and wonderful providence, in rc-storing of your sacred Majesty unto the exercise of your royal po-.ver and authority over us, and making us happy under the government of a King adorned with so rare accomplishments of piety, wisdom, and tender-heartednefs towards the good and welfare of all your Majestie’s subjects: Your Majestie’s abundant piety and religious care, in restoring the church of this your kingdom to her ancient, wholesom and legal rights and discipline, and not onely your great goodness in preserving, but also your royal bounty in increasing the revenues thereof, particularly manifested by your Majestie’s gracious letters of the twentieth day of November last, your Majestie’s great wisdom, gracious condefcension, and indefatigable personal labour and pains in finding out a way, and contriving means to reconcile the many different interests among your Majestie’s fubjcifts here, your transeendent care to secure the lives, confirm the liberties, and settle the estates of your Majestie’s subjects (even at so great a price, as the freely parting with almost all the great forfeitures in this kingdom, belonging to your Majestie, as we find in your Majellic's gracious declaration of the thirtieth of November last, for the settle-ment of this kingdom) do abundantly manifest to all the world your Majestie’s great care and goodness toward us your Majestic’s

liege

liege people, and the many blessings we receive by your Majestie’s A.D. wonderful and moll happy restauration: the stories and records of 1660. some years pall, can amply testifie what our miseries have been, and were there no writings to transmit the said memorial of them to posterity, yet the. fad and mournful condition of our church, the contempt in a manner of the whole worship of God, the tyranny of those who bore rule over us to the oppression of all good men, the murther, rapine and spoil of multitudes of your Majestie’s faithful subjects, are as so many monuments to deliver over the knowledge of our sufferings to all succeeding generations, and that now by the most happy access of your royal Majesty unto the exercise of your regal government in this kingdom, we should have, as in a moment, the true worship of God restored, our churches adorned with order and good discipline, the civil government rc-established upon the ancient fundamental laws of the land, in which is founded safety to our lives, and security to our liberties and estates; how are we obliged in all integrity to render our moll; humble and hearty thanks to Almighty God, who hath sent us so great a deliverance, so gracious and so good a King, and to honour and serve your sacred Majesty truly and faithfully with the utmost of our lives and estates: and most gracious and dread Soveraign, as we do mod; humbly and thankfully acknowledge that Almighty God hath extended his unspeakable mercy towards us in this deliverance, so tve do most cheerfully and heartily acknowledge that he hath magnified the righteousness of his judgment, in bringing to nought the councels, machinations and strength of those who role up against your sacred Majesty, and in restoring of your most sacred Majesty unto the possession of this your kingdom, unto which your Majesty, without ail doubt, feruple, question or ambiguity, hath an undoubted right by lawful defeent and inheritance, as our onely lawful and rightful supreme Liege-lord and King: and however

recognitions of this nature may seem unnecessary where your Majestie’s title unto this your realm is so clear, as that it is avowed in sundry acts of Parliament, heretofore made within this kingdom, in the times of your Majestie’s royal progenitors of famous memory, and so ancient, as it is deduced not onely from the dayes of King Henry the Second, your Majestic’s royal anccftor, but also from The King’i times far more ancient, as by sundry old and authentick evidences mentioned in the said acts and records of this your Majestie’s king- Hm. 2. lmi dom may evidently appear; yet finding what traiterous declarations m0tc ancient, have flown abroad of late yeares within this your Majestie’s kingdom, and being dutifully and zealously affected to remonstrate unto your Majestie and the world that wc are none of that seditious and rebellious rabble, whom it hath pleased the Almightie to suppress by the might of his own power, hut a part of that remnant of your Majestie’s loyal subjects, whom it hath pleased God to preserve alive amidst all those flames and (forms of perfection, and that being L 11 2 now

Xis Majesie's gracious Declaration for the Settlement of his Xing-dome of Ireland, and Satisfaction of the several Interesls of Adventurers, Souldiers, and other his Subjects there.

CHARLES the second, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, tsfe. T-o all our loving subjects of our kingdom of Ireland, of what degree or quality soever, greeting; It having pleased Almighty God out of his great mercy and compassion towards us, and all our subjects, to restore us in so wonderful a manner to each other, and with so wonderful circumstances of aflfeftion and confidence in each other as must for ever fill our hearts (if we are in any degree sensible of such blelfings) with an humble and gratefull acknowledgment of the obligation we owe to his Divine Providence, that he would voucli-safe to work that miracle for us himself, which no endeavours of-our own could bring to pass: We think it agreeable to the just sense we have, and ought to have of the good affection of all our good subjects, who have contributed so much in bringing this unspeak-able blessing upon us and themselves, that we acknowledge that our good subjects in our kingdome of Ireland have born a very good part in procuring this happiness, that they were early in their duti-full addresses to 11s, and made the fame professions of resolution to return to their duty and obedience to us, during the time of our being beyond the seas, which they have lincc so eminently made good and put in practise; however it was not cafy for us to make any publick declaration with reference to that our kingdome, there being many difficulties in the providing for, and complying with the fevc-ral interests and pretences there, which we were bound in honour and justice in some degree to take care of, and which were different from the difficulties we were to contend within this kingdom: we well knew the acts of Parliament which had formerly past for the security of the adventurers in that kingdom, and had heard of the proceedings which had been thereupon, by which very many officers, Von.

£*. in poifcf- II. We well remember the cessation, and the peace which our of the* royal father of blessed memorie had been forced, during the late ^eVatiun tr'0UMesi to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom, and by and peace bp which he was compelled to give them a full pardon for what they Mi subjeas, had before done amiss upon their return to their dutie, and their pro-d”n u on re" m'Ie °f giving his Majestie a vigorous assistance, and that from that turn to duty, time divers persons of honour and qualitie had not (that we know or nffiftnn °e?US have heard of) swerved from their allegiance towards him or ns.

lity bad not to make with our said subjects, in the time when they who wickedly I’wcc by usurped the authoritie in this kingdom, had erected that odious C. 2. to pre- court for f],e taking away of the life of our dear father; and then

of his father, no bodie can wonder that we were desirous, though upon difficult conditions, to get such an united power of our own subjects, ss might have been able, with God’s blessing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible parricide.

III. And therefore we could not but hold our self obliged to pei-form what we owe by that peace, to those who had honestly and faithfully performed what they had promised to us, though we and

Nottvith-/lauding (lie disappoint-went the king

bound1 to per- ^’cy were miserably disappointed of the effect of those promises, by formauce. an unhappy part of them which foolishly forfeited all the grace which they might have expected from us.

Affection IV- And in the Iaft place, we did and must ahvaies remember the flwmty F'(h Srcat affection a considerable part of that nation exprest to us, during subjefis while the time of our being beyond the leas, when with all cheerfulness and yaudfea.^ obedience, they received and submitted to our orders, and betook themselves to that service which we directed as most convenient and

. behoofeful at that time to us, though attended with inconveniencie enough to themselves; which demeanour of theirs cannot but be thought verie worthie of our protection, justice and favour.; and yet causes of all these important considerations and obligations appeared lb oFfefttment many contradidions to the present interest of our good subjects in of the king- that our kingdom, who had at this time likewile merited very much from us, and for whose securitie and advantage we held our self obliged to provide as well as for their inderopnitie, and lo the good settlement of that our kingdom appeared much the more difficult unto us, and even lelfened and abated much of that joy of heart we found our self possessed with, for the great blessings wc enjoy in the peace and quiet of this our kingdom of England.

V. But we raised our spirits again with the comfortable assurance that God who had wrought so much for us in England would graciously bring his work to the fame perfection in Ireland, and not suffer our good subjects to weep in the-one kingdom, whiled they re-joyccd in the other; and our satisfaction was much inercafed, when

upon

The fourteenth and fifteenth Years of Charles II. 247

Upon conference with several of our good subjects of that nation A.D. of quality and Interest, who were concerned both as soldiers and 1662. adventurers, we found that they had a due sense of the obligations Fll2l.fl which lay upon our honour and justice and were Tery willing, that we should comply with both, and that the foundations of the peace and security of that kingdom should be raised upon our discharge of those obligations; and after they had Ipent much time among!): others, who were as much or more concerned than theinielves, they freely consented to such conclusions as to our understanding may reasonably take with all just interests; and we cannot doubt but that all who have merited from us, will con-fcfs that we have been so far from being failing to them, that we have as well provided for them, as after so great troubles and confuiions, and after such blessed circumstances of our reftau-ration they could reasonably expect, and that they \vill patiently wait for further instances of our favour and kindnef6 towards them, from the peace, unity, and settlement of that kingdom, and from their contributing to it by a full submission to these our determinations herein, and hereafter more particulary expressed and declared.

VI. And therefore in the first place, in order to a settlement of that interest claimed by the adventurers, although the present estates and possessions they enjoy, if they were examined by the ftritt letter of the law, would prove very defective and invalid, as being no ways pursuant to those acts of Parliament upon which they pretend to be founded, but rather seem to be a structure upon their subsequent assent, both to different mediums and ends than the oblervance of those; yet we being always more ready to consult (where the prejudice can onely relied upon ourself) with our natural inclinations to mercy (we praise God we can say so) than with the positive reason of law; wc do hereby declare, that all the lands, tenements and hereditaments, of which all or any of the adventurers were possessed the seventh day of May, one thousand six hundred fifty nine, having been allotted or set out to them, or enjoyed by them as adventurers in satisfinftion of and for their adventures shall be confirmed and made good to them, their heirs and aifigns for ever, with allowance or correction of the admealurement, according to the tenor and directions of the respective acts of Parliament of XVII and XVIII Cmoiias to English or plantation measure, except as is hereafter excepted; and that the deficient adventurer, either in part or in whole, shall be satisfied out of the moiety of the counties of Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford, in the province of Muiifter; the King’s county, the Queen’s county, and the counties of Eall-Meath and West-meath, in the province of Leinster; and the counties of Down, Antrim, and Qj] q 2 Armagh

XVI. And whereas we underhand, that by the late usurped powers, during the distempers of these times, several Irish proprietors of the popish religion, have been dispossessed of their estates, meetly for being papists, and have sued out decrees, and are pof-fcflbd of lands in the province of Connaught, and county of Clare, in compcnfation of their former estates, which being an act of their own, we might without any injustice deny to relieve them in, yet so willing we arc that any interest intituling itself to equitable mercy might not be disappointed, that we declare, that innocent all innocent papists, being such as shall prove themselves to have creesfueddC* keen faithful and loyal unto, and never acted against our royal father or our self since the two and twentieth day of October, one thousand six hundred forty one, though they have filed out decrees, and are possessed of lands in the province of Connaught, "WcUhcy^ or county of Clave, in lieu of their former estates, shall notwith-fcir«i, shall bc Handing be restored to their said estates by the second of May, tbckrelloring one- thousand six hundred sixty one ; provided that the said lands fi!<t lands ^to in ..Connaught and Clare, so allotted to the said papists, bc reftor-rcpriCc others, ed unto us to rep rife others, or for satisfaction of such Irish pro-Irish propne-' prietors thereof, so far as this declaration excludes them not; or 't0&Vdi. i ^ *an^s Connaught and Clare, or any part thereof,

XVII. Provided also, That whatsoever adventurer or fouldier that shall be removed from his present possession, to make room for any fitch papist, shall forthwith have a reprize of equal value, worth and purchase, in other forfeited lands.

XVIII. Provided always, That whereas the corporations of Ireland are now planted with English, who have considerably improved at their own charges, and brought trade and manufacture into that our kingdom and by their settlement there do not a little contribute to the peace and settlement of that countrey, the disturbing or removal of which English would in many respects be very prejudicial; that all such of the popilli religion, of any corporations in Ireland, who have been for publick security dispolfelTed of their estates within any corporation, shall be forthwith reprized in forfeited lands, tenements and hereditaments, neer the said corporations, to the full value, worth and purchase of such estate, as he was dispofleft of within such corporation; and that particularly the popilli inhabitants of Cork, Youghall, and Kingfale, shall have undisposed forfeited lands set but to them in the baronies of Uarrimore and Mulkcrry in the county of Cork, according to their respective decrees past in that behalf; Provided that in the case of innocent papists within the said respective corporations, that were dilpofiefied as aforesaid, it shall remain in his Majestie’s power to grant restitution in like manner, as is provided in the case of other innocent papists.

XIX. We are also graciously pleased, that the lands and houses set out to any person or persons, for latisfadtion of any money lent, or publick debts incurred for provisions, arms, or ammunition, fur-nished for support of our army in Ireland, in the beginning of the rebellion, shall be and remain disposeable for the satisfaction of such of the said debts, and debentures for such debts, as upon examination of the respective cases shall appear most deserving consideration and satisfaction, in such proportions as shall be thought most equal and just.

XX. We arc likewise graciously pleased to declare, that the lands set out to George duke of Albemarle, captain general of our armies of England, Scotland and Ireland, for his arrears and l'ervice in Ireland; as also the lands being for arrears purchased by him, and whereof he is now possessed ; and the lands fctled upon Roger earl of Orrery, Charles carl of Mountrath, Richard lord baron of Coloony, Chidley Coote, and Thomas Coote Ef-quircs j the relidt and heircs of Sir Simon Harcourt, Sir William Penn, and the relidt and children of colonel George Cook, Sir The-ophilus Jones, Sir George Ayfcough, and the orphans of colonel Owen O Connelly, for their service and fuflerings in the war of Ireland; as also the lands set out to Richard Urial and Thomas

XXI. Provided alwayes, and we do hereby declare, that it is not our intention thereby to weaken or avoid the just and legal title of any person, that is reftoreable by this our decjaration; but that if any of the said estates shall be accordingly restored to the former proprietor, that then a reprize of equal value, worth, and purchase shall forthwith be a/signed in lieu thereof.

XXII. And as we cannot but with extraordinary sadness of heart remember, and even at present behold the desolate and distracted condition that our kingdom of Ireland hath been, and is reduced unto, by the unnatural insurrection begun in the year one thousand six hundred forty one, and consequently abhor and deteft the contrivers and obstinate promoters of the fame against us, our crown and dignity; l'o we cannot, upon the considerations formerly exprest in this our declaration, deny all just and reasonable provision that may Hand with the present jundture of our affairs unto such of the Irish nation, who not onely gave early evidences of their repentance for their crimes, but also persevered in' their loyalty to us

Inaccom- and our commands ; and that as near as we can, our justice and our fevcraiTntc-' mercy, in accommodating this interest might not justle each

XXIII. And in case any justly entituled to the said peace, have Tlmfe t obtained decrees for the lands in the province of Connaught or coun- {he land? defy of Clare, in lieu of their former estates, and have not been possest

of lands according to such their respective decrees, we further de- Cl, shall be clare, that if by the first day of November, one thousand fix hun- tlsiied. tired sixty one, they flia.ll not be possess of such decreed lands, they shall immediately after the said day be otherwise satisfied for the fame.

And as to those who continued with us, or served faith- T^r «'b® fully under our enfignes beyond the seas, we think fit and ac- the King’s cu-cordingly declare, that they shall be restored to their former estates, !;f if they by themselves or agents authorised by them, have not pro- j?il1 ‘I« fccuted and obtained decrees and lands in the province of Con- fation Ji □!> naught or county of Clare, in compensation of their former estates, ‘Xi,turns, a reprize being first assigned and legally set out of the remaining f*. forfeited lands undisposed of, to such adventurer or fouldier, or other reprifid s and person before named, of equal value, worth and purchase to the estate,

CHAP. XXIII.

An Act for keeping and celebrating the Twenty-third of Ofiober, as an anniversary Thankfghiing in this. Kingdom.

WHEREAS many malignant and rebellious papists and jesuits, fryers, seminary priests and other superstitious orders of the popish pretended clergy, most difloyally, treacherously and wickedly conspircd to surprize his Majestie’s castle of Dublin, his Majestie’s principal fort of this kingdom of Ireland, the city of Dublin, and all other cities and fortifications of this realm, and that all the protestant and English throughout the whole kingdom that would not join with them should be cut off, and finally by a general rebellion to deprive our late sovereign lord of ever-blessed memory Ring Charles the First of this his ancient and rightful crown and fovc-raignty of this kingdom, and to possess themselves thereof; alhvhich was by the said coni'pirators plotted and intended to be acted on the twenty-third of October, in the year of our Lord God one thousand six hundred and forty-one .; a conspiracy so generally inhumane, barbarous and cruel, as the like was never before heard of in any age or kingdom, and if it had taken effect in that fulness which was intended by the conspirators, it had occasioned the utter ruine of this whole kingdom, and the government thereof; and however it pleased Almighty God in his unsearchable wisdom and justice as a just punishment, and deferred correction to his people for their fins, and the fins of this kingdom, to permit then and afterwards the effecting of a great part of that destruction complotted by those wicked conspirators, whereby many thousand Brittish and protestants have been massacred, many thousands of others of them have been afflicted and tormented with the moll exquisite torments that malice could suggest, and all mens estates, as well those whom they barba-roufly murthered, as all other good subjects, were waited, ruined and destroyed; yet as his Divine Majesty hath in all ages ihewn his power and mercy in the miraculous and gracious deliverance of his church, and in the protestion of religious Kings and Hates, so even in the midst of his justice he was graciously pleased to extend mercy to his Majesty and to this his kingdom, and good subjects therein, not only in mercifully discovering to the then lords justices by one Owen O Connelly, a meer Iriihman, but trained up in the protestant I religion,

religion, who out of a sense of his duty and loyalty to his Majesty, A.D. and for the preservation of his good people, and as an effect of that 1661. religion he was trained up in, revealed that hideous and bloody treason not many hours before the appointed time for the excution thereof, but also in preserving the said castle'and city of Dublin, The cnftle and some other cities, towns and castles in the kingdom, from the bloody hands of the barbarous conspirators, as also in thereby ren- otlimilicrcby dring deliverance of the lives of the said lords justices and council, rn-fcr":<1-and of all the Brittish and protestants in Dublin, and in the said other cities, towns and castles preferred, and of l'undry other Brittish and protestants fallen into the hands of those rebellious conspirators, and likewise in fending us succours out of England hither by the piety, care and wisdom of our late sovereign lord King Charles the first, whereby with God’s blelfing the good subjects of this kingdom have hitherto continued safe under his mighty protection, notwithstanding the unexampled rage and implacable malice of those iner-cilefs rebels. Wherefore as we do most humbly and justly acknowledge God’s justice in our deserved punishments in those calamities, which, from the counsels and actions of those conspirators and their adherents, have fallen upon us in this kingdom in general, so we do in like manner acknowledge, that even in exercising of that his justice lie remembered mercy also, and magnified his mercies to us in those great blcflings which we humbly confcfs to have proceeded mecrlv from his infinite goodness and mercy, and therefore to his most holy Name we do aferibe all honour, glory and praise: and to the end this unfeigned thankfulness may never be forgotten, but may be had in a perpetual remembrance, that all ages to come may yield praises to his Divine Majestie for the fame, and have in memory that joyful day of deliverance; be it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, with the assent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the fame. That the twenty-third day of October shall be kept and celebrated as an anniversary holy day in this kingdom anniwifaiy for ever, and that all persons do at that day forbeare all bodily for labour, and the exercise of their trades; and that all and singular

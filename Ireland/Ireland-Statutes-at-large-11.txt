accurate experiments} from whence a necessity arises of impowering the magistrate to vary the allowance to the baker, as the price of wheat and flour varies, which creates much trouble to the magistrate, and occasions frequent disputes between him and the baker: and whereas it is therefore judged expedient to ascertain, as near as may be, the just quantity, which a quarter of wheat shall be supposed to produce, and to fix a certain reasonable allowance, to the baker, which shall never vary, except when the increase of his necessary expences in baking may re-instead of quire it: be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and h7’7h1d °d temPora^ anl' commons in this present parliament assembled, and whit* by the authority of the same, that from the twenty fourth annexed(aW' June one thousand seven hundred and seventy eight

The nineteenth and twentieth years of George III;

said last and in the said several other former recited acts particularly mentioned, were discontined, and have ever since ceased to be deemed, taken, or tonfidered as publick turnpike roads in any manner whatsoever; and it being now thought expedient and adviseable for the more effectually carrying into execution the several purposes and intentions of the said several former recited acts and of this present act, that the said road, as herein before particularly described, leading from the city of Dublin to the town of Navan, should be made into two divisions: therefore be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the said road leading as aforesaid from the city of Dublin to the town of Navan shall be divided into two parts or districts, as follows, that is to say, that so much of the said road, as reaches from Stoncybatter aforesaid to the Black Bull Inn adjoining the turn of the road to Trim, shall hereafter be known and dif-tinjuished by the name of the southern division of the said road; and so much thereof, as reaches from the Black Bull Inn aforesaid, in and to the town of Navan, shall hereafter be distinguislted and known by the name of the northern division of the said road.

mentioned, then and in every such case such person or persons 1779-80. shall pay the said respective tolls and duties twice in the fame day, Chap. 43. jt being the true intent and meaning of this act, that the pay-' ment of tolls at any of the gates or toll houses on the

fouthem division shall not be an exemption from the payment of toil in the northern division, and that the payment of tolls at any of tire gates or toll houses on the northern division shall not be an exemption of payment of toll in the fouthem division of said road 5 and that no person or persons after the time aforesaid shall travel over or pass in one and the fame day more of the said road* than is contained in any one of the foregoing divisions, without being compelled or compellable as aforesaid and obliged to pay the said respective toll twice the fame day.

Provided always, and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the time aforesaid no person or persons shall be obliged to pay any of the said tolls and duties more than once in the fame day within any one of the said divift. ons of the said road, but that every person having paid the said toll or duty, as hereby laid and imposed, at any one of the gate, erected or to be erected between the city of Dublin and the Black Bull Inn aforesaid, on producing a note or ticket thereof shall be permitted to pass free through all the other several gates with-in the said division any time during the day, in which he has once paid the said toll or duty as aforesaid, or on which the said ticket bears date, and so in like manner every person having paid the said toll or duty at any one of the gates on the said road between the said Black Bull Inn and to the said town of Na-van, called the northern division of said road, shall on producing such ticket be admitted to pass free through all the several gates now or hereafter to be erected within the said division; which said ticket or note the receiver or receivers, collector or collectors, at any of the said gates within either or any of the said divisions are to give at the time of payment for the fame gratis.

XII. And whereas' there is a power in the said first recited act of the third year of his said late Majesty for the surveyor or Purveyors, of such persons as he or they shall appoint, to dig, raise, and carry away any gravel, furze, sand, (tones, or other materials in any grounds of any person or persons whatsoever, except as therein excepted, for the purposes therein mentioned, paying to the owner or occupier of such grounds for the value thereof, and making reasonable compensation for any damage done thereby to such owner or occupier; but it has been found,

-that as no penalty is inflicted by the said act for refilling to per- A.D. mit the said materials to be used and carried away for the purposes 1779-80. aforesaid, particularly the digging for and raising gravel; that i'ome Chap. 43. persons have taken advantage thereof and have refused to permit the said trustees or their surveyor to take away the fame for the use of said road, which hath sometimes been attended with inconvenience: therefore be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the said first: day of August one fhoiifand seven hundred and eighty that any person or periods, Who shall refuse, hinder, or R prevent arty seven or more of the said trustees, or their surveyor entrance to or surveyors, from entring upon any such grounds', as therein described and mentioned, and therein or thereon to dig, raise, tcHals, at bjr gather, take, and carry away any gravel, furze, sand, stones, r. 6.’forfeit9’ or other materials, for the purposes and under the conditions *o1, therein mentioned, such person or persons shall forfeit and pay for every such offence the fumi of twenty pounds, to be levied by distress or sale of the goods of such offender, or of such owner or occupier of such ground or land, by the warrant of any two of his Majesty's justices of the peace for the county, in which such offence shall be committed, upon conviction on the oaths of any seven of the said trustees or of their surveyor or surveyors as aforesaid.

XIII. And whereas great part of the road lying between Clo-nee and the Black Bull is in winter seasons overflowed by the river, which runs from the bridge on the Trim road near the Black Bull to the bridge of Mulhuddard, occasioned by the bank which dams in the said river being broken and worn away in several places, and by the bed and fides of said river not being kept dean or open by the owners or occupiers of the lands through which the' said river runs as aforesaid, by means whereof the said: part of the road is greatly damaged, and the gravel swept off the fame, and the road thereby rendered unsafe and dangerous to'travellers: wherefore be it enacted by the autho- p rity aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful to and for the fur- inspect the veyor or surveyors, appointed in virtue of the powers and pursuant thereto in the former recited acts and herein contained, and MMuUari, such person or persons as he or they shall, or the said trustees or any seven' or more' of thenV, shall appoint, from time to time to view and inspect the progress of the said river from the Black Bull bridge to the' bridge of Mulhuddard, and for that purpose to enter upon the lands of the several persons, through which the to eMef said river runs, and when and so often as he or they shall find lanJi, the said river Hopped or obstructed, or the bank of said river

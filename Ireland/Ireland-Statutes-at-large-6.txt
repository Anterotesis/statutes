w

WHEREAS by an act passed in the fifth year of the 5 a. 2. is. reign of his present Majesty King George the second, intituled, An act for repairing the road leading from the town of continunHo Kilcullen in the county of Kildare to the city of Kilkenny, several j. c. 32.f.i. tolls and duties were granted and made payable for repairing the StI1' said road, which said act was to commence from the first day of May in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty two, and from thence to continue in force during the term "co"? irnf-of twenty one years: and whereas the trustccs appointed to put have imr-

' J " , rowed 2600l.

the said act in execution have borrowed the sum of two thou- (till unpaid, sand six hundred pounds on the credit thereof, which is still unpaid, and have applied the fame, together with the tolls collect-cd by virtue of the said act, in amending that part of the said I 10 Laugh-road which leads from the said town of Kilcullen to Laughlin-bridge, and great progress hath been made in repairing thereof: cnL^"lPjj1n1l‘ and whereas by a clause in the said act it is enacted, " That idtantsofKi!from and after the said road from the said town of Kilcullen

" credit of the said toll, shall be applied towards repairing the fromiiffnfficiToat' leading from Laughlin-bridge to the city of Kilkenny wy cif the ftrhich is adjudged a very great inconvenience to the inhabitants of the county of the city of Kilkenny and county of Kilkenny, who frequently travel the said road and pay the said toll without any hope or prospect of having the said road repaired, by reason the toll collected by the said act proves insufficient, either to pay the said principal sum of two thousand six hundred pounds so borrowed, or the interest thereof, or to repair and amend that part of the said road which leads from the said town of Kilcullen to Laughlin-bridge: and whereas a great part of that part of the Scarcity of fa;j roacj wTnich leads from the town of Catherlough in the coun-

timCMHiS to repair part of ty of Catherlough to the city of Kilkenny, by reason of the the 10.1J. depth, and nature of the foil, and the great scarcity of materials to repair and amend the fame, and the length and extent of the Laid road from the said town of Kilcullen to the said city of Kilkenny cannot be repaired and sufficiently amended by the tolls and duties made payable by the said act, but that it is of absolute necessity in order to repair and amend the fame effectually, that the said road from the said town of Catherlough to the city of Kilkenny be' erected into a separate and distinct turnpike, so NccciTary as that a toll be collected and received on that part of the said parattftimi- road separated and distinct from the toll collected or received on p:kc from Ca- tjlc otjjgr part of the said road, which leads from the said town

That the said act, made in the fifth year of the reign of his pre-S c. 2.18. sent' Majesty King George the second, and all and every the au-chiSo'nnd'aa thorities, powers, articles, rules, penalties, and clauses therein cd^continued confined (except the herein before recited clause, and what are from the end ' hereby altered) shall be of full force and effect, and shall continue forhirthe" and be executed from and after the expiration of the said term of c °t?c+ -twenty one years for and during the further term of twenty four years, and from thence,-to the end of - the then next session of Parliament, for the intents and purposes in the said act and hereafter mentioned, as if the fame powers and authority granted and given by the said act were herein again repeated and re-enacted in the budy of this present act j any thing in the former act contained to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.

HEREAS by an act passed in the fifth year of the 5 a. 2. is. reign of his present Majesty King George the second, intituled, An aB for repairing the road leading from the town of continunHo Kilcullen in the county of Kildare to the city of Kilkenny, several j.c. 32.f.i. tolls and duties were granted and made payable for repairing the StI1' said road, which said act was to commence from the first day of May in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty two, and from thence to continue in force during the term "co"? irnf-of twenty one years: and whereas the trustccs appointed to put have imr-

' J “ , rowed 2600!.

the said act in execution have borrowed the sum of two thou- (till unpaid, sand six hundred pounds on the credit thereof, which is still un-paid, and have applied the fame, together with the tolls collect-cd by virtue of the said act, in amending that part of the said I 10 Laugh-road which leads from the said town of Kilcullen to Laughlin-bridge, and great progress hath been made in repairing thereof: cnL^"lPjj1n1l‘ and whereas by a clause in the said act it is enacted, “ That idtantsofKi!-“ from and after the said road from the said town of Kilcullen

timCMHiS to

repair part of ty of Catherlough to the city of Kilkenny, by reason of the the 10.1J. depth, and nature of the foil, and the great scarcity of materials to repair and amend the fame, and the length and extent of the Laid road from the said town of Kilcullen to the said city of Kilkenny cannot be repaired and sufficiently amended by the tolls and duties made payable by the said act, but that it is of absolute necefiity in order to repair and amend the fame effectually, that the said road from the said town of Catherlough to the city of Kilkenny be' erected into a separate and distinct turnpike, so NccciTary as that a toll be collected and received on that part of the said parattftimi- road separated and distinct from the toll collected or received on p:kc from Ca- tjlc otjjgr part of the said road, which leads from the said town

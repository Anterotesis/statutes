VII. And whereas the altering or defacing the names, cyphers, crcfts, or arms, engraved upon plate, or watches, after the fame have been unlawfully or fclouioully taken front the right owners thereof, in many instanecs prevents the discovery and detection of thefts and robberies, and of other offences; be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no person whomsoever, shall, upon any f'Tw pretence, change, alter, or deface the name engraved upon any faced or al-tvatcli, as the maker or owner thereof, or the number of such , watch, or the place where made, or any coat of arms, or crcft thereon, or on any part or case thereof, nor shall any person change, at auflion, alter, or deface the name, cypher, crest, or arms, engraved upon ulonmT any article, or piece of family plate, whether gold or fiiver, without the consent of the owner thereof in writing, or of fomeper-

XIV. And whereas if regular and proper notices or summonses were to be duly served on the respective persons who shall have pledged goods with any pawn-broker resident within the district of the metropolis of the city of Dublin, or within three miles thereof, it would render the appraisement of such goods so depofned, as set forth and required by said recited act unnecessary, and thereby considerably reduce the expence of proceeding to the falc of such pledges: be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no pawnbroker aforesaid; shall procure an appraisement of Notice as any pawn or pledge deposited with him or her, but instead of such fomssW appraisement, as is set forth in said receited act, each and every of +1-the said pawn-brokers on the expiration of the time mentioned therein for the release and redemption of such pledges respectively, where the sum lent thereon amounts to four shillings, it being hereby declared unnecessary to serve either notices, or bills of appraisement for such pledges, or for any smaller sum, shall obtain a

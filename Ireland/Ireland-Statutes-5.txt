XI. And whereas by an act made in the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the reigi} of his Majesty King Charlefc the second, intituled, An act for the better ordering the felting of wines and aqua vita, together with all forts of strong waters by retail, it is enabled among other things, that every retailer of aqua vitas or other kind- of strong water whatsoever shall be obliged to take out a licence for that purpose, and fnall for such licence pay such sum, as shall be agreed upon;so as none do pay less than the sum of ten shillings yearly, and none be compelled to pay more in the city and county of the city of Dublin than ten pounds yearly, and in dl other places than five pounds yearly:and whereas the number of spirit retailers, and the consumption of low pricedand noxious spirits have of late grievously increased m the city and county of Dublin to the manifril encouragement of drunkenness and all forts of disorders to the ruin of many valuable trades and manufactures, and to the great detriment of the health of his Majesty's subjects: for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and immediately after the paffingofthis act there shall be payable to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, for every licence to be granted for felling aqua vitas, or any kind of strong waters or spirits whatsoever, by retail in the said city, and within four miles of the Tholfel of the said city, as well within franchises and liberties as without, such sum, as shall

<The third Tear o/'George I! f. be agreed to be paid for such licence pursuant to the direction of the said act of the seventeenth and eighteenth of Charles the second;so as none do pay lef* than the sum of four pounds yearly, and none shall be compelled to pay more than ten pounds yearly, a»)T law to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

XII. And whereas there are at present great quantities of low priced and noxious spirits (old in obfeure and un-licenced houses, and the increasing the duty upon spirit licences will be an additional temptation to persons to fell without licence:and whereas abuses of this kind' do fre^ qnently pass unpuni/hed; in order therefore for the more expeditious determining and effectual preventing the same, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and^may be lawful to and for any one or more of the chief com- enmmiftiooert missioners of excise to hear and determine all complaints, and of eiafc may to levy all foifeitures, that shall be made or incurred by or determine against any person or persons for felling spirits without li- comPl*UW4»*cence, in the lame manner and as effectually to all intents and

purposes, as any three of the said chief commissioners are now impo>vered to do, with like remedy of appeal as herein after mentioned.

XIII. And whereas by the said recited act, passed in the thirty third year of the reign of his Lite Majesty King George the second, lecognizances are to be entered into by persons applying for licences to fell victuals, beer, ale, wine, and strong waters in manner as by the said act is dinefted, and such fees only are to be paid for the same, as are allowed

in two several acts of Parliament made in the reign of King 14 and »5 C. *. Charles the second in the said act of the thirty third year of c ^

King George the second particularly recited: and whereas ^

the fee, allowed by the said acts to the collectors of the duty arising from licences, is after the rate of two shillings for every year, which should be comprized in such licence fof felling of wines, and after the tate of twelve pence for every year which should be comprised in such licence for felling of strong waters, and no more 5 and the said collectors are not to exact or receive from any person to be licenced any sum of money, fee, or reward for the said recognizance, licence, or acquittance, other than as aforesaid, upon pain of forfeit# ing the sum of ten pounds sterling, and being put from his office:and whereas the directions m the said recited act of the thirty third year of the reign of King George the second concerning the taking of recognizances and granting of licences have occaiioned a great additional trouble and expence to the collectors of the duty arising from licences, particularly in the district of Dublin, and the fees allowed by law for the same are by no means adequate to the trouble and expence thereof: be It therefore enacted by the authoiity aforesaid, That from and after the twenty fourth

duty of four pence; and upon every gallon of strong waters^perfectly made, imported from beyond Teas, the rate and strong waters duty of twelve pence: and whereas some doubts have been perfectly made and raised concerning certain liquors imported into ""dc. this kingdom, called brandy, rum, and geneva, whether the same should pay the rate and duty laid by the said act upon (pints made of wine or cyder imported, or the rate and duty aid thereby upon strong waters perfectly made imported from beyond seas: and whereas ever since the commencement of the said act, brandy upon the importation thereof into this kingdom has been rated for the duty of excise as of the value of six shillings and eight pence the gallon, and rum and geneva ever since the first importation thereof into this kingdom have been rated for the duty of excise as of the lame value with brandy, whereby the duties of excise received upon the importation of the said commodities by virtue of and under the said act have been four pence the gallon, and no more: and whereas it is apprehended, that an increase of duty of eight pence the gallon upon the said commodities over and above the duty, heretofore paid upon the importation thereof, would be a great temptation to smugglers to run large quantities of the said commodities into this kingdom, and would in many other respects be prejudicial to the trade thereof: therefore in order to remove all such doubts for the future, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that all brandy, rum, and geneva, which at any Brandy, time heretofore hath been, or at any time hereafter shall be, rum, and ge-imported into this kindoro, shall be deemed and considered at all times heretofore to have been, and at all times here- a£ & a.

after to be, subject and liable to a duty of excise of four cife of 4<L per

their spirituous liquors, and in order to prevent the officers of excise from gauging the same, or taking (lock therein, make use of various contrivances by placing the same in such situations, as that the officers cannot without great inconvenience and lpfs of time execute their duty with effect: for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every common dilliller or maker of spirits or^^ j aquavit* for sale shall cause all their calks and vessels, in t^ci°r vcfi^Uas which such spirits shall be tlorcd, to be placed in such to he readily situations respectively, as that the officers of excise may gauged, ftc. readily and effectually take the gauge thereof 5 and in default of their being placed in such situations for the purpose aforesaid the said officers of excise are hereby directed and authorized to take the dimensions of the outside of such calks or vessels, and to charge the duties of excise according to such dimensions, as if such calk or vessel were of the lame contents within.

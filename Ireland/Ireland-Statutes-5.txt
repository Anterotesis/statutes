On licence for retailing aqua vitae, strong waters, or spirits in Dublin, as herein.

The third Year of George III. having charge or command of any ship or vessel trading inr or to any of the ports of this kingdom, shall accommodate such officer or officers of the revenue, as shall be placed on board such ship or vessel, with beds or hammocks, not exceeding two at one time, to rest or deep in under the deck of such ship 9r vessel, upon pain of forfeiting the sum of five shillings English money for every twenty four hours such , master, purser, or other person having charge of such ship or vessel, shall neglect or refuse so to do; which said penalty shall and may be recovered against the master, purser, oc other person having charge or command of such ship or vessel, by warrant under the hands and seals of the commissioners and sub-commissioners of excise in their several and respective districts, or the major part of them, to arrtft the person of such master, purser, or other person having the charge or command of such ship or vessel, and to commit him or them to the gaol of the city or county wherein such warrant shall be granted, there to remain until the said penalty is paid, a summons being first issued, and proof made of the said offence either by the confession of the party charged therewith or by other sufficient evidence upon oath, which oath the of and sub-commissioners in their several and respective districts, or the major part of them, are hereby authorized to administer.

XI. And whereas by an act made in the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the reigi} of his Majesty King Charless the second, intituled, An act for the better ordering the felting of wines and aqua vita, together with all forts of strong waters by retail, it is enabled among other things, that every retailer of aqua vitas or other kind- of strong water whatsoever shall be obliged to take out a licence for that purpose, and shall for such licence pay such sum, as shall be agreed upon; so as none do pay less than the sum of ten shillings yearly, and none be compelled to pay more in the city and county of the city of Dublin than ten pounds yearly, and in dl other places than five pounds yearly: and whereas the number of spirit retailers, and the consumption of low pricedand noxious spirits have of late grievously increased in the city and county of Dublin to the manifril encouragement of drunkenness and all forts of disorders to the ruin of many valuable trades and manufactures, and to the great detriment of the health of his Majesty's subjects: for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and immediately after the passing ofthis act there shall be payable to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, for every licence to be granted for felling aqua vitas, or any kind of strong waters or spirits whatsoever, by retail in the said city, and within four miles of the Tholfel of the said city, as well within franchises and liberties as without, such sum, as shall be

<The third Tear of George I! f. be agreed to be paid for such licence pursuant to the direction of the said act of the seventeenth and eighteenth of Charles the second; so as none do pay lef* than the sum of four pounds yearly, and none shall be compelled to pay more than ten pounds yearly, a»)T law to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

XII. And whereas there are at present great quantities of low priced and noxious spirits (old in obscure and un-licenced houses, and the increasing the duty upon spirit licences will be an additional temptation to persons to fell without licence: and whereas abuses of this kind' do fre^ questly pass unpunished; in order therefore for the more expeditious determining and effectual preventing the same, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful to and for any one or more of the chief com- enmmiftiooert missioners of excise to hear and determine all complaints, and of eiafc may to levy all forfeitures, that shall be made or incurred by or determine against any person or persons for selling spirits without li- comPl*UW4»*cence, in the lame manner and as effectually to all intents and

purposes, as any three of the said chief of are now impo>vered to do, with like remedy of appeal as herein after mentioned.

XIII. And whereas by the said recited act, passed in the thirty third year of the reign of his Lite Majesty King George the second, lecognizances are to be entered into by persons applying for licences to fell victuals, beer, ale, wine, and strong waters in manner as by the said act is dinefted, and such fees only are to be paid for the same, as are allowed

in two several acts of Parliament made in the reign of King 14 and »5 C. Charles the second in the said act of the thirty third year of c

King George the second particularly recited: and whereas the fee, allowed by the said acts to the collectors of the duty arising from licences, is after the rate of two shillings for every year, which Should be comprized in such licence fof felling of wines, and after the tate of twelve pence for every year which Should be comprised in such licence for felling of strong waters, and no more 5 and the said collectors are not to exact or receive from any person to be licenced any sum of money, fee, or reward for the said recognizance, licence, or acquittance, other than as aforesaid, upon pain of forfeit# ing the sum of ten pounds sterling, and being put from his office: and whereas the directions in the said recited act of the thirty third year of the reign of King George the second concerning the taking of recognizances and granting of licences have occasioned a great additional trouble and expence to the collectors of the duty arising from licences, particularly in the district of Dublin, and the fees allowed by law for the same are by no means adequate to the trouble and expence thereof: be It therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty fourth

Ill, And whereas by an act made in the twelfth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the first, intituled, An act to prevent marriages by degraded clergymen and popish priejls, and for preventing marriages conjiimmated from being avoided by precontracts, and for the more effectual puniffmerit of bigamy, it is made felony in a popish priest to marry, or take upon him to marry, two persons, where either one or both of them are protestants: and whereas by an act made in the nineteenth year of his present Majesty, intituled, An act for annulling all marriages, to be celebrated by any popish priejl between protefant and protefant, and between protestant and papijl j and to amend and make more effectual an act passed in this kingdom in the fxth year of the reign of her late Majesty tfueen Anne, intituled, An act for the more effectual preventing the taking away and marrying children against the wills of their parents or guardians, all marriages celebrated by popish priests, where one or both of the parties are protestants, are made and declared null and void; since which a doubt hath arisen, whether it is felony within the said first recited act for a popish priest to celebrate marriage, where one or both of the parties are protestants; by which such popish priests are encouraged to deceive and impose upon his Majesty’s protestant subjects by taking upon them to celebrate marriage between them: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every popish priest or reputed popish priest, who from and after the first day of May one thousand seven hundred and fifty shall celebrate any marriage contrary to the said first recited act, and be thereof convicted, such popish priest shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy or of the statute, and suffer death accordingly, although the marriage, so celebrated by such popish priest, be declared null and void by the said last receited act.

II. We well remember the ceffation, and the peace which our royal father of bleffed memorie had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irifh fubje&s of that our kingdom, and by which he was compelled to give them a full pardon fer what they had before done amifs upon their return to their dutie, and their promife of giving his Majeftje a vigorous affiftance, and that from that time divers perfons of honour and qualitie had not (that we know or have heard of) fwerved from their allegiance towards him or us. We could not forget the peace that ourfelf was afterwards neceffitated to make with our faid fubjetts, in the time when they who wickedly ufurped the authorise in this kingdom, had erefted that odious court for the taking away of the life of our dear father; and . then no bodie can wonder that wc were defirous, though

And therefore we could not but hold our felf obliged to perform what we owe by that peace, to thofe who had honeftly and faithfully performed what they had proroifed to us, though we and they were miferably difappointed of the affcA of thofe promifes, by an unhappy part of them which foolilhly forfeited all the grace which they might have Aed from us.

h And in the laft place, we did and muft alwaies re-member the great affbAion a confiderable part of that nation expreft to us, during the time of our being beyond the ftas, when with all cheerfulnefs and obedience, they received and fubmitted to our orders, and betook themfelves to that fervice which we direAed as mod convenient and beboofeful at that time to us, though attended with incon-veniencie enough to themfelves 5 which demeanour of theirs cannot but be thought verie worthie of our proteAion, juf-tiee and favour ; and yet all thefe important confideratioRs and obligations appeared (o many contradiAions to the prefent intereft of our good fubjeAs in that our kingdom, who had at this time Hkewife merited very much from os, and for wb#fe fecuritie and advantage we held our felf obliged tb provide as well as for their indempnitie, and fo the good fettlement of that our kingdom appeared much the more difficult unto us, and even leflened and abated much of that joy of heart we found ourfelf poflefled with, for the great bleffings we enjoy in the peace and quiet of this our Kingdom of England.

V. But we raifed our fpirits again with the comfortable affurance that God who had wrought fo much for us in .England would graciouily bring his work to the fame per-feAion in Ireland, and not iuffer our good fubjeAs to weep in the one kingdom, whiled they rejoyced in the other; and our fatisfaAion was much increafed, when upon conference with feveral of our good fubjeAs of that nation of quality and intereft, who were concerned both as foldiers and adventurers, we found that they had a due fbnfe of the obligations which lay upon our honour and j iftice; and were very willing, that we fhould comply with both, and that the foundations of the peace and fecurity of that kingdom (hould be raifed upon our difeharge of thofe obligations ; and after they had fpent much time amongft others, who were as much or more concerned than themfelves, they freely confented to fuch conclufions as to our under-ftanding may reafonably take with all juft interefts; and we cannot doubt but that all who have merited from us, will confefs that we have been fo far from being failing to

Ahd therefore in the firft place, in order to a fetde-ment of that mtereft claimed by the adventurers, although the prefent eflates and pofieffions they enjoy, if they were examined*by the drift letter of the law, would prove very defeftive and invalid, at being no ways purfnant to thofo afts of Parliament upon which they pretend to be founded, but rather feem to be a drufture upon their fobfeqaent af~ fent, both to different mediums 'ana ends than the obfer-v?nce of thofe ; yet we bein& always more ready to con* fult (where the prejudice can onely refleft upon ourfelf) with our natural inclinations to mercy (we praife God we can fay fo) than with the pofitive realon of law ; we do" hereby declare, that all the lands, tenements and hereditaments, of which all or any of the adventurers were pof-Ailed the feventh day of May, one thoufand fix hundred fifty nine, having been allotted or fet out to them, or enjoyed by them as adventurers in fatisfaftion of and for their, adventures shall be confirmed and made good to them, their heirs and affigns for ever, with allowance or correction of the admeafurement, according to the tenor and directions of the refpeftive aft of Parliament of XVIi and XVIII Cardli9 as to Engliih or plantation meafare, except as is hereafter excepted ; and that the deficient adven^ turer, either in part or in whole, shall be fatisfied out of the moiety of the counties of Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford, in the province of Munfter; the King’s county, the Queen’s county, and the counties of Eaft-Meath and Weft meath, in the province of Leinfter; and the counties of Down, Antrim, and Armagh, in the province of Ulfter, not yet fet out to the faid adventurers ; as alfo the forfeited lands in the county of Lowth, (except the barony of Athcrdee in the faid county) and faid province of Leinfter ; fuch adventurers claiming and making their deficiencies appear before the firft day of May next; and in cafe the faid lands, fo for fupply of deficiencies fet forth, shall not be fufficient, we will appoint fome other convenient forfeited lands for their fadsfaftion, fo that all their deficiencies fhall fpeedily be fupplied.

All other particulars abovementioned, being fully effefted, we truft, through the goodnefs of God, that that near ruined kingdom will be reftored to peace and plenty; and that by fuch fignal evidences of our jufticc, favour and mercy, the wicked will be deterred from their wickednefs, and the good encouraged and confirmed in refolutions of loyalty towards us, and peace among one another. And as in this our declaration, we have made choice of thofe means which in our wifdom and judgment we have efteemed moft conducible to the quiet and ictde-ment of that our kingdom, fo we edeem it neceflary further to declare, That it is our firm intention forthwith 10 call a Parliament in that onr kingdom, and effedually ta recommend unto our chief governour or govemours, privy council, and our faid Parliament, the eftatlifhing by laws there all the particulars mentioned in this our declaration, and fuch others as shall be found neceflary for the good of our people there ; and after fuch bills are pall, that then an aft of free and general pardon, indempmty and oblivion, shall be granted to all our fubiefts of and in Ireland, notorious murderers only excepted.

may, by their care and wifdome, be re&ified, and the .............

juft part thereof confirmed : as alfo, that a fuitable ad for Ireland, for confirming judicial proceedings there in the Four-courts, may be there paft ; and another ad for ratifying all decrees and judgments in the court of claims and Exchequer of Dublin, and the claims of our protef-tant fubjeds of Ireland, that fo all our fubjeds being legally fettled and confirmed in their lives, properties and eftates, they may, without fear for the future, betake themfelves to m$nd the ruines and defolations of fo long and bloody war, and live in comfort and unity : and we more than hope, that by our thus proceeding, the world will believe nothing of our own advantage can come in competition with the peace and good of our fubjeds; for we referve little to our Self but the fatisfadion of contenting all in-terefts, at the price of freely parting with almoft all the great forfeitures vefted in us by law in that our kingdom : and if by this indulgence we shall attain that de-fired end, it will be much more confiderable unto us, than the rate at which we purchafe it.

XXXIII.	And we further declare, that whereas feveral of the adventurers and fouldiers having made a thankful eftimation of our grace and favour exprefled by this our declaration, in fettling them in a peaceable pofleflion and right of what they enjoy, by our waving thofe many advantages devolved upon us by law, have voluntarily ex-preft their own willingnefs and confidence of the forward-nefs of all the reft of their brethren, in contributing one half years full value of the profits arifing of the faid lands as aforefaid fet out for their refpedive adventures and arrears, to be paid in one year, towards the relief and reparations of the lofles of fuch as we shall judge have raoft eminently aded for and fuffered with us ; ana that (bveral of the adventurers having exprefled their own willingnefs, and confidence of the forwardnefs of the reft of the adventurers to beftow upon us as a further evidence of that thankfiilnefs, in confideration of our grace and favour in the aforefaid fettlement, one other half years rent more of full value to be paid in one other year; we cannot but declare our acceptance of fuch their free and kind offer, and when a bill shall be tendred unto us upon the accompt, and for the ends aforefaid, it shall be received by us as gracioudy as fuch an evidence of their affedion and refped doth deferve.

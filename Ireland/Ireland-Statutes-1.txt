of Ireland, of what degree or quality soever, greeting; .A. P.

It having pleased Almighty God out of his great mercy 1662. and companion towards us, and all our subjects, to restore Chap. 2. us in so wonderful a manner to each other, and with so wonderful circumllances of affection and confidence in each other as mull for ever fill our hearts (if we are in any degree sensible of such blessings) with an humble and grate-full acknowledgment of the obligation we owe to his Divine Providence, that he would vouchsafe to work that miracle for us himself, which no endeavours of our own could bring to pass: We think it agreeable to the just sense we have, and ought to have of the good affection of all our good subjects, who have contributed so much in bringing this unspeakable blessing upon us and themselves, that we acknowledge that our good subjects in our kingdome of Ireland have born a very good part in procuring this happiness, that they were early in their dutifall ad-dreffes to us, and made the same professions of resolution to return to their duty and obedience to us, during the time of our being beyond the seas, which they ha^e since so eminently made good and put in practice; however it was not cafy for us to make any publick declaration with reference to that our kingdome, there being many difficulties in the providing for, and complying with the several interests ana pretences there, which we were bound in honour and justice in some degree to take care of, and which were different from the difficulties we were to contend within this kingdom: we well knew the acts of Parliament which had formerly pad for the security of the adventurers in that kingdom, and had heard of the proceedings which had been thereupon, by which very many officers, souldiers, and others, as well of this, as that our kingdome were in possession of a great part of the lands of that our kingdom, and of whose interests we resolve to be very careful.

II. We well remember the cessation, and the peace which our royal father of blessed memorie had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom, and by which he was compelled to give them a full pardon fer what they had before done amiss upon their return to their dutie, and their promise of giving his Majestje a vigorous assistance, and that from that time divers persons of honour and qualitie had not (that we know or have heard of) swerved from their allegiance towards him or us. We could not forget the peace that ourself was afterwards necessitated to make with our said subjects, in the time when they who wickedly usurped the authorise in this kingdom, had erected that odious court for the taking away of the life of our dear father; and.then no bodie can wonder that wc were desirous, though

upon

A. D. open difficult conditions, to get such an united power of 1662. our own subjects, as might have been able, with God's Chap. 2. blessing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible par-

III. And therefore we could not but hold our self obliged to perform what we owe by that peace, to those who had honestly and faithfully performed what they had proroifed to us, though we and they were miserably disappointed of the affcA of those promises, by an unhappy part of them which foolilhly forfeited all the grace which they might have Aed from us.

h And in the last place, we did and must alwaies re-member the great affbAion a considerable part of that nation exprest to us, during the time of our being beyond the ftas, when with all cheerfulness and obedience, they received and submitted to our orders, and betook themselves to that service which we directed as most convenient and beboofeful at that time to us, though attended with incon-veniencie enough to themselves 5 which demeanour of theirs cannot but be thought verie worthie of our proteAion, juf-tiee and favour; and yet all these important consideratioRs and obligations appeared (o many contradiAions to the present interest of our good subjects in that our kingdom, who had at this time Likewise merited very much from os, and for wb#fe securitie and advantage we held our self obliged tb provide as well as for their indempnitie, and so the good settlement of that our kingdom appeared much the more difficult unto us, and even lessened and abated much of that joy of heart we found ourself possessed with, for the great blessings we enjoy in the peace and quiet of this our Kingdom of England.

V. But we raised our spirits again with the comfortable assurance that God who had wrought so much for us in .England would graciouily bring his work to the same per-feAion in Ireland, and not iuffer our good subjects to weep in the one kingdom, whiled they rejoyced in the other; and our satisfaAion was much increased, when upon conference with several of our good subjects of that nation of quality and interest, who were concerned both as soldiers and adventurers, we found that they had a due fbnfe of the obligations which lay upon our honour and j iftice; and were very willing, that we should comply with both, and that the foundations of the peace and security of that kingdom should be raised upon our discharge of those obligations; and after they had spent much time amongst others, who were as much or more concerned than themselves, they freely consented to such conclusions as to our under-standing may reasonably take with all just interests; and we cannot doubt but that all who have merited from us, will confefs that we have been so far from being failing to

VI. Ahd therefore in the first place, in order to a fetde-ment of that mtereft claimed by the adventurers, although the present estates and pofiessions they enjoy, if they were examined*by the drift letter of the law, would prove very defective and invalid, at being no ways purfnant to thofo acts of Parliament upon which they pretend to be founded, but rather seem to be a drufture upon their fobfeqaent af- sent, both to different mediums 'ana ends than the obfer-v?nce of those; yet we bein& always more ready to con* fult (where the prejudice can onely reflect upon ourself) with our natural inclinations to mercy (we praise God we can fay so) than with the positive realon of law; we do" hereby declare, that all the lands, tenements and hereditaments, of which all or any of the adventurers were pof-Ailed the seventh day of May, one thousand six hundred fifty nine, having been allotted or set out to them, or enjoyed by them as adventurers in satisfaction of and for their, adventures shall be confirmed and made good to them, their heirs and assigns for ever, with allowance or correction of the admeasurement, according to the tenor and directions of the respective act of Parliament of XVIi and XVIII Cardli9 as to English or plantation meafare, except as is hereafter excepted; and that the deficient adven^ turer, either in part or in whole, shall be satisfied out of the moiety of the counties of Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford, in the province of Munster; the King's county, the Queen's county, and the counties of Eaft-Meath and West meath, in the province of Leinster; and the counties of Down, Antrim, and Armagh, in the province of Ulster, not yet set out to the said adventurers; as also the forfeited lands in the county of Lowth, (except the barony of Athcrdee in the said county) and said province of Leinster; such adventurers claiming and making their deficiencies appear before the first day of May next; and in case the said lands, so for supply of deficiencies set forth, shall not be sufficient, we will appoint some other convenient forfeited lands for their fadsfaftion, so that all their deficiencies shall speedily be supplied.

An Act of free and general pardon y indemnity, and oblivion.

but very reasonable that the abusers of so much mercy held forth by us, should not be partakers thereof.

VIII. And whereas several legal incumbrances do, and

may rest upon the lands set out to adventurers and souldiers as aforesaid, we are pleased further graciously to declare, that the said adventurers and souldiers shall receive fatif-faftion out of the forfeited lands in the county of Kildare, saving the lands and estate of Christopher Eustace, commonly called Mad-Etiftace, in the said county, or elfe- Â»

where, which it is our will and pleasure be forth with re-

llored to him and his heirs for all statutes, recognizances, judgments, mortgages, dowers, joyntures, lease for life or lives, or for years, rent-charge, or other such incumbrances charged on their estates, such incumbrances being made appeare by the twenty second of October, 1661, before such as shall be thereunto commiiiioned with all convenient speed after this declaration.

IX. Being sensible, that several l officers who were engaged in our service in Ireland, and eminently acted and flittered therein, have by the partiality and injustice of the powers then in being received no satisfaction for the same, we are therefore further pleased graciousty to declare, that all commissioned officers, their heirs or assigns, who were in regiments, troops, or companies raised in Ireland, or transported out of England, and served our royal father or ourself in the wars in Ireland, at any time before the fifth of June, 1649, other than those who have received lands or money, for their pay due unto them (ince the fifth of June, 1649, shall be satisfied their respective personal arrears out of the particulars following, <viz.

And the said securities are hereby committed and entrusted into the hands of such persons for the uses aforesaid, as the duke of Albemarl, general of all our armies, and the lord marquess of Ormond, lord Reward of our houlhold, by us hereby thereunto authorized shall appoint, to be by them let and fet for the best advantage, and to the ends afore* said: and they are alio to assign fit and convenient salaries for such persons as shall be imployed therein, the said fa* lanes to be assigned unto them out of the profits of the (hid securities.

That such protestants, whose estates have been given out for satisfaction of adventurers or souldiers, or other* wife disposed of to any other persons, shall be forthwith restored to their former estates, and a reprizal of equal va* lue, worth, and purchase forth-wkh assigned to such adventurers or souldiers, as shall be removed out of their said estates.

XII. Provided no person or persons shall have benefit hereof, who were in the rebellion before the fifteenth of September, one thousand six hundred forty and three, and have taken out decrees for lands in the province of Connaught, or county of Clare, in recompence of their former estates; and that such adventurer, fouldier or other persons, who have been, or shall be removed from the ellate of James lord marquess of Ormond, lord steward of our hduf* hold, for what he poflfeft thereof for adventure or arrears, shall be reprized in the county of Catherloogh for the same; every person so to be removed shall not be ac-comptable for the profits he received whilst he or they enjoy such estates.

Xill. Provided alwayes, that this our declaration, or any thing or matter therein contained, shall not extend to any lands, tenements or hereditaments, which James lord marquess of Ormond, Lord steward of our houshold, or any of his ancestors, barons of Arckloe, vifeounts of Thur-les, or earls of Ormond or OfTory, did at any time heretofore mortgage, grant or demise unto any person or persons in fee, fee-farm, fee-tail, for life or for years, or for any other estate or interest, nor to any lands, tenements or hereditaments, held of the said James lord marquess of Ormond, mediately or immediately*, as of any of his mannors, whereby the forfeited or forfeitable interest of any person or persons in such lands, tenements or hereditaments.

XIV. Provided that this (Kail not extend to any of the lands held of James marqnefs of Ormond, or the lady marchioness his wife as of any their mannors; but that all such lands shall be held of the said James and the lady marchioness, and their heirs, by the same tenure, and at the same rents and services as heretofore; any thing in-thu our declaration to the contrary contained notwithstanding.

XV. And whereas the earl of Inchiquin hath been dif-poflefled of his estate, for his eminent service, and adhering unto usv and is now by ad of Parliament ordered to be restored to his said estate, we are graciously pleased hereby further to declare, that he be accordingly restored to his said estate, and th?t such who shall thereby be removed, and are jtiilly capable of reprize, that they shall be reprized, as others m like cases are to be re-prized.

XVI. And whereas we understand, that by the late usurped powers, during the distempers of these times, several Irish proprietors of the popish religion, have been difpofiefled of their estates, meerly for being papists, and have sued out decrees, and are pofTefTed of lands in the province of Connaught, and county of Clare, in compensation of their former estates, which being an act of their own, we might without any injustice deny to relieve them in, yet so willing we are that any interest intituling itself to equitable mercy might not be disappointed, that we declare, that all innocent papists, being such as shall prove themselves to have been faithful and loyal unto, and never acted againflour royal father or our self since the two and twentieth day of October, one thousand six hundred fortr one, though they have sued out decrees, and are poffef-fed of laid* in the province of Connaught, or county of Clare, in lieu of their former estates, shall notwithstanding be restored to their said estates by the second of May, one thousand six hundred sixty one; provided that the said lands in Connaught and Clare, so allotted to the said papists, be restored unto us to reprife others, or for satistadion of such Irish proprietors thereof, so far as this declaration excludes them nor; or if the said lands in Connaoght and Clare, or any part thereof, have been sold by any such papist, that the said papifl out of his estate, to which he is to be restored, shall pay the purchiie money to the said purchaser, his heires or assignes; and whosoever either by reprife or rcilauration shall enjoy the said lands* shall make fatufaction to the said put chafer for

all

The fourteenth and fifteenth Years of Charles II. all necessary reparations and improvements upon the said lands, before he be admitted to the possession of them.

XVII. Provided also. That whatsoever adventurer or Cbuldier that shall be removed from his present possession, to make room for any such papist, shall forthwith have a rcprize of equal value, worth and purchase, in other forfeited lands.

XVIII. Provided always. That whereas the corporations of Ireland are now planted with English, who have considerably improved at their own charges, and brought trade and manufacture into that our kingdom and by their settlement there do not a little contribute to the peace and settlement of that* countrey, the disturbing or removal of which English would in many respects be very prejudicial; that all such of the popish religion, of any corporations in Ireland, who have been for publick security difpof-fefled of their estates within any corporation, shall be forthwith reprized in forfeited lands, tenements and hereditaments, neer the said corporations, to the full value, worth and purchase of such estate, us he was difpofleft of within such corporation; and that particularly the popish inhabitants of Cork, Youghall, and Kingfale, shall have un-disposed forfeited lands set out to them in the baronies'of Barrimore and Mulkerry in the county of Cork, according to their respeCHve decrees past in that behalf; Provided that in the case of innocent papists within the said respective corporations, that were dispossessed as aforesaid, it shall remain in his Majestie's power to grant restitution in like manner, as is provided in the case of other innocent papists.

XIX. We are also graciously pleased, that the lands and houses set out to any person or persons, for satisfaction of any money lent, or publick debts incurred for provisions, arms, or ammunition, furnilhed for support of our army in Ireland, in the beginning of the rebellion, shall be and remain disposeable for the satisfaClion of such of the said debts, and debentures for such debts, as upon examination of the respective cases shall appear mod deferring confederation and fads faction, in such proportions as shall be thought mod equal and just.

XX. We are likewise graciously pleased to declare, that the lands set out to George duke of Albemarle, captain general of our armies of England, Scotland and Ireland, for his arrears and service in Ireland; as also the lands being for arrears purchased by him, and whereof he is now possessed; and the lands settled upon Roger earl of Orrery, Charles earl of Mountrath, Richard lord baron of Coloony, Chidley Coote, and Thomas Coote Esquires; the relit and, heires of Sir Simon Harcourt, Sir William Penn, and the r^lidl and children of Colonel George Cook, Sir Theo-

A. D. philus Jones, Sir George Ayfcough, and the orphans of

Chap. 2.' in the war of Ireland; as also the lands set out to Richard j Urial and Thomas Croflthwart, of one hundred pounds per annum; as also all such lands tenements and heredi-tements, as Arthur lord viscount of Valentia hath purchifcd from any persons in actual poflfession thereof, by virtue of any grant, order or disposition of the late usurped powers, or any of them, shall be settled and confirmed unto then, their heirs and assigns respectively: and also that land be set out to major George Rawdon, in Satisfaction of debentures due to him for arrears and provisioos fumished for Ireland.

XXI. Provided alwayes, and we do hereby declare, that it is not our intention thereby to weaken or avoid the jut and legal title of any person, that is reftorable by this our declaration; but that if any of the said estates (bill be accordingly restored to the former proprietor, that then a reprize of equal value, worth, and purchase shall forthwith be afiigned in lieu thereof.

XXII. And as we cannot but with extraordinary fad-nefs of heart remember, and even at present behold the desolate and distracted condition that our kingdom of Ireland hath been, and is reduced onto, by the unnatural infurrec* tion begun in the year one thousand six hundred forty one, and consequently abhor and deteft the contrivers and obfti-nate promoters of the same against us, our crown and dignity; so we cannot, upon the considerations formerly cx-preft in this our declaration, deny all just and reasonable pro* vision that may stand with the present j un&ure of our affairs unto such of the Irish nation, who not onely gare early evidences of their repentance for their crimes, but also persevered in their loyalty to us and our commands;

and that as near as we can, our justice and our mercy, in accommodating this interest might not justle each other, we are in a different manner to consider of such of them as are justly intituled to the benefit of those articles of peace formerly mentioned, and such who did not submit unto the.. same, or after a submission made a departure from the same, which two latter forts have justly forfeited that favour which otherwise they might have received. We are also further to consider of those who embraced the said articles, ami submitted to the said peace without any apof* tacy, in a different notion, as of those who remained in that our kingdom, who lued out decrees and received lands in fatlsfaction of their ancient estates, and those who being trampoi ted into forreign parts, through many difficulties united, rendevouzed, and served under our obedience; (b th; t upon these considerations, we think fit and declare, and accordingly do declare, that as tj those who unbraced

H

fourteenth and fifteenth Tears of Charles II* 355

the fsLid articles, and submitted to the said peace and con* A. D. flantly adhered thereunto, and remaining at home sued out 1662. decrees and obtained potiefiion of lands in the province of Chap. 2. Connaught, or county of Clare/ that they are to Hand bound by them, and not to be Relieved against their own adfc, who contented themselves to enjoy a part of satisfaction for their pwn, rather than to attend our restitution, or sub-mit themselves to our, command in forreign parts as others did; and yet if the conditions of those seem hard, they can no more reasonably expect that we should further relieve them, than our friends in England and Ireland can expect that we should pay back to them all the moneys they were compelled in the evil times to pay for their competitions* which they would have avoided had it been in their power.

XXIII. And in case any justly entituled to the said peace* have obtained decrees for the lands in the province of Connaught or county of Clare, in lieu of their former estates* and nave not been potieft of lands according to such their respective decrees, we further declare, that if by the first day of November, one thousand six hundred sixty one, they shall not be potieft of such decreed lands, they shall immediately after the said day be otherwise Satisfied for the same.

XXIV. And as to those who continued with us, or served faithfully under our 'enfignes beyond the seas, we think tit and accordingly declare, that they shall be restored to their former estates, if they by themselves or agents authorised by them, have not prosecuted and obtained decrees and lands in the province of Connaught or county of Clare, in compensation of their former estates, a reprize being first assigned and legally set out of the remaining forfeited lands undisposed of, to such adventurer or fouldier, or other person before named, of equal value* worth and purchase to the estate, out of which such adventurer or fouldier or other person aforesaid shall be so removed; yet so, that if any charge, debt, or other legal* incumbrance have been due upon, or out of any such lands so to be restored, which by law or good continence ought to be discharged by the party so to be restored, and that the said charges, debts, or incumbrances, have been discharged or satisfied by the party, his heirs or assigns, from whom such lands are now to be reprized, that such persons, their heirs or assignes may, and shall hold the said lands until they are facisned and contented of and for the same; and that none of the persons so to be removed, shall be accountable for the rents or profits of the estates out of which they shall be so removed, which rents and profits, and arrears of rents they are respectively to receive until they are potieft of other estates as aforesaid, as also reasonable consideration for reparations of houses and other ne-

The fourteenth and fifteenth Tears of Charles H. ceflary improvements made and to be seen upon the pr*. mifcs, wherein like regard is to be had to the respeanne tenants and lcffees for tncir improvements; but where the landlord took fine, he is to be accountable for the toe towards satisfaction for their improvements who paid the said fine: and left such restorations and reprizes, if 00c speedily effected, might be attended with many prejudices to all parties concerned therein, we declare that the farthest time for accomplishing thereof shall be by the three and twentieth day of October, one thousand six hundred fixtie and one.

XXVIII. And though same, not sensible of the great perplexities we have laboured under to reconcile these jarring intcrells, may ihfer. That where we judge persons hiring to be reltored to their eilates, yet the limitation of a previous reprisal may eclipse much of our grace: to this we fay, that the laying of the foundations is not now before us, when we might design the model of the structure an-fwerable to our own thoughts; and how hard it would be, that the English after so many expensive difficulties in suits of law, and finding several officers in order to get the present pofiTession they enjoy, and that after so many thousands of families, who have fold their intcrells in England, have transported and settled themselves in Ireland, and have made great improvements in buildings and otherwise, should in the interval of those accommodations (reprifal noticing first provided for) be dilpolD.fTed of their houses and their stocks (the foie subsistence of them and their families) ex-posed to certainty of loss (though greater inconveniencies we pretermit) may easily be judged; to this we might adde, that since the persons of the irish for whom we do hereby intend satisfadien, are Rich who have been abroad with us, who probably being not furniihed with (lock and other provisions, may with leis inconveniencies wait for a riprizal, than to dispossess others, especiall since we are fully assured that a very short time may and will assign them their re-fpeÂ£live reprizals, there being so good and large a proportion of undisposed forfeited lands m our power reserved for this purpose, and we doubt not but the persons most con-,

cemed in this supposed prejudice, throughly weighing these A. D. inconveniencies, and that they will be but of a Ihort dura- 1662. tion, and how great and reasonable a difladsfadion a con- Chap. 2. trary acting in us will produce, will acquiesce therein, and \^*-y-*m** by such a forbearance lay the foundation of a good under-flanding between themselves and thofi? other their fellow-subjeds who are to be settled With them in that our kingdom.

And leaf! any ambiguity or controversy might arise for pre-cedency in relUtution to their forriier rights, we do declare, v that first all innocent proteHants, and those persons termed innocent papists (who never took out any decree, or had lands assigned to them in Connaught or Clare) be first re* llored. In the next place, that these innocent protestants and papists, who took out decrees, and had lands allotted to them in pursuance thereof, in Connaught or Clare, shall be reiiored: and that such transplartted persons as shall be dif-polfeft of their decreed estates in Connaught or Clare, by virtue of this our declaration, shall be reprtzed out of other forfeited lands of equal value, worth, and purchase in the said province of Connaught, or county of Clare, or elsewhere, before they be difpoffeft of their said estates: and that then such of the Irish pap ills who constantly served under our eniigns abroad* having right to the articles of peace, are to be reiiored, of which if any dispute shall be of their capacity or priviledge herein, we shall by farther intimation of our pleasure to our chief governour or govemours in that our kingdom and council there, give a final resolve and determination therein t yet this is alwaies so to be understood, that whatsoever person or persons in the next precedent qualifications shall find any part of his or their estates, not already disposed, or not designed to be disposed to the ends aforesaid, exprell in this our declaration, that such person or persons, their heirs or aligns, shall be respedfciveiy restored to his or their said estates.

XXIX. And we further declare, that in respeÂ£fc many have contracted very just debts for furniftiing arms, ammunition, and other necessary provisions for carrying on the war in Ireland, before one thousand six hundred forty nine, for which they have given security, and so made themselves liable to suit and hazard, which in all equity ought to be provided for; that after such reprizals made as aforesaid, iarisfaftion shall be set forth out of the remaining lands in our disposal, to such persons, their heirs andalligns.

XXX. And we are gracioully pleased further to declare.

That every adventurer and fouldier, their heirs and assigns, settled in lands, tenements and hereditaments, as aforesaid; and every person restored unto, or reprized for his estate, Us is formerly mentioned, thall pay unto us, our heires and successors yearly for ever, the rem* following, <uix. for every acre in the province of Leiniler three pence; for

every

36* The fourteenth and fifteenth Tears of Charles IL

A. D. 1662. Chap. 2. every acre in the province of Munder two pence farthing; for every acre in the province of Connaught one pcny halfpeny; and for every acre in the province of Ulster one peny; accounting as to the paiment of the said rent onely, one hundred and sixty pearches to the acre, and fixteeo foot and a half to the pearch: and all such as receive satisfaction for their arrears out of the houses and tenements in the several corporations in Ireland, one shilling six pence yearly out of every twenty shillings rent, so that the rent formerly reserved on such estates 10 to be restored, exceed not the rent hereby referred: but if the said rent formerly reserved do exceea the rent hereby to be referred, the said former rent onely shall be paid, and the said estates respectively shall be dilcharged from paiment of the rent or rents hereby reserved. Aid it is our further pleafore, and we do hereby declare, that all lands, tenements and hereditaments thus settled and to be settled upon adventurers, shall be held of us, our heirs and successors, in free and common soccage, as in the statute of the seventeenth Carch is limited and appointed; and that ad lands, tenements and hereditaments settled or to be settled on the soldiers who

V are out of the said act, and not provided for by it, shall be held of us, our heirs and successors by knights service in cafite. XXXI. All other particulars abovementioned, being fully effected, we trust, through the goodness of God, that that near ruined kingdom will be restored to peace and plenty; and that by such signal evidences of our justice, favour and mercy, the wicked will be deterred from their wickedness, and the good encouraged and confirmed in resolutions of loyalty towards us, and peace among one another. And as in this our declaration, we have made choice of those means which in our wisdom and judgment we have esteemed most conducible to the quiet and ictde-ment of that our kingdom, so we edeem it necessary further to declare, That it is our firm intention forthwith 10 call a Parliament in that onr kingdom, and effectually ta recommend unto our chief governour or govemours, privy council, and our said Parliament, the eftatlishing by laws there all the particulars mentioned in this our declaration, and such others as shall be found necessary for the good of our people there; and after such bills are pall, that then an act of free and general pardon, indempmty and oblivion, shall be granted to all our subjects of and in Ireland, notorious murderers only excepted. XXXII. And because we are too credibly assured, that in the decrees and judgments given for forfeited lands in the province of Connaught and county of Clare, much injustice and fraud hath been used; we shall recommend the whole review of that business to our chief governour or

I

or governours for the time being, and oar privy council A. D. and commissioners, or some of them, to the end that i66z. whatever irregularity shall be found in those proceedings Chap. 2.

may, by their care and wisdome, be rectified, and the .......

just part thereof confirmed: as also, that a suitable act for Ireland, for confirming judicial proceedings there in the Four-courts, may be there past; and another act for ratifying all decrees and judgments in the court of claims and Exchequer of Dublin, and the claims of our protef-tant subjects of Ireland, that so all our subjects being legally settled and confirmed in their lives, properties and estates, they may, without fear for the future, betake themselves to m$nd the ruines and desolations of so long and bloody war, and live in comfort and unity: and we more than hope, that by our thus proceeding, the world will believe nothing of our own advantage can come in competition with the peace and good of our subjects; for we reserve little to our Self but the satisfaction of contenting all in-terefts, at the price of freely parting with almost all the great forfeitures vested in us by law in that our kingdom: and if by this indulgence we shall attain that de-fired end, it will be much more considerable unto us, than the rate at which we purchase it.

XXXIII. And we further declare, that whereas several of the adventurers and souldiers having made a thankful estimation of our grace and favour expressed by this our declaration, in settling them in a peaceable possession and right of what they enjoy, by our waving those many advantages devolved upon us by law, have voluntarily ex-preft their own willingness and confidence of the forward-nefs of all the rest of their brethren, in contributing one half years full value of the profits arising of the said lands as aforesaid set out for their respective adventures and arrears, to be paid in one year, towards the relief and reparations of the losses of such as we shall judge have raoft eminently acted for and suffered with us; and that (bveral of the adventurers having expressed their own willingness, and confidence of the forwardness of the rest of the adventurers to bestow upon us as a further evidence of that thankfiilnefs, in consideration of our grace and favour in the aforesaid settlement, one other half years rent more of full value to be paid in one other year; we cannot but declare our acceptance of such their free and kind offer, and when a bill shall be tendred unto us upon the accompt, and for the ends aforesaid, it shall be received by us as gracioudy as such an evidence of their affection and respect doth deserve.

XXXIV. And we do lastly declare, that protestant plantations shall be Settled, corporations created, churches freded, maintenance for preaching ministers provided,

within

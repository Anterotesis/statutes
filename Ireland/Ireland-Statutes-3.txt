III. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person shall after the first day of November one thousand seven hundred and nineteen commit any grand or petit larceny, or fdonioufiy ileal or take away money, goods, or chattles, from the person or the house of any other, for whidh such offender, as the law now Hands, is intituled to

V. And whereas there are several persons, who have secret -acquaintance with felons, and who make it their business to help persons to their stolen goods, and by that means gain money from them, which is divided between them and the felon», whereby they greatly encourage such offenders: be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That wherever any person taketh money or reward directly or indirectly, under pretence or upon account of helping any person or persons to any Ilolen goods or chattels, every such person so taking money or reward as aforesaid, unless such person doth apprehend or cause to be apprehended such felon, who dole the same, and cause such felon to be brought to his tryal for the same, and give evidence against him, shall be guilty of felony, and suffer the pain and penalties of felony according to the nature of the felony committed in dealing such goods, and in such and the same manner, as if such offender had hhnfelf dole such goods and chattels, in the manner and with such circumstances as the same were ftglen.

III. And whereas the said act appoints. That the free- No sufficient school of each diocess shall be builded and erected at the way appointed costs and charges of the whole diocess, without respect of for levying m©. freedoms, by the devise and oversight of the ordinaries of fdu>ols. the diocess, or of the vicars-general (fede <vacante) and the sheriff of the Shire, but no sufficient way is appointed for the applotting or levying of such money, as upon that occasion may be found necessary; by reason whereof, and of the want of fixed and settled places to be appropriated unto such schools in most diocefles, no money has ever yet been raised for the building of such free school, and where any such money has been raised, it has hitherto turned to very little account: be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no money shall be raised for erecting of such moncv

An Act for the further explaining and amending tha fevered Laws for preventing Frauds committed by tenants; a*J for the more easy Renewal of Leases; and for the pci-ther Amendment of the Law in certain Cases therein mentioned.

WHEREAS several lands, tenements, and hereditaments, in divers parts of this kingdom have here* toforc been demised and set for terms of lives or yean determinable upon lives by leases, minutes, or contracts ia writing, containing an actual demise, wherein do dause of Doubt whe* re-entry hath been inserted: and whereas a doubt hath where ncTclause ^cn conceived, whether the landlord or lessor, and thoU of re-entry, cau chunring under him, for want of such clause of reentry, by bring eje&* the several ilatutes now in force for preventing of frauds ment, though committed by tenants, can bring an eje&ment for the reco-rwQt due^1*vcx7 knda demised, although more than a year's

relit is in arrear; and unless explained may prove highly prejudicial to many landlords and leffors, and those claiming under them: for remedy whereof be it declared and enabled by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by where a year's t^c authority of the same, That where one whole year's may briogCff0r relit or more 16 or^due an<*n arrear to ai*y landlord

ejectment or lessor for any laud, tenements, or hereditaments Co heid,

as G. a. 13. or hereafter to be held, by any such lease, minute, or con-ms if containing tract in writing, such landlord or lessor, or those lawfully mQuoL demifs. claiming by, from, or under him, her, or them, may bring

his, her, or their ejedtment, and recover the possession of

such lands, tenements, and hereditaments so demised, in such and the same manner to all intents and purposes, as if a clause of re-entry had been expressly specified and contained in such lease, minute, or contrail in writing, and not otherwise; any thing in the said acts to the contrary notwithstanding.

II. And whereas it hath been doubted, whether after judgment hath been had and obtained in ejedlments for non-payment of relit, and execution executed thereupon, the lessor or leffors in such ejediments against the lessee of the lands, for which such cje&ment is brought, or his assignee or afhgnees, can have and maintain an action for the

71# fifth Tour of George II. 459

the recovery of the arrears of relit due before the bringing A.D. such ejedments, or which shall grow due after such eject- 1731.

ment is brought, to the time that judgment shall be had. Chap. 4. and execution executed thereupon: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every lessor or leffors recovering. ^ffor having in such ejedments for non-payment of relit, and obtaining execution 00 judgment and execution thereupon, shall and may have the eje&ment for same and like remedy for all arrears to the time of such ex- non-payment, ecution executed, as such lessor or leffors might have had against the lessee or leffecs, his or their assignee or Mifno"

neeB, if no such ejedment had been brought, or judg-ejc&ment. tfnent and execution had been obtained or executed thereupon.

III. And whereas by the several acts, now in force for the more effectual preventing frauds committed by tenants, the lessor upon the'tryal in ejedments to be brought on the said acts for non-payment of relit mufl make proof of the perfection of the counterpart of the lease, by which such irent is referred, before he or they can recover in such ejectment; which many times happens to be impradicable, by reason no counterpart was ever perfeded, or if perfeded, has been loft or so mislaid, that it cannot be produced and proved upon such trials, as the said acts direct and require, whereby such leffors are disabled fqr want of such counterparts from obtaining the remedy and relief provided by the said acts: for remedy whereof £>e it eqaded by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the first day of where one^May one thousand seven "hundred and thirty two on any year'i relit due tryal in ejedment for non-payment of relit in pursuance of ^fore eje&-this or the said former acts, where one year's relit or more ent» is due and in arrear before the summons in such ejedment, counterpartwm where it shall be necessary to produce the counterpart of perfeded, and any lease, minute, or contract, containing an actual de* fhat I*5* mise, if it shall appear to the court, that no counterpart^ori" wa3 perfeded, or if perfeded, that such counterpart is of the counter-loft or so mislaid, that it cannot be produced and given part, may be in evidence upon such trial, then and in such cases if the JPvcn in lessor or leffors in such ejedment shall give in evidence thedcncc* original lease, minute, or contract, or a copy thereof, or a copy of such counterpart, and that the lessee or leffeei therein named enjoyed the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, for which such ejedment shall be brought, under such lease, minute, or contract, such original lease, or i copy thereof, or a copy of the counterpart, shall be of the same force and effect, as if the counterpart of such lease, minute, or contract had been produced and proved upon such tryal; any thing in the said former laws to the contrary notwithstanding.

And whereat many persons hold coftsiderable estatei by leases for lives or yearly and lease otit the same in parcels to several under-tenants: and whereas many of tfcofc Jeafes cannot by law be renewed without a surrender of all the uader-leases derived out of th^feme, to that it is in the power of any such under-tenants to prevent or delay the renewing the principal lease by refusing to surrender their under-leases, notwithstanding they have covenanted so to do, to the great prejudice of their immediate landlords the first lessees: for preventing such inconvemeocies, and for making the renewal of leases more easy for the future, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in calc any leases shall be duly surrendered in order to be renewed, and a new lease made and executed by the chief landlord or landlords, the same new lease shall without a surrender of all or any of the under-leases be as good and valid to all intents and purposes, as if all the under-leases derived thereout had been likewise surrendered at or before the taking of such new lease; and all and every person and persons, in whom any estate for life or lives, or for yean, shall from time to tune be veiled by virtue of such new lease, and his, her, and their executors and administrators, shall be entituled to the rents, covenants, and duties, and have the like remedy for recovery thereof, and the under-lessees shall hold and enjoy the meftaages, lands, and tenements, m thfe respective under-leases comprised, as if the original ieafes, out of which the respective under-leases are derived, had been (till kept on Foot and continued; and the chief landlord and landlords shall have and be intituled to such and the same remedy by distress or entry in and upon the snefiuages, lands, tenements, and hereditaments, comprised in any such under-lease, for the rents and duties referred by such new lease, so far as the same exceed not the rents and duties referred in the lease, out of which such under-lease was derived, as they would have had, in case such former lease had been kill continued, or as they would haye had, in case the respective under-leases had been renewed under such new principal lease; any law, custom, or ufiige to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

V. And whereas it is a common practice among tenants to replevy distrefies taken for relit, and then to stay proceedings on such replevins by injunction out of one of {he courts of equity, which they are greatly encouraged to by the possibility of their bail being discharged by the death of (ome of the parties at law, and before judgment can be obtained at law: be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That where any eje&ment b brought on the (U-tutes for the non-payment of relit, or any of them, or any distress is taken, or action brought for arrears of relit, and the tenant files a bill in any court of equity for an injunction to stop the proceedings at law for the recovery of such

tively shall hear and determine all such causes depending proce: before them respectively, and make such absolute decree the decree and decrees therein in such and the same manner, as if such beabfo-

VIII. And whereas the law is defective in the manner of sheriffs returning devaftarvits against executors and adraini-strators, it frequently happening that sheriffs without any inquisition taken upon the oaths of twelve men, and without any knowledge of the matter, return densaftavits, and take security from the plaintiffs to indempnify such sheriffs from all damages and actions on account of such return: and whereas it frequently happens, that executions are di-

reded

No devdfla-it shall be returned but on inquisition on oath of2 of the county,

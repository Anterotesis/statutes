WHEREAS it is found by experience, that the pu-niihments, inflicted by the laws now in force agai nit the offences of robbery and felony, have not proved effectual to deter wicked and ill disposed persons from committing the said crimes : and whereas many offenders, to whom royal mercy has been extended on condition of transporting themselves to the Weft-Indies, have often neglected to perform the same, but instead thereof have abused the mercy (hewn to them by his Majesty, or his chief governor or governors of this kingdom; and by that means federal gaols of this kingdom are at this time filled with such offenders; which is not only an encouragement to such to go on in their tricked practices, but is a great charge to such cities and counties, where such persons lie confined : to remedy the same for the future, be it therefore enabled by the King’s fnoft excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords fpirittial and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same.

II. And that no such offenders may efcape" the punifh-ment designed them by such transportation : be it further ena#ed by the authority aforesaid, That the sheriff or sheriffs, who shall or may have such order of tranfmittal dire#-ed to them as aforesaid, shall at the next assizes or sessions to be holden for such County or city, from whence such offenders were tmnfmitted, lodge with the clerk of the crown or peace of such county or city a certificate of his delivering such prisoner or prisoners to the magillrate or officer of such fea-port, city or town, as the said warrant of tranfmittal shall dire#.

V. And whereas there are several persons, who have secret -acquaintance with felons, and who make it their business to help persons to their stolen goods, and by that means gain money from them, which is divided between them and the felon», whereby they greatly encourage such offenders : be it •further enacted by the authority aforesaid, Tliat wherever any person taketh money or reward directly or indirectly, under pretence or upon account of helping any person or persons to any Ilolen goods or chattels, every such person fo taking money or reward as aforesaid, unless such person doth apprehend or cause to be apprehended such felon, who dole the same, and cause such felon to be brought to his tryal for the same, and give evidence against him, shall be guilty •of felony, and suffer the pain and penalties of felony according to the nature of the felony committed in dealing such goods, and in such and the same manner, as if such offender had hhnfelf dole such goods and chattels, in the manner and with such circumdances as the same were ftglen.

VII. And whereas it has been found by experience. That the rewards given for taking and apprehending of tories, robbers, and rapparees, have been the occasion of many such offenders being brought to condign punishment: but some doubts arifmg on the consideration of the several llatutes, - which enabled grand juries to give such rewards: be it further enabled by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the twenty fifth day of December one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, it shall and may be lawfiil for any grand jury to raise, as a reward for the taking and apprehending of any tory, robber, or rapparee, who shall be proclaimed, any sum not exceeding the sum of twenty pounds, whether such tory, robber, or rapparee, shall be taken or convicted in the same or in any other county.

An A3 for the further explaining and amending tha fevered Laws for preventing Frauds committed by tenants ; a*J for the more eajy Renewal of Leases ; and for the pci-thcr Amendment of the Law in certain Cases therein mentioned.

WHEREAS several lands, tenements, and hereditaments, in divers parts of this kingdom have here* toforc been demised and fet for terms of lives or yean determinable upon lives by leases, minutes, or contracts ia writing, containing an actual demise, wherein do daufe of Doubt wbe* re-entry hath been inserted: and whereas a doubt hath where ncTclaufe ^cn conceived, whether the landlord or lessor, and thoU of re-entry, cau chunring under him, for want of such clause of reentry, by bring eje&* the several ilatutes now in force for preventing of frauds ment, though committed by tenants, can bring an eje&ment for the reco-rwQt due^^1 * vcx7 knda demifed, although more than a year's

* rent is in arrear; and unless explained may prove highly prejudicial to many landlords and leffors, and those claiming under them: for remedy whereof be it declared and enabled by the King's moll excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by where a year's t^c authority of the tame, That where one whole year's may briogCff0r rent or more 16 or ^ due an<* *n arrear to ai*y landlord

his, her, or their ejedtment, and recover the possession of

such lands, tenements, and hereditaments fo demised, in such and the same manner to all intents and purposes, as if a clause of re-entry had been expressly fpccificd and contained in such lease, minute, or contrail in writing, and not otherwise ; any thing in the said acts to the contrary notwithstanding.

II. And whereas it hath been doubted, whether after judgment hath been had and obtained in ejedlments for non-payment of rent, and execution executed thereupon, the lessor or leffors in such ejediments against the lessee of the lands, for which such cje&mcnt is brought, or his af-fignee or afhgnees, can have and maintain an action for

That every lessor or leffors recovering. ^ffor having in such ejedments for non-payment of rent, and obtaining execution 00 judgment and execution thereupon, shall and may have the eje&ment for same and like remedy for all arrears to the time of such ex- non-payment, ecution executed, as such lefTor or leffors might have had against the lessee or leffecs, his or their assignee or Mifno"

neeB, if no such ejedment had been brought, or judg-ejc&mcnt. tfnent and execution had been obtained or executed thereupon.

III. And whereas by the several acts, now in force for the more effectual preventing frauds committed by tenants, the lefTor upon the'tryal in ejedments to be brought on the said acts for non-payment of rent mufl make proof of the perfection of the counterpart of the lease, by which such irent is referred, before he or they can recover in such ejed-ment; which many times happens to be impradicable, by reason no counterpart was ever perfeded, or if perfeded, has been loft or fo mislaid, that it cannot be produced and proved upon such trials, as the said acts direct and require, whereby such leffors are disabled fqr want of such counterparts from obtaining the remedy and relief provided by the said acts: for remedy whereof £>e it eqaded by the authority aforesaid. That from and after the first day of where one ^ May one thousand seven "hundred and thirty two on any year’i rent due tryal in ejedment for non-payment of rent in pursuance of ^fore eje&-this or the said former acts, where one year's rent or more ™ent» is due and in arrear before the summons in such ejedment, counterpartwm where it shall be necessary to produce the counterpart of perfeded, and any lease, minute, or contract, containing an actual de* fhat I*5*® mise, if it shall appear to the court, that no counterpart ^ ori" wa3 perfeded, or if perfeded, that such counterpart is of the counter-loft or fo mislaid, that it cannot be produced and given part, may be in evidence upon such trial, then and in such cafes if the JPvcn in lefTor or leffors in such ejedment shall give in evidence thedcncc* original lease, minute, or contract, or a copy thereof, or a copy of such counterpart, and that the lessee or leffeei therein named enjoyed the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, for which such ejedment shall be brought, under such lease, minute, or contract, such original lease, or i copy thereof, or a copy of the counterpart, shall be of the same force and effect, as if the counterpart of. such lease, minute, or contract had been produced and proved upon such tryal; any thing in the said former laws to the contrary notwithstanding.

And whereat many persons hold coftfiderahle eftatei by leases for lives or yearly and lease otit the same in parcels to several under-tenants: and whereas many of tfcofc Jeafes cannot .by law be renewed without a surrender pf all the uader-leafes derived out of th^feme, to that it is in the power of any such under-tenants to prevent or delay the renewing the principal lease by refusing to surrender their under-leafes, notwithfUnding they have covenanted fo to do, to the great prejudice of their immediate landlords the first lessees: for preventing such inconvemeocies, and for making the renewal of leases more easy for the future, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in calc any lcafes shall be duly surrendered in order to be renewed, and a new lease made and executed by the chief landlord pr landlords, the same new lease shall without a surrender of all or any of the under-leafes be as good and valid to all intents and purposes, as if all the under-leafes derived thereout had been likewise surrendered at or before the taking of such new lease ; and all and every person and persons, in whom any estate for life or lives, or for yean, shall from time to tune be veiled by virtue of such new lease, and his, her, and their executors and administrators, shall be entituled to the rents, covenants, and duties, and have the like remedy for recovery thereof, and the under-leffees shall hold and enjoy the meftaages, lands, and tenements, m thfe respective under-leafes comprised, as if the original ieafes, out of which the respective under-leafes are derived, had been (till kept on Foot and continued ; and the chief landlord and landlords shall have and be intituled to foch and the same remedy by distress or entry in and upon the snefiuages, lands, tenements, and hereditaments, comprised in any such under-leafe, for the rents and duties referred by such new lease, so far as the same exceed not the rents and duties referred in the lease, out of which such under-leafe was derived, as they would have had, in cafe such former lease had been kill continued, or as they would haye had, in cafe the respective under-leafes had been renewed under such new principal lease ; any law, custom, or ufiige to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

V. And whereas it is a common practice among tenants to replevy diftrefies taken for rent, and then to stay proceedings on such replevins by injunction out of one of {he courts of equity, which they are greatly encouraged to by the pofiibility of their bail being discharged by the death of (ome of the parties at law, and before judgment can be obtained at law : be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid. That where any eje&ment b brought on the (U-tutes for the non-payment of rent, or any of them, or any distress is taken, or action brought for arrears of rent, and the tenant files a bill in any court of equity for an injunction to stop the proceedings at law for the recovery of such

VIII. And whereas the law is defective in the manner of (heriffs returning devaftarvits against executors and adraini-ftrators, it frequently happening that (heriffs without any inquisition taken upon the oaths of twelve men, and without any knowledge of the matter, return densaftavits, and take security from the plaintiffs to indempnify such (heriffs from all damages and actions on account of such return : and whereas it frequently happens, that executions are di-

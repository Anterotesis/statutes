XIII. And whereas it is usual with timber-dealers to saw

and work up as soon as possible the green timber they have timberfcizedon illegally possessed themselves of; and it is not clearly under- suspicion by a flood, that justices of the peace, or those authorized by }on authored,

their warrant, have a power by any act now in force, to , ^f.in,

seize such wooden ware, and wrought-up timber, as are

offered to sale by suspected persons: be it enacted by

XVI.

XXVIII.

their warrant, have a power by any act now in force, to , ^f.in,

seize such wooden ware, and wrought-up timber, as are

offered to sale by suspected persons: be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That any justice of the peace, or person authorized under his hand and seal for that purpose, shall have power to seize all fresh wrought timber, whether wooden ware, cats, carts, fork or shovel handles, hoops, ploughs, harrows, or rakes tads, when found in possession of airyjperson or persons suspected of having become illegally possessed of the same; and if such person or persons cannot give a satisfactory account of having procured

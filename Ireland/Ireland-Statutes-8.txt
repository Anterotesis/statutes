LXXXIII. And whereas the changing the course of the river commonly called the river Dodder, so as to prevent the same from discharging itself into the said river Anna Liffey and harbour of Dublin, would tend in a very great degree to the improvement of the said harbour, by removing the obflmflion now in the said river Liffey, or harbour, called the bar of Dodder, and for that purpose it is necessary that the said course shall be turned, and the change thereof begin on the northern side of BalPs-bridge, and be carried on and proceed by a cut or canal in such course or direction as to the said corporation shall seem proper, to and upon the south strand below the common high tide mark on the said strand; and in order to preserve the grounds on each side of the said new course from being overflowed in times of flood, and of fpnng tides by making substantial and permanent works or walls on each side of the canal, or cut to be made for such new course of the said river, and to have such works or walls and embankments kept at all times in good repair, so as to prevent any such overflowing: be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it (haS and may be lawful to and for the said corporation upon the terms of compensation a9 herein after mentioned, to cut and open on the north side of BalPs-bridge a sufficient course for the said river Dodder to flow in from the north side of BalPs-bridge, and be carried on and proceed by a cut or canal, in such course or direction as to them shall seem proper, to and upon the said south strand, be!

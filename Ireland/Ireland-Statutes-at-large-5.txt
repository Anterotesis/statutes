EXPLANATION.

IN the first column Is the price of the quarter of wheat, which is two barrels, the allowance of the magistrate to the baker, which is six shillings the quarter for baking, being included; and in the other columns is the weight of the several loaves, so that (for example) if the price of wheat is two pounds the quarter, and the magistrates allowance six shillings to the baker for baking, then even with two pounds six shillings in the iirfl: column, will be found the weight of the several loaves.

Note, The white loaves are one half, and the wheaten three quarters of the houshold loaves.

XI. And whereas in the art or mystery of brick-making several great abuses already have been, and are likely to be, committed for the future, unless due care be taken for the prevention thereof in and about the city of Dublin, and in several other parts of this kingdom; whereby bricks, which have been made for publick sale, are so ill prepared, made, and burnt, that they are scarce able to bear their own weight, which has either occasioned several considerable sums of money to be every year sent out of the kingdom to buy good bricks from Holland, or has otherwise occasioned great damage not only to the particular persons, who have bought and used such bad bricks so made and prepared as aforesaid, but also to his Majesty's good subjects in general, by the sudden decay and downfal of edifices and houses built therewith, whereby - the streets and publick places are continually annoyed -with repairs, to the great hindrance as well as imminent danger of all such person and persons who pass and repass on their different occasions,: and whereas there is at present no provision made by any law for the dimensions of bricks to be made and used in buildings in this kingdom: be it etiafled by the authority aforesaid for the common good and benefit of his Majesty's subjects, and the duration of buildings, and the better ascertaining the times of digging the earth, and the manner of making and burning bricks hereafter to be made for sale, and the lengths, breadths, and thickness thereof, That from and after the twenty fifth day of March in the year of pur Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty every person and persons, who shall make.or cause to be made bricks for publick sale, or shall expose such bricks, when made, to publick sale in any of the brick-fields or lands in or about the city of Dublin, ,or in any Other parts of this kingdom, shall be obliged to dig and turn such clay before the month of November next preceding the burning of such bricks, and in so doing shall fairly and cleanly uncaloe or strip the upper foil from such brick-earth, as he or they shall make use of, and shall not on any pretence whatsoever make use of any other than the proper and natural brick-earth, and shall also be obliged to turn and temper the clay once more after the month of November, and before the month of February

next preceding the burning of such bricks as aforesaid; and also that no brick-maker, temperer, moulder, or any other perl’on or persons employed in the art or mystery of brick-making, shall in any way mould or call in form any clay, which has not fird been tempered and turned in manner, as is herein before mentioned, and picked clear of stones of any kind, particularly lime-stones; or shall on any pretence whatsoever mould or form into brick any clay, wherein there is any limc-walh, or mould, or form any bricks as aforesaid after the twenty fifth day of November in any year and before the twenty fifth day of March following.

XII. And whereas in moulding or forming of bricks good and proper clay may be and is frequently made into bad bricks by the too great softness of the temper, whereby, though the moulds or forms be made of a proper size, yet from the retiring or ihrinking of the clay, when burnt, bricks become of an irregular and improper size and lhape: be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all bricks, which shall at any time or times from and after the said twenty fifth day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty one be made or burnt for sale, shall when burnt be not less than nine inches and a half long, four inches and a half broad, and two inches and a quarter thick; and also that no moulder, brick-maker, or other' person whatsoever, in forming or moulding bricks pursuant to the tenor-of this act shall cad into form or mould any piece or parcel of clay, as it is delivered to him or them on the (tool, or elsewhere, unless it be of such a confidence, that it will dick together, if taken up with a common pitch-fork of two grains or tangs: and further, that no person or persons employed in the art or mydery of brick-making shall mould, form, or burn any bricks in any other time of the year. than between the’ fird day of March and fird day of November, unless such bricks, so made or burnt at any other time than as aforesaid, be for the proper and private use of the person or persons so making or burning the fame, and not for publick sale, or to be used in any of the edifices or buildings of the city of Dublin, or any corporate town or city in this kingdom.

XIII. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons shall at any time or times from and after the said twenty fifth day of March one thousand seven hundred and thirty one make any bricks for sale in any other manner, than is herein before direrited and appointed, upon complaint made thereof by one or more person or persons before two or more justices of the peace within their respective jurisdictions, such judices are hereby authorized and required, to summon th'c

WHEREAS several lands, tenements, and hereditaments, in divers parts of this kingdom have heretofore been demised and set for terms of lives or years determinable upon lives by leases, minutes, or contrafts in writing, containing an actual demise, wherein no clause of re-entry hath been inserted: and whereas a doubt hath been conceived, whether the landlord iwr K-fc' or lessor, and those claiming under him, for want of such clause "?

of re-entry, by the several statutes now in force for preventing cimy, can of frauds committed by tenants, can bring an ejeflment for the X/" recovery of such lands so demised, although more than a year’s^)'"'’5 rent is in arrear; and unless explained may prove highly prejudicial to many landlords and leflors, and those claiming under them: for remedy whereof be it declared and enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That where one whole year’s rent or more is or shall be duc5'ejr’j|ri and in arrear to any landlord or lelfor for any land, tenements, may bring or hereditaments so held, or hereafter to be held, by any such lease, minute, or contract in writing, such landlord or lcflor, or those dauseof rc-latvfully claiming by, from, or under him, her, or them, may bring 'mjc. 1. his, her, or their ejcflment, and recover the possession of such JX/Vi/'a'foai' lands, tenements, and hereditaments so demised, in such and the demifi. same manner to all intents and purposes, as if a clause of reentry had been express, (pccified and contained in such lease, minute, or contract in writing, and not otherwise; any thing in tlte said acts to the contrary notwithstanding.

And whereas it hath been doubted, whether after judgment 173 hath been had and obtained in ejectments for don-payment of rent, and execution executed thereupon, the leflor or leffors in such ejectments against the lessee of the lands, for which such gectment is brought, or his assignee or assignees, can have and maintain an action for the recovery of the arrears of rent due before the bringing such ejectments, or which shall grow due after , such ejectment is brought, to the time that judgment shall be had, and execution executed thereupon: be it -eiiacted by the

I.cdor liav- authority aforesaid, That every leflor or leflors recovering in such andnraution ejectments for non-payment of rent, and obtaining judgment on cjcftment and execution thereupon, shall and may have the fame and like ' remedy for all arrears to the time of such execution executed, mcdyfcr«- as less°r or leffors might have had against the lessee or lessees,

brought, or judgment and execution nad been obtained or executed thereupon.

III. And whereas by the several acts, now in force for the more effectual preventing frauds committed by tenants, the leflor upon the tryal in ejectments to be brought on the said acts for non-payment of rent must make proof of the perfection of the counterpart of the lease, by which such rent is reserved, before he or they can recover in such ejectment; which many times happens to be impracticable, by reason no counterpart was ever perfected, or if perfected, has been loft or so mislaid, that it cannot be produced and proved upon such trials, as the said acts direct and require, whereby such leffors are disabled for want of such counterparts from obtaining the remedy and relief provided by the said acts: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the first day of May one thousand

Stall be of the fame force and effect, as if the counterpart of such lease, minute, or contract had been produced and proved upon such ttyal; any thing in the said former laws to the contrary notwithstanding.

IV. And whereas many persons hold considerable estates by ieafes for lives or years, arid lease out the fame in parcels to several under-tenants: and whereas many of those leases cannot by law be renewed without a surrender of all the under-leases derived out of the fame, so that it is in the power of any such under-tenants to prevent or delay the renewing the principal lease by refusing to surrender their under-leases, notwithstanding they have covenanted so to do, to the great prejudice of their immediate landlords the first lessees'! for preventing such inconveniencies, and for making the renewal of leases more easy for the future, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in case any_leases shall be duly furtendered in order to be renewed, and a be renewed r new lease made and executed by the chief landlord or landlords, the fame tieW lease shall without a surrender of all or any of the d,;r ltafa: under-leases bfi as good and valid to all iiitehts and purposes, as if all the under-leases derived thereout had been likewise surrendered at Of befofe the taking of such new lease; and all and every period and persons, in whom any estate for life or lives, or for years, shall from time to time be veiled by virtue of such new lease, and his, her, and their executors and administrators, shall be intitled to the rents, Covenants, and duties, and !cT,« shall have the like remedy for tecovery theredf, and the under-lessees shall hold and enjoy tile messuages, lands, and tenements, in the respective under-leases comprized, as if the original leases, enjoy, as if out of which the respective urider-leases are derived, had been dill kept on foot and continued; and the chief landlord and landlords shall have and be intitled to such and the fame remedy 6.

V. And whereas it is a common pradtiec among tenants to replevy distresses taken for rent, and then to stay proceedings on such replevins by injuriflion out of one of the courts' of equity,

And whereas by an act of Parliament passed in the full /rr. 4- recited, year of his present Majesty's reign, intituled, An act for continuing several temporary salutes made in this kingdom now near expiring, it is among other things enacted, " That in all suits, which " shall be commenced by English bill in the high court of " Chancery or court of Exchequer in this kingdom from and " after the twenty fifth day of March one thousand seven hundred and twenty eight, it shall and may be lawful to and for " the said courts of Chancery and Exchequer respectively to " proceed to hear and determine all such causes -depending before them respectively, and to make such decree and decrees " therein against every person and persons who shall appear to " them to havp been duly served with the process of the said " courts, and to have flood out the process of the said courts ".to a sequestration, and to be only a trustee or trustees, and no " otherwise concerned in interest in the matter in question, in " such and the same manner as if such trustee or trustees had " duly appeared and put in his or their answerand whereas a doubt hath arisen, whether such trustee shall, when the cause comes to a hearing, suffer a conditional decree, and be served shouM not be therewith before any final decree can be pronounced: for ex-onll decree'" plaining the said doubt be it enacted and declared by the autho-Eding out' afore^> That no conditional decree shall be pronounced process: against such trustee, but the court of Chancery and Exchequer

VIII. And whereas the law is defective in the manner of Iheriifs returning devajlavits against executors and administrators, it frequently happening that sheriffs without any inquisition taken upon the oaths of twelve men, and without any knowledge of the matter, return devajlavits, and take security from the plaintiffs to indempnify such sheriffs from all damages and actions on account of such return: and whereas it frequently happens, that executions are directed to sheriffs of counties of towns, and to sheriffs of remote counties, where the defendants, who are executors or administrators, never had any assets or dealings, and such sheriffs are often prevailed upon to return de-vafavits: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That from and after the first day of May one thousand seven hundred and thirty two no sheriff or other officer shall return a devafavit, but upon an inquisition taken on the oaths of twelve lawful men of the county, to whom proper challenges may be taken; and that the plaintiff or plaintiffs, his or their attorney or attorneys, or agents, shall give the defendant or defendants in such suit, or their attorney or known agent, fifteen days notice of the taking such inquisition bofore the taking thereof, "and of the time and place of taking the fame; and that such inquisition shall not be taken in any county, where no evidence of a devafavit can be given, which was committed in such county, unless in cases where the intire devafavit committed shall appear to have been out of the kingdom.

such of their children, as shall become protestants, of a reasonable support and maintenance, and such devices are carried on and concealed with so. much fubtility, that it is difficult to difrover the fame, so that the lord chancellor, lord keeper, or commissioners which Ii af- 8reat not having the truth of the matter laid before

terwards dif- him or them, may often decree less portion and maintenances, than Svfbeen he or they otherwise would have done, if the true circumstancea

greater at time of such popish parent or parents had truly and fairly appeared to ?fdthe*’ him or them: and whereas the estate of such popish parent or pa-estate improv- rents may encrease and become better after inch portions and al- lowances made by the court of Chancery, and yet after such de-

That it shall and may be lawful to and for the grand juries of the several counties in this kingdom at some general assizes, which shall be held within any of the said counties iri this kingdom, within the space of three years after the thirtieth day of September in the year one thousand seven hundred and ten, to direct, explain, and ascertain how the word plow-land in the said act shall be construed and understood within the said county, or any barony or parish

And whereas in several places the parishes are small, and the ways and kelhes too much out of repair, that the inhabitants of such parishes by the labour of six days cannot repair or make the said high ways and kelhes in one year, but oftentimes that part of the said ways that are made in summer time is spoiled the riihesf&c.’ma-next winter, by reason the fame was not finished in one season :JorParpneet,n&

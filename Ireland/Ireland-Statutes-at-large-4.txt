IV. And whereas such popish parents do frequently set up such fcfr madeto frau^u^ent settlements and incumbrances, and make fraudulent conceal the leases at low and inconsiderable rents, to make their estate real true value, personaj appear finall and of little value, in order to deprive

such of their children, as shall become protestants, of a reasonable support and maintenance, and such devices are carried on and concealed with so. much fubtility, that it is difficult to difrover the fame, so that the lord chancellor, lord keeper, or commissioners which Ii af- 8reat not having the truth of the matter laid before

terwards dif- him or them, may often decree less portion and maintenances, than Svfbeen he or they otherwise would have done, if the true circumstancea

greater at time of such popish parent or parents had truly and fairly appeared to ?fdthe*’ him or them: and whereas the estate of such popish parent or pa-estate improv- rents may encrease and become better after inch portions and allowances made by the court of Chancery, and yet after such de-

cree is made up and enrolled, it may be doubted whether the lord chancellor, lord keeper, or commissioners of the great foal, can encrease such portion or maintenances, notwithstanding it should such port!- be discovered and made appear to him or them, that the estate tomncM/nay"rea* or P^011^ of such popish parent or parents was much greater, on new bib than at the time of the decree it appeared to be, or that such popish parent or parents had encreased or improved his, her, or their mentedby estate: for remedy whereof be it further enacted by the authority co^ngK>aC aforesaid, that notwithstanding any such decree made up or en-vafoeof the rolled* it shall and may be lawful for the high court of Chancery

WHEREAS by an act of Parliament made in this kingdom in the eleventh year of the reign of our sovereign lord King James the first, it is enacted, That every person or persons for every plow-land in tillage or pallure that he shall occupy " in the same parish> and all and every other person or persons " keeping therein a draught or plough) shall find and fend, at every day and place to be appointed for the amendment of the " high ways in that parish, one wain or cart furnished after the " custom of the country, with oxen, horses, or other cattle, and " all other necessaries meet to carry things convenient for that " purpose, and also two able men iwith the fame, upon pain of " every draught making default, as in the said act is expressed." And whereas it is further enabled, " That all and every person of " persons that shall occupy a plow-land in tillage or pasture, lying " and being in several parishes, shall be chargeable with the mak- ing of the high ways and kefhes, and cutting and clearing of " paces within the parishes where he dwelleth, as far forth and in such manner and form as any person having a plow-land in any " parish ought to be chargeable by the said adand forasmuch as the word plow-land in the said act is a name, whereby lands are known and distinguished in some particular parts and places in this kingdom, and not one common name, whereby lands are known or distinguished in every county of this kingdom j by which means several persons inhabiting in counties, where the lands afe known by another name, do refuse to work according to the directions of the said act, pretending they have no lands in the said parish known or called by the name of plow-lands, which occasions many of the high ways and kefhes in this kingdom to' remain out of repair: for remedy whereof be it enacted by the Queen’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful to and for the grand juries of the several counties in this kingdom at some general assizes, which shall be held within any of the said counties iri this kingdom, within the space of three years after the thirtieth day of September in the year one thousand seven hundred and ten, to direct, explain, and ascertain how the word plow-land in the said act shall be construed and understood within the said county, or any barony or parish

II. And whereas in several places the parishes are small, and the ways and kelhes too much out of repair, that the inhabitants of such parishes by the labour of six days cannot repair or make the said high ways and kelhes in one year, but oftentimes that part of the said ways that are made in summer time is spoiled the riihesf&c.’ma-next winter, by reason the fame was not finished in one season :JorParpneet,n&

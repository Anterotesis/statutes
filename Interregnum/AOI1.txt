Whereas, by an Act made this present Session of Parliament, intituled, An Act for the speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in His Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland to their due Obedience to His Majesty and the Crown of England; among other Things, it is enacted, That no Part of the Money, which shall be paid in according to the said Act, shall be employed to any other Purpose than the reducing of the said Rebels, until the said Rebels shall be declared to be suodued by the said Lords and Commons as aforesaid; and that the said Money shall be employed for the speedy and effectual subduing of the said Rebels, by sending over into the said Realm of Ireland, and disposing there, such Forces of Foot and Horse, Monies, Ammunition, Victuals, and all other Things necessary to a War, in such Manner as the said Lords and Commons in Parliament shall from time to time direct; and the Overplus of the said money, if any shall be, to be disposed as the said Lords and Commons shall likewise direct.

And whereas the said Forces cannot be sent over, but first they must be raised:

It is therefore Declared, by the said Lords and Commons, That whatsoever Forces of Horse or Foot shall be sent over, by virt ue of the said Act. may be raised by the Direction of the Lords and Commons, by virtue of the Act aforesaid.

Ordinance of both Houses, for bringing in Plate, Money, and Horses.

[9 June, 1642.]

Whereas it appears that the King (seduced by wicked Counsel) intends to make War against His Parliament, and, in Pursuance thereof, under Pretence of a Guard for His Person, hath actually begun to levy Forces both of Horse and Foot, and sent out Summons throughout the County of Yorke, for the calling together of greater Numbers; and some ill-affected Persons have been employed in other Parts, to raise Troops, under the Colour of His Majesty's Service, making large Offers of Reward and Preferment to such as will come m; and that His Majesty doth, with a high and forcible Hand, protect and keep away Delinquents, not permitting them to make their

Appearance, to answer such Affronts and Injuries as have been by them offered unto the Parliament; and those Messengers which have been sent from the Houses for them, have been abused, beaten, and imprisoned; so its the Orders of Parliament (which is the highest Court of Justice in this Realm) are not obeyed, and the Authority of it is altogether scorned and vilified, and such Persons as stand well affected to it, and declare themselves sensible of these Public Calamities, and of the Violations of the Privileges of Parliament, and Common Liberty of the Subject, are baffled and injured, by several Sorts of malignant Men, who are about the King: some whereof, under the Name of Cavaliers, without having Respect to the Laws of the Land, or any Fear either of God or Man, are ready to commit all Manner of Outrage and Violence, which must needs tend to the Dissolution of this Government, the destroying of our Religion, Laws, Liberty, and Propriety; all which will be exposed to the Malice and Violence of such desperate Persons as must be employed in so horrid and unnatural an Act as the overthrowing of a Parliament by Force, which is the Support and Preservation of them all; which being duly considered by the Lords and Commons, and how great an Obligation lies upon them, in Honour, Conscience and Duty, according to the high Trust reposed in them to use all possible Means in such Cases for the timely Prevention of so great and irrecoverable Evils, they have thought fit to publish their Sense and Apprehension of this imminent Danger, thereby to excite all well-affected Persons to contribute their best Assistance, according to their solemn Vow and Protestation, to the Preparations necessary for the opposing and suppressing of the traiterous Attempts of these wicked and malignant Counsellors, who seek to engage the King in so dangerous and destructive an Enterprize, and the whole kingdom in a Civil War, and destroy the Privileges and Being of Parliaments. This Recourse to the good Affections oi those that tender their Religion and just Liberties and the Enjoyment of the blessed Fruits of this present Parliament, which were almost ready to be reaped, and are now as ready to be ruined by those wicked Hands, being the only Remedy left them under God, and without which they are no longer able to preserve themselves, or those by whom they are entrusted.

1. They, t he said Lords and Commons, do Declare, That whosoever shall bring in any proportion of ready Money, or Plate, or shall underwrite to furnish and maintain any Number of Horse Horsemen, and Arms, for the Preservation of the Public Peace, and for the Defence of the King and both Houses of Parliament from Force and Violence, and to inpliold the Power and Privileges of Parliament, according to His Protestation; it shall be held a good and acceptable Service to the Commonwealth, and a Testimony of his good Affection to the Protestant Religion, the Laws, Liberties, and Peace of this Kingdom, and to the Parliament and Privileges thereof.

And because a considerable Aid cannot be raised by few Hands, and the Condition of all Men's Estates and Occasions is not always proportionable to their affection, the Lords and

Commons do declare, That no Man's Affection shall be measured according to the Proportion of his Offer, so that he express his goodwill to this Service in any Proportion whatsoever.

3. And it is Ordained, That Sir John Wallaston, Knight and Alderman, Alderman Towes, Alderman Warner, and Alderman Andrewes, shall be Treasurers, to receive all such Money and Plate as shall be brought in, for the Purposes aforesaid; and that the Acquittances of them, or any Two of them, for the Receipt of the same, shall be a sufficient ground for the Party so lending Money or Plate to demand the same again, with the Interest, and likewise Consideration for the Fashion of the Plate.

4. It is Ordered, That

shall be Commissaries, to value the Horse and Arms that shall be furnished for this Service; and that a Signification, under the Hands of them, or any Two of them, of such Value of the Horse and Arms, and of the Time when they were first brought in, shall be a Warrant to demand Satisfaction, according to the said Values; and they shall keep an Account of the Time from the first Inrollment of any such Horse and Horsemen, that such as find and maintain them may be repaid, according to the Rate of Two Shillings and Six Pence per biem, for so long Time as they have maintained them in this Service; and the Commissaries are to attend at Guildhall, for the receiving and inrolling of such Numbers of Horse as shall be brought in.

5. It is Ordered, That whosoever shall bring in Money or Plate, or shall provide, and maintain Horse, Horsemen, and Arms, for this Service, shall do according to their Duty therein; and the Lords and Commons do engage the Power and Authority of Parliament, to save them harmless from all Prejudice and Inconvenience that may befall them by Occasion thereof.

6. It is Ordered, the Members of either House, who are present, shall be desired to de<51are in their Houses respectively what Money or Plate they will bring in; or what Horse, Horsemen, and Arms, they will find and maintain.

7. It is desired, that all such as have their Residence in or about London, or within Eighty Miles, will bring in their Money, Plate, or Horse, within a Fortnight after Notice; and they that dwell further off, within Three Weeks.

1. And because every Person may not be provided with present Money, or with Horse, or not have his Plate with him which

he means to bring in, and yet resolves to contribute his Part within the Time limited, and that it is necessary it should be presently known what the Provision will be for the effecting of this great and important Service; it is Ordered, That the Committees of either House, appointed for that Purpose, respectively shall receive the Subscriptions of such Members of each House as have not declared themselves in the House, or are absent upon the Public Service, or for their Private Occasions.

3. That some Persons, nominated by the Knights and Bur-guesses of each County, and approved by both Houses, shall be appointed to receive the Subscriptions in the several Counties.

And lastly, it is Declared, That whatsoever ifc brought in, shall not at all be employed upon any other Occasion than to the Purposes aforesaid; vffiich are, to maintain the Protestant Religion; the Kings Authority and His Person in His Royal Dignity; the free Course of Justice, the Laws of the Land, the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Privileges of Parliament, against any Force which shall oppose them; and this by the Direction of both Houses of Parliament.

concerning the Subsidy of [1 August 1642.]

The Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament, taking into Consideration the great Perils and Dangers that may ensue, not only to this Kingdom, but likewise unto that of Ireland, especially in these Times of apparent Danger, far exceeding all former t'imes either of His Majesty or of His Royal Father King James; and taking into further consideration the great Debt now due unto the Navy, as well before the Beginning of this Parliament as since, amounted to the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Pounds, or thereabouts; and that Two and Fifty Ships of War are now in the actual Service of this Kingdom, as well for the Defence thereof as of Ireland; and not knowing what other Supply of Ships and of Store will be further requisite in these Times of Danger, and well knowing that they cannot be maintained without great Sums of Money, nor the said great Arrears be satisfied by any Monies already collected, or owing by Merchants for the Time past: And, foreseeing the Danger and the Necessity of the Supply, did long before this Time prepare a new Book ot Rates, which passed both Houses, now Ordered to be published, wherein they had as well an equal Respect to the Ease of Merchants, as to the raising of such Sums of Money as might be proportionable to those Supplies; and did likewise prepare and pass a Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, whereby the Book of Rates is confirmed, which Bill they have likewise Ordered to be printed and published; which, after they were passed both Houses, were, upon the 29th Day ol June last past, sent to His Majesty to Yorke, for the Royal Assent; which His Majesty not having passed, the Lords and Commons did, upon

1 Aug., 1642.] Tonnage and Poundage.

17

the Fourteenth Day of this Instant July, command the Earl of Holland, Sir John Holland, and Sir Phillip Stapleton (by whom they did send the late Petition to His Majesty), in the Name of botFi Houses, to move His Majesty, to give a speedy Passage to that Bill, whereunto His Majesty hath given no Answer at all: And whereas the former Bill of Tonnage and Poundage did determine the First Day of this Instant July, since which Time no Monies intended to be raised by this last Bill have been collected: Now the said Lords and Commons, having taking the Premises into due and serious Consideration, for preventing the inevitable Dangers that must necessarily ensue, without timely Prevention in that Behalf, have thought good to make this their Declaration to all His Majesty's loving Subjects:

First, Whereas by an Act, made this present Parliament, intituled, “An Act for the Relief of the Captives taken by the Turkish, Moorish, and other Pirates, and to prevent the taking of others in Time to come, ” all Merchants, as well Denizens as Aliens, for any Goods exported or imported from the 10th Day of December, 1641, during the Term of Three Years then next ensuing, are to make due Entries of such their Goods in the Port of London, and all other His Majesty's Ports within the Realm of England and Dominion of Wales upon the Penalty of the Forfeiture of the said Goods.

Now the said Lords and Commons do enjoin all Merchants, as well Denizens as Aliens, to make due Entry of all such Goods and Merchandizes as they shall, during the Continuance of the said Act, export or import; and, to the Intent that the Entries may be accordingly made, they do expect that the Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers and other the Officers of the said City of London, and other the Ports respectively, do carefully attend their several charges, and make due Seizure, as forfeited, of all such Goods and Merchandize as shall not be entered according to the Intent of the said Statute.

2. That, although the said last Bill of Tonnage and Poundage hath not yet had the Royal Assent, and therefore the Subject by the Law is not compellable to pay the Duty therein limited to be paid; yet, the Premises and pressing Necessities considered, the Lords and Commons do Declare, That it shall be taken as an acceptable Service to the Commonwealth, by a Manifestation of their good Affections to the Public, of all those that shall, upon Entry of their Goods, advance and pay, by Way of Loan unto the Collectors or Commissioners which now are or nereafter shall be named, or to their Deputy or Deputies, all such Sum or Sums of Money as are payable oy the last Book of Rates, as should have been due in case the said Bill had passed for a Law.

3. That every Merchant, so advancing Money as abovesaid. shall have allowance, by Way of Defalcation, of Fifteen Pounds per centum, out of every Hundred Pounds he or they shall so advance and pay, over and above all other Allowances made in the said Bill, or Book of Rates, or either of them, and so out of every greater or less Sum after that Rate.

4 Whereas the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, now remaining

8734. B

18 Tonnage and Poundage. [1 Aug., 1642.

with His Majesty, cannot have the Force of the Law, without the further Concurrence of the Lords and Commons in respect the Speaker of the House of Commons, by and with the Consent of the said Commons, is to carry the said Bill up into the Lords House, for the Royal Assent; as also in Respect that, in His Majesty's Absence from Parliament, His Majesty hath no Power to pass His Royal Assent unto a Bill but by his Letters Patents under the Great Seal, and signed with His Hand, declared and notified to the Lords and Commons assembled together in the Higher House, as by a Statute made in 23d Year of King Henry the Eighth, Cap. 21. appeareth:Now the Lords and Commons, tor the further Assurance of Merchants advancing Monies as aforesaid, do promise, and Declare, That, before they consent to the perfecting of the said Bill of Tonnage and Poundage now remaining with His Majesty, or any other Bill of Tonnage or Poundage whatsoever Provision shall be made, that the said Allowance of Fifteen per Centum shall be confirmed unto the said Merchants accordingly; and that they, their Heirs, Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, shall be for ever acquitted and discharged of and from the Payment thereof.

5. To the Intent that no Merchant doth forbear to advance the said Monies by Way of Loan, according as hereby is desired, in Hope that the Duties in the said Biu shall not hereafter become payable from the First Day of July, 1642; the Lords and Commons do Declare, That no Bill of Tonnage and Poundage shall hereafter piiss in Parliament, but such as shall relate and be in Force to compel all Merchants to pay for all Goods and Merchandizes exported or imported from the said First Day of July, 1642, on which Day the former Bill of Tonnage and Poundage expired; in which Bill there shall be that Clause of Forfeiture of the Value of all such Goods as shall not be duly entered in the Custom House, from and after that Day, in such Manner as in the said Bill is expressed.

6. That all Merchants, who snail not advance Money by Way of Loan as aforesaid, in regard of the present and pressing Dangers and Necessities; the Lords and Commons do Declare, That, at what Time soever they shall consent to the passing of any Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, all such Persons who shall not advance Monies as aforesaid shall be charged to pay the Duties of Tonnage and Poundage, from the said First Day of July, 1642, during the Term of the said Bill, in such Manner as by the said Bill snail be provided.

7. That, to the Intent that no Officer belongingto any Custom House within this Kingdom or the Dominion of Wales, or other Persons appointed to be Commissioners for receiving such Monies as shall be advanced by Merchants as aforesaid, be discouraged, by reason of any Penalties mentioned in any former Acts of Tonnage and Poundage passed this Parliament, for receiving of any Duties upon Merchandize, not being granted by Parliament; although the Lords and Commons do conceive, and hereby Declare, That the receiving of the said Sums of Money beforementioned is not within the true Intention of the said

1 Any., 1642.] Tonnage and Poundage.

19

Penalties, the same being-advanced voluntarily, by Way of Loan; as also in respect those Acts, and the true Intent of them, were principally to restrain the Crown from imposing upon the People without their Consent:Yet, for the further Encouragement of such Person or Persons who shall receive any such Sums, they do Declare, and promise That whenever the said Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, now remaining with His Majesty, or any other, do pass for a Law, there shall be Provision made in such Bill for the Indemnity and Security of all such Person and Persons in that Behalf.

8. That whereas, by a former Order of the Commons House of Parliament, the Officers appointed for the Purpose have Order to take Bonus of all Merchants, for the Payment of One per Centum, to be raised by virtue of the aforesaid Bill, for the Relief of the Captives taken by Turkish or other Pirates, or so much thereof as shall be agreed on by the Lords and Commons in Parliament: It is now Ordered, That all such Merchants as shall not advance Money by Way of Loan, as aforesaid, shall at all Times hereafter, upon Entry of their Goods, make Payment of ready Money for their said Goods, according to the Tenor of the said Bill; and likewise all such other Sums of Money as, by virtue of the said Bill, are due from said Merchants, upon Bill or otherwise, for goods by them formerly entered since the 10th Day of December, 1641; by the true Intent of which Act, the One per Centum, to be paid and received, is to be taken and received according to such Rates as were due and payable by the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage which did last determine.

9. The Lords and Commons do Ordain, That the same Collectors, or Commissioners, who have formerly received the several Duties upon Merchandize, upon the several Bills of Tonnage and Poundage passed this Parliament, shall be and are deputed to be Commissioners, who are enabled, by this Ordinance, to receive all such Sum or Sums of Money, which shall, at any Time hereafter, he voluntarily advanced, by Way of Loan, in such Manner as they have formerly received the former Duties of Tonnage and Poundage; which said Commissioners, their Deputy or Deputies, or any One of them, shall have full Power and Authority to give Allowance, by Way of Defalcation, after the Rate of Fifteen per Centum, out of all such Monies as shall be advanced, according to the tme Intent of the Ordinance; all which Monies the said Commissioners, their Deputy or Deputies, shall receive upon Accompt, and shall from Time to Time issue out the same, as they the said Commissioners shall be authorized by Order of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, or of such other Person or Persons as they shall nominate and appoint, to be employed for the Uses herein before expressed.

For the more due Execution of the Premises, and that Account be justly kept, and the Commissioners duly charged; the Customers and Comptrollers, as well of the City of London as the Out Ports, are required, once in every Eight and Twenty Days, to make a true Accompt of all such Entries as have been made in the several Ports respectively, and of the Monies payable *734.

An Ordinance Inhibiting the importation of Currans.

[26 August, 1642.]

Whereas it is found by daily experience, that the Importation of Currans into this Kingdome (it being a Commodity of little or of no use at all, but a meere superfluity, and may well bee spared) is a matter of great concernment not only to the Merchant but to this Nation, in regard the said Commodity cannot be had in the parts beyond the Seas, where the same are bought, without ready money, an hundred thousand pounds per annum at least being bestowed in Currans, which otherwise wrould be brought into this Kingdome, is wholly diverted; whereas formerly (till of later years) the said Currans were bought for Commodities of this Kingdome, exported hence of small value, besides the great advantage which is yearly made upon the Merchant (where the said Currans are laden) to their exceeding prejudice by the high and excessive Rates and Taxes which are there imposed upon the said Commodity.

For the prevention of the like mischiefe for time to come, the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, at the instance and desire of the Merchants of this Kingdome, and by and with their consent, doe order, ordain and declare, that from and after the last day of September, which shall be in the Year of Our Lord God 1642. That no Currans be imported into the Kingdom of importation England, or Dominion of Wales, by any Merchants strangers, of Curranta Denizens or others by way of Merchandize or otherwise, from any ^inbeMMsl parts beyond the Seas; But the importation thereof from and forbidden, after the said last day of September, is hereby utterly prohibited and forbidden.

And further, by the Authority aforesaid, it is ordered and declared, That from and after the said last day of September, no Entries be taken of any Currans that shall be imported into this Kingdom© or Dominion of Wales, by any officer whatsoever, in any of the Custom-houses or elsewhere; And in case any Merchant-denizen, or Alien, or any other person w hatsoever contrary to this Ordinance, shall presume to Imj)ort and unlade any Currans within this Kingdom or Dominion of Wales after the said last day of September, that it shall be lawfull for the Officers of the Custoine House respectively to seize, take and carry aw?ay all such Currans, and them to detaine untill they shall receive further order from both the Houses of Parliament in that behalfe; And that every person that shall offend herein shall be liable to such further punishment and censure as the Lords and Commons in a Parliamentary way shall inflict or impose.

And it is further Ordered that the respective Officei-s of the Custome-houses doe take speciall care to put this Ordinance in execution, or doe cause it to be fully executed in every point according to the true intention of the same, and that such persons as shall not obey in any of the premises shall answ er their- neglect and contempt before the Lords and Commons in Parliament, and not otherwrise or elsewdiere.

And lastly it is Ordered and declared, That from and after the three and twentieth of August which shall be in the Yeere of Our Lord God 1642. that no Currans which are already bought in the parts beyond the Seas, and brought into this Kingdome or the Dominion of Wales, shall be sold by retaile for more than after the rate of five-pence the pound, and that if any person (that shall sell the same) shall offend contrary to this Ordinance, that he shall be liable to receive such punishment as the Lords and Commons in a Parliamentary way shall impose for his contempt in that behalfe.

Order for Stage-plays to cease.

[2 September, 1642.]

Whereas the distressed Estate of Ireland, steeped in her own Blood, and the distracted Estate of England, threatened with a Cloud of Blood by a Civil War, call for all possible Means to appease and avert the Wrath of God, appearing in these Judgements; among which, Fasting and Prayer, having been often tried to be very effectual, having been lately and are still enjoined; and whereas Public Sports do not w^ell agree with Public Calamities, nor Public Stage-plays with the Seasons of Humiliation, this being an Exercise of sad and pious Solemnity, and the •other being Spectacles of Pleasure, too commonly expressing lascivious Mirth and Levity: It is therefore thought fit, and Ordained, by the Lords and Commons in this Parliament assembled, That, while these sad causes and set Times of Humiliation do continue, Public Stage Plays shall cease, and be forbora, instead of which are recommended to the People of this Land

Assessment.

[29 Nov., 1642.

[26 November, 1642.]

Whereas the King seduced by wicked Councell hath raised an Army, and levyed War against the Parliament, and great number of Forces are ciayly raysed under the commands of Papists and other ill-affected persons, by Commissions from His Majesty; And whereas divers Delinquents arc protected from publique Justice by his Majesties Army, and sundry outrages and rapines are dayly committed by the Souldiers of the said Army, who have no respect to the Lawes of God or the Land: but bume and plunder the houses, and seize and distroy the persons and goods of divers His Majesties good Subjects; And whereas for the maintenance of the said Army divers assessements are made upon severall Counties and His Majesties Subjects are compelled by the Souldiers to pay the same; which said Army if it should continue would soone ruine and waste the whole Kingdom, and overthrow Religion, Law, and Liberty. For suppressing of which said Army and ill affected persons there is no probable way under God but by the Army raised by Authority of the Parliament; which said Army so raised cannot be maintained without great sums of Money, yet for raising such summes by reason ot His Majesties withdrawing himselfe from the advice of the Parliament, there can be no Act of Parliament passed with His Majesty's assent, albeit there is great Justice that the said Monies should bo raised. The Lords and Commons in Parliament having taken the same into their serious consideration, and knowing that the said Army so raised by them hath been, hitherto, for the most part maintained by the voluntary contributions of divers well-affected persons, who have freely contributed according to their abilities. But considering there are divers others within the Cities of London, and Westminster, and the suburbs of the same and also within the Borough of Southwark, that have not contributed at all towards the maintenance of the said Army, or if they have, yet not answerable to their Estates, who notwithstanding receive benefit and protection by the same Army as well as any others, and therefore it is most just that they should as well as others, be charged to contribute to the maintenance thereof:

Be it therefore Ordained by the Lords and Commons, in Parliament assembled, and by authority thereof; That Isaac Pennington, Lord MaioT of the City of London, Sir John Wollaston, Knight and Alderman, Alderman Towes, Alderman Warner, Alderman Andrewes, Alderman Chambers, Alderman Fowke, Sir Thomas Soams, Knt. and Alderman, Samuel Vassell, John Venn, Morris Thompson, and Richard Warring, Citizens; or any four of them shal hereby have power and authority to nominate, and appoint in every Ward within the City of London, six such

The Lords and Commons, having taken into their serious Consideration a Proclamation datea at Oxon, the 27th of December last, for the adjourning of the Court of Chancery, the Court of Wards and Liveries, the Dutchy of Lancaster, the Court of Requests, the Receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer, and of the First Fruits and Tenths, from the City of Westm r, unto the City of Oxon, and for adjourning the Courts of Kings Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer, unto the Return Crastino Purifications, found it to tend much to the Prejudice of the Commonwealth, to remove the said Courts and Receipts to Oxon, where the Body of an Army, raised against the Parliament and the Authority thereof, now resides; and therefore, in Performance of their Duty, and Trust reposed in them by the Kingdom whom they represent, did exhibit their humble Advice and Petition to Hfs 8734.

Majesty, with the Reasons inducing them thereunto, to revoke the said Proclamntion, and with all Humility desire that the said Court* and Receipts might be kept at their several usual Places and Times, and not at Oxon. But His Majesty, giving still more Credit to the Suggestions of those wicked and malignant Persons that yet encompass Him than to His Highest and most Faithful Counsel, returned His Negative Answer, and expressly denied to repeal His Proclamation: Now the Lords

and Commons, clearly discovering the great Inconveniency and Mischiefs that necessarily must happen to His Majesty's most faithful and best-affected Subjects, in Case those Courts and Receipts bo removed to Oxon, where such of them as have Occasion to attend, cannot with any Safety to their Persons or Estates repair, His Majesty having in Effect declared all Persons that have contributed any Thing in Aid or Defence of the Parliament and the Privileges thereof to be guilty of High Treason; and, in Pursuance thereof, by the Force and Power of the Army there remaining, have seized upon many of their Persons, where they are detained Prisoners, and some proceeded against as Traitors, having nothing laid to their Charge but their assisting the Parliament, and opposing that Army raised to destroy it and the Kingdom; and finding that divers, both Judges and others, whose Attendance upon the said Courts and Receipts will be necessarr, consist of Persons that are Members and Assistants to both Houses of Parliament, whose Presence at this Time cannot be spared; and that, if the Records necessary to be used in the said Courts should be removed from the usual Places towards Oxon, in a Time when Two Armies are residing near thereabouts, it would endanger the Miscarriage of them, which might ruin many of His Majesty's Subjects, whose Estates depend thereiipon; and that so long a Distance between the said Courts of Law and Equity, which have necessary Dependance one upon another, would prove exceeding prejudicial to many; thought it their Duty, in Discharge of the Trust reposed in them by the Commonwealth, as much as in them lieth, to prevent the said Inconveniencies; and therefore do hereby Declare and Order, That no Judge, Minister, or other Person belonging to any of the said Courts or Receipts, shall repair to the said City of Oxon, or do or execute any Thing belonging to their said Offices and Employments, but in the Places usual for the doing and executing thereof; and that no Member of, or Assistant to, any of the two Houses of Parliament, that have any Place, Office, or Employment, about any of the said Courts or Receipts, shall presume to depart from their Attendance upon the Parliament, without the special Leave of that House whereof they are Members or Assistants; and that no Person shall remove, or cause to be Removed, any Records or Writings of any the said Courts or Receipts, to or towards the City of Oxon: And the Lords and Commons do Declare, That, if any Person shall disobey this Order, they will proceed against them as wilful Contemners of the Authority of Parliament, and Disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdom: And it is further Declared and

Whereas the gasping condition of the Protestants in Ireland is too much manifest, their Estates devoured, their lives daily sacrificed, not onelv to the malice of their and our bloody Enemies, the Popish Rebels, but likewise to the more unavoyd-able Executioners, starving, cold and hunger, their sorrowes hardly to be equalled, nor their utter destruction possibly to be prevented, but by the great and undeserved mercy of God, upon some speedy supply of their grievous necessities. In a deep sence and compassion of their sad Estate, and not so much doubting the charity of all good Protestants here, (which hath been so fully manifested before) as to use many Arguments to invite them to a liberal contribution and Loan, for the present relief of those of our own blood and profession, and to hinder the Rebels from being sharers in the execution of those devilish Plots, which they and their adherents in England have devised, and too far effected amongst us, (who can expect no safety here, if that Kingdome be not preserved unto us, that hath so neer a relation and dependance upon this), and for the more speedy raising, collecting, and disposing of such supply as God shaft incline the hearts of his people to afford their brethren in Ireland; which can be no otherwise procured at this time, by reason of Pi m w -fi, ^e unhappy distemper here.

given^or*1 The ^ords and Commons in Parliament, do hereby Order and money lent, Declare, That all and every of his Majesties well-affected Subjects or Victuals, of any his Kingdomes and Dominions, and any person or persons Arms, Am- of the Dutch Nation under the government of the States General “n, of the united Province; that at any time hereafter shall bring in

An Ordinance exhorting all his Majestic's good subjects in the Kingdome of England, and Dominion of Wales, to the duty of Repentance, as the onelv remedy for their present Calamities, with an Earnest Confession, and deepe Humiliation for all particular and Nationall Sins, that so at length we may obtaine a firmc and happy Peace both with God and Man.

That flourishing Kingdomes have been ruin'd by impenitent going on in a course of sinning, the sacred story doth plamely tell us; and how neere to such a Ruine our sinfull Nation now is, tho present lamentable Face of it doth too apparently show. And though wee should feele the heavy Stroakes of God, yet seven times more, it is our duty to accept the punishment of our Iniquity and to say, 4 Righteous art tnou 0 Lord, and just aro thy judgements. '

Yet because the Lord who is just, is also mercifull, and in his infinite Mercy hath left the excellent and successful! remedy of Repentance to Nations brought neere to the Gates of Destruction and dispaire; O let not England be negligent in the application of it. Humble addresses of a penitent People to a Mercifull God have prevailed with Him. They prevailed for Nineveh, when the sentence seemed to be gon out against her, and may also prevaile for England.

It is therefore thought most necessary by the Lords and C-oui-

81

mons in Parliament, that all his Majesties Subjects in this King-dome of England, be excited and stirred up, speedily to lay hold upon this onely and unfailing Remedy of Repentance; freely acknowledging, and heartily bewailing even with deepest humiliation, godly sorrow, and detestation, secretly and in families, but especially publikely in Congregations, both their own personall sins, and cniefely those sins that are and have bin the sins of this Nation. A confession of Nationall Sins being most agreeable to the Nationall Judgements, under which the Landgroanes, and most likely to be effectuall for the removing of them.

Neither ouglit this confession to be sleight or light, when there is so heavy a weight of Sins, infinite in number, and hainous in nature, that lyes upon this nation. Such are the high Contempt of Gods holy Ordinances, and of Holinesse itselfe: Gross and affected ignorance, under the glorious light of the Gospel cleerly shineing among us; unfruitfumesse under the precious meanes of Grace, Ingratitude for Mercies, Incorrigiblenesse under Judgements, multitudes of Oathes, and blasphemies, wicked prophan-ations of the Lords Day, by Sports and Gamings, formerly encouraged even by Authorise. All sortes of uncleannesse, Luxury, of Excesse in Eating and Drinking. Vanity, pride, and prodigiality in Apparell; Envy, Contention, and unnaturall Divisions; Oppression, Fraud, and Violence; From diverse of which Sins and many other, not one person throughout the whole Nation can say that he is whollly free; but all must confesse that they have contributed toward the Great Stock of Nationall Sins. And so have increased the Treasure of Wrath, against these dayes of Wrath; and therefore since, according to the language of the Holy Ghost, we are^a sinfull Nation, a people laden with Iniquity, and that from the sole of the Foot to the Head, there is no Soundness© in us, we may justly expect the desolations that are denounced against so great and generall Corruption.

And as it is our duty to humble ourselves, and to give glory to God, the Searcher of all hearts, by confessing all smnes; So ought wo to be affected and humbled with deepest sense of sorrow for those most crying Sins, which now we find by too.sad experience, to have a more' immediate Influence upon the Distinction of a Kingdome; some of which are Idolatry and Bloodshed.

That of Idolatry, as it was the Sin of our Ancestors, so it is the Spreading sin of these latter times, while by a generall connivence, and almost Toleration, it hath beene severall wayes fomented and encouraged: The grievous effects whereof this Kingdome of England now begins to feele, from Multitudes of armed Papists, and their Abettors; and the Kingdome of Ireland far more heavily hath felt, being brought almost to utter Ruine, by the Intestine Warres of Romish Idolaters.

And for that other crying and cruell Sin of Bloodshed, that calls aloud for Vengeance (besides many Murders not expiated, and the blood-guilty pardoned) did it not goe hand in hand with hat ai>oininable Idoll of the Masse, in the dayes of Queen Mary, *nd some of her Predecessors, when many hundreds of the deare 8734.

Liking advantage of the late Ordinance made by both Houses, prohibiting Ships to trade into Newcastle for Coales, have raised the prizes thereof unto an unreasonable and excessive Rate, in respect to the rate they have bought the same at, to the great oppression of the poorer and meaner sorts of people Inhabiting the said Citie and Suburbs. Whereupon the House of Commons, by an Order dated the Twenty-eighth of January, referred the consideration thereof unto the Lora Maior of the City of London, to informe himself what might bee a reasonable price, having equall respect both to the Seller and the buyer, and to present his opinion to the House to be considered of by both Houses, and in the meantime Ordered, that the price should not exceed twenty-two shillings tho Chaldron. Where-uj)on the Lord Maior, calling to his Assistance the Alder-nun of the said City, did certifio that twenty-two shillings tho Chaldron at the Wharfe was a faire and fitting rate. But for the encouragement of those that Trade in Coale, to bring in their Ships of lading into the River of Thames and supply the Market there: Certified that twelve pence more upon tho

Chaldron during this Winter might bo allowed.

The Lords and Commons taking the same into their consideration, doe hereby Ordaine and Order, That no Wharfinger, WiKxlmonger, or other seller of Newcastle Coale, within tho Cities of London and Westminster, or the Suburbs or Liberties Coaio not to thereof, or within the Borough of Southwarke, shall at any time exceed 23s. aft*T the making of this Order and before tho first of Aprill next till April 1. ensuing, sell any Newcastle Ceale above the rate of 23 shillings

The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, taking into their serious considerations the heavy pressures and calamities which now lye upon this Kingdom by this unnaturall warre raised against the Parliament; and that notwithstanding all their faithfull and uncessant Endeavours, for the preserving of His Majesty, and the whole Kingdome from the mischievous and restlesse designes of Papists and ill affected persons (whose aym is the extirpation of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties.) Yet their Councells and practises are still so prevalent with His Majesty and the hearts of many people so misled and beguiled by their false pretences and insinuations, that nothing can be expected, but ruine and desolation unlesse God in mercy prevent it, and incline His Majesties heart to the faithfull advice of His great Councell of Parliament; which hath ever been, and is (under God) the cheif support of His Royall Dignity and the security of all that we have or can enjoy. And for that it is most agreeable to common Justice, that the estates of such notorious Delinquents, as have been the causers or Instruments of the

fmblike calamities, which have been hitherto imployed to the omeiiting and nourishing of these miserable Distractions, should be converted and applyed towards the support ion of the great chafes of the Common-wealth, and for the easing of the good Subjects therein, who have hitherto borne the greatest share in these Burthens.

An Ordinance for the speedy raising of Forces by Sea and Land to reduce the Town of Newcastle to Obedience to the King and Parliament.

[5 June, 1643.]

Whereas the greatest part of this Kingdom, and more especially the City of London, and most Maritime towns, are served and furnished with Coals from the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the adjacent parts of Northumberland, and the Bishoprick of Durham, which being now kept by Forces consisting of Papists, and other ill-affected persons under the command of the Earle of Newcastle: the City of London, and all the greatest part of this Kingdom are like to suffer very deeply in the want of that commodity so absolutely necessary to the maintenance and support of life, and which is like to be of very dangerous consequence in the influence which it may have upon the necessities of the meaner sort. And whereas 'tis also very dangerous to adventure shipping within the command of the Forts there erected, as being subjected to a surprize, and like enough to be made use of against the safetie of the Kingdome, if they should make their voyage onely man'd as usually for trade; And how great use has beene made of the port of Newcastle, to the danger of the Kingdome, since it came into the hands of the said Earle is manifest to all. It is therefore hoped that there are none that will be backward to contribute their best asistance towards the reducing of that place, in the recovery whereof all men are interessed, and the rather for the opportunity which is now given, if it be speedily undertaken, and effectually prosecuted. And whereas m obedience to an Order of the House of Commons the Committee of the Navy communicated their opinions in writing to the Lord Major of

Whereas the Lords and Commons now assembled m Parliament have Declared, That there have been, and now is, a Popish and traiterous Plot, for the Subversion of the true Protestant Reformed Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject; and that, in Pursuance thereof, a Popish Army hath been raised, and is now on Foot in divers Parts of this Kingdom; and have further, in a solemn Manner, Declared, Vowed, and Covenanted, That, in order to the Security and Preservation of the true Protestant Religion, and Liberty of the Subject, they will not consent to the laying down Arms, so long as the Papists, now in open War against the Parliament, shall by Force of Anns be

frotected from the Justice thereof; and whereas the Lords and 'ommons have Declared, That there hath been a treacherous and horrid Design lately discovered, by the great Blessing and especial Providence of God, of divers persons, to join themselves with the Armies raised by the King, and to destroy the Forces raised by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, to surprize the Cities of London and Westm. with the Suburbs, and by Arms to force the Parliament; and the said Lords and Commons finding, by constant Experience, that many Ways of Force and Treachery are continually attempted, to bring to utter Ruin and Destruction the Parliament and Kingdom, and, that which is dearest, the True Protestant Religion; and that, for the preventing and withstanding the same, they have thought fit that all who are true-hearted, and Lovers of their Country, should bind themselves each to other, in a Sacred Vow and Covenant, in Manner and Form as followeth: And accordingly A.B. in Humility and Reverence of the Divine Majesty, declare my hearty Sorrow for my own SinsNand the Sins of this Nation, which have deserved the Calamities and Judgements that now lie upon it; and my true Intention is, by God s Grace, to endeavour the Amendment of my own Ways; and that I do abhor and detest the said wicked and treacherous Design lately discovered; and that I never gave, nor will give, my Assent to the Execution thereof; but will, according to my Power and Vocation, oppose and resist the same, and all other of the like Nature; and, in Case any other like Design shall hereafter come to my Knowledge, I will make such timely Discovery as I shall conceive may best conduce to the preventing thereof: And whereas I do in my Conscience believe that the Forces raised by the Two Houses of Parliament are raised and continued for their just Defence, and for the Defence of the true Protestant Religion, and Liberties of the Subject, against the Forces raised by the King, I do here, in the Presence of Almighty God, Declare, Vow and Covenant, That I will, according to my Power and Vocation, assiit the Forces raised and continued by both Houses of Parliament, against the Forces raised by the King without their Consent; and will likewise assist all other Persons that shall take this Oath, in what they shall do in Pursuance thereof; and

An Ordinance for reducing to obedience of Parliament, and for securing of the Counties of Denbigh, Mountgomery, Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey.

[12 June, 1643.]

Whereas the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament, have received credible Information, that very many Papists, notorious Delinquents, and other ill-affected persons inhabiting within the severall Counties of Denbigh, Mountgomery, and Flint, in the Dominion of Wales, have in meere opposition to, and contempt of the Power and Authority of this present Parliament, entered into an hostile and dangerous Assotiation amongst themselves, and with many other persons of like condition with them, inhabiting in other adjacent Counties, for the raising and promoting of an intestine and civill Warre within this kingdoine: and in pursuance thereof, have (contrary to their allegiance) levyed, and do daily levy great forces both of Horse and Foot within their said severall Counties, compelling the common people by Imprest, Imprisonment, and other violent courses, to enter into acts of hostility and rebellion with them, and inforcing the Inhabitants of the said Counties, by illegall, unjust, and insupportable taxations, to support and maintaine them in their said Rebellion and Force, contrary not only to the ancient known laws of this Kingdom; but also to severall Acts made and consented unto by his Majesty this present Parliament: and multitudes of his Majesties good Protestant subjects have been, and daily are robbed of all their estates, imprisoned, ruined and destroyed by them; Which proceedings of the said persons, doe tend not only to the disturbance of the peace, and tran-

Suility of this Kingdom; but also to the subversion of the mdamentall Government thereof, and of the Protestant Religion therein professed, in case they should receive into their ayd and assistance any considerable number of the Irish Rebells, which is not improbable; It being the ayme (as it is probable) of all the Papists now in armes in this Kingdome, and in the Kingdom© ot Ireland, to free themselves from the Laws established against them, and the cruell and bloudy outrages committed by them upon the Protestants of both Kingdomes, (in ruining whole Families, consuming by fire whole Townes, and using his Majesties Name for their authority to countenance their treasonable practises) making it evident to all men, that the said Rebellion and civill Warre in both Kingdomes, have sprang from the same Roote, and must needs five and dye together; The said Lords and Commons taking the same into their serious considerations, doe hold it necessary (for the more speedy suppressing of the said Rebellion, and reducing of the said Papists, Delinquents, and ill-affected persons to their due obedience) that the said severall Counties of Denbigh, Mountgomery, Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey, and the adjacent Counties, be with all convenient speed secured, aswell from insurrection, as forraigne Invasion, being seated on the Irish Coasts.

Whereas divers good orders have been lately made by both Houses of Parliament, for suppressing the great late abuses and frequent disorders in Printing many false, forged, scandalous, seditious, libellous, and unlicensed Papers, Pamphlets, and Books to the great defamation of Religion and Government. Which Orders (notwithstanding the diligence of the company of Stationers to put them in full execution) have taken little or no effect: By reason the Bill in preparation, for redress of the said disorders, hath hitherto been retarded through the present distractions, and very many, aswel Stationers and Printers, as others of sundry other professions not free of the Stationers Company, have taken upon them to set up sundry private Printing Presses in comers, and to print, vend, publish, and disperse books, pamplets and papers, in such multitudes, that no industry could be sufficient to discover or bring to punishment all the several abounding Delinquents; And by reason that divers of the Stationers Company and others being Delinquents (contrary to former orders and the constant custome used among the said Company) have taken liberty to Print, Vend and publish, the most profitable vendible Copies of Books belonging to the Company and other Stationers, especially of such agents as are imployed in putting the said Orders in Execution, and that by way of revenge tor giving information against them to the Houses for their Delinquences in Printing,

to the great prejudice of the said Company of Stationers and Agents, and to their discouragement in this publike service. DecUratSms *s therefore Ordered by the Lords and Commons in of Parlia- Parliament, That no order or Declaration of both, or either

meat not to House of Parliament shall be printed by any, but by order of

108

Committees for Scotland. [19 July, 1043.

Thomas Hatcher and Henry Darley, Esquires, appointed Committees or Commissioners to the Kingdom and States

of Scotland.

1. You shall forthwith repair into the Kingdom of Scotland, either to Edinborough, or to other Parts, as you see Cause; and you shall make your Addresses to the Parliament, or any Instruction for the Committees or Commissioners going to Scotland, deputed by them, to the Assembly of the States, or any Commissioners appointed by them, the General Assembly of the Church, or the Commissioners of the General Assembly, the Lords of the Secret Council, Commissioners for Conservation of the Peace the Commissioners of Common Burthens, and such others as shall have Power and Authority to treat with you upon such Matters as you have received, or shall receive, in Charge, and to negociate in that Kingdom as Committees or Commissioners of and from the Parliament of England.

2. You shall take all fit Ways and Opportunities to make known to the State and Nation of Scotland the great Miseries, Calamities, and Dangers, brought upon this Church and Kingdom, by the Faction of Papists, and Prelates, and their Adherents, whereby they are disabled for the present to make Payment of those great Debts which are owing to them, for the Remainder of the Brotherly Assistance, and the Arrear of their Army in Ireland.

3. You shall take Caro of stating and settling all Debts, Accompts, and Demands, betwixt the Two Nations of England and Scotland; and, the same being reduced to Certainty, you shall treat and compound for the Time and Manner of Satisfaction for the said l)ebts, in such Manner as shall stand with Justice, and the Conveniency of both Kingdoms.

4. As touching the Remainder of the Brotherly Assistance, it is conceived most just and reasonable that, because the War upon the Subjects and People of Scotland, begun and prosecuted in the Year 1640 and 1641, was procured by the Faction of Papists, Prelates, and their Adherents, which was the Cause of the coming of Scotts into this Kingdom, and of the Engagements thereupon made for their Satisfaction, that sufficient Lands of Papists, Prelates, and other Malignants as have adhered unto them, shall, by the Direction and Appointment of both Houses of Parliament, be set forth; out of which, Recompence shall be made for the Forbearance of that Money, until such Time as Satisfaction be given for the Discharge of all the said Debt, with the Interest, and Consideration for the Forbearance thereof.

5. As for the Arrear due to the Scottish Army in Ireland; it being impossible for this State, by reason of the manifold Troubles and Burthens which lie upon it, to make present Payment, it is desired that our Brethren of Scotland think upon some other Way how we may make Satisfaction, either in the Confiscate Lands in Ireland, by Way of Adventure, according to the Rates and Proportions at which they are to be delivered to the English Adventurers, or else by Estalment, at Four equal Payments, within Two Years after the Peace of this Kingdom

shall be settled, or else in Provision of Victual and Apparel, to be delivered at reasonable Rates in Scotland, or any other Place, or any other Way within the Power of the Two Houses; it being our earnest Desire to give our Brethren full Contentment herein, so far as God shall enable us thereunto.

li. You shall, according to the precedent Articles, treat and conclude for the Discharge both of the Debts aforementioned, that is, for the Remainder of the Brotherly Assistance, and the Arrear of the Army in Ireland, and such further Payments as shall grow due, until they shall be dismissed in any of these Ways, and if none of these Ways shall be agreeable to our Brethren, you shall receive any further or other Propositions from them concerning the same; and such Propositions to certify to the Lords and Commons in Parliament, that so you may receive further Direction therein.

7. You shall, with the like Plainness and Truth, make known to our Brethren of Scotland, that we are, by these Troubles, made altogether unable to continue the Charge of the Army in Ireland; therefore, lest it should become too great a Burden to them in our Disability of Payment, we desire the said Army may be dismissed in some short Time; only such Garrisons to hie kept on Foot as our Brethren shall think fit to retain for the Guard of Carrickfergus and Colraine, according to the Treaty in that Behalf.

8. You shall meditate and conclude an Establishment of the same Garrisons, both for Number of Men and Allowances, which the Two Houses will undertake to discharge accordingly (the Number of Men not exceeding Two Thousand), in Money, or Provision at reasonable Rates, to be agreed upon.

9. You shall put our Brethren in Mind, that the Popish and Prelatical Faction, which began with them in the Year 1640-1641, and intended to make Way to our Ruin by theirs, and so to have corrupted and altered Religion in the whole Island, have not diminished in any Part of their Malice towards them, or at all departed from their Design, but only varied in the Manner of their Proceeding; conceiving that they have an easy Way to destroy them if they may first prevail over us; and thereupon you shall uso your uttermost Endeavour to persuade and excite our Brethren to join with us in the common Cause, not only of the Two Kingdoms, but of all the Professors of the Protestant Religion; for the total and univeral Suppression whereof, they may discern that the Pope and his Faction in several Countries are strongly combined.

10. You shall desire therefore, that both Nations may be streightly united and tied, for our mutual Defence, against the Papists and Prelatical Faction, and their Adherents, in both Kingdoms, and not to lay down Arms till they shall be disarmed, and subjected to the Authority and Justice of Parliament, in both Kingdoms respectively; for the effecting whereof, we desire our Brethren of Scotland to raise an Army of Ten Thousand Foot, and One Thousand Horse, or more, to be forthwith sent against the Papists, Prelatical Faction, and Malignants; the same

11. You shall take Care, that the City of Carlisle, the Towns of Newcastle and Barwicke, whensoever they shall be secured from the Papists and Malignants, shall be delivered over into the Hands of such Persons and Garrisons as shall be appointed to receive and defend the same by the Two Houses of Parliament.

12. For the Charge in raising and arming these Men, wo shall give our Brethren Satisfaction as speedily as we may; and, if the Reason of War require that those Forces, or any Part thereof, be employed on this Side Teas, or that it shall be so desired and directed by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, they are in such Case to be subject to the Order and Command of his Excellency the Earl of Essex, or such other as shall be appointed Lord General by the Two Houses of Parliament.

13. You shall assure our Brethren ef Scotland, that, if they shall be annoyed or endangered by any Force or Army, either from England or any other Place, the Lords and Commons of England will assist them, with a proportionate Number of Ten Thousand Foot and a Thousand Horse, or more, to be sent into Scotland, for their Defence, under such Order and Direction as shall be thought fit by the Parliament or State of Scotland: And, for the better securing of the Coast of the Kingdom of Scotland from the Invasion of the Irish Rebels, or other Enemies, during such Time as their Army shall be employed for the Defence of this Kingdom, you shall agree with them for a Guard of Ships, to be maintained by us, upon that Coast.

14. And, that the mutual Interest and Dangers of both Kingdoms may be defended and preserved by both, you shall, on the Behalf of the Lords and Commons of England, contract and agree with the Kingdom and States of Scotland, that no Pacification, or Agreement for Peace, shall be concluded by the Two Houses of Parliament, without sufficient Caution and Provision for the Security, Peace, and Safety of that Kingdom, the Indemnity of all Persons and States for and concerning the Aid and Assistance which shall be given to this Parliament and Kingdom, the Suppression of the Popish and ill-affected Party among them, the safe and peaceable Return of their Forces sent hither, and the real Performance of all Articles agreed upon with them.

15. You shall receive the Public Faith of that Kingdom, that neither their Entrance into nor Continuance in this Kingdom, in Arms, shall be made Use of to the Prejudice of the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown of England, nor of the Liberties and Privileges of the Subjects; but that all Matters concerning the same be determined by the Two Houses of Parliament; and that, as our Brethren shall be pleased to come in to help us at

our Request, so their Forces shall be always ready to depart this Kingdom whensoever they shall by both Houses of Parliament be thereunto desired.

16. You shall further consider, with our Brethren of Scotland, what other Articles or Propositions may be fit to be added and concluded, whereby the Assistance and Union betwixt the Two Nations may be made more beneficial and effectual, for the Security and Defence of Religion and Liberty in both Kingdoms; you shall certify all such Propositions to the Two Houses of Parliament, and thereupon proceed to a Conclusion, as you receive further Direction from them.

You are, together with the Ten Thousand Foot and One Thousand Horse, or more, desirod of our Brethren of Scotland for our Assistance, to consider, agree, and conclude with them, concerning a fitting Train of Artillery to accompany the same.

You are to represent to our Brethren of Scotland the Desire of both Houses, that the Earl of Antrim may be re-examined, with Reference to the Affairs of this Kingdom, upon such Interrogatories as shall be by you framed and propounded in that Behalf, or such as shall be hereafter appointed by both Houses; which Examinations you are to return unto the Houses with all convenient Speed.

You are to prosecute the Instructions formerly given by the Two Houses unto Michaell Welden and John Corbett Esquires, concerning the Six Earls of Scotland, voted Incendiaries by both Houses.

Whereas, by Act of Parliament in both Kingdoms, concerning the Treaty of Peace betwixt the Two Nations, Two Commissions, the one for conserving Peace, and the other for Trade, are directed and appointed, which Commissions are passed and consented to by the Two Houses of Parliament; you are therefore, according to the said Commissions, and in the Capacity of Commissioners in that Behalf, to treat and advise of all such Matters as by the said Act of Parliament is appointed; and to carry with you authentic Copies of the same, and them to deliver to the Commissioners for conserving of Peace, as you shall see Cause.

You are to represent to the general Assembly of Scotland, or to the Commissioners appointed by them, the Care and Endeavours of both Houses, for a perfect Reformation in this Church, and the happy Progress made by them therein; for the better accomplishing whereof, they have called an Assembly of Godly and Learned Divines, which are now sitting; and that, by reason of the Prevalency of the Papists, Prelatical Faction, and other malignant Enomies to this so-much-desired Reformation, now in Arms against the Parliament, these good Beginnings are like to receive Interruption, if not be utterly disappointed; and therefore you are not only to desire Assistance of that Reverend and Godly Assembly, for the carrying on this Work with their Prayers; but also, by such seasonable and effectual Means as to them shall seem meet, to co-operate with the States of the Kingdom of Scotland, for the effecting the Desires of both

[22 July, 1643.]

The Lords and Commons now Assembled in Parliament, taking into their serious consideration the great Danger that this Kingdome lveth under, through the implacable malice and treacherie of Papists, and other Malignant persons, who have, and daily doe wickedly practise, and endeavour the utter mine and extirpation of the Protestant Religion, the Priviledge of Parliament, and the Liberty of the Subject: Insomuch, that there is no probable way left them for the preservation of this Nation how to prevent the said malitious practises, but by raising of Moneys for the purposes first above-mentioned, until! it shall please Almighty God in his mercy to move the Kings Majesties heart to confide in, and concurre with both his Houses of Parliament, for the establishing of a blessed and happy Peace, which by both Houses is much desired and prayed for. And forasmuch as many great levies have becne already made for the purposes first above-mentioned, which the well-affected partie to the Protestant Religion, have hitherto willingly payd, to their

great charge; and the Malignants of this Kingdome have itherto practised by all cunning wayes and means how to evade and elude the payment of any part thereof.

[21 September, 1643.]

The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament taking into their serious considerations the many heavy pressures, and most grievous calamities which now lie upon this Kingdorne by this bloudy and unnatural War raised against the Parliament, and that notwithstanding all their faithful! and constant endeavours for the preserving of His Majesty and the whole Kingdorne from the most cruel and endless Designs of Papists, Delinquents, and ill-affected Persons; jet their counsels and practices are still so prevalent with His Majesty, and the hearts of many people so misled and beguiled by their false pretences and specious insinuations, that nothing can be expected but the extirpation and final subversion of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, unless God of his infinite mercy prevent it, and incline His Majesties heart to the faithfull Advice of His great Councel of Parliament, which hath ever been, and is (under God) the chief support of his Royal Crown and Dignity, and the security of all that we have or can enjoy; and for that it is found by wofull experience, that divers ill-affected Persons, by pretence of His Majesties authority, have and do still daily seize upon divers and sundry great sums of Money, raised and collected in divers parts of this Kingdorne by Acts and Ordinances of Parliament for the relief of the poor distressed Protestants in Ireland, the suppressing and subduing of those most barbarous and bloudy Rebels, and for defence of this Kingdomo and Parliament, and do divert and imploy the same, and likewise His Majesties Revenue, and all other moneys of the well-affected Persons whatsoever by rapine or violence they can lay* hands on; to tho fomenting, nourishing, and maintaining of these miserable distractions, and unnatural War: And the Lords and Commons omitting no opportunity, nor neglecting any fitting means which they conceived might divert the said War here, so violently' pressed forwards by rapists, Delinquents, ill-affected Persons, and the Rebels of Ireland; did formely Ordain,

That the Officers of the Receipt, Court of Wards and Liveries,

Receivers, and others, should not repair unto Oxford, but attend

their service here in the usual places: Yet in contempt of the

same and other Ordinances, some Officers are gone to Oxford,

divers convey sundry sums of Money thither, and others neglect

their service, to the great prejudice and disservice of the

Commonwealth: And to the intent that His Majesties Revenue

might no more be misapplied, and that the same may be im-

ployed for the good of His Majesty and the Commonwealth: The

Lords and Commons therefore do Ordain, and be it Ordained by

Ordinance to provide Salt-petre for making Gunpowder.

[23 October, 1643.]

Whereas tho great Expence of Gunpowder, occasioned by the present War within His Majesty's Dominions, hath well near consumed the old Store, and dotn exhaust the Magazines so fast, as, without a larger Supply, the Navy, Forts, and Land Armies, cannot be furnished; and whereas Foreign Salt-petre is not equal in Goodness with that of our own Country, and the Foreign Gunpowder far worse conditioned and less forcible than that which is made in England; and whereas divers Foreign States have of late prohibited the Exportation of Salt-petre and Gunpowder out of their own Dominions and Countries, so that there can be little hope of future Expectation of any Petre or Powder to be brought into this Kingdom as in former Times, which will enforce us to make Use of our own Materials; it is held most necessary, that the digging of Salt-petre and the making of Gunpowder shall by all fit Means be encouraged at this Time, when it so much concerns the Public Safety: Nevertheless, to prevent the reviving of thoso Oppressions and Vexations exercised upon the People, under the colourable Authority of Commissions granted to Salt-petre-men, which Burthen hath been eased since the Sitting ot this Parliament, and to the End that there may not be any Pretence to interrupt the Work, it is Ordained, by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That such Persons as shall be nominated and allowed by the said Lords and Commons in Parliament shall have Power and Authority, by this present Ordinance, to search and dig for Salt-petre, in all Pigeon-houses, Stables, and all other Outdiouses, Yards, and Places likely to afford that Earth, at fit seasons and Hours, between Sun-rising and Sun-setting (except all Dwelling-houses, Shops, and Milk-houses); the said Salt-petre-men, at their own Cost and Chaiges, levying the Ground, and repairing any Damage which shall be done by them; wherein if the said Petre-men do fail to give Satisfaction to the Contentment of the Owners, then, Notice given by the Parties grieved unto the next Deputy Lieutenant, or other Committees appointed by Parliament, the said Deputy Lieutenants, Committees, or any one or more of them, shall have

Power to compel the said Petre-men to lay the Ground in as good Order as before the breaking up (Working only excepted); and likewise to give such reasonable Satisfaction for the damage, as he or they, in his or their Discretion, shall think fit; which not being obeyed, the Name and Offence of such Person or Persons refusing shall be returned to the Parliament: And forasmuch as the Salt-petre-men, for the Provision of the State, are to bring in a Proportion of Salt-petre Weekly, which they can be in no

Person whatsoever shall refuse to suffer Salt-petre-men allowed by Parliament to dig and work for Salt-petre, acccording to the Rules and Limitations beforementioned, then the Salt-petre-men shall return the Names of such Persons so refusing, to be proceeded against according to their Demerits:And it is likewise Ordained, That the said Salt-petre-men, for the Carriage of the Liquor, Vessels, and other Utensils, from Place to Place, and delivering of the Salt-petre where the same shall be made into Gun-Powder, it shall be lawful for the said Salt-petre-men to demand and take Carts, by the known Officers, so as the Lading shall not exceed Twenty Hundred Weight, and the Journey not exceed Ten Miles; for Carriage whereof the Owner shall be paid after the Rate of Eight Pence the Mile; by which Means the Work of making Powder in this Kingdom (which else will be let fall in this time of Danger) may be continued and cherished, and the Subjects may have the Benefit of Powder at far easier Rates than now it is sold for.

And whereas the said Great Seal ought constantly to remain in the Hands and Custody of one or more Officer or Officers (sworn for that service), and to be used and employed for the Weal and Safety of His Majesty's People, which notwithstanding hath been diver's Times, si thence the conveying away thereof as aforesaid, put into the Hands of other Persons not sworn, and Popishly and dangerously affected, who have had the disposing and managing thereof at their own Wills and Pleasures, and hath been traitorously and perniciously abused, to the Ruin and Destruction of the Parliament and Kingdom, by granting and issuing out Divers illegal Commissions of Array, and other unlawful Commissions, for raising of Forces against the Parliament, by issuing out of most foul and scandalous Papers, under the Name and Title of Proclamations against both Houses of Parliament, and divers Members thereof, any others adhering to them, proclaiming them Traitors and Rebels; Commissions of Oyer and Terminer to proceed against divers of them as Traitors, and other Commissions to seize and confiscate their Estates, for no other Cause but for doing their Duties and Services to the Commonwealth; as likewise by granting that horrid Commission, for executing of that most bloody and detestable Design of Waller, Tomkins, and others, for the Destruction of the Parliament, and City of London, and of the Army raised for their just Defence; and (as if Massacres and Assassinations had been but light and venial Crimes) another Commission hath been granted, under the same Seal, for a Cessation of Arms with the barbarous and bloody Rebels in Ireland, after the Effusion of so much innocent Blood and Slaughter of above One Hundred Thousand Protestants, Men, Women, and Children, by their Merciless and bloody Hands, whereupon a Cessation of Arms is accordingly concluded, and those brutish Rebels thereby emboldened to prepare themselves, not only for a total extirpation of the Protestants remaining there, but for a Conquest also of this Kingdom; and further, by granting of

An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, for the making of Salt-petre, &c.

[3 April, 1644.]

Whereas the great Expence of Gunpowder, occasioned by the present War within His Majesty's Dominions, hath well near consumed the old store, and doth exhaust the Magazines so last, that, without a larger Supply, the Navy, Forts, and the Land Arms, cannot be furnished; and whereas Foreign Salt-petre is not equal in Goodness with that of our own Country, and the Foreign Gunpowder far worse conditioned, and less forceable, than that which is made in England; and whereas divers Foreign Estates have of late prohibited the Exportation of Salt-petre and Gunpowder out of their own Dominions and Countries, so that there can be little Hope of future Expectation of any Petre or Powder to be brought into this Kingdom as in former Times, which will inforce us to make Use of our own Materials; it is held most necessary, that the digging of Salt-petre, and making of Gunpowder, should by all fit means be encouraged at this Time, when it so much concerns the Public Safety:Nevertheless, to prevent the reviving of those Oppressions and Vexations exercised upon the People under the colourable Authority of Commissions granted to Salt-petre-men, which Burthen hath been eased since the Sitting of this Parliament; and to the End that there may not be any Pretence to interrupt the Work:It is Ordained, by the Loras and Commons in Parliament, That such Persons as shall be nominated and allowed by the Committee of Lords and Commons for the Safety of the Kingdom, or any Five of them, their Factors, Workmen, and Servants, shall have Power and Authority, by this present Ordinance, to search and dig for Salt-petre, in all Pigeon-houses, Stables, Cellars, Vaults, empty Ware houses, and other Out-houses, Yards, and Places likely to afford that Earth, at fit Seasons, from Halt an Hour after Sunrising in the Morning, till an Hour before Sun-setting; and in Pigeon-houses likely to afford that Earth, at fit Seasons, from Nine of the Clock in the Morning, till Three of the Clock in the Afternoon; the said Salt-petre-men at their own Cost and Charges leveling the Ground, and repairing any Damage which shall be done by them; wherein if the said Salt-petre-men do fail to give Satisfaction to the Contentment of the Owners, upon Complaint made by the Parties grieved, unto the Deputy-Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, Committees of Parliament, or any One or more of them, and they, or any One of them, shall have Power to compel the said Salt-petre-men to lay the Ground in as good Order as before the breaking-up (Working only ex-

cepted), and likewise to give such reasonable Satisfaction for the Damage, as he or they in his or their Discretion shall think fit, which not being obeyed, the name and offence of such Person or Persons refusing shall be returned to the said Committee of Lords and Commons for the Safety of the Kingdom, or any Five of them:And forasmuch as the Salt-petre-men, for the provision of the State, are to bring in a proportion of Salt-petre Weekly, which they can be in no Ways able to do in Case they should be denied to dig and work for Salt-petre, it is therefore Ordered, That in Case any Person whatsoever shall refuse to suffer Salt-petre-men, allowed by the Committee of Lords and Commons for the Safety of the Kingdom, or any Five of them, to dig, and work for Salt-petre, according to the Rules and Limitations beforementioned; upon Complaint thereof made to the Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, Committees of Parliament, or any One or more of them, then they, or any One of them, shall hereby have Power to inforce the Obedience of the Parties so refusing, or to certify their Offence, and Names of the Offenders, to the Committee of the Lords and Commons for the Safety of the Kingdom, to be proceeded against according to their Demerits: And it is likewise Ordained, That the said

Salt-petre-men, for the Carriage of the Liquor, Vessels, and other Utensils, from Place to Place, and delivering of the Salt-petre where the same shall be made into Gunpowder, it shall be lawful for the said Salt-petre-men to demand and take Carts, by the known Officers, so as the Lading shall not exceed Twenty Hundred Weight, and the Journey not exceed Ten Miles by common Estimation; for Carriage whereof, the Owner shall be paid after the Rate of Eight Pence the Mile, and the empty Vessels are to be re-carried gratis; and the said Salt-petre men are likewise to be freed from all Taxes and Tolls demandable for any of their Carriages used about their said Works: and in Case any Person whatsoever shall refuse to suffer the said Salt-peire-men to dig, or to do any other Thing in Pursuance of this Ordinance, according to the Limitations and Directions hereby given, then the Salt-petre-men shall return the Names of such Persons so refusing, to the Committee of Lords and Commons for the Safety of the Kingdom, or any Five of them, to be proceeded against according to their Demerits; by which Means the Work of making Powder in this Kingdom (which else will be let fall in this Time of Danger) may be continued and cherished, and the Subjects may have the Benefit of Powder at far easier Rates than now it is sold for:For which Purpose, it is lastly Ordained, That the said Committee of Lords and Commons for the Safety of the Kingdom shall, by virtue of this Ordinance, have Power and Authority to put this Ordinance in Execution, and to do and perform all such Thing and Things as to them shall seem expedient for the better effecting of this Service.

And it is further Ordained, That such Salt-petre-men as shall be allowed as aforesaid shall take such Out-houses, for their Work-houses, to set their Vessels and Utensils in, as shall be fit, and may be reasonably spared; and to have, take, and draw 8734. 2 D 2

This Ordinance of Parliament to continue for Two Years, from the 25th Day of March, 1644.

An Ordinance tor the better observation of the Lords-Day.

[8 April, 1644.]

Forasmuch as the Lords-day, notwithstanding several good Lawes heretofore made, hath been not onely greatly prophaned, but divers ungodly Books have been published by the Prelatical Faction, against the morality of that day, and to countenance the prophanation of the same, to the manifest indangering of souls, prejudice of the true Religion, great dishonour of Almighty God, and provocation of his just wrath and indignation against this Land;

Former Lawes to be put in execution.

Pastimes.

Children committing the said Offences.

The Lords and Commons for remedy thereof, do Order and Ordain, and be it Ordered and Ordained, That all the Lawes Enacted and in force, concerning the observation of the Lords-day, be carefully put in execution; and that all and singular person and persons whatsoever, shall on every Lords-day, apply themselves to the sanctification of the same, by exercising themselves thereon, in the duties of Piety and true Religion, publickly and privately: And that no person or persons whatsoever, shall publickly cry, shew forth or expose to sale, any Wares, Merchandizes, Fruit, Herbs, Goods or Chattels whatsoever, upon the Lords day, or any part thereof; upon pain, That every person so offending, shall forfeit the same Goods so cryed, shewed forth, or put to sale: And that no person or persons whatsoever shall, without reasonable cause for the same, travel, carry burthens, or do any worldly labours, or work whatsoever, on that day, or any part thereof; upon pain, That every one travelling contrary to the meaning of this Ordinance, shall forfeit for every offence, ten shillings of lawfull money; and that every person carrying any burthen, or doing any worldly labour or work, contrary to the meaning thereof, shall forfeit live shillings of like money for every such offence.

8 April, 1644.] Observation of Lord's Day.

421

And because the prophanation of the Lords-day hath been heretofore greatly occasioned by May-Poles, (a Heathenish vanity, generally abused to superstition and wickedness.) The Lords and Commons do further Order and Ordain, That all and singular May-Poles, that are, or shall be erected, shall be taken down and May-pole* removed by the Constables, Borsholders, Tything-men, petty shall be Constables, and Churchwardens of the Parishes, and places where removed, the same be: And that no May-Pole shall be hereafter set up, erected, or suffered to be within this Kingdome of England, or Dominion of Wales.

And for as much as it is necessary that some course be taken for the keeping of the Enemy from plundering and spoyling, and securing the Countries mom the danger of Alarams which otherwise will enforce them to continuall rising, disturbe them in their Harvest, and other necessary imployment, and make their charge insupportable; To the end therefore the Trained Bands now upon these late Alarms raised, may return home, and their Country secured Counties from such further trouble.

And on the next day, being Christmas Day, in particular.

Whereas some doubts have been raised whether the next Fast shall be celebrated, because it falleth on the day which heretofore was usually called the feast of the Nativity or our Saviour. The Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled doe order and ordaine that publique notice be given that the Fast appointed to be kept on the last Wednesday in every moneth ought to be observed untill it be otherwise ordered, by both llouses of Parliament: And that this day in particular is to be kept with the more solomne humiliation, because it may call to remembrance our sinnes, and the sinnes of our forefathers, who have turned this Feast, pretending the memory of Christ into an extreame forgetfulnesse of him, by giving liberty to carnal 1 and sensuall delights, being contrary to the life which Christ himselfe led here upon earth, and to the spirituall life of Christ in our soules for the sanctifying and saving whereof Christ was pleased both to take a humane fife, and to lay it down againe.

And whereas by another Ordinance of the fourth of October last, The said Lords and Commons did Ordaine, That the greatest part of the sums due and payable by vertue of the said former Ordinance, which were then in Arreare, should by the said Sir Gilbert Gerard be paid over to Sir Walter Earle Knight, Lieutenant of the Ordnance, for the uses therein limited and expressed; enjovning all and every such persons, as by the said first recited Ordinance were appointed to collect and leavy the said Arreares, forthwith to proceed effectually therein, and to make payment of the same in such manner as in and by the said first recited Ordinance was formerly appointed.

An Ordinance for taking away the Book of Common Prayer, and for establishing and putting in execution of the Directory for the publique worship of God.

[4 January, 1644/5.]

The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, taking into serious consideration the manifold inconveniences that have arisen by the Book of Common-Prayer in this Kingdome, and resolving, according to their Covenant, to reform Religion according to the Word of God, and the Example of the best Reformed Churches, have consulted with the Reverend, Pious, and Learned Divines called together to that purpose; And do judge it necessary, that the said Book of Common-Prayer be abolished, and the Directory for the Publique Worship of God, herein after mentioned, be established and observed in all the Churches within this Kingdome:Be it therefore Ordained by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, That the Statute of the second and third years of King Edward the Sixth, intituled, [The Penalty for not using Uniformity of Service, and Administration of Sacraments, &c.] And the Statute of the fifth and sixth years of the same King, intituled, [Uniformity of Prayer, and Administration of Sacraments, shall be used in the Church :] And so much of the Statute of the first year of Queen Elizabeth, intituled, [There shall be Uniformity of Prayer and Administration of Sacraments] as concerns the said Book of Common-Prayer, and the Uniformity of Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments:And so much of the Statute of the fifth year of the same Queen, intituled, [By whose Order, the Bible, and Book of Common-Prayer shall be Translated into the Welch Tongue] as concerns the Book of Common-Prayer: And so much of the Statute of the eighth year of the some Queen, intituled, [All Acts made by any person since primo Eliz. for the Consecrating, Investing &e of any Archbishop, or Bishop, shall be good] as concerns the said Book, be and stand from henceforth repealed, void, and of none effect, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever.

?lace of publique Worship within this Kingdom© of England, and lominion of Wales; Which Directory for the publique Worship of God, with the Preface thereof followeth. And it is further Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That there shall be provided at the charge of every Parish or Chappelry in this Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, a fair Register Book of Velim, Register to be kept by the Minister and other Officers of the Church; foi and that the Names of all Children Baptized, and of their Parents Manage* and of the time of their Birth and Baptizing, shall be written and Burials, and set down by the Minister therein; and also the Names of all Persons Married there, and the time of their Marriage; and also the Names of all Persons Buried in that Parish, and the time of their Death and Burial: And that the said Book shall be shewed by such as keep the same, to all persons reasonably desiring to search for the Birth, Baptizing, Marriage, or Burial of any person therein Registred, and to take a Copy, or procure a Certificate thereof

The Preface.

In the beginning of the blessed Reformation, our wise and Preface, pious Ancestours took care to set forth an Order for Redress of many things which they, then, by the Word discovered to be Vain, Erroneous, Superstitious, and Idolatrous in the Publique Worship of God. This occasioned many Godly and Learned men to rejoyce much in the Book of Common-Prayer at that time set forth; Because the Mass and^ the rest of the Latine-Service being removed, the Publique Worship was celebrated in our own Tongue; many of the common People also receive benefit by hearing the Scriptures read in their own Language which formerly were unto them as a Book that is sealed.

Howbeit, long and sad Experience hath made it manifest;

That the Leiturgie used in the Church of England (notwithstanding all the pains and Religious intentions of the Compilers of it) hath proved an offence, not onely to many of the Godly at home; but also to the Reformed Churches abroad.

For not to speak of urging the Reading of all the Prayers which very greatly increased the burden of it; the many unprofitable and burdensome Ceremonies, contained in it, have occasioned much mischief, as well by disquieting the Consciences of many godly Ministers and people who could not yeeld unto them, as by depriving them of the Ordinancies of Goa, which they might not enjoy without conforming or Subscribing to those Ceremonies.

Sundry good Christians have been by meanes thereof, kept from the Loras Table, and divers able and faithfull Ministers debarred from the Exercise of their Ministery (to the endangering of many thousand Souls in a time of such scarcity of faitnfull Pastors) and spoiled of their livelihood, to the undoing of them and their Families. Prelates and their Faction have laboured to raise the Estimation of it to such an height, as it there were no other Worship, or way of Worship of God amongst us, but onely the Service- Book; to the great hinderance of the Preaching of the Word, and (in some places, especially of late) to the justling

584 Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan., 1644/5

of it out, as unnecessary; or (at best) as far inferiour to the Reading of Common-Prayer, which was made no better then an Idol by many Ignorant and Superstitious People, who pleasing themselves in their presence at that Service, and their Lip-labour in bearing a part in it, have thereby hardened themselves in their ignorance, and carelesness of saving knowledge and true piety.

In the meantime Papists boasted, that the Book was a compliance with them in a great part of their Service, and so were not a little confirmed in their Superstition, and Idolatry, expecting rather our return to them, then endeavouring the reformation of themselves: In which expectation they were of late very much incouraged, when, upon the pretended warrantableness of imposing of the former Ceremonies, new ones were daily obtruded upon the Church.

Add hereunto (which was not foreseen, but since hath come to pass) that the Leiturgie hath been a great means, as on the one nanu to make and increase an idle and unedifying Ministery, which contented it self with set forms made to their hands by others, without putting forth themselves to exercise the gift of Prayer, with which our Lord Jesus Christ pleaseth to furnish all his Servants whom he calls to that Office: So on the other side it hath been (and ever would be, if continued) a matter of endless strife and contention in the Church, and a snare both to many .godly and faithfull Ministers, who have been persecuted and silenced upon that occasion, and to others of hopefull parts, many of which have been, and more still would be, diverted from all thoughts of the Ministery to other studies; especially in these latter times, wherein Goa vouchsafeth to his people more and better means for the discovery of Errour and Superstition, and for attaining of knowledge in the mysteries of godliness, and gilts in Preaching and Prayer

Upon these, and many the like weighty considerations, in reference to the whole Book in general, and because of divers particulars contained in it; not from any love to Novelty, or intention to disparage our first Reformers (of whom we are perswaded that, were they now alive, they would joyn with us in this work, and whom we acknowledge as Excellent Instruments raised by God to begin the purging and building of his House, and desire they may be had of us and Posterity in everlasting Remembrance, with thankfulness and honour; ) but that we may m some measure answer the gracious Providence of God, which at this time calleth upon us for further Reformation, and may satisfie our own consciences, and answer the expectation of other Reformed Churches, and the desires of many of the godly among our selves, and withall give some publique Testimony of our endeavours for Uniformity in Divine Worship, which we have promised in our Solemn League and Covenant: We have, after earnest and frequent calling upon the Name of God, and after much consultation, not with flesh and blood, but with his holy Word, resolved to lay aside the former Leiturgy, with the many Rites and Ceremonies formerly used in the Worship of God: And have agreed upon

4 Jan., 1644/5.] Directory for Public Worship. 585

this following Directory for all the parts of Publique Worship, at ordinary and extraordinary times.

Wherein our care hath been to hold forth such things as are of Divine Institution in every Ordinance; and other things we have endeavoured to set forth according to the Rules of Christian Prudence, agreeable to the General Rules of the Word of God.

Our meaning therein being onely that the general heads, . the sense and scope of the Prayers and other parts of Publique Worship being known to all, there may be a consent of all the Churches in those things that contain the substance of the Service and Worship of God; And the Ministers may be hereby directed in their Administrations to keep like soundness m Doctrine and Prayer; and may, if need be, nave some help and furniture:And yet so, as they become not hereby slothful] and negligent in stirring up the rifts of Christ in them: But that each one, by meditation, by taking heed to himself and the Flock of God committed to him, and by wise observing the wayes of Divine Providence, may be carefull to furnish his heart and tongue with further, or other materials of Prayer and Exhortation, as shall be needfull upon all occasions.

Of the Assembling of the Congregation, and their Behaviour in the Publique Worship of God.

When the Congregation is to meet for Publique Worship, the Assembly People (having before prepared their hearts thereunto) ought all and be-to come 'and joyn therein: not absenting themselves from the baviour of Publique Ordinances, through negligence, or upon pretence private meetings.

Let all enter the Assembly, not irreverently, but in a grave and seemly manner, taking their seats or places without Adoration, or Bowing themselvs towards one place or other.

The Congregation being assembled; the Minister, after solemn calling on them to the worshipping of the great name of God, is to begin with Prayer;

In all Reverence and Humility acknowledging the incomprehensible Greatness and Majesty of the Lord (in whose presence they do then in a special manner appear') and their own vileness and unwoilhiness to approach so near him; with their utter inability of themselves to so great a Work: And humbly beseeching him for Pardon, Assistance, and Acceptance in the whole Service then to be performed; and for a Blessing on that particular portion of his Word then to be read: and all, in the Name and Mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The Publique Worship being begun, the people are wholly to attend upon it; forbearing to reaae anything, except what the Minister is then reading or citing; and abstaining much more from all private whisperings conferences, salutations, or doing

586

Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan., 1644/5.

reverence to any persons present, or coming in; as also from all gazing, sleeping, and other undecent behaviour, which may disturb the Minister or people, or hinder themselves or others in the service of God.

If any through necessity be hindred from being present at the beginning, they ought not, when they come into the Congregation, to betake themselves to their private Devotions, but reverently to compose themselves to joyn with the Assembly, in that Ordinance of God which is then in hand.

Of Publique Reading of the Holy Scriptures.

Public Reading of the Word in the Congregation, being part of the

Reading of Publiaue Worship of God, (wherein we acknowledge our dependence upon nim, and subjection to him) and one Means bcnptures sanctified by him for the ecufying of his People, is to be performed by the Pastors and Teachers.

Howbeit, such as intend the Minister^ may occasionally both read the Word, and exercise their gift in Preaching in the Congregation, if allowed by the Presbytery therunto.

All the Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, (but none of those which are commonly called Apocrypha) shall be publiquely read in the vulgar tongue, out of the best allowed Translation, distinctly, that all may hear and understand.

How large a portion shall be read at once, is left to the wisdom of the Minister; But it is convenient, that ordinarily, one Chapter of each Testament be read at every meeting; and somtimes more, where the Chapters be short, or the Coherence of matter requireth it.

It is requisite that all the Canonical Books be read over in order, that the people may be better acquainted with the whole body of the Scriptures: And ordinarily, where the Reading in either Testament endeth on one Lords day, it is to begin the next.

We commend also the more frequent Reading of such Scriptures, as he that readeth shall think best for Edification of his Hearers; as the Book of Psalms, and such like.

When the Minister who readeth, shall judge it necessary to expound any part of what is read, let it not be done until the whole Chapter or Psalm be ended: and regard is always to be had unto the time, that neither Preaching or other Ordinance be straitned, or rendred tedious. Which rule is to be observed in all other publique performances.

Besides Publique Reading of the Holy Scriptures, every person that can reade, is to be exhorted to reade the Scriptures privately (and all others that cannot reade, if not disabled by age or otherwise, are likewise to be exhorted to learn to reade) and to have a Bible.

Public Prayer before the Sermon.

After reading of the Word (and singing of the Psalm) the Minister who is to Preach, is to endeavour to get his own, and

his Hearers hearts to be rightly affected with their sins, that they may all mourn in sense thereof before the Lord, and hunger and thirst after the Grace of God in Jesus Christ, by proceeding to a more full Confession of Sin with shame and holy confusion of face; and to call upon the Lord to this effect;

To acknowledge our great sinfulness; First, by reason of Original sin, which (beside the guilt that makes us liable to everlasting Damnation) is the seed of all other sins, hath depraved and poysoned all the faculties and powers of Soul and Body, doth defile our best actions, and (were it not restained, or our hearts renewed by Grace) would break forth into innumerable transgressions, and greatest rebellions against the Lord, that ever were committed by the vilest of the Sons of Men. And, next, by reason of Actual sins, our ownt sins, the sins of Magistrates of Ministers, and of the whole Nation, unto which we are many ways accessary. Which sins of ours receive many fearful 1 aggravations, we having broken all the Commandements of the holy, just, and good Law of God, doing that which is forbidden, and leaving undone what is enjoyned; and that not onely out of Ignorance, and Infirmity, but also more presumptuously against the light of our Mindes, checks of our Consciences, and motions, of his own Holy Spirit to the contrary, so that we have no cloak for our sins; Yea, not onely despising the riches of Gods goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering, but standing out against many invitations and offers of Grace in the Gospel, not endeavouring as we ought to receive Christ into our hear s by Faith, or to walk worthy of him in our lives.

To bewail our blindness of minde, hardness of heart, unbelief, impenitencie, securitie, lukewarmness, barrenness, our not endeavouring after mortification and newness of life:nor after the exercise of godliness in the power thereof; and that the best of us have not so ‘ sted lastly walked with God, kept our garments so unspotted, nor been so zealous of his glory, and the good of others, as we ought: And to mourn over such other sins as the Congregation is particularly guiltie of; notwithstanding the manifold and great mercies of our God, the Love of Christ, the Light of the Gospel, and Reformation of Religion, our own purposes, promises, vows, solemn Covenant, and other special obligations to the contrary.

To acknowledge and confess, that, as we are convinced of our guilt; so out of a deep sense thereof, we judge ourselves unworthy of the smallest benefits, most worthy of Gods fiercest wrath, and of all the Curses of the Law and heaviest Judgements inflicted upon the most rebellious Sinners; and that he might most justly take his Kingdom and Gospel from us, plague us with all sorts of spiritual and temporal judgements in this life, and after cast us into utter Darkness, in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth for evermore.

Notwithstanding all which, To draw near to the Throne of Grace, encouraging our selves with hope of a gracious Answer of our Prayers, in the riches and all-sufficiency of that onely one

oblation, the satisfaction and intercession of the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of his Father, and our Father; and, in confidence of the exceeding great and precious promises of mercy and grace in the new Covenant, through the same Mediator thereof, to deprecate the heavie wrath and curse of God. which we are not able to avoid or bear; and humbly, and earnestly to supplicate for mercy in the free and full remission of all our sins, and that onely for the bitter sufferings and precious merits of that our onely Saviour Jesus Christ.

That the Lord would vouchsafe to shed abroad his love in our hearts by the holy Ghost; seal unto us by the same spirit of Adoption, the full assurance of our Pardon and Reconciliation, comfort all that mourn in Zion, speak peace to the wounded and troubled spirit; and bind up the broken hearted: And as for secure & presumptuous sinners, that he would open their eys, convince their consciences, and turn them from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan, unto God, that they also may receive forgiveness of sin, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith in Christ Jesus.

With Remission of sins through the bloud of Christ To pray for sanctification by his Spirit; the Mortification of sin dwelling in, and many times tyrannizing over us, the quickning of our dead spirits with the life of God in Christ, grace to fit and inable us for all duties of conversation, and callings towards God and men, strength against temptations, the sanctified use of blessings and crosses, and perseverance in Faith, and obedience unto the end.

To pray for all in Authority, especially for the Kings Majesty that God. would make him rich in blessings, both in his person and government; establish his Throne in Religion and Righteousness, save him from evil Counsel, and make him a blessed and glorious Instrument for the conservation and propagation of the Gospel, for the encouragement and protection of them that do well, the terrour of all that do evil, and the great good of the whole Church, and of all his Kingdomes; For the conversion of the Queen

or the Universities, and all Schools and Religious Seminaries of Church and Commonwealth, that they may flourish more and more in Learning and piety; for the particular City or Congregation, that God would pour out a blessing upon the Ministry of the Word, Sacraments, and Discipline, upon the Civil Government, and all the several Families and persons therein; For mercy to the aflicted under any inward or outward distress; For seasonable weather and fruitfull seasons as the time may require; For averting the Judgements that we either feel or fear, or are liable unto, as Famine, Pestilence, the Sword, and ruch like.

And, with confidence of his mercy to his whole Church, and the acceptance of our persons through the merits and mediation of our great High-rriest the Lora Jesus, To profess that it is the desire of our souls to have fellowship with God in the reverent and conscionable use of his holy Ordinances; and, to that purpose to pray earnestly for his grace and effectual assistance to the sanctification of his holy Sabbath, the Lords day, in all the duties thereof, publick and private both to ourselves, and to all other Congregations of his people, according to the riches and excellency of the Gospel this day celebrated and enjoyed.

And, because we have been unprofitable hearers in times past, and now cannot of our solves receive as we should, the deep things of God, the mysteries of Jesus Christ, which require a spiritual! discerning, To pray that the Lord who teacheth to profit, would graciously please to pour out the Spirit of Grace, together with the outward means thereof, causing us to attain such a measure of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, and in him, of the things which belong to our peace, that we may account all things but as dross in comparison of him: And that we, tasting the first fruits of the glory that is to be revealed, may long lor a more full and perfect communion with him, that where he is, wo may be also, and enjoy the fulness of those joyes and pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore.

More particularly, that Ood would in special manner furnish his Servant (now called to dispense* the* bread of life unto his houshold) with wisedome, ndelity, zeal, and utterance,

590

Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan., 1644/5.

that he may divide the Word of God aright, to every one his portion, in evidence and demonstration of the Spirit and power; and that the Lord would circumcise the ears and hearts of the Hearers, to hear, love, and receive with meekness the ingrafted Word, which is able to save their souls, make them as good ground to receive in the good seed of the Word, and strengthen them against the temptations of Satan, the cares of the World, the hardness of their own hearts, and whatsoever else may hinder their profitable and saving hearing; that so Christ may be so formed in them, and live in them, that all their thoughts may be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, and their hearts established m every good word and work for ever.

We judge this to be a convenient Order, in the ordinary publike prayers; vet so, as the Minister may defer (as in prudence he shall think meet) some part of these Petitions, till after his Sermon, or offer up to God some of the Thanksgivings, hereafter appointed, in his Prayer before his Sermon.

Of the Preaching of the Word.

Preaching, Preaching of the Word, being the power of God unto Salvation, and one of the greatest and most excellent Works tielonging to the Ministry of the gospel, should be so performed, that the Workman need not to be ashamed, but may save himself, and those that hear him.

It is presupposed (according to the Rules for Ordination) that the Minister of Christ is in some good measure gifted for so weighty a service, by his skill in the Original Languages, and in such Arts and Sciences as are handmaids unto Divinity, by his knowledge in the whole Body of Theology, but most of all in the holy Scriptures, having his senses and heart exercised in them above the common sort of Believers; And by the illumination of Gods Spirit, and other gifts of edification which (together with reading and studying of the Word) he ought still to seek by Prayer, and an humble heart, resolving to admit and receive any truth not yet attained, when ever God shall make it known unto him. All which he is to make use of, and improve, in his private preparations, before he deliver in publike what he hath provided.

Ordinarily, the subject of his Sermon is to be some Text ot Scripture, holding forth some principle or head of Religion; or suitable to some special occasion emergent; or he may go on in some Chapter, Psalm, or Book of the holy Scripture, as he shall see fit.

Let the Introduction to his Text be brief and perspicuous, drawn from the Text it self, or context, or some parallel place, or general sentence of Scripture.

If the Text be long (as in Histories and Parables it sometimes must be) let him give a brief sum of it; if short, a Paraphrase thereof, if need be: In both, looking diligently to the scope of the Text, and pointing at the chief heads and grounds of Doctrine, which he is to raise frqm iU

4 Jan., 1644/5.] Directory for Public Worship.

591

In Analysing and dividing his Text, he is to regard more the order of matter, then of words; and neither to burthen the memory of the hearers in the beginning, with too many members of Division, nor to trouble their minus with obscure terms of Art.

In raising Doctrines from the Text, his care ought to be, First, that the matter be the truth of God. Secondly, that it be a truth contained in, or grounded on that Text, that the hearers may discern how Goa teacheth it from thence. Thirdly, that he chiefly insist upon those Doctrines which are principally intended, and make most for the edification of the hearers.

The Doctrine is to be expressed in plain terms; or, if any thing in it need explication, is to be opened, and the consequence also from the Text cleared. The parallel places of Scripture confirming the Doctrine, are rather to be plain and pertinent then many, and (if need be) somewhat insisted upon, and applied so the purpose in hand.

The Arguments or Reasons are to be solid; and as much as may be, convincing. The illustrations of what kinde soever, ought to be full of light, and such as may convey the truth into the Hearers heart with spiritual delight.

If any doubt, obvious from Scripture, Reason, or Prejudice of the Hearers, seem to arise, it is very requisite to remove it, by reconciling the seeming differences, answering the reasons, and discovering and taking away the causes of prejudice and mistake. Otherwise, it is not fit to detain the Hearers with propounding or answering vain or wicked Cavils, which as they are endless, so the propounding and answering of them doth more hinder then promote edification.

He is not to rest in general Doctrine, although never so much cleared and confirmed, but to bring it home to special Use, by application to his Hearers: Which, albeit it prove a work of great difficulty to himself, requiring much prudence, zeal, and meditation, and to the natural and corrupt man will be very unpleasant; yet he is to endeavour to perform it in such a manner, that his Auditors may feel the Word of God to be quick and powerfull, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; and that if any unbeliever or ignorant person be present, he may have the secrets of his heart made manifest, and give glory to God.

In the Use of Instruction or Information in the knowledge of some truth, which is a consequence from his Doctrine, he may (when convenient) confirm it by a few firm Arguments from the Text in hand, and other places of Scripture, or from the nature of that Common place in Divinity, whereof that truth is a branch.

In Confutation of false Doctrines, he is neither to raise an old Heresie from the grave, nor to mention a blasphemous opinion unnecessarily: But if the people be in danger of an Errour, he is to confute it soundly, and endeavour to satisfle their judgements and consciences against all objections.

In Exhorting to Duties, he is, as he seeth cause, to teach also the means that help to the performance of them.

In Dehortation, Reprehension, and publique Admonition (which

SO 2

Directory f'or Public WoRSHrp. [4 Jan., 1644/5.

require special wisdom) let him, as there shall be cause, not only discover the nature and greatness of the sin, with the misery attending it, but also shew the danger his Hearers are in to be overtaken and surprized by it, together with the Remedies and best way to avoid it.

In applying comfort, whether general against all tentations, or particular against some special troubles or terrors, he is carefully to answer such objections as a troubled heart and afflicted spirit may suggest to the contrary.

ft is also sometimes requisite to give some notes of trial (which is very profitable, especially when performed by able and ex-perieneeu Ministers, with circumspection and prudence, and the Signes clearly granted on the noly Scripture) whereby the Hearers may be able to examine themselves, whether they have attained those Graces, and performed those Duties to winch he exhorteth, or be guilty of the sin Reprehended, and in danger of the judgements tnreatned, or are such to whom the Consolations propounded do belong, that accordingly they may be quiekned and excited to duty, humbled for their Wants and Sins, affected with their Danger, and strengthened with Comfort as their condition on examination shall require.

And, as he needeth not alwayes to prosecute every Doctrine which lies in his Text, so is he wisely to make choice of such Uses, as, by his residence and conversing with his flock, he findeth most needfull and seasonable: and, amongst these such as may most draw their souls to Christ, the fountain of light, holiness and comfort.

This method is not prescribed as necessary for every man, or upon every Text; but only recommended, as being found by experience to be very much blessed of God, and very helpfull for the peoples understandings and memories.

But the Servant of (Jurist, what ever his method be, is to perform his whole Ministery;

1. Painfully, not doing the work of the Lord negligently.

2. Plainly, that the meanest may understand, delivering the truth, not in the entising words of mans wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect; Abstaining also from an unprofitable use of unknown Tongues, strange phrases, and cadences of sounds and words, sparingly citing sentences of Ecclesiastical, or other humane Writers, ancient or Modern, be they never so elegant.

3. Faithfully, looking at the honour of Christ, the conversion,

edification and salvation of the people, not at his own gain or glory: Keeping nothing back which may promote those holy

ends, giving to every one his own portion, and bearing indifferent respect unto all, without neglecting the meanest, or sparing the greatest in their sins.

4. Wisely, framing all his Doctrines, Exhortations, and especially his Reproofs, in such a manner as may be most likely to prevail, showing all due respect to each mans person and place, and not mixing his own passion or bitterness.

4 Jan.y 1644/5.] Directory for Public Worship.

593

5. Gravely, as becometh the Word of God, shunning all such gesture, voice and expressions, as may occasion the corruptions of men to despise him and his Ministery.

6. With loving affection, that the people may see all coming from his godly zeal, and hearty desire to do them good. And,

7. As taught of God, and perswaded in his own heart, that all that he teacheth, is the truth of Christ: and walking before his flock as an example to them in it; eamastly, both in private and publique, recommending his labours to the blessing of God, and watchfully looking to himself and the flock whereof the Lord hath made him overseer; So shall the Doctrine of truth be preserved uncorrupt, many souls converted and built up, and himself receive manifold comforts of his labours, even in this life, and afterward the Crown of Glory laid up for him in the world to come.

Where there are more Ministers in a Congregation then one, and they of different gifts, each may more especially apply himself to Doctrine or Exhortation, according to the gift wherein he most excelleth, and as they shall agree between themselves.

Of Prayer after the Sermon.

The Sermon being ended, the Minister is; Prayer after

To give thanks for the great Love of God in sending his Son the Sermon. Jesus Christ unto us; For the communication of his Holy Spirit; For the light and liberty of the glorious Gospel, and the rich and heavenly blessings revealea therein; as namely,

Election, Vocation, Adoption, Justification, Sanctification, and hope of Glory; For the admirable goodness of God in freeing the Land from Antichristian Darkness and Tyranny, and for all other National Deliverances; For the Reformation of Religion;

For the Covenant; and for many Temporal blessings.

To pray for the continuance of the Gospel, and all Ordinances thereof, in their purity, power and liberty. To turn the chief and most useful heads of the sermon into some few Petitions; and to pray that it may abide in the heart, and bring forth fruit

To pray for preparation for death and judgement, and a watching for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. To intreat of God the forgiveness of the iniquities of our holy things, and the acceptation of our spiritual sacrifice, through the merit and mediation of our great High-Priest and Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ.

And because the Prayer which Christ taught his Disciples, is not onely a pattern of Prayer, but it self a most comprehensive Prayer, we recommend it also to be used in the Prayers of the Church.

And whereas, at the Administration of the Sacraments, the holding Publique Fasts and dayes of Thankesgiving, and other special occasions, which may anord matter of special Petitions and Thankesgivings; It is requisite to express somewhat in our publique Prayers (as at this time, it is our duty to pray for a 8734. 2 P

blessing upon the Assembly of Divines, the Armies by Sea and Land for the defence of the King, Parliament and Kingdom), Every Minister is herein to apply himself in his'Prayer before or after his Sermon to those occasions; but for the manner he is left to his liberty as God shall direct and inable him, in piety and wisdom to discharge his duty.

The Prayer ended, let a Psalm be sung, if with conveniency it may be done. After which (unless some other Ordinance of Chris i nat concerneth the Congregation at that time be to follow) et the Minister dismiss the Congregation with a solemn

The Administration of the Sacraments.

And first, Of Baptism.

Baptism. Baptism, As it is not unnecessarily to be delayed, so is it not to be administred in any case by any private person; but by a Minister of Christ, called to be the Steward of the Mysteries of God.

Nor is it to be administred in private places, or privately, but in the place of publique Worship, and in the face of the Congregation, where the people may most conveniently see and hear; and not in the places where Fonts in the time of Popery were unfitly and superstitiously placed.

The Childe to be Baptized, after notice given to the Minister the day before, is to be presented by the Father, or (in case of his necessary absence) by some Christian friend in his place, professing his earnest desire that the Childe may be Baptized.

Before Baptisme, the Minister is to use some words ot Instruction, touching the Institution, Nature, Use and ends of this Sacrament: shewing,

That it is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ: That it is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, of our Ingrafting into Christ, and of our Union with him, of Remission of Sins, Regeneration, Adoption, and Life eternal: That the Water in Baptism, represented and signified, both the blood of Christ, which taketh away all guilt of sinne, Original and Actual; and the sanctifying vertue of the Spirit of Christ against the Dominion of Sin, and the Corruption of our sinful Nature: That Baptizing, or sprinkling and washing with water signified the cleansing from sin by the Bloud; and for the Merit of Christ, together with the Mortification of sin, and rising from sin to Newness of life, by vertue of the Death and Resurrection of Christ: That the Promises made to Believers and their seed, and that the seed and posterity of the Faithfull, bom within the Church, have by their birth, interest in the Covenant, and right to the Seal of it, and to the outward Priviledges of the Church, under the Gospel, no less then the Children of Abraham in the time of the Old Testament; the Covenant of Grace, for substance, being the same; and the Grace of God and the consolation of Believers, more plentiful then before: That the Son of God admitted little children into his presence, imbracing and blessing them, saying, For of such is the

4 Jan., 1644/5.] Directory for Public Worship. 595

Kingdom of God: That children by Baptism are solemnly received into the bosome of the visible Church, distinguished from the world, and them that are without, and united with Believers; and that all who are baptized in the Name of Christ, do renounce, and by their Baptism are bound to fight against the Devil, the World and the Flesh: That they are Christians, and federally holy before Baptism, and therefore are they Baptized:That the inward Grace and vertue of Baptism is not tied to that very moment of time wherein it is administred, and that the fruit and power thereof reacheth to the whole course of our life; and that outward Baptism is not so necessary, that through the want thereof the Infant is in danger of Damnation, or the Parents guilty, if they do not contemn or neglect the Ordinance of Christ when and where it may be had.

In these or the like Instructions, the Minister is to use his own liberty, and godly wisdom, as the Ignorance or Errors in the Doctrine of Baptism, and the Edification of the people shall require.

He is also to admonish all that are present;

To look back to their Baptism; to repent of their sins against their Covenant with God, to stir up their faith; to improve and make the right use. or their Baptism; and of the Covenant sealed thereby betwixt God and their souls.

He is to exhort the parent;

To consider the great mercy of God to him and his childe; To bring up the childe in the knowledge of the grounds of the Christian Religion, and in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: and to let him know the danger of Gods wrath to himself and child, if he be negligent. Requiring his solemn promise for thepenormance of his duty.

This being done, Prayer is also to be joyned with the word of Institution, for sanctifying the water to this spiritual use, and the Minister is to pray to this or the like effect:

That the Lord who hath not left us as strangers without the Covenant of promise, but called us to the priviledges of his Ordinances, would graciously vouchsafe to sanctifie and bless his own Ordinance of Baptism at this time: That he would joyn the inward Baptism of his spirit with the outward Baptism of water; make this Baptism to the Infant a Seal of Adoption, Remission of sin, Regeneration, and Eternal life, and of all other promises of the Covenant of Grace: That the childe may be planted into the likeness of the death and Resurrection of Christ; and that the body of sin being destroyed in him, he may serve God in newness of life all his dayes.

Then the Minister is to demand the Name of the childe, which being told him, he is to say (calling the Childe by his Name)

I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

596

Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan., 1644/

As he pronounceth these words, he is to Baptize the Childe with water: which for the manner of doing of it, is not onely lawfull but sufficient and most expedient to be, by powring or sprinkling of the water on the Face of the childe, without adding any other Ceremony.

This done, he is to give thanks and pray, to this or the like purpose;

Acknowledging with all thankfulness, that the Lord is true and faithfull in keeping Covenant and Mercy: That he is good and gracious, not onely in that he numbreth us among his Saints, but is pleased also to bestow upon our children this singular token and badge of his love in Christ: That in his truth and special providence, he daily bringeth some into the bosome of his Church, to be partakers of his inestimable benefits, purchased by the bloud of his dear Son, for the continuance and increase of his Church.

And praying, That the Lord would still continue and daily confirm more and more this his unspeakable favour; That he would receive the Infant now Baptized, and solemnly entred into the houshold of Faith, into his Fatherly tuition and defence, and remember him with the favour that he sheweth to his people; That if he shall be taken out of this life in his infancy, the Lord, who is rich in mercy, would be pleased to receive him up into glory; and if he live and attain the years of discretion, that the Lord would so teach him by his Word and Spirit, and make his Baptism effectual to him, and so uphold him by his Divine power and grace, that by Faith he may prevail against the Devil, the World, and the Flesh, till in the end he obtain a full and final victory, and so be kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Of the Celebration of the Communion, or Sacrament of the

Lords Supper.

The Communion, or Supper of the Lord is frequently to be Celebrated; But how often, may be considered and determined by the Ministers and other Church Govemours of each Congregation, as they shall finde most convenient for the comfort and edification of the people committed to their charge. And when it shall be administred, we judge it convenient to be done after the morning Sermon.

The Ignorant and the Scandalous are not fit to receive this Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

Where this Sacrament cannot with conveniency be frequently administred, it is requisite that publike warning be given the Sabbath day before the administration thereof: and that either then, or on some day of that Week, something concerning that Ordinance, and the due preparation thereunto, and participation thereof be taught, that by the diligent use of all means sanctified of God to that end, both in pubhque and private, all may come better prepared to that heavenly Feast.

When the day is come for administration, the Minister having ended his Sermon and Prayer, shall make a short exhortation;

4 Jan., 1644/5.] Directory for Public Worship. 597

Expressing the inestimable benefit we have by this Sacrament; together with the ends and use thereof: Setting forth the great necessity of having our comforts and strength renewed thereby in this our pilgrimage and warfare: How necessary it is that we come unto it with Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Love, , n<I with hungring and thirsting souls after Christ and hh beiu Ja-: How great the danger, to eat and .irink unworthily.

Next, he is in the name of Christ on the one part, to warn all such as are Ignorant, Scandalous, Profane, or that live in any sin or offence against their knowledge or conscience, that they presume not to come to that holy Table, shewing them, That he that eaceth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement unto himself: And on the other part, he is in especial manner to invite and encourage all that labour under the sense of the burden of their sins; and fear of wrath, and desire to reach out unto a greater progress in Grace then yet they can attain unto, to come to the Loras Table; assuring them in the same Name, of ease, refreshing and strength to their weak and wearied souls.

After this Exhortation, Warning, and Invitation, the Table being before decently covered, and so conveniently placed, that the Communicants may orderly sit about it, or at it, The Minister is to begin the action with sanctifying and blessing the elements of Breaa and Wine set before him (the Bread in comely and convenient vessels, so prepared, that being broken by him, and given, it may be distributed amongst the Communicants: The Wine also in large Cups) having first in a few words shewed, That those elements, otherwise common, are now set apart and sanctified to this holy use, by the word of Institution and Prayer.

Let the words of Institution be read out of the Evangelists, or out of the first Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians, chap. 11. vers. 23. I have received of the Loi'd, &c. to the 27, verse, which the Minister may, when he seeth requisite, explain and apply.

Let the Prayer, Thankesgiving, or Blessing of the Bread and Wine, be to this effect;

With humble and hearty acknowledgement of the greatness of our misery, from which neither man nor Angel was able to deliver us, and of our great unworthiness of the least of all Gods mercies; To give thanks to God for all his benefits, and especially for that great benefit of our Redemption, the love of God the Father, the sufferings and merits of the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, by which we are delivered; and for all means of Grace, the Word and Sacraments, and for this Sacrament in particular, by which Christ and all his benefits are applied and sealed up unto us, which, notwithstanding the denial of them unto others, are in great mercy continued unto us, after so much and long abuse of them all.

To profess that there is no other name under heaven, by which we can be saved, but the Name of Jesus Christ, by whom alone we receive liberty and life, have access to the throne of Grace,

598

Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan. 1644/5.

are admitted to eat and drink at his own Table, and are sealed uj3 by his Spirit to an assurance of happiness and everlasting

Earnestly to pray to God the Father of all mercies, and God of all consolation, to vouchsafe his gracious presence and the effectual working of his spirit in us, and so to sanctifie these Elements both of Bread and Wine, and to bless his own Ordinance, that we may receive by Faith the Body and Bloud of Jesus Christ crucified for us, and so to feed upon him, that he may be one with us, and we with him, that he may live in us, and we in him, and to him, who hath loved us and given himself lor us.

All which he is to endeavour to perform with suitable affections answerable to such an holy Action, and to stir up the like in the people.

The Elements being now sanctified by the Word and Prayer, The Minister being at the Table, is to take the Bread in his nand, and say, in these expressions (or other the like used by Christ, or his Apostle upon this occasion:)

According to the holy Institution, command, and example of our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, I take this Bread, and having given thanks, I break it and give it unto you (There the Minister who is also himself to communicate, is to break the Bread, and give it to the Communicants:) Take ye, eat ye, This is the body of Christ which is broken for you, Do this m remembrance of him.

In like manner the Minister is to take the Cup, and say in these expressions (or other the like, used by Christ, or the Apostle upon the same occasion; )

According to the Institution, command, and example of our Lord Jesus Christ. I take this Cup and give it unto you, (Here he giveth it to the Communicants; ) This Cup is the new Testament in the blood of Christ, which is shed for the Remission of the sins of many; Drink ye all of it.

After all have communicated, the Minister may, in a few words

!>ut them in minde Of the grace of God in Jesus Christ, held orth in this Sacrament, and exhort them to walk worthy of it

The Minister is to give solemn thanks to God,

For his rich mercy, and invaluable goodness vouchsafed to them in that Sacrament, and to entreat for pardon for the defects of the whole service, and for the gracious assistance of his good Spirit* whereby they may be enabled to walk in the strength of that Grace, as becometh those who have received so great pledges of salvation.

The Collection for the poor is to be ordered, that no part of the publique worship be thereby hindred.

Of the Sanctification of the Lords Day.

The Lords The Lords day ought to be so remembred before hand, as that all

D%y. worldly business of our ordinary Callings may be so ordered, and

so timely and seasonably laid aside, as they may not be impediments to the due sanctifying of the Day when it comes.

The whole Day is to be celebrated as holy to the Lord, both in publique and private, as being the Christian Sabbath. To which end it is requisite, that there be a holy cessation or resting all the Day, from all unnecessary labours, and an abstaining, not onely from all sports and pastimes, but also from all worldly words and thoughts.

That the diet on that Day be so ordered, as that neither servants be unnecessarily detained from the publique worship of God, nor any other persons hindred from the sanctifying that Day.

That there be private preparation of every person and family, by prayer for themselves, and for Gods assistance of the Minister, and for a blessing upon his Ministery, and by such other holy exercises, as may further dispose them to a more comfortable communion with (jod in his publique Ordinances.

That all the people meet so timely for publique worship, that the whole Congregation may be present at the beginning, and with one heart solemnly ioyn together in all parts of the publique Worship; and not depart till after the Blessing.

That what time is vacant, between, or after the solemn meetings of the Congregation in publique, be spent in Reading, Meditation, Repetition of Sermons (especially, by calling their families to an account of what they have neard) and catechizing of them, holy conferences, prayer for a blessing upon the Publique Ordinances, singing of Psalms, visiting the sick, relieving the poor, and such like duties of piety, charity and mercy, accounting the Sabbath a delight

The Solemnization of Marriage.

Although Marriage be no Sacrament, nor peculiar to the Marriage Church of God, but common to mankinde, and of publique interest in every Common-wealth, yet because such as marry are to marry in the Lord, and have special need of Instruction. Direction, and Exhortation from the Word of God, at their entring into such a new condition; and, of the blessing of God upon them therein, we judge it expedient, that Marriage be solemnized by a lawfull Minister of the Word, that he may accordingly counsel them, and pray for a blessing upon them.

Marriage is to be betwixt one man and one woman only, and they, such as are not within the degrees of Consanguinity or Affinity prohibited by the Word of God. And the parties are to be of years of discretion, fit to make their own choice, or upon good grounds to give their mutual consent.

Before the solemnizing of Marriage between any Persons, their purpose of Marriage shall be published by the Minister three several Sabbath dayes in the Congregation, at the place or places of their most usual and constant abode respectively. And of this Publication, the Minister who is to joyn them in Marriage, shall have sufficient Testimony, before he proceed to solemnize the Marriage.

Goo

Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan.% 1644/5

Before that Publication of such their purpose (if the parties be under age) the consent of the Parents, or others, under whose

Eower they are ("in caso the Parents be dead) is to be made nown to the Church-Officers of that Congregation, to be Recorded.

The like is to be observed in the proceedings of all others, although of age, whose Parents are living, for their first marriage. And in after marriages of either of those parties, they shall be exhorted not to contract marriage, without first acquainting their Parents with it, (if with conveniency it may be done) endeavouring to obtain their consent.

Parents ought not to force their children to marry without their free consent, nor deny their own consent without just cause.

After the purpose or contract of marriage hath been thus published, the marriage is not to be long deferred. Therefore, the Minister, having had convenient warning, and nothing being objected to hinder it, is publikely to solemnize it in the place appointed by Authority for publique Worship, before a competent number of credible witnesses, at some convement hour of the day, at any time of the year, except on a day of publique Humiliation. And vre advise that it be not on the Lords day.

And because all Relations are sanctified by the Word and

Acknowledging our sins, whereby we have made our selves less then the least of all the mercies of God, and provok'd him to imbitter all our comforts, earnestly in the name of Christ to intreat the Lord (whose presence and favour is the happiness of every condition, and sweetens every Relation) to be their Portion, and to own and accept them in Christ, who are now to be joyned in the Honourable estate of Marriage, the Covenant of their God: And that as he hath brought them together by his Providence, he would sanctifie them by his Spirit, giving them a new frame of heart, fit for their new estate; enriching them with all Graces, whereby they may perform the duties, enjoy the comforts, undergo the cares, and resist the temptations which accompany that condition, as becometh Christians.

The Prayer being ended, it is convenient that the Minister do briefly declare unto them out of the Scripture,

The Institution, Use, and ends of Marriage, with the Conjugal duties which in all faithfulness they are to perform each to other, exhorting them to study the holy Word of God that they may learn to live by Faith, and to be content in the midst of all Marriage cares and troubles, sanctifying Gods name in a thank-full, sober, and holy use of all Conjugal comforts, praying much with, and for, one another, watching over, and provoking .each other to love and good works, and to live together as the heirs of the Grace of life.

After solemn charging of the persons to be married, before the great God, who searcheth all hearts, and to whom they must give a strict account at the last Day, that if either of them know

any cause, by precontract or otherwise, why they may not lawfully proceed to marriage, that they now discover it: The Minister (if no impediment be acknowledged) shall cause, first, the Man to take the woman by the right hand, saying these words,

I N. do take thee N. to be my married Wife, and do, in the presence of God, and before this Congregation, promise and covenant to be a loving and faithfull Husband unto thee, untill God shall separate us by death.

Then the Woman shall take the Man by his right hand, and say these words,

I N. do take thee N. to be my married Husband, and I do, in the presence of God, and before this Congregation, promise and Covenant to be a loving, faithfull, and obedient Wife unto thee, untill God shall separate us by death.

Then without any further Ceremony; the Minister shall in the face of the Congregation, pronounce them to be Husband and Wife, according to Gods Ordinance; and so conclude the action with Prayer to this effect;

That the Lord would be pleased to accompany his own Ordinance with his blessing, beseeching him to enrich the persons now married, as with other pledges of his love, so particularly with the comforts and fruits of marriage, to the praise of nis abundant mercy, in and through Christ Jesus.

A Register is to be carefully kept, wherein the names of the parties so married, with the time of their marriage, are forthwith to be fairly Recorded in a Book provided for that purpose, for the perusal of all whom it may concern.

Concerning Visitation of the Sick.

It is the duty of the Minister, not onely to teach the Visitation People committed to his charge, in publique, but privately, of the Sick, and particularly to admonish, exhort, reprove, and comfort

them, upon all seasonable occasions, so far as his time, strength, and personable safety will permit.

He is to admonish them in time of health to prepare for death; and for that purpose they are often to comer with their Minister about the estate of their souls: and in times of sickness to desire his advice and help timely and seasonably, before their strength and understanding fail them.

Times of sickness and affliction are special opportunities put into his hand by God, to minister a word in season to weary souls: because then the conscienoes of men are, or should be more awakened to bethink themselves of their Spiritual estates for Eternity, and Satan also takes advantage

then, to load them more with sore and heavy temptations:

Therefore the Minister being sent for, and repairing to the Sick, is to apply himself with all tenderness and love, to administer some Spiritual good to his soul, to this effect

He may, from the consideration of the present sickness, instruct him out of Sdripture, that diseases come not by

b

602 Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan., 1644/5.

chance, or by distempers of body onely, but by the wise and orderly guidance of the good band of God to every particular person smitten by them. And that whether it be laid upon him out of displeasure for sin, for his correction and amendment, or for trial and exercise of his graces, or for other special and excellent ends, all his sufferings shall turn to his profit, and work together for his good, if he sincerely labour to make a sanctified use of Gods visitation, neither despising his chastening, nor waxing weary of his correction,

If he suspect him of ignorance, he shall examine him in the principles of Religion, especially touching Repentance and Faith; and, as he seeth cause, instruct him in the nature, use, excellency, and necessity of those graces; as also touching the Covenant of Grace, and Christ the Son of God, the Mediatour of it, and concerning Remission of sins by Faith in him.

He shall exhort the sick person to examine himself, to search and tir his former ways, and his estate towards God.

Ana if the sick person shall declare any scruple, doubt or temptation, that are upon him, instructions and resolutions shall be given to satisfie and settle him.

If it appear that he hath not a due sense of his sins, endeavours ought to be used to convince him of his sins, of the guilt and desert of them, of the filth and pollution, which the soul contracts by them, and of the curse of the Law, and wrath of God due to them; that he may be truly affected with, and humbled for them; and withall to make known the danger of deferring Repentance, and of neglecting Salvation at any time offered, to awaken his Conscience, and rowze him out of a stupid and secure condition to apprehend the Justice and wrath of God, before whom none can stand, but he that being lost in himself, layeth hold upon Christ by Faith.

If he have endeavoured to walk in the wayes of holiness, and to serve God in uprightness, although not without many failings and infirmities; or if his spirit be broken with the sense of sin, or cast down through want of the sense of Gods favour; then it will be fit to raise him up by setting before him the freeness and fulness of Gods grace, the sufficiency of Righteousness in Christ, the gracious offers in the Gospel, that all who repent and believe with all their heart in Gods mercy through Christ, renouncing their own Righteousness, shall have life and salvation in him.

It may be also useful to shew him, that death hath in it no Spiritual evil to be feared by those that are in Christ, because sin the sting of death is taken away by Christ, who hath delivered all that are his from the bondage of the fear of death, triumphed over the grave, given us victory, is Himself entred into glory, to prepare a place for his people: So that neither life nor death shall oe able to separate them from Gods love in Christ, in whom such are sure, though now they must be laid in the dust, to obtain a joyful and glorious Resurrection to eternal life.

Advice also may be given, as to beware of an ill grounded perswasion on mercy, or on the goodness of his condition for

4 Jcm.t 1644/5.] Directory foe Public Worship. 603

heaven, so to disclaim all merit in himself, and to cast himself wholly upon God for mercy in the sole merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, who hath engaged himself never to cast off them, who in truth and sincerity come unto him. Care also must be taken, that the sick person be not cast down into despair by such a severe representation of the wrath of God due to him for his sins, as is not mollified by a seasonable propounding of Christ and his Merit for a door of hope to every pemtent Believer.

When the sick person is best composed, may be least disturbed, and other necessary offices about him least hindred, the Minister, if desired, shall pray with him, and for him to this effect,

Confessing and bewailing of sin Original and Actual, the miserable condition of all by nature, as being Children of Wrath and under the Curse, acknowledging that all Diseases, Sicknesses, Death, and Hell it self are the proper issues and effects thereof: Imploring Gods mercy for the sick person through the bloud of Christ, breeching that God would open his eyes, discover unto him his sins, cause him to see himself lost in himself, make known to him the cause why God smiteth him, reveal Jesus Christ to his soul for Righteousness and life; give unto him his holy Spirit to create and strengthen faith, to lay hold upon Christ, to work in him comfortable evidences of his love, to arm him against temptations, to take off his heart from the world, to sanctifie his present Visitation, to furnish him with patience and strength to bear it, and to give him perseverance in Faith to the end.

That if God shall please to add to his dayes, he would vouchsafe to bless and sanctifie all meanes of his recovery, to remove the disease, renew his strength, and enable him to walk worthy of God, by a faithful remembrance and diligent observing of such vows and promises of holiness and obedience, as men are apt to make in times of sickness, that he may glorifie God in the remaining part of his life.

And if God have determined to finish his dayes by the present Visitation, he may finde such Evidence of the Pardon of all his sins, of his interest in Christ, and Eternal life by Christ, as may cause his inward man to be renewed, while ms outward man decayeth, that he may behold Death without fear cast himself wholly upon Christ, without doubting, desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, and so receive the end of his Faith, the Salvation of his Soul, through the onely merits and intercession of the Lord Jesus Christ, our alone Saviour and All-sufficient Redeemer.

The Minister shall admonish him also (as there shall be cause) to set his house in order, thereby to prevent inconveniences, to take care for the payment of his debts, and to make restitution or satisfaction where he hath done any wrong, to be reconciled to those with whom he hath been at variance, and fully to forgive all men their trespasses against him, as he expects foigiveness at the hand of God.

Lastly, the Minister may improve the present occasion to exhort those about the sick person, to consider their own

604

Burial of the Dead.

Fasts.

mortality, to return to the Lord and make Peace with him; in health to prepare for sickness, death, and judgement, and all the dayes of their appointed time so to wait until their change come; that when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, they may appear with him in glory.

Concerning Burial of the Dead.

When any person departeth this life, let the dead body, upon the day of Burial, be decently attended from the house to the place appointed for Publique Burial, and there immediately interred without any Ceremony.

And because the customes of kneeling down, and praying by, or towards the dead Corps, and other such usages in the place where it lies, before it be carried to Burial, are Superstitious:and for that, praying, reading, and singing both in going to, and at the Grave, have been grosly abusea, are no way beneficial to the dead, and have proved many waves hurtful to the living, therefore let all such tilings be laia aside.

Howbeit, we judge it very convenient, that the Christian friends which accompany the dead body to the place appointed for publique Burial, do apply themselves to meditations and conferences suitable to the occasion: And, that the Minister, as upon other occasions, so at this time, if he be present, may put them in remembrance of their duty.

That this shall not extend to deny any civil respects or differences at the Burial, suitable to the rank and condition of the party deceased whiles he was living.

Concerning Publique Solemn Fasting.

When some great and notable Judgements are either inflicted upon a People, or apparently imminent, or by some extraordinary provocations notoriously deserved; as also, when some special blessing is to be sought and obtained, Publique solemn Fasting (which is to continue the whole Day) is. a Duty that God expecteth from that Nation, or People.

A Religious Fast requires total abstinence, not onely from all food (unless bodily weakness do manifestly disable from holding out till the Fast be ended, in which case somewhat mav be taken, yet very sparingly, to support Nature when ready to mint; ) but, also from all worldly labour, discourses and thoughts, and from all bodily delights, (although at other times lawfull) rich apparel, ornaments and such like, during the Fast; and much more, from what ever is, in the nature or use, scandalous and offensive; as, garish attire, lascivious habits and gestures, and other vanities of either sex, which we recommend to all Ministers in their places, diligently and zealously to reprove, as at other times, so especially at a Fast, without respect of persons as there shall be occasion.

Before the publique meeting, each Family and Person apart, are privately to use all Religious care to prepare their hearts to such a solemn work; and to be early at tno Congregation.

4 Jan., 1644/5.] Directory for Public Worship.

605

So large a portion of the Day, as conveniently may be, is to be spent in Publique Reading and Preaching of the Word, with singing of Psalms fit to quicken affections suitable to such a Duty; but especially in Prayer, to this or the like effect:

Giving Glory to the Great Majesty of God, the Creator, Preserver, and Supream Ruler of all the World, the better to affect us thereby with an holy reverence and awe of Him. Acknowledging his manifold, great, and tender mercies, especially to the Church and Nation, the more effectually to soften, and abase our hearts before him. Humbly confessing of sins of all sorts, with their several aggravations: Justifying Gods righteous Judgements, as being far less then our sins do deserve; yet humbly and earnestly imploring his mercy and grace for our selves, the Church, and Nation, for our King, and all in Authority, and for all others for whom we are bound to pray (according as the present exigent requireth) with more special importunity and imargement then at other times. Applying by faith the Promises and Goodness of God, for Pardon, help and deliverance from the evils felt, feared, or deserved, and for obtaining the blessings which we need and expect; together with a riving up of our selves wholly and for ever unto the Lord.

In all these, the Ministers, who are the mouths of the people unto God, ought so to speak from their hearts upon serious and through premeditation of them, that both themselves and their people may be much affected, and even melted thereby; especially with sorrow for their sins, that it may be indeed a Day of deep humiliation and afflicting of the soul.

Special choise is to to be made of such Scriptures to be read, and of such Texts for preaching, as may best work the hearts of the hearers to the special business of the day, and most dispose them to humiliation and repentance; insisting most on those particulars, which each Ministers observation and experience tels nim are most conducing to the edification, and reformation of that Congregation to which he preacheth.

Before the close of the publique Duties, the Minister is in his own, and the Peoples names, to engage his and their hearts to be the Lords, with professed purpose and resolution to Reform what ever is amiss among them, and more particularly such sins as they have been more remarkably guilty of; and, to draw nearer unto God, and to walk more closely and faithfully with him in new obedience, then ever before.

He is also to admonish the people with all importunity, that the work of that day doth not end with the Publique duties of it, but that they are so to improve the remainder of the day, and of their whole life, in re-inforcing upon themselves and their families in private, all those godly affections and resolutions which they professed in publique, as that they maybe setled in their hearts lor ever, and themselves may more sensibly finde that God hath smelt a sweet savour in Christ from their performances, and is pacified towards them, by answers of Grace, m pardoning of sin, m removing of judgements, in averting or preventing of Plagues, and in conferring of blessings suitable to the conditions and prayers of his people, by Jesus Christ.

606

Directory for Public Worship. [4 Jan., 1644/5.

Beside solemn and general Fasts injoyned by Authority, we judge, that at other times, Congregation may keep dayes of Fasting, as Divine Providence shall administer unto them special occasions. And also that Families may do the same, so it be not on dayes wherein the Congregation to which they do belong, is to meet for fasting, or other publique duties of Worship.

Days of Public Thanksgiving.

Concerning the observation, of Dayes of Publique Thanksgiving.

When any such Day is to be kept, let notice be given of it, and of the occasion thereof, some convenient time before, that the people may the better prepare themselves thereunto.

The Day being come, and the Congregation (after private preparations) being assembled, the Minister is to begin with a worn of exhortation to stir up the people to the Duty for which they are met, and with a short Prayer for Gods assistance and blessing (as at other Conventions for publique Worship) according to the particular occasion of their meeting.

Let him then make some pithy narration of the deliverance obtained, or Mercy received, or of whatever hath occasioned that assembling of the Congregation, that all may better understand it, or be minded of it, and more affected with it.

And because singing of Psalms is of all other the most proper Ordinance for expressing of Joy and Thanksgiving, let some pertinent Psalm or Psalms be sung for that purpose, before or after the reading of some portion of the Word suitable to the present business.

Then let the Minister who is to preach, proceed to further Exhortation and Prayer before his Sermon, with special reference to the present work: after which let him preach upon some Text of Scripture pertinent to the occasion.

The Sermon ended let him not onely pray, as at other times after preaching is directed, with remembrance of the necessities of the Church, King, and State (if before the Sermon they were omitted) but inlarge himself in due and solemn Thankesgiving for former mercies and deliverances, but more especially for that which at the present calls them together to give Thanks: with humble Petition for the continuance and renewing of Gods wonted mercies, as need shall be, and for sanctifying grace to make a right use thereof. And so, having sung another Psalm suitable to the mercy, let him dismiss the Congregation with a blessing, that they may have some convenient time for their repast and refreshing.

But. the Minister (before their dismission) is solemnly to admonish them to beware of all excess and riot, tending to gluttony or drunkenness, and much more of these sins themselves, in their eating and refreshing, and to take care that their mirth and rejoycing be not carnal, but spiritual, which mav make Gods praise to be glorious, and themselves humble and sober; and that both their feeding and rejoycing may render them more cheerful and inlarged further to celebrate his praises in the

4 Jan., *1644/5.] Dibectory fob Public Wobship.

607

midst of the congregation, when they return unto it, in the remaining part of that Day.

When the congregation shall be again assembled, the like course in praying, reading, preaching, singing of Psalms, and offering up of more praise and thanksgiving, that is before directed for the morning, is to be renewed and continued so far as the time will give leave.

At one or both of the publick meetings that day, a Collection is to be made for the poor (and in the like manner upon the day of publick Humiliation) that their loynes may bless us, and rejoy cethe more with us. And the people are to be exhorted at the end of the latter meeting, to spend the residue of that day in holy duties, and testifications of Christian love and charity one towards another, and of rejoycing more and more in the Lord; as becometh those who make the joy of the Lord their strength.

Of Singing of Psalmes.

It is the duty of Christians to praise God publiquely by sing- 'pnalm tijDg ing of Psalmes together in the Congregation, and also privately ing. in the Family.

In singing of Psalms the voice is to be tunably and gravely ordered: But the chief care must be, to sing with understanding, and with Grace in the heart, making melody unto the Lord.

That the whole Congregation may joyn herein, every one that can read is to have a Psalm- Book, and all others, not disabled by age or otherwise, are to be exhorted to learn to read. But for the present, where many in the Congregation cannot read, it is convenient that the Minister or some other fit person appointed by him and the other Ruling Officers, do read the Psalm line by line, before the singing thereof.

An Appendix touching Bayes and Places for Publique Worship.

There is no Day commanded in Scripture to be kept holy under Days and the Gospel, but the Lords Day, which is the Christian Sabbath. Places for

Festival dayes, vulgarly called Holy dayes, having no Warrant Public in the Word of God, are not to be continued. Worship.

Nevertheless, it is lawful and necessary upon special emergent occasions, to separate a day or days for Publique Fasting or Thanksgiving, as the several eminent and extraordinary dispensations of Gods Providence shal administer cause Sc opportunity to his people.

As no place is capable of any holiness under pretence of whatsoever Dedication or Consecration, so neither is it subject to such pollution by any superstition formerly used and now laid aside, as may render it unlawfiill or inconvenient for Christians to meet together therein for the publique worship of God. And therefore we hold it requisite that the places of publique assembling for worship among us should be continued and imployed to that use.

it is a constant Practice of divers Merchants, Importers, and others, to remove from the Ships, and other Vessels, wherein such Goods are first imported, into other Ships, Hoys, Baraues, Lighters, or other Vessels, all Sorts of exciseable Goods, Merchandizes, Wares, and Commodities whatsoever, carrying them beyond the Seas, to the Coasts, Port Towns, Creeks, or other Bye places whatsoever, without making Entry thereof at the Excise-office, thereby endeavouring to frustrate the State of the Duty of Excise, upon Pretence that, so long as Goods are Water-borne, they are not liable to Seizure or Forfeiture; as also, upon Tickets, granted from the Office, fraudulently to use One Merchant's Name, of whom they pretend the Goods to be bought, instead of the Importer or true Owner thereof, under whose Hand they bring no true Note or Certificate to signify the Truth; which several Frauds, though apparently practised, yet are so cunningly carried on, that they cannot in all Cases be proved by Two Witnesses: Now the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, taking Notice how People of all Degress and Qualities are apt to dispute and elude the said Ordinance, which doth much prejudice and interrupt that necessary Service; for Prevention of these and the like fraudulent and indirect Practices hereafter, the said Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled do hereby Ordain and De-

The Lords and Commons considering the wonderfull providence of God in calling them to this great and difficult worko of reforming and purging his Church and people, his guidance and manifest protection oi them in it, doe acknowledge that never any of his servants since the foundation of the world had more high and strong engagements heartily and sincerely to endeavour the compleat establishment of Purity and Unity in the Church of God than they have, they doe therefore require all Ministers injunctions and Elders that they be carefull to walke with understanding in to Ministers the House of God, that by Example, Exhortations and and Elders. Admonitions, they endeavour to build up the people of the, Lord in love, that with humility and meeknesse of spirit they adome their holy Profession, and win Soules to the love of the Truth.

and Govemour of all things; That this only true God, is the God whom we worship; that this God is but one, yet three distinct Persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all equally God.

2. That God created man after his own Image, in knowledge, righteousnesse, and true holinesse; That by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sinne, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned; That thereby they are all dead in trespasses and sinnes, and are by nature the cmldren of wrath, and, so lyable to etemall death, the wages of every sin.

3. That there is but one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who is also over all, God-blessed for ever, neither is there salvation in any other; That he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and borne of the Virgin Mary; That he dyed upon the crosse to save his people from their sins; That he rose againe the third day, from the dead; ascended into Heaven sits at the right hand of God, and makes continuall intercession for us, of whose fulnesse we receive all grace necessary to salvation.

4. That Christ and his benefits are applyed onely by faith That faith is the gift of God, and that we nave it not of ourselves, but it is wrought m us by the Word and Spirit of God.

That faith is that grace whereby we beleeve and trust in Christ for remission of sins and life everlasting, according to the promise of the Gospell, that whosoever beleeves not on the Son of God, shall not see life, but shall perish eternally.

That they who truly repent of their sinnes, doe see them sorrow for them, and tume from them to the Lord, and that except men repent they shall surely perish

That a godly life is conscionably ordered according to the Word of God, in Holinesse and Righteousnesse, without which no man shall see God.

That the Sacraments are Seales of the Covenant of Grace in the Blood of Christ: That the sacraments of the New Testament, are Baptism and the Lords Supper, that the outward elements in the Lords Supper are Bread and Wine, and do signifie the Body and Blood of Christ Crucified, which the worthy receiver by faith doth partake of in this Sacrament, which Christ hath likewise ordained for the remembrance of his death, that whosoever eates and drinkes unworthily, is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and therefore that every one is to examine himselfe, lest he eat and drink judgement to himselfe, not discerning the Lords Body.

That the soules of the faithfull, after death, doe immediately live with Christ in Blessednesse, and that the soules of the wicked doe immediately go into Hell torments.

That there shall be a Resurrection of the Bodies, both of the iust and unjust at the last Day, at which time all shall appear© before the Judgement Seat of Christ, to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether it be good or evill: And that the righteous shall go into life eternall, and the wicked into everlasting punishment.

An Ordinance enabling Saltpeter-men to make Gun-Powder.

[7 February, 1015/6. J

Whereas the great expence of Gunpowder, occasioned by the present Wars within His Majesties Dominions, hath well neer consumed the old store, and doth exhaust the Magazines so fast, that without a larger supply the Navy, Forts, and Land Armies cannot be furnished. And whereas foraign Saltpeter is not equal in goodness with that of our own Countrey, and the foraign Gunpowder far worse conditioned, and lesse forceable then that which is made in England. And whereas divers foraign Estates have of late prohibited the exportation of Saltpeter and Gunpowder out of their own' Dominions and Countries, so that there can be little hope of future expectation of any Peter or Powder to be brought into this Kingdom as in former times, which wil enforce us to make use of our own materials, It is held most necessary that the digging of Saltpeter, and making of Gunpowder, should by all fitting means be encouraged at this time when it so much concerns the publique safety. Nevertheless to prevent the reviving of those oppressions and vexations exercised upon the people, under the colorable authority of Commissions granted to Saltpeter-men, which burthen hath been eased since the sitting of this Parliament: And to the end that there may Power to not be any pretence to interrupt the Work, It is Ordained by the

namedb Dords and Commons in Parliament, That such persons as shall

Farit to dig nominated and allowed by the Lords and Commons, Members for Saltpeter of both Houses which are of the Committee of both Kingdoms, or in likely any five of them, their Factors, Workmen and Servants, shall places. have power and authority by this present Ordinance to search, and cfig for Saltpeter in all Pigeon-houses, Stables, Cellars, Vaults, empty Ware-Houses and other Out-houses, Yards and places likely to afford that earth, at fit seasons, from half an hour after Sun-rising in the morning till an hour before Sunsetting, and in Pigeon-houses likely to afford that earth at fit seasons, from nine of the clock in the morning till three of the Saltpeter- clock in the afternoon. The said Saltpeter-men at their own cost men to give and charges levelling the ground, repairing any damage which to^Owners11 ^one ^Y them: Wherein if the said Saltpeter do fail to

laid the foundation of a Presbyterial Government in every Congregation, with Subordination to Classical, Provincial, and National Assemblies, and of them all to the Parliament; Although it cannot be expected that a present Rule in every particular should be settled ail at once, but that there will be need of Supplyments and Additions, and haply, also of alterations, as experience shall bring to light the necessity thereof; yet were the Fundamental and Substantial parts of that Government long since settled in persons, by and over whom it was to be exercised, and the nature, extent, and Subordination of their power was limited, and defined; onely concerning the Administration of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, how all such persons as were guilty of notorious and scandalous Offences, might be suspended from it, some difficulty arising, not so much in the matter itself, as in the Manner how it should be done, and who should be the Judges of the Offence: The Lords and Commons having it alwayes in their purpose and intention, and it being accordingly Declared and Resolved by them, That all sorts ot notorious scandalous Offenders should be suspended from the Sacrament; For the preventing of an indefinite, and unlimited power in the Eldership, they held it fit for the present, That the particular Cases of such scandalous Offences should be specified and enumerated with expresse Declaration, That further provision should be made by Authority of Parliament, for suen Cases as were left out of the said enumeration, which, accordingly, having since taken into their serious consideration, and having had several debates thereupon as the difficulty of the Matter required, which hath taken up much time, for the avoiding as far as possible may be all Arbitrary power; and that all such cases wherein persons should bo suspended from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, might be brought to the cognizance, and passe the Judgement of the Parliament, who were bound in Justice as well to take care that none be injuriously detained from that Ordinance, as to give power whereby such may be kept away who are unfit to partake therein: And to the intent also that a full and speedy course may be settled to enable the several Elderships to suspend all such Offenders, from the Lords Supper, without having recourse to the Parliament itself from all parts of the Kingdom upon every such emergent Case, which might prove troublesome and tedious, and give liberty to such notorious and scandalous Offenders to communicate a long space in the said Ordinance; And to the Intent likewise, That all such Cases coming first from the particular Elderships, may, after they have passed the Judgement of Parliament, return again to all the severall Elderships within the Kingdom, to proceed upon them from time to time in like manner as in the Cases enumerated. For the ends and purposes aforesaid, and also for supply of some defects in the former Ordinance, and Direction of Parliament, concerning the choice of Elders, and some other Matters;

kind as by the said Statutes doth appear; but, by reason of the great Liberty that several idle and loose Persons at this Time take unto themselves, by Guns, tracing of Hares in the Snow, sotting Dogs, and other unlawful Means, to kill and destroy the Game of all kinds throughout the whole Kingdom, in Contempt of Law and Authority, which, if not timely prevented, will prove a Destruction to the said Game in all Parts: It is Ordered, by the Lords in Parliament assembled, That the Justices of the Peace in the several Counties of the Kingdom, and specially about the King's Honours, Castles, Parks, Chaces, and Houses, are hereby charged and required, by virtue of their Places, and the Tenor of the said Statutes, to take special care that they put the said Statutes in due Execution against all such Offenders as shall trespass in this kind, according to the Nature of their several Offences; And herein the said Justices of Peace and others authorized are hereby required to take special Care in the Execution of the Premises, as the contrary will be answered to this House.

Declaration of necessity of levy.

An Ordinance concerning the Excise, with Additional Iastruc-tions for the better regulating the same.

[22 February, 1646/7.]

The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament taking notice of the many Tumults and great Riots which have of late happened, and been privily fomented in several parts of the Kingdom against the Receipts and Collections of the Excise, by the secret and subtil designs and practices of Malignants, and suen who by their false and feigned pretences do endeavour to breed misunderstanding and impatience in the people; Have, for the better manifesting of the Justice of their proceeding, and reality of their intentions, thought fit to make this Declaration to the whole Kingdom:

That as nothing did or could have drawn them to resolve upon this Imposition, but the preservation of this Kingdom, the Religion, Laws and Liberties from utter mine and destruction: all which at that time was threatened by the restlesse and cruel designes, practices and treacheries of Papists and malignant persons: So they could then finde no other means, after the well-affected had so willingly bom so many great Levies, which the Malignants had endeavoured by all cunning wayes to evade, as any longer to maintain the Parliament Forces, and other great affairs of the Common wealth, and to draw in the Malignants and Neutrals to bear their proportional parts of the charge, then by some such constant and indifferent way. And what great difficulties, expences, and charges the said Lords and Commons have by the Receipt and Credit of the Excise, with some other helps, as occasion did require, been enabled ever since, through Goa's blessing, to overcome and maintain, by continually keeping on foot so many several armies, as they were by the King's party

in Arms against the Parliament enforced to raise in divers parts of the Kingdom; by maintaining so many Garisons; by relieving of Ireland from time to time, when other Supplies could not be timely raised; by satisfying our Brethren of Scotland in part, Is by this time so evident to the whole Kingdom, that they hope no well-affected person can or will look bach upon what he hath contributed in this way for his part, with any regret or repining, as if the same had or can be fruitlesse to him or his posterity.

And for the present continuance of this Levie, when it shall be considered for what great sums, and to how many well-affected persons they have already engaged the Excise for Moneys borrowed and justly due unto them: what expenses they must yet be at before they can settle this Kingdom; what charges are requisite to reduce the Kingdom of Ireland; and what great engagements do otherwise lie upon the Parliament for many Supplies and Services, for satisfying whereof the Publike Faith and Honour of the Parliament and Kingdom is engaged; They are confident that no well-affected or understanding person can or will desire or expect that this Levie, which they still finde the most equal and indifferent course to go through so many great affairs, should cease while the Parliament is thus deeply engaged, and have so many pressing occasions for moneys for the necessary support and preservation of the Kingdom.

And therefore the said Lords and Commons assembled in All persons Parliament do hereby declare to the whole Kingdom, That they duly to pay shall and do expect that all persons whatsoever shall duely pay Fxcize. all sums of Money imposed by any Ordinance of Parliament by way of Excise upon all and every the Commodities, Merchandizes, and things therein mentioned and comprised; and that the same Ordinances shall be duly observed, according to the Former Rules therein prescribed, until further Order of both Houses of 0*?. eon-Parliament. Whereunto the said Lords and Commons do hereby ^xcize^tobe require all persons to yield all ready obedience, conformity anil observed, assistance accordingly, as they tender the Honour of the Parliament, the Welfare of the Kingdom, and as they would approve themselves well-affected to both.

And we the said Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, to Receipts of manifest our constant and sincere intentions in the continuance of this Receipt of the Excise, do hereby declare, That as hitherto ^Soyed y the Revenue thereof hath been wholly employed for the publike for public, uses and occasions of the Kingdom, and cfi verted to no private uses, use whatsoever: so they are still resolved to dispose thereof in the same publike and necessary service of the Common-wealth onely; and shall no longer continue this Charge upon the Not to be subject, then they shall finae the publike Affairs wherewith they continued are intrusted, necessarily to require the same. And when it longer Ithan shall please God by the continuance of his mercy to enable them need to settle the peace of the Kingdom, and to overcome the engagements thereof in some good measure, they shall then make it appear to the whole world, how much more ready they are to ease the people of this Charge, then they were willing at first to impose the same.

An Ordinance for Re-establishing the Duty of Excise upon all Commodities except Flesh and Salt made in the Kingdom.

[28 August, 1647.]

The Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled by their late taking oft' the Excise wholly from Flesh, and discharging all Salt made in this Kingdome from payment of Excise, were confident they had given so full a testimony to the whole Kingdom of their readinesse to ease all people, so far as might stand with the support of the I*ublick, that they expected, That all persons would have with patience attended the time of the Parliament for the removall of the rest, and in the interim have duly paid the severall duties of Excise upon all other Commodities, and submitted unto all Ordinances of Parliament in that behalf; But being daily informed of the generall opposition which is made against the Collections of those Duties of the Excise which they have thought fit for some time to continue, and the many violences, injunes and abuses that are offered to the Commissioners, Sub-Commissioners, and other Officers and Receivers thereof, in many Cities, Towns, Counties, and Places of the Kingdome; The said Lords and Commons doe therefore hereby Declare, That as they have not taken off any part of the Excise, but only from Flesh and Salt made in the Kingdome as aforesaid, so they cannot yet, in respect of the great Debt, and many Payments for which these continued Receipts of the Excise are engaged and designed, neither in Justice or Honour, nor with the safety of the Kingdome encrease the rest, but must expect and if they be put to it, must require obedience and conformity from all persons whatsoever, unto the due payment of all and every of them, according to the Ordinances of Parliament in that behalf made; What causes did enforce the Parliament at first to resolve upon this Imposition, and for what reasons they are necessitated to continue the same, are fully set down in the Declaration of both Houses of Parliament of the 22 February 1646, upon occasion of the Tumults and great Riots which then lately Before had happened, and were privilv fomented in severall parts of the Kingdome against the Receipts of the Excise; and the same necessity for continuance thereof lying still upon the Parliament, and the Tumults and Riots in opposition thereunto rather being increased than suppressed; The said Lords and Commons cannot but deeply resent the great neglect of the Authority of Parliament amongst the People, and if they shall continue in this obstinacy, they snail be enforced upon such Remedies, as shall speedily br'rg the Contemners thereof unto

1005

condign and exemplary punishment: But they doe hope all wel-affected persons will after publication of this present Declaration, and upon review of the said Declaration of the 22 February,

1646, Wore-mentioned, which therefore they have ordered to Declaration be reprinted and published herewith, be so sensible of their own of Feb. 22, past miscarriages, and so fully satisfied of the Parliament's inten- 1646/Ve tions in the continuance of these Receipts, that they will presently *nn e ' conform unto the payment of all Duties of Excise, due or payable by all and every of them, according to the Ordinances of Parliament, and not divert the Parliament from those great affairs for the settlement of the Peace of the whole Kingdom, upon which they are at present engaged, by enforcing them to such courses for vindicating the Authority of their Orcunances, as must needs hinder the Parliament in this great Work, but will also be severely accounted for, with the causers thereof. For as this Duty is by experience found to be the most easie and equall way, both in relation to the People and to the Publick; so the Loras and Commons are resolved, through all opposition whatsoever, to insist upon the due collection thereof: But when it shall please God to enable them to settle the Peace of the Kingdom, and to overcome the Engagements and occasions thereof in some good measure, They doe hereby again Declare, That they will then make it appear to the whole World, how much more ready they are to ease the People of this Charge, than they ever coula be to impose the same.

And for the speedy re-establishing of this Receipt according to instructions the Ordinances of Parliament, or the more vigorous carrying on to Comnris-thereof, The said Lords and Commons doe hereby require and sioners for enjoyn the Commissioners of Excise, their Sub-Commissioners,

And it is further ordained, that Records be carefully kept by the Register to be nominated by the Presbytery, of the Names of the persons ordained, with their Testimonials, of the Time and Place of their ordination, and of the Ministers who did ordain them, and of the Charge to which they are appointed, and that no money or gift, of what kind soever shall be received from the person to be ordained, or from any on his behalf, for Ordination, or ought else belonging to it, by the Presbytery, or any of them, or any appertaining to any of them, upon what pretence soever, except to the Register for the Entry, Instruments, and Testimonial of his Ordination, which shall not exceed the sum of Ten shillings for each person ordained.

And it is yet further ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That all persons who shall be ordained Presbyters according to this Directory, shall be for ever reputed and taken, to all intents and 6734. 4 0 2

purposes, for lawfull and sufficiently authorized Ministers of the Church of England, and as capable of any Ministerial imployment in the Church, with the rights and profits belonging tnereunto, as any other Presbyters whatsoever, already ordained, or hereafter to be ordained: And that all Presbyters, who are hereby appointed and authorized to ordain, and shall (according to this present Directory) ordain any one or more Presbyters, are hereby declared to perform an acceptable service to this Church and Kingdome, and shall have the protection of both Houses of Parliament for their indeiupnity: And what Presbytery soever being in due manner desired, shall, without just and due cause, refuse, or defer to ordain any Presbyter, whom by the rules and direction of this Ordinance they ought to ordain, or shall omit, or neglect to observe the solemnity of Ordination, in that decent, and grave, and Godly manner as is meet, It is hereby declared, That they are guilty of a very great offence, and deserve severe punishment.

The Power of Synodical Assemblies.

S°nodi °1 1- That Synodical Assemblies, whether Provincial or National,

Assembles, consisting of Pastors, Teachers, Church-go vernours, and other fit

(>ersons (when it shall be deemed expedient) where they have a awfull calling thereunto, have Ecclesiastical power and authority to judge and determine controversies of Faith, and cases of Conscience according to the Word.

2. They may also excommunicate, and dispense other Church censures, in cases that are orderly brought before them.

Of Church censures; and first, of suspension from the

Sacrament

Church 1. That the several Elderships respectively, within their

censures. respective bounds and limits, have power to suspend from the Suspension Sacrament of the Lords Supper, all ignorant and scandalous from the persons within the Rules hereafter following, and according to Sacrament: the said Rules and directions.

Rules and Directions concerning suspension from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in cases of Ignorance.

In cases of 1. All such persons who shall be admitted to the Sacrament ignorance* of the Lords Supper, ought to know, That there is a God, that there is but one everliving and true God, maker of Heaven and Earth, and Governour of all things; that this onely true God is is the God whom we worship; that this God is but one God, yet three distinct persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all equally God.

That God created man after his own Image, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness; that by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned; that thereby they are all dead in

by

2ft Aug.; 1648, ] Church Government.

trespasses and sins, and are by nature the Children of wrath, and so hable to eternal death, the wages of every sin.

That there is but one Mediator betwixt God and Man, the man Christ Jesus, who is also over all, God blessed for ever, neither is there salvation in any other.

That he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary, that he died upon the Cross to save his people from their sins, that he rose again the third day from the dead, ascended into Heaven, sits at the right hand of God, and makes continual intercession for us, of whose fulness we receive all Grace necessary to Salvation.

That Christ and his benefits are applyed onely by Faith; that Faith is the gift of God, and that we have it not of our selves, but it is wrought in us by the Word and Spirit of God.

That Faith is that Grace whereby we believe and trust in Christ for remission of sins and life everlasting, according to the promises of the Gospel; that whosoever believes not on the Son of God, shall not see life, but shall perish eternally.

That they who truly repent of their sins, do see them, sorrow for them, and turn from them to the Lord; and that except men repent, they shall surely perish.

That a Godly life is conscionably ordered according to the Word of God, in holiness and righteousness, without which no man shall see God.

That the Sacraments are Seals of the Covenant of Grace in the bloud of Christ; that the Sacraments of the New Testament are Baptisme and the Lords Supper: That the outward Elements in the Lords Supper are Bread and Wine, and do signifie the Body and Bloud of Christ crucified, which the worthy Receiver by Faith doth partake of in this Sacrament, which Christ has likewise ordained for the remembrance of his death: That whosoever eats and drinks unworthily, is guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord, and therefore that every one is to examme himself, lest he eat and drink judgement to himself, not discerning the Lords Body.

That the souls of the faithfull after death do immediately live with Christ in blessedness; and that the souls of the wicked do immediately go into hell torment: That there shall be a Resurrection of the Bodies both of the just and unjust at the last day, at which time all shall appear before the Judgement Seat of Christ, to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether it be good or evil, and that the Righteous shall go into life eternal, and the wicked unto everlasting punishment.

2. Those who have a competent measure of understanding concerning the matters contained in these Articles, shall not be kept back from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper for Ignorance: And the examination and judgement of such persons as shall for their ignorance of the aforesaid points of Religion not be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is to be in the power of the Eldership of every Congregation.

speed Determine and Adjudge the same: But in case the party accused shall find himselfgneved, either by the not examination or undue examination of Witnesses, or mis-entring of the Depositions, in such case he shal forthwith declare the same to the Eldership, who shall relieve him if there be cause; which if they shall not do, then the three Justices of Peace next to the Parish whereof the party complained of is a member, or any two of them, not being of the same Eldership before whom the complaint lies, shall have power, and are hereby enabled and required, forthwith to examine upon Oath the said Witnesses that were not examined or were mis-examined, or whose Depositions were mis-entred, and with all convenient speed return the Examination to the said Committee of Parliament: And in case the said Justices, or any two of them, do not finish their examination within six days after the cause shall be presented unto them, the party shall abstain until they have finished and certified their examination:And the said Committee, upon hearing the whole matter from the Eldership and Justices, or either of them, shall adjudge whether the same be a Notorious and Scandalous Offence, and so

22 Aug.} lti48.j Church GGveRnMUnt.

And be it further Ordained, It any shall find themselves aggrieved with the Judgement against him given by the said Committee, they shall appeal from thence to both Houses of Parliament, if they see cause.

And be it Ordained, That the Committee to whom the said Certificate shall be made as aforesaid, shall Report to both Houses the said several cases to them certified, and their Judgements thereupon, that so the Offences not yet enumerated, may be added to the enumeration, in case the Houses shall so think fit: And in their Reports they shall take care, that they first Report those Certificates, and their Opinions thereupon, wherein they at any time shall differ from the Eldership.

Be it further Ordained, That these Rules and Instructions following be carefully observed by the respective Elderships, in the dispensing of this Censure of Suspension from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

1. That none be suspended from the Sacrament before Admonition, unless the commision of the sin, or the information thereof to the Elders, be so immediately before the time of the Administration of the Sacrament, that there be no space for Admonition.

2. That Offences which are private be not brought unto the Eldership, unless the Offendor be privatly admonished, and is not amended by such private admonition.

3. That in all cases, the Eldership specially labour to convince the person offending of the sinfulness of that which is proved against him, and then of the aggravations, as they shall be needfull.

4. That if they shall see cause to judge, after the pressing or it upon his Conscience, that he yet remains unconvinced that it is a sin, and therefore doth not express any Repentance for it, but not out of stubbornness and obstinacy, then they are not to suspend him from the Sacrament, until further endeavours have been used to convince him, unless it appear that his Admission would be scandalous to the Congregation.

5. That in lesser Offences brought before the Eldership, they proceed with special Lenity, as in greater with special Zeal, and so accordingly be more slow or quick in censuring those that are found guilty, and more facile or wary in admitting expressions of Repentance.

6. That if upon Admonition the Offendor shall give evidence of his Repentance, so as the Elders shall be satisfied, and the parties offended an justly except nothing against it, let him not be kept from tho Sacrament: But if he repent not, but remain obstinate, let him be suspended from the Sacrament, according to the Directions befbrementioned.

7. That ft any man accuse another for a scandalous Crime unjustly, the Eldership shall not onely clear the wronged Person,

Rules and instruction in cases of suspension

1212

Church Government [29 Aug.r164A.

but take care that the Accuser may make such acknowledgement as the Eldership shal advise, according to the nature of the feet.

8. That in all Offences brought before the Eldership, they are to be carefull to keep the matter as secret as they can, even though they be forced to proceed to Suspension, and not to make it more publique then the nature of the Fact, and the impenitency of the Person doth constrain them.

9. In case any should be censured in the particular Congrega-.tion whereof he is a Member, he may presently appeal to the Classical Presbytery, or further if it he requisite, where not onely himself may be cleared and righted, but such as have done the injury may be censured; yet pendente lite let him abstain from the Sacrament.

Of Excommunication, and the course of proceedings therein.

The Order of proceeding with Offenders, who before Excommunication manifest Repentance.

hxcomnmni- j When the Offence is private, private Admonition is in all ea ion. wisdome and love to be observed, that the Offendor may either be recovered by Repentance, or if he add obstinacy or contempt to his fault, he may be cut off by Excommunication.

2. If the sin be publiquely scandalous, and the sinner being examined be judged to have signs of unfeigned Repentance, and nothing justly objected against it when made known unto the people, let him be admitted to publique Confession of his sin, and manifestation of his Repentance before the Congregation.

3. When the Penitent is brought before the Congregation, the Minister is to declare his sin, whereby he hath provoked Gods wrath, and offended his people, his Confession of it, and profession of unfeigned Repentance for it, and of his Resolution (through the strength of Christ') to sin no more; and his desire of their Prayers for Mercy and Grace to be kept from falling again into that, or any the like sin: Of all which the Penitent is to make a full and free expression according to his ability.

4. Which being done, the Minister, after Prayer to God for the Penitent, is to admonish him to walk circumspectly, and the

Seople to make a right use of his fall and rising again, and so to eclare that the Congregation resteth satisfied.

The Order of proceeding to '.Excommunication.

1. Excommunication being a shutting Qut of a Person from the Communion of the Church (and therefore the greatest and last Censure of the Church) lat.it be inflicted with great and mature deliberation, and after all other good means have been assayed.

2. That such Errors as subvert the Faith, or anytother Errors which overthrow the power, of Godliness, if the Party who holds

1213

them, spread them, seeking to draw others after him; and such sins in practice as cause the Name and Truth of God to be Blasphemed, and cannot stand with the Power of Godliness; and such practices as in their own nature manifestly subvert that Order, Unity, and Peace which Christ liath established in his Church; and particularly all those Scandalous sins for which any Person is to be suspended from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, obstinately persisted in, these being publiquely known, to the just Scandal of the Church, the Sentence of Excommunication may and ought to proceed, according to the Directions hereafter following.

3. But the Persons who hold other Errors in Judgment, about points wherein Learned and Godly men possibly may or do differ, and which subvert not the Faith, nor are destructive to Godliness; or that be guilty of such sins of infirmity as are common y found in the Children of God, or being otherwise found in the Faith, and holy in Life, (and so not falling under Censure by the former Rules) endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, and do yet out of Conscience not come up to the observation of all those Rules which are or shall be established by Authority for Regulating the outward Worship of God, and Government of his Church, the Sentence of Excommunication for these causes shall not be denounced against them.

4. That when the sin becomes publique, and justly scandalous, the Offender shall be dealt withal by the Eldership to bring him to Repentance, and to such a manifestation thereof as that his Repentance may be publique as the Scandal: But if he remain obstinate, he is at last to be Excommunicated, and in the mean time shall be suspended from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

And whereas there be divers and various Judgments touching the power of Excommunication, and the proper subject thereof, for the clearing of Difficulties, avoiding of Offences, and preservation of Peace, Let these following Directions be observed.

In the great and difficult cases of Excommunication, whether concerning Doctrine or Conversation, the Classical Presbytery upon the knowledge thereof may examine the person, consider the nature of the Offence, with the aggravations thereof; and as they shall see just cause, may Discern and Declare, That he is to be excommunicated, which shall be done by the Eldership of that Congregation whereof he is a Member, with the consent of the Congregation, in this or the like manner.

1. As there shall be cause, several publique Admonitions shall be given to the Offender (if he appears) and prayers made for him.

2. When the Offence is so hainous, that it cries to Heaven for vengeance, wasteth the Conscience, and is generally Scandalous, the Censures of the Church may proceed with more expedition.

1214

Church Government. [29 Aug., 1648.

Speak this in the third person, if the paity be abtenU

Absolution.

3. In the Admonitions, let the Fact be charged upon the Offender, with the clear evidence of the guilt thereof; then let the nature of his sin, the particular aggravations of it, the punishment and curses threatned against it, the danger of impenitency, especially after such means used, the wofull condition of them cast out from the favour of God, and Communion of the Saints, the great Mercy of God in Christ to the

?enitent, how ready and willing Christ is to forgive, and the Jhurch to accept him upon this his serious Repentance: Let these or the like particulars be urged upon him out of some suitable places of Holy Scriptures.

4. The same particulars mav be mentioned in Prayer, wherein the Lord is to be intreated to bless this Admonition to him, and to affect his heart with the consideration of these things, thereby to bring him unto Repentance.

5. If upon the last Admonition and Prayer there be no evidence nor sign of his Repentance, let the dreadfull Sentence of Excommunication be pronounced, with calling upon the Name of God, in these or the like expressions.

Whereas thou N. hast been by sufficient proof convinced of [here mention the sin] and after due Admonition and Prayer remainest obstinate, without any evidence or sign of true Repentance; Therefore in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and before this Congregation, I pronounce and Declare thee N. Excommunicated, and shut out from the Communion of the Faithfull.

Let the Prayer accompanying the Sentence, be to this effect.

That God, who hath appointed this terrible Sentence for removing of offences, and reducing of obstinate sinners, would be

Eresent with this his Ordinance, to make it effectual to all those oly ends for which he hath appointed it; That the retaining of the Offenders sin, and shutting him out of the Church, may fill him with fear and shame, and break his obstinate heart and be a means to destroy the Flesh, and to recover him from the power of the Devil, that his Spirit may be saved; that others also may be stricken with fear, and not dare to sin so presumptuously, and that all such corrupt Leaven being purged out of the Church (which is the House of God) Jesus Christ may delight to dwell in the midst of them.

6. After the Denunciation of this Sentence the people are to be warned that they hold him to be cast out of the Communion of the Church, and to shun all Communion with him: Nevertheless, Excommunication dissolveth not the bonds of Civil or Natural Relations, nor exempteth from the Duties belonging to them.

The Order of proceeding to Absolution.

If after Excommunication the signs of Repentance appear in the Excommunicated person, such as Godly sorrow for sin, as

29 Aug., 1648.] Church Government.

Then $hall follow the sentence of Absolution in these or the like words.

Whereas thou N. hast for thy sin been shut out from the Communion of the Faithfull, and hast now manifested thy Repentance, wherein the Church resteth satisfied, In the name of Jesus Christ before this Congregation, I pronounce and declare thee absolved from the Sentence of Excommunication, formerly denounced against thee, and do receive thee to the Communion of the Church, and the free use of all the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, that thou mayest be partaker of all his benefits, to thy eternal Salvation.

After this Sentence of Absolution, let the Minister speak to him as to a Brother, exhorting him to Watch and Pray, or comforting him, if there be need:Let the Elders imbrace him, and the whole Congregation hold Communion with him as one of their own.

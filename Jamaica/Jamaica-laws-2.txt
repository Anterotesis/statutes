WHEREAS the Laws now in Force, for preventing indirect Prac- Act 5.

tices at the Elections of Representatives to serve in the Assemblies of this Island, and for securing the Freedom of such- Elections, have been found, by Experience, to be very defective, and many Abuses and indirect Practices have been made use of, and are daily increasing in the Election of Members to serve in the AlTembly of this Island, so that divers persons have procured themselves to be returned againfc the Consent of the Majority of the true Freeholders of the Parishes they were returned for; and without some proper Regulations to prevent so great and growing an Evil, the Rights and Liberties of the People are on the moil precarious Foundation.

II. And whereas* by the above-mentioned Act, the Pro volt-Marshal, or his Deputy, attending the said Elections, are not impowered to administer the Oath thereby appointed to be taken by the Freeholder; so that divers evil minded Persons not duly qualified, have presumed to take the said Oath, under Confidence that by the Defect aforesaid, no Punishment can be inflicted.

Ill- And whereas the several Freeholds, mentioned in the said Laws, have been fraudulently and scandalously prepared, and the good Intention of the Law defeated, by Huts being occasionally erected, not of the real Value of Ten Pounds per Annum, on Purpose to qualify the Owner or Owners thereof to vote at Elections, and by putting several Pens on un-fetliedTrads of Land, and driving fix Head' of Cattle therein, immediately before such Elections, on Purpose to qualify the Owner or Owners thereof to vote at Elections, and removing the said Cattle immediately after such Elections, as well as by occasionally opening and planting five Acres of Land, in such Manner that the Owner or Owners could reap no Benefit therefrom, and neglecting the fame afterwards, so as to make it appear, the said Plantation was prepared with a manifeffc Intent to evade the Law, and qualify the Owner or Owners thereof to vote at such Elections.

IV. And whereas many fraudulent Conveyances have of late been made, on Purpose to create and multiply Freeholds, to the great Danger of our happy Confiitution, and to the great Injury, as well of the true Freeholders of this Island, who have been at great Expence and Pains in settling and cultivating their Lands, as of Persons offering themselves as Candidates at the said Elections, and in Prejudice of the Freedom of such Elections: For Remedy of such Mischiefs and to prevent the like for the future. May it please your most Excellent Majesty that it may be enacted. Be it therefore enacted by .the Lieutenant-Governor, Council and AlTembly, of this your Majesty’s Island of Ja- The necefl-a,y tnaica, and it is hereby enacted and ordained by the Authority of the same, qualifications That no Person whatsoever shall be admitted to Vote at any Election in housesh°ldS W this Island, unless his Freehold consists of a House erected and built, and in the actual Pofiefiion of such Freeholder, by Title recorded in the Of" ^rded^tweive fice of Inrollments of this Island, for twelve Calendar Months next before Months w

Maltster and Maker of Malt is liable to the Penalty of Five

Shillings for every Bushel of Corn or Grain in the Couch, steeped in order to the making thereof into Malt, and found in the Malt House of such Maltster, so hard, close and compact, as it could not

be, unless the fame had by some means or other been forced together to prevent the riling and swelling thereof: And Whereas no means are hitherto provided for the Officers of Excise to establish,

by Experiment, whether any such Corn or Grain has been in reality so forced together; and it is therefore expedient that the Power and Authority hereinafter mentioned should be given for the purpose of making such ExperimentBe it therefore enacted by The King’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful to and for any Supervisor, and any other Officer of Excise in Great Britain, by themselves, or by any Person or Persons by them employed for that purpose, in the Presence of such Maltster, or his, her or their Servant, (if such Maltster or Servant shall think fit to be present at such Operation,) to throw or remove all the Corn or Grain from or out of any Couch which such Supervisor or Officer shall suspect to have been forced together, and to throw and lay the fame level in such Malt House; and if any Increase shall be found in the Gauge or Quantity of such Corn or Grain, on the Removal and laying the fame level as aforesaid, exceeding the Rate of One Bushel in every Twenty Bushels over and above the Quantity which the fame appeared to be by the previous Gauge thereof taken in the Couch, then, and in every such case, Proof being made of such Increase as aforesaid, the fame shall be deemed conclusive Evidence, that such Maltster, or Maker of Malt, did tread, ram or otherwise force together the said Corn or Grain in the Couch, or that the fame was so hard, close and compact, as it could not be, unless the fame had by some means or other been forced together to prevent the rising and swelling thereof; and such Maltster or Maker of Malt shall forfeit and lose the Sum of Five Shillings for every Bushel of such Corn or Grain of such Couch.

II. And Whereas the Laws in force relating to the Duty of Excise imposed for and in respect of Bricks made in Great Britain, prescribe no Dimensions for such Bricks, and many Brick Makers have of late made Bricks of very unusually large Sizes, whereby the said Duty is likely to be greatly diminished,

provide for such poor Children as should be appointed to be

bound Apprentices to them in pursuance of the said prior Acts:

And Whereas since that Time several Acts have passed by which Houses of Industry, or Establishments for the Poor, have been authorized to bind Apprentices; and Doubts have arisen whether the Powers and Provisions in the said Act of the Twentieth of His Majesty will extend to the Case of Apprentices so bound out under the Authority of such subsequent Acts;' Be it there-

of Low Wines and Spirits such Wash so decreased was presumed to make, and the Officers of Excise were thereby required in such Case to make such Charge in the Manner prescribed by the said Act; and that if any Decrease should at any Time or Times appear in the Stock of Spirits made for Exportation, belonging to any such Distiller or Distillers (except such as in the said Act in that Behalf excepted), every such Distiller and Distillers should be charged, and the Officers of Excise were thereby required to charge him, her or them, for all the Spirits so found to be decreased, and not properly accounted for, with Double the Duties such Spirits would have been charged with £ if made for Home Consumption: And Whereas by the Laws in force at the Time of making the said Act, the said Duties, in the said Act in that Behalf mentioned, were chargeable upon the Low Wines and Spirits made for Home Consumption, but the Duties on Low Wines and Spirits made for Horne Consumption were, by an Act made in the Twenty seventh Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, among other Things, for repealing the Duties of Customs and Excise, and granting other Duties in lieu thereof, repealed, and in lieu and stead thereof other Duties are by the Acts now in force imposed for fermented Wort or Wash brewed or made in that Part of Great Britain called

for extracting Spirits for Home Consumption, and on other ' 4 Matters and Things in that Part of Great Britain called Scotland,

and in the said Acts in that Behalf particularly mentioned; and by Means thereof the said Penalties, so far as the same relate to such Double Duties respecting Spirits made for Home Consumption, are become void; and it is therefore expedient,in lieu and in stead of the said recited Penalties, to impose such other Penalties, and make such Provisions, as hereinafter in that Behalf directed;’ Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, in order the more effectually to prevent such Distillers from fraudulently removing Wort, Wash, Low Wines or Spirits, if any Decrease shall at any Time or Times be found in the Wort or Wash of any Distiller or Distillers, brewed or made for the extracting of Spirits for Exportation, (except such Decrease as shall be made appear, to the Satisfaction of the Commissioners of Excise for the Time being, to have really and truly arisen from Accident), such Distiller or Distillers shall for every such Decrease of Wort or Wash be, and he, she and they is and are hereby charged with Double the Duties which would have been chargeable for or in respect of a Quantity of fermented Wort or Wash, brewred or made in that Part of Great Britain called England, for extracting Spirits for Home Consumption, equal to the Quantity of such Decrease of the Wort or Wash so found as aforesaid; and if any Decrease shall at any Time or Times be found in the Spirits of the First or Second Extraction, or of any other Spirits of any such Distiller or Distillers made for Exportation, (except such Decrease as shall be made appear, to the Satisfaction of such Commissioners, to have really and truly arisen from Accident,) such Distiller or Distillers shall, for every such Decrease be, and he, she and they is and are hereby charged with Double the Duties which would have been chargeable for or in respect of a Quantity of fermented Wort or Wash, brewed or made

If Decrease found in Wash made for extracting Spirits for Exportation (Exception), Distiller charged with Double Duties on Wash (instead of on the Spirits as under 2 G. c. 5. § 26.); and charged in like Manner for Decrease in Spirits of First or Second Extraction, or of any other Spirits for Exportation, &c.

Where Spirits distilled for Exportation in One Day, and not locked up in Warehouse, decrease or are removed in Absence of Excise Officer, Distiller charged with Double Duties on Wash, instead of on the Spirits, as under 2 G. 3. c. 5. §22.

in that Part of Great Britain called for extracting a

Quantity of Spirits for Home Consumption, as would be presumed to be requisite to make a Quantity of Spirits equal to the Quantity of Spirits of such Decrease, reckoning at and after the Rate of One hundred Gallons of such Wort or Wash for every Twenty four Gallons of such Decrease of Spirits; and the proper Officer or Officers of Excise is and are hereby, in any or either of the said Cases, to make such Charge or Charges accordingly.

‘ IX. And Whereas by the said Act, made in the Second Year of c His present Majesty’s Reign, it was also enacted, that if it should appear that any such Decrease, as in the said Act is in that. Behalf particularly mentioned, had been made in the Quantity or Quality of the Spirits distilled for Exportation in One Day, and which could not, for Want of Time, be conveyed from the Spirit Cask and locked up, as was thereinbefore directed, or in case any such Spirits should have been removed in the Absence of the Officer of Excise, in either of the said Cases the Distiller or Distillers should be and were thereby charged for the said Spirits so decreased or removed, with Double the Duties such Spirits would have been charged with if made for Home Consumption, which the Officer of Excise was thereby required to charge accordingly: And Whereas by reason of such Repeal of the said Duties as aforesaid, it is become expedient to make such Provisions as next hereinafter mentioned;’ Be it therefore enacted, That if from and after the passing of this Act it shall at any Time so happen that the Spirits distilled for Exportation in One Day, belonging to any Distiller or Distillers, cannot, for Want of Time, be conveyed from the Spirit Cask (into which they are directed to be run immediately from the Still) and locked up in the Warehouse or Warehouses, as by the said Act is in that Behalf directed, and it shall appear that any such Decrease, as in the said Act in that Behalf mentioned, has been made in the Quantity or Quality of the said Spirits; or in case any such Spirits shall have been removed in the Absence of the Officer of Excise, , in either of the said Cases, in lieu and stead of any Charge as is in such Case in the said Act in that Behalf particularly directed to be made, the Distiller or Distillers shall be and are hereby charged for the said Spirits so decreased or removed, with Double the Duties which the Wort, Wash, Liquor or other Preparation from whence such Spirits were made or extracted, would have been charged or chargeable with, had the said Spirits been made from fermented Wort or Wash, brewed or made in that Part of Great Britain called England, for extracting such Spirits for Home Consumption from Malt, Corn, Grain or Tilts, reckoning at and after the Rate of One hundred Gallons of such Wort, Wash, Liquor or other Preparation, for every Twenty four Gallons of such Spirits, and which the Officer of Excise is hereby required to charge accordingly.

X. And Whereas by the said Act, made in the Second Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, it was also enacted, that when Spirits made for Exportation should be delivered out of any Warehouse or Warehouses, to be sent Coastways in order for Exportation to Foreign Parts, as in the said Act is in that Behalf mentioned, the Distiller or Distillers, out of whose Warehouse

‘ house such Spirits were delivered, should on taking out the same give such Bond as was in the said Act in that Behalf di-e rected, in Double the Value of the Spirits, and Double the Duties which were payable for the like Spirits distilled for Home i Consumption, that the same Spirits, and every Part thereof

should (the Danger of the Seas and Enemies excepted) be really

and truly landed in such Port of this Kingdom for which the same should be entered, and such Bond so entered into should

not be discharged or delivered up, until such a Certificate as is c in the said Act prescribed, should be produced from the Chief Officer of Excise of the Port for which such Spirits were entered;

‘ and it was also by the said Act enacted, that such Spirits so to

be sent Coastways, when landed at the Port for which the same ( were entered, should be immediately on the landing thereof put

into a proper Warehouse, and there continued until the same should be exported, and should be secured by the Person to whom they were sent, and by the Chief Officer of Excise in the

said Act mentioned, in Manner in the said Act in that Behalf directed: And Whereas by reason of such Repeal of the said Duties as aforesaid, it is become expedient to make such Provisions as next hereinafter mentioned;' Be it therefore further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, every Distiller or Distillers, out of whose Warehouse or Warehouses any such Spirits made for Exportation shall be delivered to be sent Coastways in order for Exportation to Foreign Parts, as in the said Acts is in that Behalf mentioned, shall in lieu and stead of the said Bond so in that Behalf directed to be given as aforesaid, give Bond, with sufficient Security, to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, to be approved of as any other Security is directed by the said last mentioned Act to be approved, in Double the Value of such Spirits, and Double the Duties which the Wort, Wash, Liquor or other Preparation from whence such Spirits were made or extracted, would have been charged or chargeable with, had the said Spirits been made from fermented Wort or Wash, brewed or made in that Part of Great Britain called England, for extracting such Spirits for Home Consumption from Malt, Corn, Grain or Tilts, reckoning at and after the Rate of One hundred Gallons of such Wort, Wash, Liquor or other Preparation, for every Twenty four Gallons of such Spirits, that the same Spirits, and every Part thereof shall (the Danger of the Seas and Enemies excepted) be really and truly landed in such Port of this Kingdom for which the same shall be entered, and such Bonds so entered into shall not be discharged or delivered up, until such a Certificate shall be produced from the Chief Officer of Excise of the Port for which such Spirits were entered, testifying the landing thereof, and the several other Matters and Things in and by the said Act particularly directed, in the Certificate thereby required for the Discharge of such Bond as was thereby directed to be given for or in respect of Spirits to be sent Coastways, and for the landing of such Spirits in the Port of this Kingdom for which the same should be entered.

If Excise Officer, after taking Account of Wash, &c. preparing for extracting of Spirits in England, shall find any Deficiency, he shall charge Distiller with Duty on a Quantity of Wash equal to that deficient.

Instead of Penalties under 2 G. 3. c. 5. §29.

Abuses of Brewers, Distillers and other Persons chargeable with

the Duties of Excise, it was enacted, that the Gauger and { Gaugers of Excise should from Time to Time gauge and take Account of all Wash and other Materials prepared or preparing 1 for the making of Low Wines, and also of all Low Wines, Spirits

or Strong Waters, found in the Houses, Cellars or Warehouses,

‘ or in any Wash Back, Cast or other Vessel or Vessels, used by any Distiller or Maker of Low Wines or Spirits; and in case he should miss any Quantity or Quantities of Liquor or Drink brewed or made from Corn, or any Wash or other Materials pre-

pared for making of Low Wines, which he had found as in the

said Act is mentioned, and should not on Demand receive Satisfaction what was become of such Drink or Wash, or other such

like Materials, that in every such Case it should be lawful for

such Gauger to charge such Distiller with so much Low Wines

as such Liquor, Drink, Wash or other Materials so missing, in his Judgment would reasonably have made: And Whereas the

Duties on Low Wines and Spirits are now repealed, and certain Duties are imposed in lieu thereof, on Wort, Wash or Liquor fermented, brewed or made in that Part of Great Britain called

England, for extracting Spirits for Home Consumption, and it is < therefore expedient to make such Provision as is hereinafter

mentioned;’ Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be

lawful to and for all and every the Officer or Officers of Excise, from Time to Time to gauge and take an Account of all Wash, Drink and other Liquor or Materials, prepared or preparing for the extracting of Low Wines or Spirits in that Part of Great Britain called England; and that in case any Officer or Officers of Excise, at any Distiller or Distillers in that Part of Great Britain called England, shall miss or find any Deficiency in the Gauge of

any Quantity or Quantities of Liquor or Drink brewed or made, or in any Wash or other Materials preparing or prepared for extracting of Spirits for Home Consumption, and which the Officer or Officers of Excise had before found or gauged at such Distiller or Distillers, then and in every such Case it shall and may be lawful for such Officer or Officers to charge such Distiller or Distillers with the Duty on a Quantity of fermented Wort or Wash, Cyder, Perry or other Wash or Liquor, of the same Kind of Materials as the said Liquor, Drink, Wash or other Materials consisted of, or was preparing or prepared from, equal to the Quantity of such Liquor or Drink, Wash or other Materials, so missing or found deficient in the Gauge, and such Distiller or Distillers shall pay the same accordingly; and the said Duty shall be recovered and applied in like Manner as the said Duties by Law imposed for or in respect of fermented Wort or Wash, brewed or made in that Part of Great Britain called , from Malt,

Corn, Grain or Tilts, or from other Materials for extracting Spirits for Home Consumption, are now by Law directed to be recovered and applied.

XII. And Whereas by the said Act, made in the Second Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, it was also enacted, that such Spirits in the said Act in that Behalf mentioned as should be shipped for Stores, should during the Time the Ship or Vessel was or should be within the Limits of any Port of this Kingdom,

Duty of all such Stores which should not be so stowed and kept, or produced and shown to the Officers of Excise, which said Double Duty should be charged by the Officers of Excise for such

+Stores which should not be so stowed and kept, or produced and shown according to the Rate such Spirits would have been charged with if made for Home Consumption, and which Charge should be paid by the Master of the Ship or Vessel on board of which such Stores were shipped; and when any Spirits made for Exportation, should be entered for Exportation to any of the Places in that Act particularly in that Behalf mentioned, the Exporter or Exporters thereof, when the whole Quantity of Spirits intended at that Time to be exported should be shipped,

should immediately give and enter into such Bonds as are in the said Act directed for the due and fair Exportation of such Spirits,

and produce such Certificates within the respective Times in the

said Act in that Behalf prescribed, and that the Penalty in every cBond so to be entered into in pursuance of that Act, should be

‘ Double the Value of the Spirits entered for Exportation, and

Double the Duties such Spirits ought to have paid if they had ( been made for Home Consumption; and that until such Bond should be entered into by the Exporter or Exporters, the Distiller or Distillers from whose Warehouse such Spirits should be sent,

should be and were thereby charged for such Quantity of Spirits so

shipped for Exportation, with Double the Duties such Spirits

would have been charged with if made for Home Consumption,

‘ and that such Charge should not be discharged until such Bond

should be entered into; And Whereas by reason of such Repeal of the said Duties, and the said Imposition of the said other Duties for such Wort or Wash as aforesaid, it is become expe-

dient, in lieu and instead of the said last recited Charges and

Penalties respectively, to impose such other Charges and Penalties, and make such Provisions hereinafter in that Behalf directed;’ Be it therefore further enacted, That in lieu and instead of the said last recited Charges and Penalties respectively, from and after the passing of this Act, all such Spirits made or drawn in Great Britain for Exportation, as shall be shipped for Stores, shall during the Time the Ship or. Vessel is or shall be within the Limits of any Port of this Kingdom, be openly stowed and kept, so that the Officers of Excise may at any Time examine the same, on Pain of forfeiting the Double Duties which the Wort, Wash, Liquor or other Preparation, from whence such Spirits were made or extracted, would have been charged or chargeable with, had such Spirits been made or extracted from fermented Wort or Wash, brewed or made in that Part of Great Britain called England, for extracting such Spirits for Home Consumption from Malt, Corn, Grain or Tilts, reckoning at and after the Rate of One hundred Gallons of such Wort, Wash, Liquor or other Preparation, for every Twenty four Gallons of such Spirits which shall not be so stowed and kept, or produced and shown to the Officers of Excise; which said Double Duty shall be charged by the Officers of Excise, for such Stores which shall not be so stowed and kept, or produced and shown as aforesaid, and which Charge shall be

entered into by the Exporter or Exporters, the Distiller or Distillers from whose Warehouse such Spirits were sent, shall be and are hereby charged for such Quantity of Spirits so sent with such Double Duties as last aforesaid, and such Charge shall not be discharged until such Bond shall be entered into; and also except that the Proof of the due Exportation of such Spirits shall not be required to be made till the End of Three Years from the Date of such respective Bonds.

XIII. And Whereas great Quantities of Starch are used in the making of Stone Blue, and the Laws already in Force have by Experience been found insufficient to prevent Makers of Starch,

‘ being at the same Time Makers of Stone Blue, from clandestinely making Use of Starch, for which no Duty has been paid, in the making of Stone Blue: For Remedy whereof, be it further enacted, That no Person licensed to make Starch, or having made Entr}' of any Workhouse or Place for the making of Starch at any Office of Excise, or being a Maker of Starch within Great Britain, shall be a Proprietor, Owner or Occupier of any Workhouse or Place made use of for the making of Stone Blue, or for the keeping of Stone Blue, or Materials for the making of Stone Blue, or have any Part or Share in any Stone Blue Manufactory, or be in any Manner concerned in the Trade or Business of a Maker or Manufacturer of Stone Blue; and if any Person licensed to make Starch, or having made Entry of any Workhouse or Place for the making of Starch as aforesaid, or being a Maker of Starch within Great Britain, shall be a Proprietor, Owner or Occupier of any Workhouse or Place made Use of for the making of Stone Blue, or, for the keeping of Stone Blue, or Materials for the making of Stone Blue, or shall have any Part or Share in any Stone Blue Manufactory, or be in any Manner concerned in the Trade or Business of a Maker or Manufacturer of Stone Blue, the Person or Persons, so offending shall for each and every such Offence forfeit and lose the Sum of Two hundred Pounds.

‘ XIV. And Whereas it has been found by Experience that the 1 Security by Bond, required by an Act made in the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, to be given by Persons acting as Auctioneers, is not sufficient to answer the Pur- poses thereby intended For Remedy whereof, and for the better securing the Payment of the Duties by Law imposed for and in respect of Sales at Auction, be it therefore enacted, That every Person not already licensed according to the said Act, who now or at any Time or Times hereafter doth or shall exercise the Trade or Business of an Auctioneer, or Seller by Commission, at any Sale of any Estate, Goods or Effects whatsoever, by Outcry, knocking down of Hammer, by Candle, by Lot, by Parcel or by any Mode of Sale at Auction, or whereby the highest Bidder is deemed to be the Purchaser, or who shall act in such Capacity within the Limits of the Chief Office of Excise in London, shall, at the Time of receiving his Licence, give Security by Bond to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, with Two sufficient Sureties, in Manner following; (that is to say,) himself in the Sum of One hundred Pounds, and his Sureties in the Sum of Two hundred Pounds each (a), which Security the Commissioners of Excise in England, or an}' (a) [ Other Surety, 43 G. 3. c. 130. § L]

XV. And be it further enacted, That each and every Person who shall exercise such Trade or Business, or who shall act in such Capacity as aforesaid, in any Part of Great Britain not within the Limits of the said Chief Office, shall at the Time of receiving his Licence, give Security by Bond as aforesaid, with Two sufficient Sureties, in Manner following: (that is to say,) himself in the Sum of Five hundred Pounds, and his Securities in the Sum of Fifty Pounds each, which Security shall be taken by the Commissioners of Excise in England and Scotland respectively, or any Two or more of them respectively for the Time being, or by such Person or Persons as they the said Commissioners, or any Two or more of them respectively, shall appoint for that Purpose, or by the respective Collectors of Excise within their respective Collections, in like Manner as is herein-before directed, with regard to the Bonds to be given within the Limits of the Chief Office of Excise in London, that the said Person who shall exercise such Trade or Business, or who shall act in such Capacity as aforesaid, shall and will deliver every Account, and make Payment of all and every Sum and Sums of Money in Manner prescribed in or by the said Acts, or any or either of them.

i XVI. And Whereas for preventing Frauds in the shipping of ‘Rum as Stores, free of Duty, to be consumed on board Ships on their Voyages to Foreign Parts, it is expedient to make such Provision as is hereinafter mentioned; Be it therefore enacted, That no such Rum shall be delivered as Stores, to be spent and consumed as aforesaid, out of any Warehouse or Warehouses in which the same shall have been lodged, in pursuance of an Act, made in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second (a), among other Things, to empower the Importers or Proprietors of Rum or Spirits, of the British Sugar Plantations, to land the same before Payment of the Duties of Excise charged thereon, and to lodge the same in Warehouses at their own Expence, unless the Person or Persons intending to have the same so delivered shall give Bond, with sufficient Security to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, to be approved of by the respective Commissioners of Excise land and Scotland for the Time being, or any Three of them, or by such Person or Persons as they shall from Time to Time appoint or employ for that Purpose, in Double the Value of the Goods, and the Duties of Excise payable thereon, that such Rum, and every Part thereof, shall (the Dangers of the Seas and Enemies excepted) be really and truly spent and consumed on board

not exceeding in the Whole the Sum of Seventy two thousand Pounds, as should be necessary and sufficient for the Purposes next therein after mentioned, to be applied by the said Mayor,

Aldermen and Commons, in the first place in paying One half of the Charges of obtaining the said Act, and afterwards in purchasing the Lands and Hereditaments which should be purchased by the said Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens, and their Successors as aforesaid, and in paying the Charges of making and completing the said Canal and other Works, which were to be made and done by the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commons in pursuance of that Act, and afterwards in discharging all the necessary Expences of managing, repairing and preserving the same Canal and other Works, for three Years after publick Notice of their being ready for Use, and also in paying during the same three Years, such Sums of Money as were therein before directed to be paid by the said Mayor and Commonalty, and Citizens, and their Successors, for Losses and Deficiencies of Tythes, Taxes,

Sewer Rates and other Rates, and Assessments; and it was thereby further enacted, that there should also be advanced and paid,

from and out of the said Consolidated Fund, upon the Credit of the said Rates and Duties thereby made payable to His Majesty,

His Heirs and Successors, such Sums of Money as should be sufficient for making certain Compensations therein particularly mentioned, and thereby entrusted to the Care and Management of certain Commissioners appointed and to be appointed, by virtue of the said Act; and it was thereby further enacted, that the Monies which should be produced by the Rates and Duties made payable to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, by that Act,

should be applied in the Manner therein and in Part hereinafter mentioned; (that is to say), in the first place, so much thereof should be paid into the Chamber of the City of London as should be sufficient for defraying the necessary Charges of repairing,

altering and renewing the Mooring Chains in the River Thames,

and of laying down new or other Mooring Chains therein, and for paying the Salaries of the Harbour Masters and their Assistants, pursuant to that Act, and subject thereto; the Residue of such Monies so to be produced should be applied, from Time to Time, in repaying and replacing to the said Consolidated Fund,

Power to advance a further Sum of 50,0001. out of the Consolidated Fund.

Monies to be produced by the said Rates and Duties should be

disposed of as next thereinafter is directed: And whereas the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commons have made great Progress in excavating the said Canal, and performing the other Works by the said recited Act directed to be made and done by them: 4 And whereas by reason of a Clause in the said recited Act, compelling the purchase of the Whole of any Building or Parcel of Land in the actual Occupation of one Person, or of several Persons jointly, although only Part thereof might be wanted for the Purposes of the said Act, and thereby causing more Buildings and much larger Quantities of Land to be necessarily purchased than were actually wanted for the Purposes aforesaid, and by reason of Satisfaction being made to Parties interested in Premises purchased under the said Act, for Goodwill, Improvements, and Injury or Damage, as thereby directed, and of a great Advance in the Prices of Timber, Iron and other Materials used in the

said Works, the Charges and Expences of making and completing the said Canal and other Works, are likely very far to 4exceed the Estimate originally made thereof; and the said Sum of Seventy two thousand Pounds by the said recited Act authorized and directed to be advanced, paid and applied as aforesaid,

will therefore be insufficient for the Purposes to which the same is so made applicable: And whereas in consequence of the last mentioned Clause in the said recited Act, there have been purchased and conveyed, and agreed to be conveyed, to the said

Mayor and Commonalty, and Citizens, and their Successors,

under the Powers given by the same Act in that Behalf, divers Houses, Buildings and Parcels of Land, of very considerable

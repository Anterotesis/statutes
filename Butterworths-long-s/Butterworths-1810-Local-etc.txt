are made Experiments and Investigations important in a very high Degree to the Improvement of Chemical Science, and to its Ap* 4 plication to Arts and Manufactures in this Country; and in the Course of which, Discoveries have been made highly honourable to this Age and the British Nation: And whereas the increased Scale of Expenditure which has necessarily attended the increased Scale of the Establishment having far exceeded the Funds of the said Inllitution, the Managers have lately laid a State of their Concerns before a General Meeting of the Proprietors, at which it was unanimously determined, that the National Objects to which the Royal Inllitution is now applied, should not be abandoned on account of any Sacrifice of Property which may be required on their Part, but with a View to attract the Interest of Scientific and Publick Charadfers in its Fayour, and to induce them to form an active Co-operation for its Support, that Measures should be taken to form on its Balls a Publick National and Permanent Establishment devoted to the Cultivation of pradlical Science, and

An Act for building certain Offices for the Examiners, Cursitors, Clerk of the Crown and Clerks of the Petty Bag, of the High Court of Chancery; and for making certain Regulations in the Examiner's Office of the said Court; and for making Provision for such of the Examiners, Deputy Examiners and Clerks, as from Length of Service or from Age or Infirmity, are or shall be incapacitated from the due Execution of their Offices; and for making Provision for other Officers of the said Court; and M making other Payments in respect of the said Offices.

[9th June 1S10.]

WHEREAS the due Execution of the Office of Examiner of 4 W the High Court of Chancery, by Persons qualified and competent to discharge the important Duties of the said Office, is of the utmoffi Consequence to the Administration of Justice, and the Interest of the Suitors of the said Court: And whereas the said Office hath heretofore been and is now held for Life; and Doubts

are entertained whether there is any where competent Authority to remove the Person or Persons'who now or hereafter may hold

the said Office, if at any time by reason of Sickness, Infirmity, or

other Cause, he or they should be unable or incompetent to discharge the Duties of the said Office: And whereas Henry Flit croft Esquire, one of the Persons holding the said Office, is now and

hath for a considerable time been a Lunatic Ward of the said Court

of Chancery, and wholly incompetent to the Discharge of the

Duties of the said Office: And whereas the Persons who have discharged the Duties of the said Office, have frequently been engaged in other Employments and Pursuits, whereby Delays, Hindrancee and Impediments, and other Inconveniences have been oc-

cafioned to the Suitors of the said Court, in the Prosecution of their

Suits therein: And whereas it would be expedient that in future

the Business of the said Office should be executed by the Persons holding the same in their own Persons, and that they should be expressly prohibited from acting as Counsel, Solicitors, Attornies,

Clerks in Court or Draftsmen, or as Agents or Clerks to any Person acting in any of those Capacities, or in any other Respect 1 or Capacity in any way conne&cd with the said Court of Chancery, or any Suit or Matter depending the rein, or before the Lord High Chancellor, Lord Keeper, or Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, or the said Court of Chancery; and that the Bullnefs of the said Office should, as near as may be, be equally divided and go in rotation amongst the Persons holding the said Office; 4 and that Witnesses on different Sides of the lame Cause should be

examined by different Examiners; and it is reasonable that Com-

pensation should be made to such of the present Examiners and Deputy Examiners as chuse to decline to continue their Service in the said Office, upon the Conditions and under the Reilrictions hereby intended to be imposed upon them: And whereas the Fees and Emoluments of the said Office are (regard being had to the great Increase in the Necessaries of Life and the Expence of Living) 4 not adequate to the Attendance, Trouble and Importance of their

4 Offices

Offices and to their Servites $ and it would be for the Benefit of the

Suitors of the said Court, that adequate Provision should be made

for the Persons who shall be appointed to discharge the Duties of the said Office: And whereas the Business of the Examiner's 4 Office of the said Court of Chancery, and also of the Clerk of

the Crown and the Clerks of the Petty Bag, is carried on in one

and the same Building, in the Rolls Yard in the Liberty of the

Rolls, in the County of Middlesex, and the same is out of Repair, ' and insufficient for the necessary Accommodation of Witnesses whilst under Examination in the said Court, and for the Purposes of the said Office of Examiner and the other Offices there carried on:

And whereas it would be for the Benefit of the Suitors of the said

Court, that proper Provision should from time to time be made for

such of the Examiners of the said Court and their Clerks as from Age or Infirmity are or shall, in the Judgment of the said Court, be incapacitated to perform the Duties of their respective Offices; 4 and also that Provision should be made for putting the said Offices

into proper and substantial Repair, or for rebuilding the same if

necessary, and for other Payments and Expences incident to the

said Office; and that such other Regulations should be made re*

specting the said Office, as are hereinafter mentioned and contained:

And whereas the Freehold of the said Premises or Part thereof is

now veiled in the principal Examiners of t'ie said Court, and in the.4 Clerks of the Petty Bag, for their respective Lives, and during

their Continuance in Office, for the Purposes of the said Office 5 4 and it would be for the Benefit of the Suitors of the said Court

that the Freehold of the said Premises should in future be vetted in

the Matter of the Rolls and his Successors, for the Purposes of the

said Offices of the said Court of Chancery, and that proper Com-

pen fat ion should be made to the said Principal Examiners and to the Two junior Clerks of the Petty Bag, for their several Interests in the said Premises respectively 2 And whereas there appertains to

the said Court of Chancery certain other Officers, called the Ulher

and Court Keeper of the said Court of Chancery, who, among

other Duties of their said Offices, have been required to furnifi

the said Court with Stationary and other Articles requisite and

necessary for the Use of the said Court, and have been and are

allowed to charge for the same a tier Centage thereon, over and

above the Colt of the Articles so furnished, as Part of their Re-

muneration for undertaking and discharging their said Offices; and

the same is an improper Mode of remunerating the said Officers,

and is open to great and continual Abuse, and ought to be discon-

tinned for the future, and that the said Officers should be remu-

lierated in same other more fit and proper Manner: And whereas

there also appertains to the said Court of Chancery certain other Officers called the Cursitors, who traufad the Bufiucfs of their said

Office, and keep the Records of their said Office, in the First Floor of a certain Building, situate in Chancery Lane> many Years held, and now holdcu by the said Officers as Tenants at Will thereof, under a private Individual: And whereas the said Records are of considerable Importance, and by being kept in an Office so circum(laneed, are exposed to greater Ri(k than accords with the Importance of the said Records; and it is expedient that the same should be deposited and kept in some more fate and secure Place, and that

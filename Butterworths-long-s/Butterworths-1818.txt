CAP. XL VI.

An Act for Relief of Persons entitled to Entailed Estates, to be purchased with Trust Monies, in that Part of the United Kingdom called Ireland [30th May 1818.]

WHEREAS by the Practice of Courts of Equity in that lfert

of the United Kingdom called Ireland, in Cases in which

Money under the Controul of such Courts is subject to be laid out

' ' in the Purchase of Lands to be limited to Uses capable of being

barred by Fine, the said Courts direct such Money to be paid to

the Party or Parties who could by Fine bar the Uses to which such

Lands, in case the same had been purchased, would have been

limited, and do not reauire or compel the actual Investment of such

Monies in {he Purchase of Lands, notwithstanding other Persons

might take Estates or Interests therein if the same were purchased,

ana be entitled to hold such Estates or Interests until such Fine

was actually levied: And whereas nevertheless, where Money under

the Controul of the said Courts is subject to be invested in the

Purchase of Lands to be # limited to Uses not capable of being

barred by Fine, but capable of being barred by Recovery, the said Courts, according to the Practice thereof, refuse to direct the same

to be paid to the Party or Parties who, in case futh Lands had

+been purchased, could by Recovery have barred all the Uses to which the same would have been limited, and require and compel the actual Investment of such Monies in a Purchase or Purchases of some Lands; and such last mentioned Practice is attended with great Inconvenience and Expence to the Party or Parties who by a Recovery could bar the Uses to which such Lands are to be limited when purchased, and the Interest and Benefit of others, who might take Estates barrable by such Recovery when suffered, is not according to such last mentioned Practice materially promoted or secured, and it may therefore be expedient to alter such Practice; And whereas it may also be expedient to provide some satisfactory and summary Proceeding, whereby Trustees possessed of Money subject to be laid out in Lands may be required in proper Cases to pay such Money to the Parties entitled, and

under this Act to become entitled, to receive the same Be it

therefore enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the

mere Montes Authority of the same*, That from sod after the passing of this Act,

II. And be it further enacted, That in all Cases where Money iubie&ed to be laid out in the Purchase of Hereditaments to be settled as aforesaid shall happen to be invested in Government or Real or other Securities, all such Securities shall for the Purposes of this Act be considered as Money, and shall and may accordingly be transferred, assigned and disposed of under an Order of the respective Courts aforesaid, made in a summary Way upon the Petition of such Persons, and with such Examination and Content where necessary as aforesaid, in such and the same manner as Monies subjected to be laid out in the Purchase of Hereditaments to be settled as aforesaid are hereinbefore authorised to be paid, applied and disposed of.

And Whereas another Act was passed in the Fifty first

A.D. 1818. 58° GEO. III. C. 49. 167

Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for rendering more effectual an Act made in the Forty seventh Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled 'An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade:' And Whereas divers Persons have, contrary to Law, imported into certain of His Majesty's Possessions on the Continent of South America, certain Negro Slaves from other Possessions of His Majesty: And Whereas it is expedient that all Persons who have been concerned in advising, authorizing or making such Importations of Negro Slaves as aforesaid, contrary to Law, should be indemnified, inasmuch as such Importations have been made under a belief that they were authorized by Law; Be it therefore enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

[Certain Importations of Slaves rendered valid, and Prosecutions nulled.]

That the said Importations be and be deemed valid and of due Force in Law; and that all personal Actions and Suits, Indictments, Informations and all Prosecutions and Proceedings whatsoever, which have been or shall be hereafter prosecuted or commenced against any Person or Persons for having advised, authorized or made any such Importation at any time before the passing of this Act, be, are and shall be discharged and made void by virtue of this Act;

Division or Liberty in which such Parish or Place does lie, and shall, upon such Inhabitants making Oath before such Justice that they do believe the Contents of such Notice to be true, and entering into a Recognizance in the penal Sum of Twenty Pounds each

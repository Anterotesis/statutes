An Act to suspend, until the First Day of May One thousand eight hundred and seven, the Payment of all Drawbacks on Spirits made or distilled in Great Britain or Ireland, and exported from either Country to the other respectively.

[iyth. March 1807.]

WHEREAS by the Acts for the Union of Great Britain and t Ireland it is among ft other Things provided that any Articles ( of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of either Country which f are or may be subject to internal Duty, or to Duty on the Materials f of which they are composed, may be made subject on their Importar

tion into each Country respectively from the other, to such Countervailing Duty as shall appear to be just and reasonable in respect of 1 such internal Duty or Duties on the Materials, and that upon the

+Export of the said Articles from each Country to the other respectively, a Drawback shall be given equal in Amount to the Countervailing Duty payable on such Articles on the Import thereof into the same Country from the other: And whereas by the said Acts, and by other Acts of Parliament now in force, certain Countervailing Duties are chargeable on Spirits made or distilled in Great Britain on the Importation thereof into Ireland, and on Spirits made or distilled

from either Country to the other respectively: And whereas Doubts

have arisen whether certain of the said Duties and Drawbacks are 1 just and reasonable, and how far the same are therefore confident with

the Letter and Spirit of the said Acts for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland: For Remedy thereof, and to the Intent that such ' Countervailing Duties should be imposed, such Drawbacks allowed, f and such Provisions made as shall be judged proper for putting the

Trade between Great Britain and Ireland, in respect of Home-made f Spirits, upon a just, fair, and equitable Footing, according to the c true Meaning and Spirit of the said Acts for the Union of Great f Britain and Ireland. and also that sufficient Time may be afforded f for ascertaining just and reasonable Countervailing Duties and Draw-c backs, and for making such necessary Provisions as aforesaid, it is ' expedient that the Payment of all Drawbacks upon the Export ' of such Spirits from each Country to the other respectively should f be suspended for a limited Time^be it therefore enacted by the King?s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled? and by the Authority of the same, That, from and after the Twentieth Day of February One thousand eight hundred and seven, the Payment of all Drawbacks for or in respect of such Spirits on the Exportation thereof from any Part of Great Britain to Ireland, or from Ireland to any Part of Great Britain respectively, shall be suspended until the First Day of May One thousand eight hundred and seven,

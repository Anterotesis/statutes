An Act for the more effectual Regulation of Pilots, and of the Pilotage of Ships and Vessels on the Coast of England.

[20th April 1812.]

WHEREAS Ships and Vessels have frequently been wreeked, and many Lives and much Property have been lost, from the Ignorance or Misconduct of Persons taking charge of such Ships,

or Vessels as Pilots: And whereas the Corporation of Trinity House of Deptford Strond have, as well by Usage for more than Three Centuries, as by Grants from the Crown, and under the Authority of an Act passed in the Fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majestr 5 C. a. o.ao.

King George the Second, been empowered to appoint Pilots, Loads-f men or Guides, to conduit Ships or Vessels into and out of and upon

the River of Thames, through the North Channel to or by Or ford*

west, and round the Long Sand Head, through the Queen's Channel

or other Channels into toe Downs, and from and by Orfordness, and of the North Channel, and up the Rivers Thames and Medway, and the several Creeks and Channels belonging or running into the same;

and to make such Orders and Constitutions as should be needfal for the wholesome Government of Seafaring Men, and Maintenance and

Increase of Navigation, and of all Seafaring Men within the said River of Thames; in pursuance of which Powers she said Corpora- lion have from time to time appointed a sufficient Number of Pilots for the Purposes before mentioned: And whereas there hath been,

time out of Mind, and now is, a Society or Fellowship of Pilots of the Trinity House of Dover, Deal and the Isle of Thanet, who have had the Pilotage and Loadmanage of all Ships from the said Place*

of the Rivers Thames and Medway, which laid Society or FeHoW-

notwithstanding which, many Persons not having Licence or Ao^ qSeC 4 thority, or competent Knowledge or Experience have taken upon d*.

themselves to alt as Pilots for conducing Ships or Vessels to- and from and upon the said Rivers, to the great Hazard of such Ships or Vessels, and their Cargoes, and the Lives of their Crews: And whereas the Provisions of the said Acts have been found inadequate 1 to the Regulation of Pilotage, and the Prevention of such Mifchfeft

and it is therefore necessary that further and more effectual Regular tioos should be made for that Purpose, and that ad the Provision*

have been passed for the disafforesting certain Forests belonging to

His Majesty, and for the inclosing divers Commons, Open and

Waste Lands, over which His Majesty had Forestal, Manorial or other Rights, or in which He was otherwise interested, Powers have been given to the Lord High Treasurer, or to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, and to the Commissioners of

His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, or to the Sur*

1 veyor General of His Majesty's Woods, Forests, Parks and Chaces,

or to the Surveyor General of the Land Revenue of The Crown,

for the time being, with the Approbation of the Lord High Treasurer, or any Three of the Lords Commissioners for the time being, of His Majesty's Treasury, to contract and purchase, for and on behalf of His Majesty, his Heirs or Successors from any Purlieu Owners, or any other Persons who should be entitled to any Allotments of Land under such Acts, or from any other Owners or Proprietors of Lands, all or any Part of their respective Lands, or of the Allotments to be made to them in respect thereof, for the Use of His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors,

to the intent that such Lands, when so jfurchafed, should be ap- propriated to the Growth and Preservation of Timber; and also to purchase all or any of the Timber, Underwood, Bushes or Thoms, which were or should be Handing or growing upon the same Lands: And Whereas the said Provisions nave been and may be in a great Measure frustrated, by reason that such Acts do not extend to enable any Body or Bodies Politic or Corporate or any Person or Persons having only a partial or qualified Interest in any

of the Lands or Allotments so to be purchased, or any Committees,

Guardians or Trustees, or others, acting for Persons who are or

Depredations have been and do continue to be committed in His Majesty's Woods to the Timber and Trees growing the rein; and it would tend greatly to the Preservation of such Timber and Trees, if such Fuel Rights could be effectually extinguished: And

Whereas many of the Owners or Proprietors of such Rights are willing and desirous to fell or commute the same for an adequate Price or Consideration; and although it would be desirable to purchase the same for and on behalf of His Majesty, yet by reason that such Fuel Rights are ia general of small Value, and held by many different Proprietors, and that the Tenements, to which such Rights are appurtenant, are in some cases in Settlement, and in others are held by Persons who are under Disabilities, or incapable of making any valid Surrender or Extinguishment of such Rights, and the same cannot be surrendered to His Majesty, or extinguished, by any of the ordinary Modes of Conveyance, without great Expence; whereby the Purchase of such Rights is very much obstructed and impeded, and such Difficulties cannot be removed without the Aid of Parliament Be it therefore further enabled, That whensoever the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, or the Surveyor General of His Majesty's Woods, Forests, Parks and Chases, for the time being, shall, with the Approbation of the Lord High Treasurer, or any Three of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the time being, contract and agree with any Person or Persons, Body Politic or Corporate, for the Purchase or Extinguishment of any such Common of Eftovers or Fuel Rights as aforesaid, whether the Person so contracting with the said Commissioners or the said Surveyor General shall be entitled thereto absolutely or for any qualified or partial Estate, or as the Hu (band, Committee or Trustee of any Person or Persons under any of the Incapacities or Disabilities hereinbefore mentioned, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, or the said Surveyor General for the time being, to pay the Price or Consideration for the Purchase of such Rights to the Person or Persons, Body Politic or Corporate, so contracting for the Sale thereof, or to apply and dispose thereof in manner herein after mentioned; and such Person or Persons so contracting shall thereupon give a Certificate of such Contract, and of the Payment of the Consideration Money for the Purchase of such Rights, which shall be made according to the Form contained in the Schedule (C.) to this Act, or as near thereto as circumstances will permit; and upon Payment of such Sum of Money, and the signing such Certificate, all such Fuel Rights and Rights of Common of Eftovers for Firewood, as shall be m or by every such Certificate, or any Schedule thereto, expressed to be sold, released or extinguished, shall from thenceforth and immediately thereupon become and be emerged and extinguished in the Freehold and Inheritance of the said Woods, and be for ever thereafter vested in His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, in Right of His Crown, without any Bargain and Sale, Fine, Recovery, Deed or other Conveyance thereof whatsoever; any Statute, Custom, Law, Practice or Ufuage to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

XLVII. And Whereas by an Act passed in the Fifty second 3. c. 161. ' Year of His Majesty's Reign for enabling His Majesty to grant ' Leases under certain circumstances, and for other Purposes therein ' mentioned, the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and c Land Revenues, or the Surveyor General of His Majesty's Woods

and Forests for the time being, under the Authority of the Lord 1 High Treasurer or the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the time being, are empowered to grant Leases, under the Restrictions and Regulations therein mentioned, of certain Parts of the Royal Forests, and of certain Purpreftures and Encroachments within such Forests: And Whereas no Provision is

contained in the said last mentioned Act for exempting such Leases

VI. And Whereas an Act of the Parliament of Scotland* in the Year One thousand six hundred and eighty one, Chapter ' Seventeen, intituled An Act concerning the Sale of Bankrupts, ' Lands, required certain Forms of Publication and Citation, which

in Practice have been found to be expensive and inconvenient;

and another Act of the Parliament of Scotland, in the Year One thousand six hundred and' ninety five, Chapter Six, intituled Act ' regulating the Sale and Payment of Bankrupts* Estates, made it ' Lawful for Purchasers of such Estates to consign the Price, after a

certain time, in the Hands of the Magistrates and Town Council

of Edinburgh, which Method has been found inconvenient, and has ' seldom been practised; and by an Article in the Regulations of the Session established in the same Year One thousand six hundred ' and ninety five, Section Twenty fix, it was provided that the

Ranking of the Creditors should proceed and be concluded by ? Decree before the Sale of the Lands, which Regulation has g£tte'- rally been prejudicial to the Creditors; Be it enacted, That the said in Part recited Acts shall be and the same are hereby in so far repealed; and the Court of Session shall have full Power to make Acts of Sederunt for abridging the Forms of Publication and Citation, and regulating the Proceedings in Processes of Sale, Ranking and Division, whether at the Instance of Creditors or of apparent Heirs; and in every case of a Sale under the Authority of the Court of Session, it shall be lawful to the Purchaser, at any Term of Whitsunday or Martinmas subsequent to the Term of Payment of the Price, to lodge the Price, with the Interest due upon it, in" the Royal Bank, or Bank of Scotland, or the Bank of the Brrftit Linen Company, at such Interest as can be procured for it, by doing which, and by giving Notice thereof to the Agent itho earned on the Sale, he shall be discharged of the said Price; and further, the Court of Session, upon the Application of any of the Creditors, shall be empowered to make an Order on the Purchaser Jo lodge the Price and Interest, at any of the said Terms, subseqttent to the Term of Payment, in one or other of the said Banks, fuffldect Intimation being always previously given both to the Purchaser and to the Common Agent for the Creditors, that such Application is biade, in order that all Parties may have an Opportunity to object j and in all cases of Judicial Sales, the Lands or other heritable Sub-Jfefts may be brought to actual Sale so soon as the necessary previous Steps are taken, whether the Ranking be concluded or H5t, Unless the Court, upon Application of any Party concerned, 1km $nd sufficient Cause to delay the Sale.

VII. And Whereas Doubts have arisen upon the Construction of an Act, made in the Year One thousand six hundred and

ninety, Chapter Twenty, intituled Act anent the Sale of Bankrupt/ f Lands, in 10 far as it requires that the Common Debtor be found 1 Bankrupt and utterly Insolvent Be it enacted, That a judicttl Sale, at the Instance of Creditors, may m all Cases proceed tfhel^ the Interest of the Debts and the other annual Burdens Ukceed tfc* tearly Income of the Sabjefts under Sale, or tvhere a Sedueftratioft mail nave taken place under this or any former Statute, without-other Proof of Bankruptcy or Insolvency.

in the Year One thousand five hundred and forty, Chapter One x°ll#

' hundred and six, concerting Charges to enter Heir, and another

Act im the Year One thousand six hundred and twenty one, Chapter

Twenty seven, concerning Apprisings against Heirs, it was ordain*

ed, that Charges against Heirs unentered, which were to be the Foundation of apprising against their Predecessors Lands, might proceed at the Instance of Creditors, commanding them to enter

within Forty Days after the Charge; but it has been doubted whether the same or a longer Term is required when the Person

charged is out of Scotland, and it is expedient that such InductJt

Ihoutd be of long Duration; Be it enacted, That the Induct£ of Adjudicttioni on a Charge to enter Heir shall in no case exceed Forty Days, whether Charges to enter the Person charged be within the Kingdom or out of it 5 and that e, r* after one such Charge, whether general or special, has been given at the Instance of any Creditor, every subsequent Charge, at the Instance of the same or of any other Creditor, may be upon the Inducts of Twenty Days only 5 any Law or Practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

IX. And, in order to leiTen the Number of Adjudications for Different Cr«-Debt, and consequently the Expence to all Parties, and to facilitate*

the tan psffu Preference of Creditors in similar circumstances, be it enacted, That the Lord Ordinary officiating in the Court of Session, before whom the first Process of Adjudication against any Estate fot Payment or Security of Debt hr calied, shall ordain Intimation thereof to be made in the Minute Book, and on the Wall, in order'c

that any other Creditors of the Common Debtor, who at the next Calling of the Cause can shew that, although they have not executed their SummonfeS of Adjudication, they are in other respects, by the nature of the Grounds of Debt, and Steps taken by them, in Condi* tioa to proceed in adjudging their Debtor's Estate, may produce the Instructions of thieir Drots, with Summonses of Adjudication, libelled and signetted, for the Purpose of their being conjoined in the Decree of Adjudication, Twenty Sederunt Days being allowed for fneb Intimation before the Cause can be called a Second Time; and if any of these Forms shall happen to be omitted, the said Adjudication shall be null and void, without Prejudice to its being brought forward again in more due Form, or still conjoined with any after Adjudication; and, without Prejudice to the Validity and Order of ranking of posterior Adjudications according to the Rules of Law, when any after Process or Processes of Adjudication are brought into Court, the lame shall be regulated, as to the Time and Manner of Proceeding in them, by an Act or Acts of Sederunt of the Court of Session, so as to provide, as saur as circumstances will admit, for the pari pajfu Preference of such posterior Adjudications with one another, and to ibrijge the Number and Expence of such Proceedings; and in all dies where Penalties for Nonpayment over and above Performance arc contained in Bonds, or other Obligations for Sums of Money, and Ure made the Subject of Adjudication, or of Demand in any ofher Shape, it shall be in the Power of the Court to modify and rtftrift such Penalties, so as not to exceed the real and necessary Expeoces incurred in making the Debt effectual.

XL And, in order to fix more clearly in time coming what Diligence is necessary to make an Adjudication effectual* be it enacted, That the presenting a Signature in Exchequer* when the holding is of The Crown, or the executing a general Charge of Hondo# aguioft Superiors at the Market Cross of Edinburgh*, and Pier and Shore of Leith* when the holding is of a Subject* and recording aa Abstract of the said Signature* or the said Charge in the RegMbrar of Abbreviates of Adjudications* shall be held m all time coming as the proper Diligence for the Purpose aforesaid.

that instead of the Date of the Seisin* the Date of recording the Seisin in the Register of Seifins and Reversions* should be taken as the Rule Be it hereby enacted, That in all Qdbon upon the said Act* in the Year One thousand six hundred and ninety six* or this present Act* the Dispositions* Heritabk Bonds or other Heritable Rights, whereupon Infeftment may follow* shall in time coming be reckoned to be of the Date of the Registration of the Seisin law* fully taken thereon, without Prejudice to the Validity or Iim&dity of the said Heritable Rights* in all other respects as formerly.

manner, and in like time, as the Payments on behalf of His Royal

Highness are directed to be settled by the said recited Act of the

Thirty fifth Yeas of His Majesty's Reign: And Whereas it was

in such Proposal, and the Acceptance thereof understood, that the Arrangement, if carried into Erfest, was a final Arrangement as to

the Income which His Royal Highness was thereafter to allow to Her Royal Highness; and it was further agreed and understood,

that a Document to such Purport should be signed by His Royal

Highness as making the Proposal, and by Her Royal Highness as assenting to and concurring with all the Parts of it 5 whi<m Docu-

ment was so signed accordingly 2 And Whereas His Majesty, having ' been made acquainted with the said Proposal, for the Purpose of

learning His Majesty's Pleasure thereon, as the Father of His

Family, did by a Writing, signed by His Majesty, and with His Majesty's Approbation, placed in the Hands of His Royal High-; 4 ness, signify that His Majesty thought it reasonable that it should be fully utiderstood, and that His Majesty did so undertland it, that

it would be contrary to what His Royal Highness reasonably and justly made an indispensable Condition, and contrary to the abfatate

and efiential Faith of the Transaction, that His Royal Highness>s

5 regular Payment of the Seventeen thousand Pounds ter yiunnm, 1 being continued, should remain liable in any way for the future to 4. the jjebta of Her Royal Highness, His Royal Highness having

liberally undertaken, when thus focured by His Majesty's Approbation, to settle the Debts of Her Royal Highness to the Amount of the Sums of Forty one thousand Poinds and Eight; thousand Pounds, making in all Forty nine thousand Pounds, and to tucrease Her Royal Highness'e Income to the Net Sum of Scwestteira thousand Pounds: And Whereas His Royal Highness did, mpurfhance

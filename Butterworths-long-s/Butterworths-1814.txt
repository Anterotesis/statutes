Depredations have been and do continue to be committed in His Majesty's Woods to the Timber and Trees growing therein; and it would tend greatly to the Preservation of such Timber and Trees, if such Fuel Rights could be effectually extinguished: And

Whereas many of the Owners or Proprietors of such Rights are willing and desirous to fell or commute the same for an adequate Price or Consideration; and although it would be desirable to purchase the same for and on behalf of His Majesty, yet by reason that such Fuel Rights are ia general of small Value, and held by many different Proprietors, and that the Tenements, to which such Rights are appurtenant, are in some cases in Settlement, and in others are held by Persons who are under Disabilities, or incapable of making any valid Surrender or Extinguishment of such Rights, and the same cannot be surrendered to His Majesty, or extinguished, by any of the ordinary Modes of Conveyance, without great Expence; whereby the Purchase of such Rights is very much obstructed and impeded, and such Difficulties cannot be removed without the Aid of Parliament Be it therefore further enabled, That whensoever the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, or the Surveyor General of His Majesty's Woods, Forests, Parks and Chases, for the time being, shall, with the Approbation of the Lord High Treasurer, or any Three of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the time being, contract and agree with any Person or Persons, Body Politic or Corporate, for the Purchase or Extinguishment of any such Common of Eftovers or Fuel Rights as aforesaid, whether the Person so contracting with the said Commissioners or the said Surveyor General shall be entitled thereto absolutely or for any qualified or partial Estate, or as the Hu (band, Committee or Trustee of any Person or Persons under any of the Incapacities or Disabilities hereinbefore mentioned, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, or the said Surveyor General for the time being, to pay the Price or Consideration for the Purchase of such Rights to the Person or Persons, Body Politic or Corporate, so contracting for the Sale thereof, or to apply and dispose thereof in manner hereinafter mentioned; and such Person or Persons so contracting shall thereupon give a Certificate of such Contract, and of the Payment of the Consideration Money for the Purchase of such Rights, which shall be made according to the Form contained in the Schedule (C.) to this Act, or as near thereto as circumstances will permit; and upon Payment of such Sum of Money, and the signing such Certificate, all such Fuel Rights and Rights of Common of Eftovers for Firewood, as shall be m or by every such Certificate, or any Schedule thereto, expressed to be sold, released or extinguished, shall from thenceforth and immediately thereupon become and be emerged and extinguished in the Freehold and Inheritance of the said Woods, and be for ever thereafter vested in His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, in Right of His Crown, without any Bargain and Sale, Fine, Recovery, Deed or other Conveyance thereof whatsoever; any Statute, Custom, Law, Practice or Ufuage to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

Most Gracious Sovereign,

E Your Majesty'e most dutiful and loyal Subjects the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\

Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, from and after the Commencement of this Act, there shall in Schedule be granted, raised, levied, collected and paid unto His Majesty, his

levied. Heirs and Successors, upon and in respect of the several Articles and

Things mentioned, set forth and expressed in the Schedule hereunto annexed, the several Sums of Money and Duties as they are respectively described and set forth in the said Schedule; and the said Schedule and all the Exceptions, Exemptions and Regulations therein contained shall be deemed and taken to be Part of this Act to all Intents and Purposes; and the said several Duties shall be in lieu and full Satisfaction of all Duties granted on Auctions in Ireland by any former Act or Acts of Parliament.

Collection of the Duties on Auctions in Ireland, and to prevent Frauds

An Act to amend the several Acts for securing the CollcQion of the Duties on Auctions in Ireland; and also so much of Two several Acts* one made in the Forty ninth Year of His said Majesty's

VI. And Whereas an Act of the Parliament of Scotland* in ' the Year One thousand six hundred and eighty one, Chapter ' Seventeen, intituled An Act concerning the Sale of Bankrupts9 ' Lands, required certain Forms of Publication and Citation, which

in Practice have been found to be expensive and inconvenient;

and another Act of the Parliament of Scotland, in the Year One ' thousand lix hundred and' ninety five, Chapter Six, intituled Act ' regulating the Sale and Payment of Bankrupts* Estates, made it ' Lawful for Purchasers of such Estates to consign the Price, after a

certain time, in the Hands of the Magistrates and Town Council

of Edinburgh, which Method has been found inconvenient, and has ' seldom been practised; and by an Article in the Regulations of

the Session established in the lame Year One thousand six hundred ' and ninety five, Section Twenty fix, it was provided, that the

Ranking of the Creditors should proceed and be concluded by ? Decree before the Sale of the Lands, which Regulation has g£tte'- rally been prejudicial to the Creditors ; Be it enacted, That the said in Part recited Acts shall be and the same are hereby in so far repealed; and the Court of Session shall have full Power to make Acts of Sederunt for abridging the Forms of Publication and Citation, and regulating the Proceedings in Processes of Sale, Ranking and Division, whether at the Instance of Creditors or of apparent Heirs; and in every case of a Sale under the Authority of the Court of Session, it shall be lawful to the Purchaser, at any Term of Whitsunday or Martinmas subsequent to the Term of Payment of the Price, to lodge the Price, with the Interest due upon it, in" the Royal Bank, or Bank of Scotland, or the Bank of the Brrftit Linen Company, at such Interest as can be procured for it, by doing which, and by giving Notice thereof to the Agent itho earned on the Sale, he shall be discharged of the said Price; and further, the Court of Session, upon the Application of any of the Creditors, shall be empowered to make an Order on the Purchaser Jo lodge the Price and Interect, at any of the said Terms, subseqttent to the Term of Payment, in one or other of the said Banks, fuffldect Intimation being always previously given both to the Purchaser and to the Common Agent for the Creditors, that such Application is biade, in order that all Parties may have an Opportunity to object j and in all cases of Judicial Sales, the Lands or other heritable Sub-Jfefts may be brought to actual Sale so soon as the necessary previous Steps are taken, whether the Ranking be concluded or H5t, Unless the Court, upon Application of any Party concerned, 1km $nd sufficient Cause to delay the Sale.

' VII. And Whereas Doubts have arisen upon the Construction of an Act, made in the Year One thousand six hundred and

ninety, Chapter Twenty, intituled Act anent the Sale of Bankrupt/ f Lands, in 10 far as it requires that the Common Debtor be found 1 Bankrupt and utterly Insolvent Be it enacted, That a judicttl Sale, at the Instance of Creditors, may m all Cases proceed tfhel^ the Interest of the Debts and the other annual Burdens Ukceed tfc* tearly Income of the Sabjefts under Sale, or tvhere a Sedueftratioft mail nave taken place under this or any former Statute, witnout-other Proof of Bankruptcy or Insolvency.

in the Year One thousand five hundred and forty, Chapter One x°ll#

' hundred and six, concerting Charges to enter Heir, and another

Act im the Year One thousand six hundred and twenty one, Chapter

Twenty seven, concerning Apprisings against Heirs, it was ordain*

ed, that Charges against Heirs unentered, which were to be the Foundation of apprising against their Predecessors Lands, might proceed at the Instance of Creditors, commanding them to enter

within Forty Days after the Charge; but it has been doubted whether the same or a longer Term is required when the Person

charged is out of Scotland, and it is expedient that such InductJt

4 Ihoutd be of long Duration ; Be it enacted, That the Induct£ of Adjudicttioni on a Charge to enter Heir shall in no case exceed Forty Days, whether Charges to enter the Person charged be within the Kingdom or out of it 5 and that e, r* after one such Charge, whether general or special, has been given at the Instance of any Creditor, every subsequent Charge, at the Instance of the same or of any other Creditor, may be upon the Inducts of Twenty Days only 5 any Law or Practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

IX. And, in order to leiTen the Number of Adjudications for Different Cr«-Debt, and consequently the Expence to all Parties, and to facilitate*

the 1 tan psffu Preference of Creditors in similar circumstances, be it enacted, That the Lord Ordinary officiating in the Court of Session, before whom the first Process of Adjudication against any Estate fot Payment or Security of Debt hr calied, shall ordain Intimation thereof to be made in the Minute Book, and on the Wall, in order'c

that any other Creditors of the Common Debtor, who at the next Calling of the Cause can shew that, although they have not executed their SummonfeS of Adjudication, they are in other respects, by the nature of the Grounds of Debt, and Steps taken by them, in Condi* tioa to proceed in adjudging their Debtor's Estate, may produce the Instructions of thieir Drots, with Summonses of Adjudication, libelled and signetted, for the Purpose of their being conjoined in the Decree of Adjudication, Twenty Sederunt Days being allowed for fneb Intimation before the Cause can be called a Second Time; and if any of these Forms shall happen to be omitted, the said Adjudication shall be null and void, without Prejudice to its being brought forward again in more due Form, or still conjoined with any after Adjudication; and, without Prejudice to the Validity and Order of ranking of posterior Adjudications according to the Rules of Law, when any after Process or Processes of Adjudication are brought into Court, the lame shall be regulated, as to the Time and Manner of Proceeding in them, by an Act or Acts of Sederunt of the Court of Session, so as to provide, as saur as circumstances will admit, for the pari pajfu Preference of such posterior Adjudications with one another, and to ibrijge the Number and Expence of such Proceedings; and in all dies where Penalties for Nonpayment over and above Performance arc contained in Bonds, or other Obligations for Sums of Money, and Ure made the Subject of Adjudication, or of Demand in any ofher Shape, it shall be in the Power of the Court to modify and rtftrift such Penalties, so as not to exceed the real and necessary Expeoces incurred in making the Debt effectual.

An Act to amend the Laws respecting the Attestation of Instruments of Appointment and Revocation, made in exercise of certain Powers in Deeds, Wills and other Instruments.

[30th Juiy 1814.]

WHEREAS Powers, Authorities and Trusts are in many 4 V* cases required to be executed by Deeds or Instruments«signed by or under the Hands of the Persons executing the same,

4 or Persons consenting to or directing Acts respecting such Powers,

Authorities and Trusts are frequently required to signify such Consent or Direction by Deeds or Instruments signed by them, or

under their Hands, and it has been the ordinary Practice, in the

Memorandum of Attestation of Deeds, to express the Fads of Sealing and Delivery only: And Whereas Doubts have arisen respecting the Validity of Deeds or Instruments so attested and requiring Signature, although the same may have been actually signed by the Persons whose Signature is required thereto, and the Titles of many Purchasers, and of other Persons claiming under such Instrument may be defective for want of the Insertion of the Word Signed,' or some Word to that ElFed, in the Memorandum of Attestation thereof: And Whereas it is expedient that the Titles

of Purchasers and other Persons should not be disturbed, merely on account of the Omission to express the Fact of Signature in the Memorandum of Attestation of any stich Deed or oilier Instrument already made : May it therefore please Your Majesty, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That every Deed or other Instrument, already Deeds &c. ex-made with the Intention to exercise any Power, Authority orTrust, or Cuted without to signify the Consent or Direction of any Person whole Consent or Memorandum Direction may be necefl'ary to be so signified, shall (if duly signed and of Attestation, executed and in other respects duly attested) be from the D.*te thereof, deerncd vai, d* and so as to establish derivative Titles, if any, of the same Validity and

Efsect, and no other, at Law and in Equity, and proveable in like manner, an if a Memorandum of Attestation of Signature, or being under Hand, had been subscribed by the Witness or Witnesses thereto; and the Attestation of the Witness or Witnesses thereto, expressing the Fad of Sealing, or of Sealing and Delivery, without expressing the Fad of Signing or any other Form of Attestation, shall not exclude the Proof or the Presumption of Siguature.

in different Years, whereby the Widows are left m uncertainty as

to the Extent of the Income which they are to receive in any one

4 Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, Power is given to the c*c, x*

4 said Commissioners to take or contract for a House for the Purposes of the said Corporation, and also One or more Warehouses,

4 Stables or Store Yards, and such other Accommodations as they should deem necessary for the better carrying on the Purposes of the said A Cl; and that the Repairs thereof, and the providing necessary Accommodations, should be paid out of the Funds arising

4 by virtue of the said Act, provided that the annual Rent and Ex-

5 pences thereof, exclusive of Taxes and Repairs, should not exceed the Sum of Two hundred and fifty Pounds 5 And Whereas the said Commissioners have from time to time experienced great Difficulties in carrying into Execution the Purposes of the said Att in paving, cleansing and lighting the Streets of Dublin, which Works were l'everally done by Contract under the Authority of the DireClors, and Commissioners under former Acts, but which Works are now performed and executed under the immediate Direction of the present Commissioners; and an absolute Necessity is thereby created for various Stores and Workffiops in the different Depart ments, which were not wanting, or necessary to the former DireClors and Commissioners, for the reason aforesaid; and such Difculties are likely to continue and increase, unless the said Commissioners shall be empowered to take ar.d contraCl for additional Stores,

and the Expence of the said Lighting and Works will thereby be considerably dirainished in other respeda ; Be it therefore enacted. That it shall and may be lawful for the said Commissioners, out of the Funds arising by virtpe of the said recited Act of the Forty seventh Year of His present Majesty's Reign, or by virtue of this Act, to pay for the Annual Rent of the House, Houses, Warehouses, Stables and Places now occupied and rented by them, and also for such other House, Houses, Warehouses, Stores, Store Yards and other Places, as shall by the said Commissioners be found necessary to be taken and occupied by them, for the Purposes of the said recited Act, and of this present Act, such annual Sums or Rents as they shall think proper, not exceeding in the whole the Sum of Eight hundred Pounds Sterling, by the Year, exclusive of Taxes and Repain; nevertheless to be subject to the Approbation of the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland for the time being.

XIV. And Whereas the Lives and Limbs of His Majesty's 4 Subjects passing and repassing through the City of Dublin and the Liberties and Environs thereof, are greatly endangered by various Vaults, Arches, Cellars and other Excavation < of the Earth under the flagged Ways and Pavements within the said Limits of the Jurisdiction of the said Commissioners, from the same being supported by Timber in a decayed State, or built of bad Materials, and with bad and inefficient Workmanship ; For Remedy whereof. Be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawfcil for the said Comnuf-sioners, or any Two or more of them, or any Officer acting under their Authority, at all reasonable Hours in the Day-time, having first given Twenty four Hours* Notice in Writing, to enter any House or other Building within the said Limits, to view all such Vaults, Arches, Cellars or Excavations; and if the lame shall appear to be fnpported by Timber or insufficiently supported in any manner, or

become decayed so as to be dangerous to the Public, then such Commissioners or their Officer shall serve or cause to be served a Notice in Writing on the Person or Persons occupying the House or Houses in Front of which such Vault or Vaults, Arch or Arches, Cellar or other Excavation shall be found, requiring the said Person or Persons to cause the same within the Space of Fourteen Days from the Date of such Notice, to be well and sufficiently repaired or built on the Sides with Walls of Stone or Brick and Mortar, and to be arched over with the like Materials in the lame manner, under the Direction of an Officer to be appointed by the said Commissioners for that Purpose 5 and if the Person or Persons occupying such House shall refuse or neglect to perform the Directions of such Notice, or to apply to the said Commissioners for Licence to proceed with the said Work for the said Space of Fourteen Days, then and in every such case the said Commissioners or any Two of them may give Orders, and appoint a proper (kilful Person or Persons to ered or cause to be erected, such Walls of Stone or Brick and Mortar, and such Vault or Vaults, Arch or Arches, Cellar or other Excavation to be built with Stone or Brick and Mortar, and to cover in such Vault or Vaults, Arch or Arches, Cellar or Excavation 5 in which case, if the Occupier or Occupiers of such House or Building as aforesaid, shall for Twenty one Days after the completing of such Work, and after that a Bill of Expences shall have been fumished to such Occupier or Occupiers, refuse or neglect to pay to the said Commissioners the said Expences, then and in such case the said Commissioners or One of them shall and may issue their or his Warrant to levy by Distress and Sale of the Goods and Chattels of the Occupier or Occupiers, or Landlord or Landlords of such House, where-soever found, the full Amount of the said Expences, together with the Cods and Charges attending such Distress, Levying and Sale of his or her Goods and Chattels, which shall thereupon be executed accordingly, the Surplus, if any, to be returned to the said Occupier or Occupiers, Landlord or Landlords.

XV. And Whereas several Vaults have been heretofore built,

and now are situate in several of the Squares, Streets, Lanes,

4 Courts, Alleys and Quays within the Limits aforesaid, many of which Vaults have been extended from the Fronts of Public

Buildings, Houses, Messuages, Tenements, dead Walls and void Spaces, so far as to meet or nearly meet the Vaults built fronting the Houses, Buildings, Messuages and Tenements on the other Side of such Streets, Lanes, Courts and Alleys, and no sufficient Space has been left, or remains between such Vaults in the Centre pr otherwise of such Streets, Lanes, Courts and Alleys for building and erecting Public Sewers therein, and several of the Vault*

4 built and now situate in several of the said Squares, Streets and Quays which are not built on each Side thereof, have been extended too far out and beyond the Centre of the Street thereof;

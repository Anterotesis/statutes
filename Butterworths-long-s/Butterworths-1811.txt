Cotton Wool spun in Great Britain, there should be wove in the

Warp in both Selvages through the whole Length thereof. Three

Blue Stripes, each Stripe ot one Thread only, in manner in the said Act particularly mentioned: And whereas it is also by the said recited Act, among other things, enacted, that if any Person or Persons, Body or Bodies Corporate, should expose or cause to be

exposed to Sale, or have in his, her or their Custody or Possession in Great Britain, any Stuffs wholly made of Cotton, and printed, painted, flamed or dyed (Muffins, Fustians and Neckcloths cx-

cepted), wherein shall not be woven in the Warp in both Selvages,

only through the whole Length of each Piece, Three Blue Stripes

(unless for Exportation), then such Person or Persons, Body or

Bodies Corporate so offending should not only forfeit all and every such last mentioned Stuffs so exposed or caused to be exposed to

Sale, or which should be in his, her or their Custody or Possession,

but should also forfeit for every Piece thereof the Sum of Fifty, Pounds: And whereas by the said Act it is also enacted, that if any Person or Persons, Body or Bodies Corporate, should import or bring into Great Britain, or into any Port, Harbour, Haven or

whatsoever made of Linen Yarn only, or of Linen Yarn and Cotton Wool mixed, or made wholly of Cotton Wool, wherein should be wove in the Warp, in either or both Selvages only, through the Whole or any Part of the Length of each Piece, One or more Blue ' Stripe or Stripes of One or more Thread or Threads, such Person or Persons, Body or Bodies Corporate, shou'd not only forfeit and

109

51° GEO. III. C. 33, 34.

said Act made in the Fourteenth Year of the Reign aforesaid, should be deemed to be Foreign Calicoes, and on their being printed,

Mark or Seal, containing the following Words, videlicet, 4t Foreign Calicoes for Exportation and every Draper, Trader, or Dealer for Sale, having in his, her or their Cufrody or Possession such

Assigns, equally amongst them: And whereas the Profits and ' Emoluments of the said Office have beer, divided equally amongst ' the said Persons accordingly Be it therefore enacted, That the Compensation or Allowance hereinbefore authorised to be made and granted by the Lords of the Treasury, upon the Abolition of the said Office of Comptroller in the Port of London, shall be paid to and for the Use of the Persons who are at the time of the passing of this Act, or would hereafter be legally entitled to demand and receive the Profits and Emoluments of the said Office under the Will of the aforesaid Frederick Earl of Gutlford, if the said Office had net been abolished under the Provisions of this Act, and to no other Person or Persons whatever.

IX. Provided always, and be it enacted, That whenever it shall be found necessary to make a new Appointment under the Authority of this Act, for the Execution of any of the Duties of either of the Offices enumerated in the Tables hereunto annexed, marked (B.) and (C.) which may be deemed requisite to be performed, although the Patents for the Offices may be abolished, the Commissioners of the Customs shall in all such cafealay an Account of the same before both Houses of Parliament, within Fourteen Days of the Beginning of the Session next after such Appointment, describing the Office, and the Amount of the Salary which shall be appointed for the same.

X. And whereas it is expedient that the Benefit intended to be

afforded to Trade and Commerce by the said recked Acts should,

without Delay, be extended as much and as generally as possible,

and that Merchants and Traders should be exonerated from the

Payment of any Fee, Perquisite, Gratuity or Reward, to any

Officer, Clerk or other Person employed in the Service of the

Customs, except as herein after is provided; Be it therefore further enacted, That, from and after the said Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve, no Fee, Perquisite, Gratuity or Reward, whether pecuniary or of any other Sort or Description whatever, shall be required, taken or received, by any Officer, Clerk or other Person executing or performing or affilling in the Execution or Performance of any of the Duties, or acting in any of the Offices ot Employments in or belonging to His Majesty's Customs in the Port of London, for any Service, Act, Duty, Matter or Thing done or performed, or to be done or performed by any or either of such Officers, Clerks or other Persons, on account of or relating to any such Office or Employment, except as herein after is provided; and all such Officers, Clerks and other Persons respectively, shall, from and after the said Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve, receive such annual Salaries or other Allowances as the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the time being, or any Three or more of them, shall deem to be reasonable for the Labour and Trouble of executing the Dutieft of their respective Offices or Employments; and if any such Officer, Clerk or other Person, shall, at any time after the said Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve, require, take or receive any Fee, Perquisite, Gratuity or Reward, whether pecuniary or of any other Sort or Description whatever, either directly or indinedly, except as herein after is provided, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this Act, on account of or relating to any such Office or Employment, or for any Service, Act, Duty, Matter or Thing,

dope or performed, or to be done or performed, either therein or in the Performance or Execution of any Orders or Directions he may have received from the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs, though the same shall be freely offered or given, every such Officer,

Clerk or other Person so offending, shall, on Proof thereof to the Satisfaction of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs in England, or any Four or more of them, be, for the First Offence, peremptorily dismissed from his Office or Employment, and be Penalty, rendered incapable of ever again holding or executing, or acting in any Office or Employment in the Service of His Majesty's Customs or Excise.

XI. Provided also, and be it further enacted, That nothing in this Proviso for So- Ad contained shall extend or be construed to extend to prevent licitors taking any of the Solicitors of His Majesty's Customs from charging and Fee>* receiving any Fees which they have been heretofore accustomed to charge and receive on account of the professional Business which they traniaft in their respective Offices.

X.IL And whereas it has long been the Practice for Merchants

and 9thei^ concerned in the Importation and Exportation of Goods,

to feled and employ such of the Officers or Clerks in the Long Room, of the Custom House London, in preparing, framing and

passing Entries of Goods inwards and outwards as they thought proper: And whereas it is expedient and necessary, for the Accommodation of Trade, that Merchants and others should not be f prevented from availing themselves of the Assistance afforded by such Officers and Clerks, when they may require it, but that the Fee s or Reward for such Assistance should be regulated and ascertained; 9

Be it therefore further enabled, That, from and after the said Fifth pees ^en by Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve, it shall be Clerks in the lawful for any Officer or Clerk employed in the Service of the Long Room. Customs in the Long Room of the Custom House London, to render such Assistance as aforesaid to Merchants and others making Entries inwards or outwards, and to take or receive for the same such Fee or Reward only as the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs iu England, or any Four or more of them with the Approbation of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of them, shall from time to time think proper and direct, and any such Officer or Clerk who shall take or receive any greater Fee or Reward for such Service than shall be so allowed and directed, shall be subject to the Penalties of this Act, and be punishable as a Person receiving illegal Fees, contrary to the Provisions thereof.

XIII. And whereas Inconvenience might arise to Merchants and others making Entries at the Custom House in the Port of London if the several Collectors and Receivers of the Duties of Customs in the said Port were to be subject and liable to the Penalties of this Act, in case they were to receive more than the precise fradional Amount of the Duties of Customs due on any such Entry not amounting to Six Pence, according to a Practice 14 which has long prevailed Be it therefore enacted, That nothing for

in this Act contained shall extend or be construed to extend, to pre- taking of the vent any Receiver or Collector of any of the Duties of Customs in odd Fence, the Port of London* from receiving and applying to his own Use so much beyond the precise fradional Amount of the Duties legally

due on any Entry as shall not in any Instance amount to the Sam of

Six Pence beyond such precise Amount of Duty; that is to say, when the total Sum of the Duties upon an Entry produces a Eraction under Six Pence, he may receive the Six pence, and where it produces a Fra&ion between Six Pence and One Shilling, he may receive the Shilling, provided that the Merchant or other Person making such Entry shall be desirous and willing to pay the same, but not other wise

XIV. And whereas it is necessary, for the Accommodation of

Merchants and Traders, that Warrants of Entries inwards in the

Port of London should, in certain cases, be issued by the sevend

Receivers and Collectors of the Duties of v^ustoms, and expedited

and delivered to the proper Officers appointed to discharge or deliver the Goods mentioned i' any such Entry, without waiting

the usual Course of daily Business: And whereas the Practice of

granting such Accommodation to Merchants and others has long

prevailed, and would, if discontinued, be attended with much Is-

convenience to Trade: And whereas it is just and reasonable that the Officers of the Customs, by whom such Warrants are to be issued and expedited, should receive a moderate Recompence for the

extraordinary Trouble occasioned thereby; Be it therefore enacted, That in case any Merchant or other Person making any Entry inwards in the Custom House in the Port of London shall be defirotis of having the Warrant of such Entry dispatched before the usual Hour of delivering such Document to the proper Officer of the Customs appointed to attend the Examination and Discharge of the Goods so entered, it shall be lawful for the Receiver or Coljeftor of the Customs in the Port of London, whose Duty it may be to issue such Warrant, and for the Officer commonly called the Clerk of the Warrants in the Long Room of the Custom House London, to expedite and pass the same throtigh the proper Offices, provided the Merchant or other Person making any such Entry shall request to be so accommodated; and in such case the following Gratuity shall be paid to the said Officers; videlicet, to the Receiver or Collector whose Duty it may be to issue such Warrants, the Sum of Six Pence for each Warrant so issued, and no more; to the Officer commonly called the Clerk of the Warrants, the Sum of One Shilling for each Warrant so expedited, and no more; any thing in this Act contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

XV. And whereas certain Persons in the Office of the Collector of the Customs outwards in the Port of London, arc directed and

employed specially to write Cockets for the shipping of Goods for the Purpose of Exportation: And whereas it has been customary

for the Merchants and other Persons entering Goods for Exportation, to select and employ such of the said Cocket Writers as they shall think fit to write such Cockets: And whereas it is necessary for the Accommodation of the Merchants, and to facilitate the re-

gular shipping of Goods intended to be exported, particularly during a Press of Business, that such Practice should still be allowed; Be it therefore enacted, That, from and after the Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve, it shall be lawful for any Merchant or other Person making an Entry in the Custom House in the Port of London, of Goods intended to be shipped for Exportation to Foreign Par^s, and for which it is necessary a

Cocket

51° GEO. III. C. 71. 215

Cocket should be first procured, to feled and employ any or either of the Persons bolding the Office of Cocket Writer in writing such Cocket; and it shall and may be lawful for any such Cocket Writer so 'employed as aforesaid to receive from the Merchant or other Person making any such Entry, such Fee or Gratuity according to the Trouble uccafioned by Writing the same, as shall be agreed on between the Person making the Entry, and such Cocket Writer; any thing contained in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding:

[Proviso.]

Provided always, that such Fee or Gratuity shall not in any case whatever exceed the Sum of Five Shillings, including the Expence of the Parchment on which such Cocket shall be written, which Parchment the said Cocket Writer shall provide at his own Expence; and any such Cocket Writer who shall take or receive any greater Fee or Reward for writing any such Cocket than is hereinbefore allowed, shall be subject to the Penalties of this Act, and be punish-. able as a Person receiving illegal Fees contrary to the Provision thereof.

XVI. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That nothing Officers may rein this Act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to p.rc-e, vc Shares of vent any Officer or other Person holding or exercising, or acting in, be, zu^e,

or performing the Duties of any Office or Employment in the Customs; n the Port of London* from receiving such Reward or Satisfaction, for or on account of any Detention, Seizure or Forfeiture, of any Goods, Wares or Merchandize, or apy Penalty or Share of Penalty or Composition, which, under any Law now in force, or hereafter to be passed in relation to the Duties of Customs, be is or may be legally entitled to; or to prevent any such Officer,

Clerk or other Person, from receiving any Allowance, Gratuity or Reward, which the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Trea-fnry, or any Three or more of them, or the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs in England, or ?ny Fopr pr more of them, may think fit to direct.

XVII. And be it further enacted, That nothing in this Act con- Proviso for pre-tained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to alter the Hours sent Hours of during which Officers, Clerks and other Persons, employed in the Attendant* Service of the Customs in the Port of London, are required to attend

for the Execution and Discharge of their respective Duties, by the

Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act for abolishing Fees received by

certain Officers and other Persons employed in the Service of the Customs in the Port of London, and for regulating the Attendance of Officers and others so employed.

XIX. And be it, further enacted, That every Person who from and after the said Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve shall be appointed to anyf Office or Employment in or belonging to His Majesty's Customs in the Port of London, shall at their respective Admissions thereto, or who, having been so appointed and admitted, shall not have taken the Oath of Office required by Law before the said Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve shall, instead of the Oath prescribed by an Act passed in the Sixth and Seventh Years of the Reign of King Willim and Queen Mary, take the following Oath; that is to say,

T A. J$. do swear to be true and faithful in the Execution, to the 4*bed of my Knowledge and Power, of the Trust committed to my Charge and Inspection in the Service of His Majesty's Customs, and that I will not require, take or receive, any Fee, Per-

Act, Duty, Matter or Thing, done or performed, or to be done or performed, in the Execution or Discharge of any of the Duties of my Office or Employment, on any account whatever, other than my Salary, and what is or shall be allowed me by Law or by any Special Order of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs for the time being. So help me GOD.*

XX. And, in order that proper Compensation may be made to any Officer, Clerk or other Person employed in the Service of the Customs in the Port of London, who may luftain Loss by the Abolition of Fees directed by this Act, be it therefore enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury for the time being, or any Three or more of them, in cases where, on dup £?amination and Enquiry, it shall be made appear to them that the Salaries or Allowances to be paid to Officers, Clerks or other Persons, employed in the Service of the Customs in the Port of London, as a Reward for their Labour (in future) in the Execution of the Duty of their respective Offices or Employments, may not amount to so much as it might be just and reasonable to allow to the present Possessors of such Offices or Employments by way of Compensation for the Loss of fees formerly received by them respectively, to order such further annual Allowances as they the said Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of them, shall deem just anti reasonable to be paid to any such Officer, Clerk or other Person; such further Allowance to commence from and after the said Fifth Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twelve, and to continue during the time any such Officer, Clerk or other Person, shall hqld any such Office I or Employment: Provided always, that in case any such Officer, Clerk or other Person, shall be removed to any other Office or Em- 1

XXI. And whereas certain Officers, Clerks and other Persons*employed in the Service of the Customs in the Port of London,

have been in the Practice of receiving Fees not authorised by Law:

XXXI. Rules for Application of Half Pay -

XXXII. And whereas the Officers of the Royal Regiment of Manx Fencibles engaged to serve in the said Corps upon a Stipulation contained in the Letter of Service under which they were

raised, that they should be allowed to receive any Half Pay to which they might be entitled, notwithstanding their holding Subahem Commissions in the said Corps, but no Provision has been

made by Parliament for Payment of such Half Pay; and it is therefore expedient that Provision should now be made for Payment of the Arrears of Half Pay to such Officers as aforesaid; Be it therefore enacted, That Officers who are entitled to Half Pay, and who accepted or held Subaltern Commissions in the Royal Regiment of Manx Fencibles, shall, notwithstanding their having had the full Pay of such Commissions, be entitled to receive the Arrears of such Half Pay for any Year or Time in which they shall not hart before been allowed to receive the same, upon taking an Oath before the Officer usually administering Oaths to Persons for the Purpose of their receiving Half Pay, that they had not in any Year or Time for which such Arrear is claimed, any Office dr Employment of Profit, Civil or Military, under His Majesty, besides their Allowance of Half Pay, save and except their Pay as such Subaltern Officer of the Royal Regiment of Manx Fencibles, and taking the said Oath, shall, without taking any other Oath, be sufficient to entitle such Officer to receive his Half Pay.

XXXIII. And whereas Chaplains of Regiments, who hare been placed on Half Pay, have not been allowed to receive such Half Pay in some Years, in consequence of being in Possession at the time of certain Ecclesiastical Benefices or Preferments, though the lame were sot in the Patronage of the Crown; And whereas it

Half Pay allowed to Officers of the Manx Fencibles.

A.D. 1811.

355

51° GEO. III. C. 117, 118.

it has been judged fair and reasonable that they (ljould be allowed ' to receive such Half Pay, though in Possession of Ecclesiastical ' Preferment, provided the same was private Patronage, and not ' derived from the Crown, and that they should also be allowed to receive the Arrears of Half Pay for such former Years as aforesaid; Be it therefore enacted, That all Chaplains, who, after having been placed on Half Pay, shall have been refused or been unable to receive such Half Pay in any Year, in consequence of holding any Ecclesiastical Benefice not derived from or in the Gift of the Crown, shall be entitled to receive the Arrears of such Half Pay for such Years, upon making Affidavit before the proper Officer for administering Oaths to Persons for entitling them to receive Half Pay, that they held no Ecclesiastical Benefice or Preferment in any such Year derived from the Crown, nor any Place or Employment of Profit under His Majesty; and the taking the said Oath shall, without taking any other Oath, be sufficient to entitle such Chap* lain to receive his Half Pay.

XXXIV. Application of Overplus of Sum under 50 G. 3. c. 115. §14. to reduced Officers.

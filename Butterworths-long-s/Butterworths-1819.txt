the Port or other Officer appointed for that Purpose, under the Provisions of this A6fc, shall deliver to the Master or Chief Officer of said Vessel a blank Journal Book, in such Form as the said Commissioners of the Irish Fisheries shall direct or appoint, signed by the said Colle&or or such other Officer, and ruled under diftm& Heads; in which said Master or some one of the Crew above the Age of Fourteen Years, shall enter an Account of the Proceedings of said Vessel, the Soundings upon the Coast and Fishing Banks, the Quantity of Fi(h taken by said Vessel, and the Quantity bought, and the times when respectively 5 and in default of so doing, such Vessel shall forfeit such Part of the Bounty as (he might otherwise have been entitled to, as the said Commissioners of Fisheries shall think fit.

XIII. And for the better ascertaining the Quantity of Herrings taken and bought, be it further enabled, That every Vessel at the time of being entered for the Fisheries, shall have on board Two Half Barrels, each containing Sixteen Galions, with which shall be measured the Herrings taken and bought by her; and the Entry in the Journal of the Quantity of Herrings taken and bought, shall be by the Number of Barrels or Half Barrels, and not by Tale or Count.

That no Drag Net or other Sea Net which hath a Me(h of less than Three Inches and a Half from Knot to Knot, shall be made use of in catching &ny kind of Fi(h, (except Herrings, Pilchards, Sprats, Shrimps and Prawns, and small Shell Fi(h tor Bait,) upon any Parts of the Coasts of Ireland, or within any of the Bays, Harbours, Rivers or Creeks thereof, nor shall any false or double Bottom, Cod or Paunch, or any other Net, though of legal Size, be placed upon or behind the other, in order to take and destroy small Fi(h; and if any Person or Persons shall make use of any Drag Net or other Sea Net which has a Me(h of less than Three Inches and a Half from Knot to Knot, in catching any kind of Fish (except Herrings, Pilchards, Sprats, Shrimps, Prawns and small Shell Fish for Bait) on any Parts of the Sea Coasts of Ireland, or within any of the Bays, Harbours, Rivers or Creeks thereof, shall place any false or double Bottom, Cod or Paunch, or any other Net, though of legal Size, upon or behind any other, in order to take and destroy small Fish; such Person or Penons so offending, and being thereof convicted, upon his or their Appearance, or Default after Summoist, before One or more Justice or Just ices of the Peace of the County, or Infpe&or of the District where such Person or Persons so offending hath or have their usual Place of Abode, by the Oath of One or more credible Witness or Witnestes, which Oath such Justice or Justices of the Peace, or Infpe&or, is and are hereby empowered to administer, or by Confession of the Party offending, shall for every such Offence forfeit and lose such Net or Nets, which such Justice or Justices are hereby empowered to seize and destroy, and shall also forfeit a Sum not less than Forty Shillings, nor exceeding Ten Pounds, to be levied by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of such Justice or Justices 01 the Peace, or Infpe&or, before whom such Offender shall be convicted, by Distress and Sale of the Goods of such Offender, the One Moiety thereof to the Person who shall inform and prosecute for the same, and the other Moiety to go and be disposed of to the Use of the Poor of the Parish where such

* XV. And Whereas Shoals of Herrings are frequently frightened € from the Entrance of the Bays and Creeks, by Vessels mooring

* and (hooting their Nets in improper Places, and by laying long 1 Lines for taking of Cod and Lyng across the Entrance of Bays

* and Creeks, and other Irregularities Be it ena6ted, That no Vessel on the Coasts of Ireland shall moor or (hoot their Nets in any Places which shall be forbidden by the Inspector or other Officer to be appointed; nor shall any Person (hoot any Net or any long Line for taking of Cod, Lyng and other Fish, at any time nor in any Place which shall be forbidden by the said Inspector, or other Person duly authorised for such Purpose under the Provision9 of this Act, under a Penalty of Twenty Pounds, to be levied in lik£ manner as the other Penalties by this Act directed are appointed to be levied.

XVI. And be it further enacted, That no Nets shall be (hot or wet for the taking of Herrings in the Day time, under the Penalty of Ten Pounds, to be recovered again ft the Owner or Owners of such Net6, or of the Vessel from which such Nets shall be (hot or wet, and to be levied by Distress and Sale of his, her or their Goods and Chattels, by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of the Inspector or Inspectors of the Fisheries; and if there shall be no Inspector, then by Warrant of a Justice of the Peace for the County wherein the Party or Parties do reside, and before whom the Offence shall be proved by the Confession of the Party accused, or by the Oath of One or more credible Witness or Witnesses; which said Penalty, when recovered, shall be applied in such Manner and to such Uses as the other Penalties hereinbefore mentioned are to be applied.

1 XVII. And Whereas, notwithstanding the Laws now in force

* for the Regulation of the Fisheries of Irelandby the Multitude of

* Boats that resort to the different Places of Rendezvous, many of

* which shoot their Nets in the Day time, and begin to fish before the

* Shoals of Herrings, Pilchards or Mackerel are settled in the Bays

* and Creeks where they usually resort for Shelter, there is reason to € believe that the Fisheries are much injured, and that a Regulation 4 with regard to the time of commencing the Fishery would be of 4 great Advantage Be it enacted, That in the several Places where Inspectors or other Officers are appointed, and where Orders shall be given for the purpose by the Commissioners of the Irjjh Fisheries, or any Three of them, who are hereby empowered so to do, no Person shall be at liberty to shoot their Nets, until Notice for such Purpose shall be posted up by the Inspector of the District, under a Penalty of Twenty Pounds, to be levied as other Penalties in this Act directed.

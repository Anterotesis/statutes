XIX. And Whereas in many Parishes, and more especially in large and populous Towns, the Payment of the Poor's Rates is

greatly evacted, by reason that great Numbers of Houses within such Parishes are let out in Lodgings, or in separate Apartments, or for short Terms, or are let to Tenants who quit their Residences

or become insolvent before the Rates charged on them can be collected; and it hath been found, that in many Instances the Persons letting such Houses do actually charge and receive much higher Rents for the same, upon the Ground and Expedition that the Occupiers thereof cannot be effectually assessed to the Poor's Rates, and will not be charged with or required to pay such Rates, and do thus obtain an undue Advantage to themselves, and by means of the Premises the other Inhabitants of such Parishes are unjustly compelled to pay much more than their fair and due Proportions of the Charges of relieving and maintaining the Popr For Remedy thereof be it further enacted, That from and after the Firffc Day of January One thousand eight hundred and twenty, it shall be lawful for the Inhabitants of any Parish, in Vestry assembled, and they are hereby empowered, to resolve and diredfc, that the Owner or Owners of all Houses, Apartments or Dwellings in such Parishes, being the immediate Lessor or Lessors of the actual Occupier or Occupiers, which shall respectively be let to the Occupiers thereof at any Rent or Rate not exceeding Twenty Pounds, nor less than Six Pounds by the Year, for any less Term than One Year, or on any Agreement by which the Rent shall be reserved or made payable at any shorter Period than Three Months, shall be assessed to the Rates for the Relief of the Poor, for or in respectc of such Houses, Apartments or Dwellings, and the Outhouses and Curtilages thereof, instead of the adtu&l Occupiers; and the Inhabitants so assembled in Vestry may and they are hereby authorised from time to time to refeind, renew, vary and amend every such Resolution and Direction as they shall see Occasion, so as no such Resolution or Direction shall extend to assess or charge the Owner of any House, Apartment or Dwelling which shall with the Outhouses and Curtilages thereof be let at a greater Rent than Twenty Pounds or less than Six Pounds as aforesaid; and the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of every such Parish are hereby empowered and required to carry into effea all such Resolutions and Directions of the Inhabitants in Vestry assembled, and in pursuance and execution thereof, in all Rates to be by them made for the Relief of the Poor, to assess by a fair and equal Pound Rate the Owner or Owners, being the immediate Lessor or Lessors of the actual Occupier or Occupiers, of every House, Apartment or Dwelling to which such Resolution and Direction shall extend, for or in respect of the same, according to the actual Rent at which every such House, Apartment or Dwelling shall be let, after making a reasonable Deduction from such Rent, not exceeding in any Case One Half of the same; and upon Nonpayment of the Sum or Sums so to be assessed, the same may and shall be levied upon, and the Payment thereof be enforced against, such Owner and Owners, Lessor and Lessors, so to be assessed, and his and their Goods and Chattels, in like manner as Rates for the Relief of the Poor may by Law be levied and recovered, and the Payment thereof enforced, upon and against any actual Occupier on whom the same are charged.

XXI. Provided, and be it further enacted, That every Person receiving or claiming the Rent of any such House, Apartment or Dwelling, for his or her own Use, or receiving the same For the Use of any Corporation Aggregate, or of any Landlord or Leflor who shall be a Minor, under Coverture, or in fane, or for the Use of any Person who shall not be usually residens: within Twenty Miles from the Parish in which any such House, Apartment or Dwelling shall be situated, shall for this Purpose be deemed and taken to be and shall be rateable as the Owner thereof.

XXII. Provided also, and be it further enacted, That every Person to be rated as the Owner of any such House, Apartment or Dwelling, who shall think himself or herself aggrieved by any such Rate, shall have such and the like Remedy by Appeal against the same, as any other Person thereby rated; and every Person so rated shall be entitled, as an Inhabitant of the Parish in and for which he shall be assessed, to be present and to vote in every Vestry or Meeting of the Inhabitants thereof, for the Execution of the Laws for the Relief of the Poor, or for the Consideration of any Matter or Question in relation thereto, in like manner as the Inhabitants of the said Parish.

the Port or other Officer appointed for that Purpose, under the Provisions of this Act, shall deliver to the Master or Chief Officer of said Vessel a blank Journal Book, in such Form as the said Commissioners of the Irish Fisheries shall direct or appoint, signed by the said Collector or such other Officer, and ruled under distm& Heads; in which said Master or some one of the Crew above the Age of Fourteen Years, shall enter an Account of the Proceedings of said Vessel, the Soundings upon the Coast and Fishing Banks, the Quantity of Fish taken by said Vessel, and the Quantity bought, and the times when respectively 5 and in default of so doing, such Vessel shall forfeit such Part of the Bounty as (he might otherwise have been entitled to, as the said Commissioners of Fisheries shall think fit.

XIII. And for the better ascertaining the Quantity of Herrings taken and bought, be it further enacted, That every Vessel at the time of being entered for the Fisheries, shall have on board Two Half Barrels, each containing Sixteen Galions, with which shall be measured the Herrings taken and bought by her; and the Entry in the Journal of the Quantity of Herrings taken and bought, shall be by the Number of Barrels or Half Barrels, and not by Tale or Count.

XIV. And Whereas the Quantity of Fish is diminished by*Methods of Fishing which destroy the Spawn and Fry of Fish Be it enacted, That no Drag Net or other Sea Net which hath a Me(h of less than Three Inches and a Half from Knot to Knot, shall be made use of in catching any kind of Fish, (except Herrings, Pilchards, Sprats, Shrimps and Prawns, and small Shell Fish for Bait,) upon any Parts of the Coasts of Ireland, or within any of the Bays, Harbours, Rivers or Creeks thereof, nor shall any false or double Bottom, Cod or Paunch, or any other Net, though of legal Size, be placed upon or behind the other, in order to take and destroy small Fish; and if any Person or Persons shall make use of any Drag Net or other Sea Net which has a Me(h of less than Three Inches and a Half from Knot to Knot, in catching any kind of Fish (except Herrings, Pilchards, Sprats, Shrimps, Prawns and small Shell Fish for Bait) on any Parts of the Sea Coasts of Ireland, or within any of the Bays, Harbours, Rivers or Creeks thereof, shall place any false or double Bottom, Cod or Paunch, or any other Net, though of legal Size, upon or behind any other, in order to take and destroy small Fish; such Person or Penons so offending, and being thereof convicted, upon his or their Appearance, or Default after Summoist, before One or more Justice or Justices of the Peace of the County, or Inspector of the District where such Person or Persons so offending hath or have their usual Place of Abode, by the Oath of One or more credible Witness or Witnesses, which Oath such Justice or Justices of the Peace, or Inspector, is and are hereby empowered to administer, or by Confession of the Party offending, shall for every such Offence forfeit and lose such Net or Nets, which such Justice or Justices are hereby empowered to seize and destroy, and shall also forfeit a Sum not less than Forty Shillings, nor exceeding Ten Pounds, to be levied by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of such Justice or Justices 01 the Peace, or Inspector, before whom such Offender shall be convicted, by Distress and Sale of the Goods of such Offender, the One Moiety thereof to the Person who shall inform and prosecute for the same, and the other Moiety to go and be disposed of to the Use of the Poor of the Parish where such

Offender lives; and in case no sufficient Dist refs or Distresses can or way be had, whereout to levy the said Sum adjudged to be forfeited, that then the said Justice or Justices of the Peace, or Inspector, shall and may, by Warrant under his or their Hands and Seals, commit such Person or Persons to the Common Gaol of the County or Place where such Offender shall be convicted, there to remain for any time not exceeding Thirty Days, unless such Offender shall sooner pay the Penalty so forfeited, upon Payment whereof he shall be discharged forthwith.

XV. And Whereas Shoals of Herrings are frequently frightened from the Entrance of the Bays and Creeks, by Vessels mooring

and (hooting their Nets in improper Places, and by laying long 1 Lines for taking of Cod and Lyng across the Entrance of Bays

and Creeks, and other Irregularities Be it enacted, That no Vessel on the Coasts of Ireland shall moor or (hoot their Nets in any Places which shall be forbidden by the Inspector or other Officer to be appointed; nor shall any Person (hoot any Net or any long Line for taking of Cod, Lyng and other Fish, at any time nor in any Place which shall be forbidden by the said Inspector, or other Person duly authorised for such Purpose under the Provision9 of this Act, under a Penalty of Twenty Pounds, to be levied in lik£ manner as the other Penalties by this Act directed are appointed to be levied.

XVI. And be it further enacted, That no Nets shall be (hot or wet for the taking of Herrings in the Day time, under the Penalty of Ten Pounds, to be recovered against the Owner or Owners of such Net6, or of the Vessel from which such Nets shall be (hot or wet, and to be levied by Distress and Sale of his, her or their Goods and Chattels, by Warrant under the Hand and Seal of the Inspector or Inspectors of the Fisheries; and if there shall be no Inspector, then by Warrant of a Justice of the Peace for the County wherein the Party or Parties do reside, and before whom the Offence shall be proved by the Confession of the Party accused, or by the Oath of One or more credible Witness or Witnesses; which said Penalty, when recovered, shall be applied in such Manner and to such Uses as the other Penalties hereinbefore mentioned are to be applied.

XVII. And Whereas, notwithstanding the Laws now in force for the Regulation of the Fisheries of Ireland by the Multitude of Boats that resort to the different Places of Rendezvous, many of which shoot their Nets in the Day time, and begin to fish before the Shoals of Herrings, Pilchards or Mackerel are settled in the Bays

and Creeks where they usually resort for Shelter, there is reason to believe that the Fisheries are much injured, and that a Regulation with regard to the time of commencing the Fishery would be of great Advantage Be it enacted, That in the several Places where Inspectors or other Officers are appointed, and where Orders shall be given for the purpose by the Commissioners of the Irish Fisheries, or any Three of them, who are hereby empowered so to do, no Person shall be at liberty to shoot their Nets, until Notice for such Purpose shall be posted up by the Inspector of the District, under a Penalty of Twenty Pounds, to be levied as other Penalties in this Act directed.

XVIII. And be it further enacted, That any Vessel or Boat which shall be laden at any Port or Place in Ireland with Salt in $ulk or in Barrels, intended to be used in the curing of Herrings,

WHEREAS by an Act passed in the Thirty first Year of 3*0. a. c.ia the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second,

intituled An Act for the Encouragement of Seamen employed in the Royal Navy; and for establishing a regular Method for the punctual,

frequent and certain Payment of their Wages; and for enabling them more eqfily and readily to remit the same for the Support of their Wives and Families; and for preventing Frauds and Abuses attending such

Payments; it was declared that no Person or Persons whatsoever, §3C*

who should be employed in receiving of any Wages, Prize Money, or any other Monies due or becoming due for or upon account of the Service of any Officer, Seaman or other Person in the Royal Navy, should be entitled to take or retain more than Sixpence in the Pound for or upon account of receiving thereof and for paying the same to the Person or Persons by whom they or he

4. An Act for establishing a more easy and expeditious Method for the

punctual and frequent Payment of the Wages and Pay of certain Officers belonging to His Majesty's Navy, and by subsequent Regulations } 3*

established under His Royal Highness the Prince Regent's Order in Council, certain Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the Navy are permitted to receive Part of their Pay and Allowances by

drawing Bills upon the Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy, and same are allowed to receive the Whole of their Pay in that manner,

though it is still required of them to pass the same Documents

and Accounts annually, or on quitting a Ship: And Whereas it is expedient to amend the said Act of the Thirty first of His late Majesty George the Second Be it therefore enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent

of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act, so much of the said recited Act of the Thirty firit Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second as respects the said Allowance of Sixpence in the Pound for receiving <md paying any Wages, Prize Money, or any other Monies as aforesaid, shall be deemed to be and shall be, to all Intents and Purposes, applicable and be applied to the full Amount of the Pay and Allowances receivable by all Commissioned and Warrant Officers of His Majesty's Navy who are by Law allowed to draw Bills upon the Commissioners of His Majesty* Navy, and shall not be deemed to be limited and restricted to Monies aftuaDy and bond side passing through the Hands of the said Agents.

Compensation may have been due to Navy Agents, in respect of passing the Accounts of Commissioned and Warrant Officers having annual or other Accounts to pass, beyond the Amount of such Allowance of Sixpence in the Pound by the said recited Act

Wages, Prize Money, or other Monies as aforesaid; Be it therefore further enacted, That on all Accounts passed previously to this Act it shall and may be deemed lawful to and for Navy Agents to have made the usual. and customary Charges for patting such

paid

in the Pound to be the Charge for Agency.

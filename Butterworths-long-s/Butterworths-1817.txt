XVIII. And Whereas by the aforesaid recited Act passed in the Fifty sixth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, it is required that the Owner or Owners of any Ship, Vessel or Boat requiring a Licence shall give the necessary Security for the same,

4 at the Port to which such Ship, Vessel or Boat shall belong, and no other: And whereas it may happen that such Ship, Vessel or Boat may not be at the Port to which ffie is to belong at the time when a 4 Licence and Security shall become necessary Be it therefore enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs in England, Scotland or Ireland, or any Three or more of them respectively, in such cases, on Proof to their Satisfaction that the Mailer or Owner of such British Vessel or Boat

XIX. And Whereas it is required that the Persons who are to become Security shall be Persons approved by the Collector and Comptroller of the Customs sufficient and responsible, and it is expedient to require further Satisfaction as to such Sufficiency and Responsibility Be it therefore further enacted, That the Persons who are intended to become Security, shall make Oath before the Collector and Comptroller of the Customs (who are hereby authorized to administer the same), that they are respectively possessed of sufficient Property to answer and pay the Sum for which they intend to become Security.

XX. And Whereas it is expedient, for the more effectual Execution of the Laws now in force or hereafter to be made for the Benefit of His Majesty's Revenue of Customs, and the Suppression

been

A.D. 181JT. 57° GEO. III. C. 97.

been valued to the Crown, in the Computation of the said Purchase Money, as being exempt from all Rectorial and Vicarial'

Tithes, it was further agreed, that if the said Henry Hall Viscount Gage, his Heirs or Assigns, should not make out and deduce 6 a clear and satisfactory Title to the Tithes of the said last mentioned Lands and Woods, or to an Exemption from the Payment thereof, then and in such case the said Henry Hall Viscount Gage, his Heirs or Assigns, should either dedudl or allow unto The King's Majesty, His Heirs or Successiors, out of the said Purchase Money, i the Sum of One thousand five hundred and eleven Pounds Five Shillings, or to the Satisfaction of the said Commissioners indemnify His Majesty, His Heirs and Successiors, from any Loss, Damage,

4 Colts, Charges or Expences on account of such Tithes or any Claims or Demands in respect thereof; and it was by the Articles of Agreement expressly agreed, that nothing therein contained should extend or be construed to charge the Commissioners, Parties thereto, in their own Persons, or their or any of their own proper

Lands or Tenements, Goods or Chattels, with or for the Performance of any of the Covenants or Agreements in the said Articles of Agreement contained, but that such Covenants or Agreements

should only be enforced as against the Land Revenues of the Crown; and that all Costs, Charges and Expences which should or might become payable by reason or means of any such Covenants or Agreements, or any Breach or Non Performance thereof,

should be enforced, raised, levied and recovered by, from or out of such Revenues only, any thing in the said Articles of Agreement contained to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding: And after further reciting that it was intended to apply to Parliament in the then and now present Session for an Act to confirm the said Agreement, and to enable the Commissioners of His Majestiy's 4 Woods, Forests and Land Revenues to raise the Sums requisite to pay the several Instalments of the Purchase Money before mentioned, as they should respectively become due, by Sales of competent Parts of the Land Revenues of the Crown, it was thereby expressly provided and declared, that if such Act of Parliament as aforesaid should nut be passed in this present Session of Parliament, then the said Articles of Agreement and the Contract thereby made, and every thing therein contained, should cease,

determine and be wholly void: And Whereas from the Quantity of thriving Oak Timber now growing on the said E Hates, Manors,

4 Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments by the said Articles of Agreement agreed to be sold and disposed of, and the Facility of conveying the Timber growing thereon when cut to the Government Dock Yards by Water Carriage, and from the Contiguity of the said Estate, Manors, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments to the Royal Foreffi of Dean, whereby the same may be managed as the Crown Lands by the Officers of the said Forest at a small Expence, the same appears to be a desirable Purchase, and it is therefore expedient to make Provisions for enabling the said Commissioners, Parties to the said Articles of Agreement, to make good the Contract thereby entered into on behalf of His Majesty,

and to carry the same into Effect; and in order to have a Fund ready for the Payment of the several Instalments of the said Purchase Money as they shall respectively become due, it is expedient

X 3 4 that

that the Commissioners for the time being of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenues should be authorized and empowered to sell and dispose of certain Parts and Possessions of the Land Revenues of the Crown, to raise the Monies which will be requisite to pay the Paid Instalments as they shall become payable,

and should be enabled to apply the Monies so to be raised in the Payment thereof accordingly: And Whereas by an Act passed in 1 Ann. Stat.i. < the First Year of the Reign of Queen Anne, intitulecj An Act so?

which from and after the Twentieth Day of March One thousand seven hundred and two, should be made or granted by the said Queen, Her Heirs or Successors, Kings or Queens of this Realm,

under any of the Seals therein mentioned, or by Copy of Court Roll, or other wise howsoever, of any Manors, Messuages, Lands,

4 Body Politic or Corporate whatever, whereby any Estate or Interef! should pass from the said Queen, Her Heirs or Successors,

should be void and of none Effect, unless the same should be made for some Term or Estate not exceeding Thirty one Years or Three Lives, and unless there should be reserved by such Grants, Leases or Assurances such Rents as in the said Act is expressed; in which said Act is contained a Proviso, that where the greatef! Part of the yearly Value of any Tenements or Hereditaments which belonged to the said Queen, Her Heirs and Successors, should, at the time of making any Lease or Grant thereof, confif! of the Building or Buildings thereupon which might want to be repaired or reedified, in every such case, to encourage the Rebuilding or Reparation thereof, it was declared and enacted, that it should be lawful for the said Queen, Her Heirs and Successors, at any time after the said Twentieth Day of March One thousand seven hundred and two, to demise or grant such Tenements or Hereditaments to any Person or Persons for any Term or Eslate, so as such Term or Estate did not exceed Fifty Years or Three Lives, and so as such Lease or Grant should be made to commence from the Date or making thereof; or if such Grant or Lease should be made to take Effect in Reversion or Expedancy, that then the same, together with the Estate or Estates in Possession of and in the same Tenements or Hereditaments should not exceed Fifty Years or Three Lives from the Date or making thereof as aforesaid, and so as the same should not be made difpunishable of Waste, and so as there should be reserved and payable upon every such Lease or Grant during such Term, not exceeding Fifty Years or Three Lives, as much Rent as was by the said Act required to be reserved for the same Tenements or Hereditaments respectively in case of a Lease not exceeding One and thirty Years or Three Lives and not otherwise: And Whereas since the passing of the said Act certain Parts and Portions of the Lands and Land Revenues of the Crown, which from their unimprovable Nature, inconvenient Situation or other Circumstances, were not desirable to be held or retained, have from time to time been fold and disposed of under the Authority of divers Acts of Parliament passed for that Purpose;

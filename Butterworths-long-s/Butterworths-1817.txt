' VL And Whereas divers Persons are now'in Custody on Charges

of High Treason and Suspicion of High Treason, under Warrants

from One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, or from ( His Majesty's Privy Council, and it may be highly important that

'such Persons as have been or shall be secured and detained on such 6 Charges under and by virtue of such Warrant or Warrants should

be kept wholly separate and apart from each other, so as to prevent

all Communication between them and with other Persons, except c such Communication as His Majesty may think fit to permit, and c under such Restrictions as may be advisable, and Doubts may arise c how far the Powers of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State

to change the Places of Confinement of Persons so committed ex-

tend j and it is expedient to provide that the same shall not be so 4 exercised as to deprive the Persons so committed of any Right to be tried or discharged which they might respectively have had if

their respective Places of Confinement had not been changed P Now, to obviate all Doubts and Difficulties in respect thereof, be it further enacted and declared, That it shall be lawful for One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, as he shall fee Occasion, to order any Person committed to any Gaol or other Prison on any Charge of High Treason, Suspicion of High Treason, or Treasonable Practices, either before or after Indidftment found, to be conveyed to and detained in any other Gaol or other Prison, until discharged by due Course of Law, and to issue all Warrants necessary for such Purposes: Provided always nevertheless, that no Person who shall be removed by any such Warrant as aforesaid, shall be by means of such Removal deprived of such Right to be tried or discharged, as such Person would by Law have been entitled to if not so removed; and in every case in which any such Person would have been entitled to have been tried or discharged if such Person had continued in the Gaol or Prison to which such Person was before committed, it shall be lawful for such Person to apply to be bailed or discharged in the same Maimer as such Person might have done if such Person had remained in the Gaol or Prison to which such Person was before committed as aforesaid.

VII. And be it further enacted, That this Act shall continue in force until the First Day of July One thousand eight hundred and seventeen.

VIII. And be it further enacted, That this Act may be altered, varied or repealed by any Act or A&8 to be made in this present Session of Parliament.

And Whereas divers Persons are now in Custody on Charges 4 of High Treason and Suspicion of High Treason, under Warrants 4 from One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State or from 4 His Majesty's Privy Council, and it may be highly important 4 that such Persons as have been or shall be secured and detained 4 on such Charges underand by virtue of such Warrant or Warrants 4 should be kept wholly separate and apart from each other, so as to 4 prevent all Communication between them and with other Persons, except such Communication as His Majesty may think fit to permit, and under such Reftridlions as may be advisable; and Doubts 4 may arise how far the Powers of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries 4 of State to change the Places of Confinement of Persons so committed extend; and it is expedient to provide that the same shall 4 not be so exercised as to deprive the Persons so committed of any 4 Right to be tried or discharged which they might respectively have 4 had if their respective Places of Confinement had not been changed Now, to obviate all Doubts and Difficulties in respect thereof be it further enabled and declared, That it shall be lawful for One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, as he shall fee Occasion, to order any Person committed to any Gaol or other Prison on any Charge of High Treason, Suspicion of High Treason or Treasonable Pradlices, either before or after Indictment found, to be conveyed to and detained in any other Gaol or other Prison until discharged by due Course of Law, and to issue all Warrants necessary for such Purposes: Provided always nevertheless, that no Person who shall be removed by any such Warrant as aforesaid shall be by means of such Removal deprived of such Right to be tried or discharged as such Person would by Law have been entitled to if not so removed; and in every case in which any such Person would have been entitled to have been tried or discharged, if such Person had continued in the Gaol or Prison to which such' Person was before committed, it shall be lawful for such Person to apply to be bailed or discharged in the same manner as such Person might have done if such Person had remained in the Gaol or Prison to which such Person was before committed as aforesaid.

VII. And be it further enacted, That this Act shall continue in force until the First Day of March One thousand eight hundred and eighteen.

A.D. 1S1JT. 57* GEO. III. C. 97.

4 been valued to the Crown, in the Computation of the said Pur* 4 chafe Money, as being exempt from all Rectorial and Vicarial'

Tithes, it was further agreed, that if the said Henry Hall Viscount 4 Gage, his Heirs or Assigns, should not make out and deduce 6 a clear and satisfactory Title to the Tithes of the said last mentioned Lands and Woods, or to an Exemption from the Payment 4 thereof, then and in such case the said Henry Hall Viscount Gage, his 4 Heirs or Assigns, should either dedudl or allow unto The King's 4 Majesty, His Heirs or Successiors, out of the said Purchase Money, i the Sum of One thousand five hundred and eleven Pounds Five 4 Shillings, or to the Satisfaction of the said Commissioners indemnify 4 His Majesty, His Heirs and Successiors, from any Loss, Damage,

4 Colts, Charges or Expences on account of such Tithes or any 4 Claims or Demands in respect thereof; and it was by the Articles 4 of Agreement expressly agreed, that nothing therein contained 4 should extend or be conitrued to charge the Commissioners, Parties 4 thereto, in their own Persons, or their or any of their own proper

Lands or Tenements, Goods or Chattels, with or for the Performance of any of the Covenants or Agreements in the said Articles 4 of Agreement contained, but that such Covenants or Agreements

4 should be enforced, raised, levied and recovered by, from or out 4 of such Revenues only, any thing in the said Articles of Agree ment contained to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding: And 4 after further reciting that it was intended to apply to Parliament 4 in the then and now present Session for an Act to confirm the said Agreement, and to enable the Commissioners of His Majesfiy's 4 Woods, Forests and Land Revenues to raise the Sums requisite 4 to pay the several Inllalments of the Purchase Money before 4 mentioned, as they should respectively become due, by Sales of 4 competent Parts of the Land Revenues of the Crown, it was 4 thereby expressly provided and declared, that if such Act of Parliarnent as aforesaid should nut be passed in this present Session of 4 Parliament, then the said Articles of Agreement and the Contract 4 thereby made, and every thing therein contained, should cease,

4 and to carry the same into Effect; and in order to have a Fund 4 ready for the Payment of the several Inllalments of the said Purchase Money as they shall respectively become due, it is expedient

that the Commissioners for the time being of His Majesty's 4 Woods, Forests and Land Revenues should be authorized and empowered to sell and dispose of certain Parts and Possessions of the 4 Land Revenues of the Crown, to raise the Monies which will be 4 requisite to pay the Paid Instalments as they shall become payable,

4 and should be enabled to apply the Monies so to be raised in the 4 Payment thereof accordingly: And Whereas by an Act passed in 1 Ann. Stat.i. < the First Year of the Reign of Queen Anne, intitulecj An Act fo?

6 the Vend and Delivery of Coals within the Cities of London and 4 Westminster, and Liberties thereof and in certain Parts of the Coun-

< ties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and Essex, and for making better 4 Provision for the fame> the several Acts of Parliament hereinbefore

referred to were repealed, and other Provisions and Regulations

were made for preventing Frauds and Abuses in the Admeasure-

ment and Delivery of Coals within the Limits in the said Act ' mentioned; and by the said Act it was enatted, that the said John. 4 Baker and Alexander Tullochytht Two Persons then last nominated

and appointed by His said present Majesty, and then holding and 4 exercising the Office of Principal Land Coal Meters for the City*

of Westminster, should remain and continue such Principal Land 6 Coal Meters for the Purpose of admeasuring Coals within the 6 City and Liberty of Westminster, and for that Part of the Duchy e of Lancaster adjoining thereto, and for the several Parishes of Saint 4 Giles in the Fields, Saint Mary le bone, and for such Part of the 4 Parish of Saint Andrew Holborn as lies in the County of Middle-

fexy and for other Purposes mentioned in the said Act, save and except he or they should die or be removed from such Office or ' Offices by His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, which Removal 4 Plis Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, are thereby empowered to 6 make, until the Twenty fourth Day of June One thousand eight

hundred and seventeen, and from thence to the End of the then i next Session of Parliament: And Whereas the Regulations con-

tained in the said recited Act have been found very beneficial c to the Consumers of Coals within the Limits therein com-

prised: And Whereas the Term for which the said John Baker 4 and Alexander Tulloch were continued Principal Land Coal Meters 6 as aforesaid hath nearly expired, and His Majesty has been gra-

ciously pleased that the same should be renewed in Manner hereinafter mentioned: And Whereas Doubts have arisen whether the ' said Principal Coal Meters have the Power of suspending or dif-

missing the labouring Land Coal Meters appointed by them by

virtue of the said recited Act; and it is therefore expedient that

such Power should be expressly given to them: And Whereas by

the said recited Act of the Forty seventh Year of the Reign of His .56 G.3. c.xxi. c present Majesty, and by an Act made in the Fifty sixth Year of

' the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for preventing 4 Frauds in the Admeasurement and Delivery of Coals within the 4 several Parishes in the County of Middlesex lying between the f Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea and the Mouth of the River Colne

near Staines; and also between Limehouse Hole and the Mouth of 1 the River Lee near Blackwall; and also within the several Parjhes

in the Counties of Middlesex and Essex, adjoining to both Banks of

the River Lee and the Branches thereof between the River Thames

and Edmonton, Regulations have been made for preventing Frauds 4 in the Admeasurement and Delivery of Coals in all the Places adjoining the River Thames between the Mouth of the River Lee 4 near Blackwall and the Mouth of the River Colne near Staines, ex-

< cepting only the said Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea: And Whereas,

4 since the Establishment of the Land Coal Meter's Office for the 4 City and Liberty of Westminster, the said Parish of Saint Luke

6 CheVea hath greatly increased in Population and Buildings, and

gulations contained in the said recited Act of the Forty seventh

Year of the Reign of His present Majesty were extended to the c said Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea, they would be of great Benefit

to the Inhabitants of the said Parish, and would prevent the PrO-c visions of the said A Cl of the Forty seventh Year of the Reign ' of His present Majesty from being evaded: And Whereas, in confe-6 quence of the immediate Vicinity of the said Parish of Saint Luke 1 Chelsea to the said City and Liberty of IVefminfer, the said Parish

of Saint Luke Chelsea might with peculiar Convenience be com-1 prised within the Limits of the said Land Coal Meter's Office c for the City and Liberty of Wefminfer .*' May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,

1 LXXIX. And whereas in consequence of certain Exemptions from Toll, expressly allowed by several Acts of Parliament for His Majesty's Forces on their March, or on Duty, and for the Horses

and Carriages attending them, Doubts have arisen whether in all

cases not so exempted, the Officers and Soldiers, and the Carriages

and Horses, belonging to His Majesty or employed in His Service,

and returning therefrom, may not be charged with the Payment of Tolls; therefore, for obviating such Doubts, it is hereby enacted and declared, That all His Majesty's Officers and Soldiers, and their Horses, on Duty or on their March, and all Carriages and Horses belonging to His Majesty, or employed in His Service, and returning therefrom, or employed in His Service, when conveying the Officers,

Soldiers, Servants, Women, Children, or other Persons of or belonging to His Majesty's Forces, or the Arms, Clothe3, Accoutrements,

Tents, Baggage and other Equipage, of or belonging to His Majesty*

Forces on their Marches, or any Ordnance, or Barrack, or Commis-fariat or other Public Stores of or belonging to His Majesty, or for the Use of His Majesty's Forces, or returning therefrom, were and are, and shall be exempted from Payment of any Duties and Tolls otherwise demandable by virtue of any Act of Parliament already made, or hereafter to be made, for Persons, Horses or Carriages passing Turnpike Roads or Bridges, unless by such Act it has been or shall be expressly provided that the said Officers, Soldiers, Carriages and Horses, ' are and shall be liable equally with others to the Duties and Tolls therein authorised to be demanded and taken

Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall exempt from the Exception* Payment of Tolls any Boats, Barges or other Vessels employed in conveying the Officers, Soldiers, Servants, Women, Children or other Persons of or belonging to His Majesty's Forces, or the Arms,

Clothes, Accoutrements, Tents, Baggage and other Equipage, of

or belonging to His Majesty's Forces, or any Military. Stores, along any Canal, but the same shall be liable to Toil in like manner as other Coats, Barges and Vessels are liable thereto.

LXXX. And whereas the respective Sums of Money by this Act appointed to be paid to the Constables by the Officers demanding

such Carriages, Horses, Boats, Barges or other Vessels, may not,

in many cases, be sufficient to answer the Charge and Expence of

providing the same, insomuch that the said Constables may frequently be at great Charges over and above what is received by them of the said Officers, to the great Burthen of the Townships

of which they are Constables, or else the Persons providing such

Carriages are grievously oppressed For Remedy whereof, and that the said Overplus Charge may be borne by each County or Riding at the general Charge of such County or Riding; Be it

filiation from Corn or Grain in Great Britain, it was enacted, that that Act should commence and take Effect as to all such Matters and Things therein contained, in respect whereof no special Commencement is thereby directed or provided, from and immediately after the Eighth Day of February One thousand eight hundred and twelve, and should remain and continue in force during the Term that the Distillation of Spirits from Corn or Grain should be and remain in force: And whereas it was by the said Act intended that the same should remain and continue in force during the Term that the Prohibition of the Distillation of Spirits from Corn or Grain should be and remain in force, but proper Words for that Purpose were by Mistake left out of the said Clause, and it is therefore expedient to rectify the said Mistake; Be it therefore enacted, That ExpUiaed. the said Act shall be deemed and taken to have commenced and taken Effect as to all fuen Matters and Things therein contained, in Tefpeft whereof no special Commencement is thereby directed or provided, from and immediately after the Eighth Day of February One thousand eight hundred and twelve, and to have been in force, and shall remain and continue in force during the Term that the Prohibition of the Distillation of Spirits from Corn or Grain shall be mnd remain in force; any thing in the said recited Act to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

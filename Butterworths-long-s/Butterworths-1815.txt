An Act for enabling His Majesty to grant to John Francis Erskine of Mar Esquire, and his Heirs and Assigns, the Feu Duties and Quit Rents arising in the Lordship of Stirlings in Discharge of a Debt of greater Value created upon the said Feu Duties by a Grant from His Majesty King George the First.

[iith/«/y813.]

WHEREAS an Act was passed in the First Year of the 1G. 1, Stit.a.

4 Reign of His Majesty King George the First, intituled An c* 5°*

4 A3 far appointing Commt/foners to esquire of the Estates of certain Traitors, and of Popish Recusants, and of Estates given to super-

fit ions lifts, in order to raise Money out of them severally for the Use of the Public: And Whereas Hi* said Majesty was, by the said Act empowered to make Provision for the Daughter of John Earl of Mar, who was attainted for his Accession to the Rebellion

in the Year One thousand seven hundred and fifteen, out of Hi*

Estates, which were forfeited to The Crown: And Whereas His said Majesty George the First did, in pursuance of the said recited Act, in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and sixteen, grant to Lady Frames Erskine, the only Daughter of th*

said John Earl of Mar, a Portion or Sum of Ten thousand Pounds,

together with the due and customary Interest for the same, to be payable forth of the said Earl of Mar*3 forfeited Estates, beginning the First Term's Payment of the said Interest at Martinmas One thousand seven hundred and sixteen; and in Security of the said Sum and Interest thereof. His Majesty disponed the forfeited

Estates of the said Earl, and the Feu Duties of the Lordship of Stirling, which belonged to The Crown, declaring always that the said Estates and Feu Duties should be redeemable by The Crown, on Payment of the said Portion or Sum of Money, and the Annual Rent whfch should be due thereon at the time of the Redemption t 4 And Whereas John Francis Erskine Esquire of Mar (the Son and Heir of the Ibid.Lady Frances Erskine), and who now claims to be entitled to the said Portion, and the Money remaining due thereon, and Interest thereof, has applied, by Petition, to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury in relation to the same, and for an Account to be taken of the Arrears remaining unpaid under the said Grant: And Whereas the Barons of His Majesty* Court of Exchequer in Scotland have reported that the Earl of Mar*a Estates were fold in the Year One thousand seven hundred and Twenty four, and produced little more than sufficient to pay off the preferable Debts thereon, and that a very small Sum having been obtained towards the Extin ftion of the Ten thousand1 4 Pounds, granted by His Majesty King George the First to the said Lady From* £tfihef and that the only-Security, therefore, whichr

Proprietors of Lands in Lordship of Stirling, not subject to higher Fen

remained for Payment of such Sum, and which was declared by the Commissioners of Forfeited Estates, to amount, on the Fifteenth

Day of August One thousand seven hundred and twenty four, to

Nine thousand two hundred and fourteen Pounds Seven Shillings

and Seven pence Halfpenny, were the Feu Duties of the Lordship

of Stirling, which, as they belonged to The Crown, were not fold along with the Earl of Mar*s Estates j and that ever since that time the said Lady Frances Erskine, and the said John Francis Erskine Esquire of Mar her Son, have continued to collect these Duties payable out of the Lordship of Stirling, towards Payment of the above mentioned Sum of Nine thousand two hundred and fourteen Pounds Seven Shillings and Seven pence Halfpenny; but, from the Amount of these Feu Duties being for many Years less than the legal Interest of the above mentioned Sum, the Sum has increased very considerably during the long Period the same has been due, and if now calculated, with Interect, would amount to a Sum of about Twenty eight thousand Pounds, and which if greater than the Value of the Feu Duties at the ordinary Rate of Purchase: And Whereas the said John Francis Erjleine is willing and desirous to take the Feu Duties of the Lordship of Stirling in full Discharge of the before mentioned Sum and Interest thereon,

and it is therefore expedient that His Majesty should be empowered to grant the Feu Duties of the Lordship of Stirling in full Discharge, and in lieu of the said Portion, and all Arrears thereof, upon certain Terms and Conditions

May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by The King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for His Majesty to give, grant and dispone to the said John Francis Erskine Esquire of Mar, and to his Heirs and Assigns, all and whole the Feu Duties of the Lordship of Stirling, formerly payable to the said Lady Franca Erskine, and to the said John Francis Erskine, or to the Chamberlains of the said Lordship, by the Proprietors of Lands, Tenements and others, lying within the Sheriffdoms of Stirling, Perth and Clackmannan, and all Arrears due thereon, he the said John Francis Erskine, or his Heirs or Assigns, giving to His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, a full and complete Discharge and Acquittance of the said principal Sum of Nine thousand two hundred and fourteen Pounds Seven Shillings and Seven pence Halfpenny, and all Arrears of Interest due, or which may be claimed thereon, in such Formas shall be directed and approved by the Chief Baron and Barons of His Majesty's Court of Exchequer in Scotland; and which Discharve and Acquittance shall be entered and enrolled in the Offices of The King's Remembrancer and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, and in such other Offices in the said Court as the Barons shall direct.

6 the Vend and Delivery of Coals within the Cities of London and Westminster, and Liberties thereof and in certain Parts of the Coun-

ties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and Essex, and for making better Provision for the fame> the several Acts of Parliament hereinbefore

referred to were repealed, and other Provisions and Regulations

were made for preventing Frauds and Abuses in the Admeasure-

of Westminster, should remain and continue such Principal Land 6 Coal Meters for the Purpose of admeasuring Coals within the 6 City and Liberty of Westminster, and for that Part of the Duchy e of Lancaster adjoining thereto, and for the several Parishes of Saint Giles in the Fields, Saint Mary le bone, and for such Part of the Parish of Saint Andrew Holborn as lies in the County of Middle-

fexy and for other Purposes mentioned in the said Act, save and except he or they should die or be removed from such Office or ' Offices by His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, which Removal His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, are thereby empowered to 6 make, until the Twenty fourth Day of June One thousand eight

hundred and seventeen, and from thence to the End of the then i next Session of Parliament: And Whereas the Regulations con-

tained in the said recited Act have been found very beneficial c to the Consumers of Coals within the Limits therein com-

prised: And Whereas the Term for which the said John Baker and Alexander Tulloch were continued Principal Land Coal Meters 6 as aforesaid hath nearly expired, and His Majesty has been gra-

ciously pleased that the same should be renewed in Manner hereinafter mentioned: And Whereas Doubts have arisen whether the ' said Principal Coal Meters have the Power of suspending or dif-

missing the labouring Land Coal Meters appointed by them by

virtue of the said recited Act; and it is therefore expedient that

such Power should be expressly given to them: And Whereas by

the said recited Act of the Forty seventh Year of the Reign of His .56 G.3. c.xxi. c present Majesty, and by an Act made in the Fifty sixth Year of

' the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for preventing Frauds in the Admeasurement and Delivery of Coals within the several Parishes in the County of Middlesex lying between the f Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea and the Mouth of the River Colne

near Staines; and also between Limehouse Hole and the Mouth of 1 the River Lee near Blackwall; and also within the several Parjhes

cepting only the said Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea: And Whereas,

6 CheVea hath greatly increased in Population and Buildings, and

( the Houses and Streets therein adjoin to and communicate with

certain Parts of the City and Liberty of Westminster: And c Whereas the Provisions of the said Act of the Forty seventh Year

of His present Majesty are liable to be greatly evaded by carrying c Coals landed in the said Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea into the City 6 and Liberty of Westminster; and it is apprehended that if the Re-

gulations contained in the said recited Act of the Forty seventh

Year of the Reign of His present Majesty were extended to the c said Parish of Saint Luke Chelsea, they would be of great Benefit

to the Inhabitants of the said Parish, and would prevent the PrO-c visions of the said A Cl of the Forty seventh Year of the Reign ' of His present Majesty from being evaded: And Whereas, in confe-6 quence of the immediate Vicinity of the said Parish of Saint Luke 1 Chelsea to the said City and Liberty of IVefminfer, the said Parish

advanced Prices of Provender and every other Article relative to

Coaches and Horses, been found in some Instances to be infuiS-

cient, and otherwise objedionable in consequence of the Difficulty 4 of calculating the same: And whereas it is therefore expedient

that the Rates and Fares enumerated and set forth in all former 4 Acts of Parliament should be repealed, and others substituted in 4 lieu thereof; May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be 4 enacted and be it enacted b/the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same.

One Shilling for going and One Shilling for returning, over and above his regular Fare:

VII. c And whereas it hath frequently occurred, that Persons c hiring and taking Hackney Coaches to VauxhalU or other Places

of publick Resort, and elsewhere, have directed the Drivers thereof < to wait, and have not returned, to the great Loss and Prejudice of

the Owners of such Coaches $ for Remedy whereof, ' be it further, enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act it shall be lawful for every Hackney Coachman so hired and taken, and directed to wait, and they are hereby empowered to a(k, demand, and receive of and from the Person or Persons so hiring and directing them to wait as aforesaid, a reasonable Sum in Hand, over and above the Fare to which they respectively shall be entitled for driving thither, the Sum so received to be accounted for when every such Coach shall be finally discharged* '

VIII. ' And whereas by the Laws now in force, Hackney Coach-

men are not obliged or compellable to go with Persons desirous of*

hiring their Coaches, provided they shall have been out Twelve Hours: And whereas Hackney Coachmen have been oftentimes

improperly Summoned toanswer for Refusal, to the great prejudice ' and Loss both of themselves and their Matters; ' be it therefore further enacted, That every Hackney Coachman who shall, in civil and explicit Terms, declare to any Person or. Persons desirous to engage his Coach, either that he hath been at work Twelve Hours with his Coach and Horses, or that he is adualiy hired, and shall afterwards, notwithstanding such Reply, be summoned to answer. for Refusal, and shall, upon the hearing of the Complaint, produce Sufficient Evidence to prove that he had been then Twelve Hours at

IX.*And whereas the Owners of Hackney Coaches, regularly9licensed, have been heretofore greatly prejudiced and aggrieved by

the Interference of the Owners or Drivers of the stated figured

Stages with the regular Street-work of Hackney Coaches; for Re-1 medy whereof/ be it further enacted, That no Owner or Driver of any stated figured Stage, on his Way to London, shall take up any Person as and for a Passenger in his Coach after he shall have entered the paved Streets of London or Westminster, or the Borough of Southwark, at any of the Extremities thereof respectively; nor shall any such Owner or Driver of any such stated figured Stage, on his Re* turn into the Country, take up any Person as and for a Passenger in his Coach, for the Purpose ot fettmg down such Passenger in any of the paved Streets of London or Westminster, or Borough of South-waarl, such Owner or Driver well knowing at the Time when he shall take up such Passenger that it is his Intention to get out of such Stage in any of the paved Streets of London or WcBminster, or Borough of Southwark, under a Penalty for every such Offence of any Sum not exceeding Three Pounds nor less than Twenty Shillings, in the Discretion of the Commissioners for licensing Hackney Coaches, or the major Part of them, before whom any Complaint in this Behalf shall be heard; or if any Person, being an Qwner of such stated figured Stage, shall offend a Second Time in this Behalf, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, or the major Part of them, before whom such Complaint shall be heard, and they are hereby empowered to revoke the Licence of such Owner so offending more than once; yet nevertheless, so that no such Owner or Driver shall be liable to any Penalty for any such Offence, if any Person whom he shall have so taken up and set down in any of the paved Streets of London or Westminster, or the Borough of Southwark, shall have previously taken his Place for the Country at One of the regular Booking Houses, and paid the full Fare accordingly.

CAP. CIV.

An Act for the better Regulation of Pilots, and of the Pilot* age of Ships and Vessels navigating the British Seas.

[25th June 1808.]

WHEREAS Ships and Vessels have frequently been wreeked, and many Lives and much Property have been loft, from the ' Ignorance and Misconduct of Persons taking Charge of such Ships or Vessels as Pilots: And whereas the Corporation of Trinity ' House of Deptford Strond have, as well by Usage for more than ' Three Centuries as by Grants from the Crown, and under the Au- thority of an Act passed in the Fifth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second, been empowered to appoint Pilots, Loadfmen, or Guides, to conduct Ships or Vessels into and ' out of and upon the River of Thames through the North Channel to or by Orfordnefs and round the Long Sand Head through the

§ueen*s Channel or other Channels into the Downs9 and from and by rfordnefs, and up the North Channel, and up the Rivers Thames ana Medway9and the several Creeks and Channels belonging or run- ning into the same, and to make such Orders and Constitutions as*should be needful for the wholesome Government of Seafaring ' Men and Maintenance and Increase of Navigation, and of all Sea-« faring Men within the said River of Thames; in pursuance of which Powers the said Corporation have from Time to Time appointed a sufficient Number pr Pilots for the Purposes before mentioned: And whereas there hath been Time out of Mind, and now is, a«Society or Fellow ship of Pilots of the Trinity House of Dover9 Deal9 and the Ijlc of Thanet9 who have had the Pilotage and Load* # manage of all Ships from the said Places up the Rivers Thames and

Medway; which said Society or Feilowship have been confirmed by

various Acts of Parliament for regulating the Pilots of the Society 4 or Fe'llowfiiip of Pilots of Dover, Deal, and the IJlt of Thane!f 4 commonly called Cinque Port Pilots, notwithstanding which many

Persons not having Licence or Authority, or competent Know-

ledge or Experience, have taken upon themselves to act as Pilots 4 for conducing Ships or Vessels to and from and upon the said Rivers, to the great Hazard of such Ships or Vessels and their Cafgoes, and the Lives of their Crews: And whereas the Provisions of

the said Acts have been found inadequate to the Regulation of

Pilotage and the Prevention of such Mischiefs, and it is therefore ' necessary that further and more efiedual Regulations should be made

for that Porpose, and that all the Provisions and Regulations relating to the several Descriptions of Pilots aforesaid should be repealed: And whereas Acts of Parliament have been passed for efta-

blifiiing separate and peculiar Jurisdictions in relation to Pilotage in «certain Ports and on different Parts of the Coast of England, which

by reason of the same being limited have been found infnfficient to 4 answer the good Purposes intended thereby, and it is therefore 4 necessary that more effectual Regulations should be made in relation

to Pilotage on the Coasts of England: And whereas it is necessary

for duly enforcing the Laws respecting Quarantine, on which the 4 Health of His Majesty's Subjects euentially depends, that the 4 Names and Places of Residence of all Pilots in England should be

known by those whose Duty it is to convey Information respecting

those Laws from Time to Time to them: May it therefore pleale 4 Your Majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all

of Great Britain, the said'Duties, granted by the Act of the Fifth 4 and Sixth Years of King William and Queen Mary, were continued 4 for One Year more after the Expiration of the said Ninety-six Years,

and were made payable throughout the whole Kingdom of Gre.zt 4 Britain, and the same .Duties were afterwards made perpetual by ' an Act of the First Year of the Reign of King George the Fidl;

in force; And whereas Scotland not being any longer entitled, under 4 the Act of Union, to an Exemption from the Amount of the Stamp

in England and Scotland, upon all Deeds and Instrumenis common ? to both, the Duties upon all such Deeds and Instruments are ' equalized in the Schedule hereunto annexed; and itlbeing reasonable,

that Scotland should have some other Exemption, by way of Equivalent for the A mount of the Duties granted by the said Act of the

ftruments in life there, for the completing or renovating of Titles to ? Lands and other heritable Subjests, are, in the said Schedule liere-f unto annexed, reduced from Fourteen Shillings to Seven Shillings:

in lieu of the present Houses* most of which are. con(lru£ted chiefly of Wood, and arc in a ruinous State, producing, with the Remainder of the said Premises, a present gross Rental to the Lessees of about Three thousand two hundred Pound* only per annum

and also for the Conilru&iori of other respectable Buildings in the Line of the said intended Roads, and the making of other Roads or Streets to communicate with the before mentioned intended Roads; ail which might be effected, if His said Royal Highness ' was empowered to grant Leases of the said Premises, upon such Terms as might be for the mutual Benelit of His said Royal Highness and His Successors: And whereas the said Premises called Prince's Meadows* contain altogether, by Admeasurement, Twenty eight Acres, Three Roods, and Ten Perches of Land, or thereabout, and comprize witlkin the Limits thereof a Range of Wharfs, with Two Bargehouses, altogether abutting upon the '.River Thames* to the Extent of One thousand two hundred and ' fifty two Feet, or thereabout, behind which Wharfs an'd Bar^ehoulos there is a narrow Road or Street, called the Narrow Wall,

passed in the Thirty third Year of the Reign of His present Ma. 3j/;. a. e.; g. jesty, intituled An Act to enable His Royal Highness George Prince of Wales to make Leases, Copies and Grants of Offices, Lands and Hereditaments, Parcel of His said Royal Highness's Duchy of Comwall, or annexed to the same; and for the other Purposes therein mentioned; His said Royal Highness, in addition to the ordinary Powers thereby veiled in His said Royal Highness, of making Leases and Grants for the Term of Thirty one Years, or for Terms of Years

determinable upon Three Lives, is further empowered to ma^e Leases and Grants of any Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments, Parcel of the Possessions of the said Duchy of Cornwall or annexed to the same, for any Term of Years not exceeding the Term of Ninety nine Years, expressly for the Purpose of improving the same,

by erecting substantial Buildings thereon, or for the Purpose of improving Waste Lands by Cultivation or otherwise; provided that upon all such Leases or Grants so to be made for Terms exceeding Thirty one Years, or exceeding the usual Term determinable upon Three Lives, improved Annual Ground Rents should be 'referred, payable to His said Royal Highness, or to such as should 'have the Inheritance or other Ellate of the said Duchy; and that in all such Cases no Fine or other Consideration should be taken by His said Royal Highness, further or other than the improved Annual Ground Rents so directed to be reserved as aforesaid: And whereas the said before recited Provision against the taking of Fines 1 in all Cases of Leases or Grants to be made by His said Royal Highness for Terms exceeding Thirty one Years, or exceeding the usual Term determinable upon Three Lives, was not intended to deprive His Royal Highness of the accustomed Benefit of Fines to be received, in the ordinary Course of granting Renewals in like Manner as such Fines might now be received by His said Royal Highness, in respect to the said Premises called Prince's Meadows, by confining the future Leases or Grants thereof to such Terms of Years as, with the existing Terms therein, would not exceed the ' ordinary Period of Thirty one Years, but which Period is of a,

Duration too limited to afford sufficient Encouragement for the 'erecting of any substantial Buildings, whillt the continuing so to grant the said Premises for short Terms of Years will not only

have the Effect of excluding them from the Improvement whereof they are from Situation susceptible, but may at the same time occasion the said Premises to remain an Interruption to any general Plan for the Improvement of the Neighbourhood, which at present stands so much in Need thereof: And whereas it would not be aduLable, under the Circumstances before mentioned, to make any immediate Leases or Grants of the said Premises called Prince's 4 Meadows y for such Term only as, with the exilting Term or Terms therein, would fill up the same to the ordinary Period of Thirty one years, more especially as the said Premises could not be made to produce, m4fcr a Lease or Leases to be granted for such limited Term of Years, a greater Income than the Sum of Four thousand two hundred Pounds Yearly, clear of all Ont-goings, whilR 'under a Lease or Leases to be granted for extending the Term to

tioned; His said Royal Highness, in addition to the ordinary Powers*thereby veiled in His said Royal Highness, of making Leases and Grants for the Term of Thirty one Years, or for Terms of Years

determinable upon Three Lives, is further empowered to ma^e Leases and Grants of any Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments, Parcel of the Possessions of the said Duchy of Cornwall or annexed to the same, for any Term of Years not exceeding the Term of Ninety nine Years, expressly for the Purpose of improving the same,

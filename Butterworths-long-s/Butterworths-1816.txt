Class respectively, that Appropriations should be made out of the Civil List Revenues, in the manner herein after directed;* Be it therefore further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Lord High Sums appropri-Treasurer, or the Commissioners of the Treasury for the time being, atedto Payment or any Three or more of them, and they are hereby required, at the ciafleT^Civil Commencement of every Quarter, or within a Period not exceeding j and to be Thirty Days from the Commencement of each Quarter, by Warrant applied in the under their Hands, to direct what Sums shall respectively be set First Instance in apart and appropriated, in the Receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer, Payment thereout of the Quarterly Revenues of the Civil List, for the Purpose J^ftr* of defraying the several Charges upon the respective Gaffes thereof; payments, but so as that the Sum to be appropriated to the Sixth Class do not exceed One fourth Part of the estimated annual Amount of that Class, as specified in the Schedule to this Act annexed; and so that the Sums to be appropriated to the other of the Gaffes in any One Quarter be equal to One fourth Part of the estimated Amount of such Class, together with any Saving which may have accrued upon the said Class in the preceding Quarter; and the several and respective Sums, in the said Warrant directed to be set apart and appropriated, shall be so set apart by the Auditor of the Receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer, and be appropriated to the respective Claffe8 accordingly; and each and every Sum so set apart and appropriated, shall in the First Instance be applied in the Payment of all the unsatisfied Charges of every Description of the Class in respect of which such Appropriation shall have been made, in Preference to any other Charges whatever upon His Majesty's Civil List Revenues j and no Part thereof shall on any Account whatever be applied for any other Purpose, or in Aid of any other of the Gaffes of the Civil List, or of any other of the Charges thereon, except in the manner herein after provided; any thing contained in the said recited Act of the Twenty second Year aforesaid, or any other Act or Acts of Parliament to the contrary notwithstanding; but in case the actual Charge of any Class or Gaffes of the Civil List shall exceed the Sum which may have been appropriated thereto, then such Exceeding shall and may be issued out of any Money in the Exchequer arising from His Majesty's Civil List Revenues, which may not have been appropriated to any particular Class or Gaffes of the Civil List.

V. And Whereas it is expedient that the Income as well as the Charge of His Majesty's Civil List Revenues should, as far as may be practicable, consist of such Sums as are fixed and certain in their Amount, and that so much of the said recited Act of the Twenty third Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, as ena£ls, that the Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury shall direct the Surplus of the Fees and Gratuities, Specified in the said Act, to be carried to the Account of the Monies applicable to the Use of His Majesty's Civil Government and to the Sinking Fund, in the Pro- portions in the said Act specified, should therefore be repealed Be it further enacted, That so much of the said Act as is above recited shall be and the same is hereby repealed; and that from and after the passing of this Act, there shall be applied to the Civil List Revenues, out of the Surplus of such Fees and Gratuities, the Sum of Forty eight thousand Pounds per Annum, by even and equal Quarterly Payments; and the Remainder of such Surplus shall go and be carried to the said Consolidated Fund.

VII. And Whereas it may frequently happen that Pensions, 4 Fees and Salaries may be directed to be paid at the Exchequer, in cases where the Parties entitled to such Pensions, Fees and Salaries, 4 may have died previously to the Day up to which such Payments may have been directed, by which the Money becomes appropriated in the Hands of the proper Officers of the Exchequer, and cannot be applied to any Purposes whatever without the Authority of Parliament: And Whereas it is expedient that Authority should be given to the Lord High Treasurer, or Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, or any Three or more of t^em for the time

388 C. 68. 56° GEO. III. A.D. 1816.

[Eleven Ounces Two Penny-weights fine, &c.;]

Coins of this Kingdom; and such Silver Coin, Plate, Bullion or Manufacture so brought or delivered, shall be assayed at the said Mint, and melted down and coined with all convenient Speed, into Silver Coins of a Standard in Fineness of Eleven Ounces Two Pennyweights of fine Silver, and Eighteen Pennyweights of Alloy in the Pound Troy, and in Weight after the Rate of Sixty six Shillings to every Pound Troy, whether the same be coined in Crowns, Half Crowns, Shillings or Sixpences, or Pieces of a lower Denomination; and that as soon as conveniently may be after any such Silver Coin, Plate, Bullion or Manufacture respectively, so brought to the Mint, shall be melted and assayed, there shall be delivered to the Person bringing in and delivering the same a Sum in Silver Coins, of Crowns, Half Crowns, Shillings or Sixpences, after the Rate of Sixty two Shillings of the Standard Fineness and Weight hereinbefore mentioned, for every Pound Troy of Standard Silver of the Fineness aforesaid, by such Person brought and delivered into the Mint, and so proportionably for a greater or lesser Weight;

[of which Sixty two Shillings per Pound shall be delivered to the Party bringing in the Bullion, and Four Shillings retained for Assaying, Loss and Coinage.]

XI. And Whereas at various times heretofore the Coins of this Realm of Gold and Silver have been equally a legal Tender for Payments to any Amount, and great Inconvenience has arisen from both those precious Metals being concurrently the Standard Measure of Value, and equivalent for Property; and it is expedient that the Gold Coin made according to the Indentures of the Mint should henceforth be the sole Standard Measure of Value and legal Tender for Payment, without any Limitation of Amount, and that the Silver Coin should be a legal Tender to a limited Amount only, for the Facility of Exchange and Commerce;

[Gold Coin declared the only legal Tender;]

Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, the Gold Coin of this Realm shall be and shall be considered and is hereby declared to be the only legal Tender for Payments (except as herein after provided) within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland;

[being the Weight and Fineness of the Mint Indenture.]

A.D. 1816. 56° GEO. III. C. 68. 589

Weight and Fineness are hereby declared to be and shall remain to be the Standard of and for the lawful Gold Coin of the Realm, so far as relates to Gold Coins of the Denominations at present in use, and specified in the said Indenture; and in case any Gold Coin or Coins of any other Denomination shall hereafter be coined at the said Mint under any future Indenture, such Gold Coin and Coins shall hold the like Standard in Fineness as the Gold Coins of the present Denominations, and shall hold such Weight as shall be proportionate to the Weight of the present Gold Coins, according to the Value for which such Gold Coin or Coins of any new Denomination shall be declared to be current.

XII. And Whereas it is expedient that the Silver Coin of the Realm should be a legal Tender by Tale, according to its Denomination, to any Amount not exceeding the Sum of Forty Shillings; Be it therefore enacted,

[14 G. 3. c. 42. §1. and other Acts as herein mentioned, repealed after a Day to be named in The King's Proclamation for that Purpose.]

That from and after such Day as shall be for that Purpose named in any Proclamation, which at any time after the passing of this Act shall be made and issued, by or on behalf of His Majesty, with the Advice of His Majesty's Privy Council, so much and such Parts of the Act made in the Fourteenth Year of His present Majesty's Reign, intituled An Act to prohibit the Importation of Light Silver Coin of this Realm from Foreign Countries into Great Britain or Ireland, and to restrain the Tender thereof beyond a certain Sum, as enacts or provides or may be construed to enact or provide, that any Tender in Silver Coin of the Realm shall be legal to the Amount of Twenty five Pounds, or a Tender for any greater Sum, according to its Value by Weight, and also so much of any Act and Acts whereby the said last recited Act is continued, revived or made perpetual, shall be, and the same is and are hereby repealed accordingly:

[Current Gold Coin shall not be received or paid for more or less than its Value, according to its Denomination.]

XIII. And be it further enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, no Person shall by any Means, Device, Shift or Contrivance whatsoever, receive or pay for any Gold Coin lawfully current within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, any more or less in Value, Benefit, Profit or Advantage, than the true lawful Value which such Gold Coin doth or shall by its Denomination import; nor shall utter or receive any Piece or Pieces of Gold Coin of this Realm, at any greater or higher Rate or Value, nor at any less or lower Rate or Value than the same shall be current for in Payment, according to the Rates and Values declared and set upon them pursuant to Law; and that every Person who shall offend herein shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a Misdemeanor, and being thereof convicted by due course of Law, shall suffer Imprisonment for the Term of Six Calendar Months, and shall find Sureties

And be it further enacted, That if any Person who shall be convicted of receiving or paying any such Gold Coin contrary to this Act, shall afterwards be guilty of the like Offence, the Clerk of the Assize or Clerk of the Peace for the County, City or Place where such Conviction was so had, shall, at the Request of the Prosecution or any other Person on His Majesty's behalf, certify such Conviction, for which Certificate Two Shillings and Sixpence, and no more, shall be paid; and such Certificate being produced in Court, shall be sufficient Proof of such former Conviction.

[Indictments not to be traversed.]

XV. And be it further enacted, That no Person against whom any Bill of Indictment shall be found at any Assizes or Sessions of the Peace for any Offence against this Act, shall be entitled to traverse the same to any subsequent Assizes or Sessions; but the Court at which such Bill of Indictment shall be found shall forthwith proceed to try the Person or Persons against whom the same shall be found,

[Proviso.]

unless he, she or they shall shew good cause, to be allowed by the Court, why his, her or their Trial should be postponed.

[On Prosecution, not necessary to prove Money lawful.]

XVI. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That on any Prosecution or Trial of any Offender or Offenders hereafter to be prosecuted or tried for any Offence against this Act, it shall not be necessary to prove that the Gold Coin received or paid or uttered contrary to this Act, is the Current Gold Coin of this Realm, but the same shall be deemed and taken so to be, if received or paid or uttered as such, until the contrary thereof shall be proved to the Satisfaction of the Judge, Justice or Court before whom any such Offender or Offenders shall be prosecuted or tried.

An Act to make certain Provisions for modifying the several Acts for imposing and levying of Fines, in respect of unlawful Distillation of Spirits in Ireland.

[1st July 1816.]

« ^IT WHEREAS it is expedient to make certain Provisions for \\ regulating the imposing Fines in respect of illicit Distillation < of Spirits in Ireland;* Be it therefore enacted by The King’s hjoft Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful for any Person in Ireland, other than a Person duly licensed as a Distiller or Brewer, to have or keep in his or her Custody or Possession any Worts, Walh or Pot Ale (except for the Purpose of being made into Beer for the private Use of such Person, Proof of which shall lie on such Person), nor for any Person other than a licensed Distiller, to have or keep in his or her Custody or Possession any Low Wine9 or Singlings whatever; and that it shall not be lawful for any Person to be Owner or Proprietor, or Part Owner or Proprietor, of any Still, other than such Person as shall be a licensed Distiller or Partner of such licensed Distiller, or a Brazier duly licensed to make or repair Stills, or Person otherwise duly authorized by Law; and that it shall not be lawful, for. aDy Person to have,

receive or derive any Benefit, UTe, Profit or Advantage, of or from any Still, Still Head or Worm of a Still kept, used and worked in any Place not being the Distillery of a Distiller duly licensed, or of or from any Worts, Wash, Pot Ale, Low Wines, Singlings or Spirits, made, brewed, fermented or distilled in any Place not being the Distillery of a Distiller duly licensed; and if any Person shall at any time after the passing of this Act have or keep in his or her Custody or Possession any Worts, Wash, Low Wines or Singlings, or shall be Owner or Proprietor, or Part Owner or Proprietor of any Still, Still Head or Worm of a Still, or shall have, receive or derive any Benefit, Use, Profit or Advantage of or from any Still, Still Head or Worm of a Still, or of or from any Worts, Wash, Pot Ale, Low Wines, Singlings or Spirits contrary to the Provisions of this Act, every such Person shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of a Misdemeanor, and it shall and may be lawful for any Justice of the Peace within his Jurisdiction, on Information on Oath of any such Offence, to issue his Warrant for the Apprehension of such Person or Persons, and on Examination into the Complaint, to commit such Person to Gaol, there to remain until delivered by due Course of Law; and in case any Indictment shall be found against such Person or Persons, he, she or they shall plead thereto without having time to traverse the fame; and it shall be lawful for the Court before whom such Person or Persons shall be tried and convicted, to inflict such Punishment on such Person or Persons, for the first Offence, as may by Law be inflicted on Persons guilty of Misdemeanor, and for the Second Offence, to sentence such Person so convicted to be transported for the Term of Seven Years, or instead thereof it shall be lawful for the said Court to inflict either for the first or further Offence such Punishments as are respectively herein after provided.

II. And Whereas from the great Number of dissolute and dif- orderly Persons who have been convicted and imprisoned for the

Offence of carrying on illicit Distillation, many of the Gaols in

Ireland are so crowded as not only very much to endanger the

Health of the Prisoners, but also to increase the Depravity of their

Morals; and it is therefore expedient under certain Regulations

to provide other Places of Confinement for them: And Whereas € it will tend to avoid the crowding of Gaols, and also to the Re- formation of such Offenders, that they should be employed, under

certain Regulations, on Works for the Benefit of the Rivers and € Harbpurs of Ireland Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, whenever any Person shall be convicted of a Misdemeanor under this Act, or any other Act or Acts for the Suppression of illicit Distillation in Ireland, or shall be convicted of any Offence under this Act, or any of the said Acts, for which lie shall be liable to be transported, it shall and maybe lawful for the Court before whom any such Person shall be so convicted, if such Court shall think fit, in the Place of any other Punishment for such Misdemeanor, or in the Place of such Punishment by Transportation, to order and adjudge that such Offender, appearing to be of competent Age and free from any bodily Infirmity, shall be punished by being kept for such Term, not exceeding Two Years, in cases of any First Offence, and not exceeding Five Years in cases of any Second or further Offence, as such Court shall think fit, to

An Act to regulate the binding of Parish Apprentices.

[2d July

WHEREAS many Grievances have arisen from the binding of poor Children as Apprentices by Parish Officers to im- proper Persons, and to Persons reading at a Distance from the Parishes to which such Poor Children belong, whereby the said Parish Officers, and the Parents of such Children, are deprived of the Opportunity of knowing the manner in which such Children are treated, and the Parents and Children have, in many Initances* become estranged from each other; and also from the Permission given to'Apprentices, by the Persons to whom such Apprentices have been bound, to serve otheta without a formal Assignment, 4 whereby the Discretion to be exercised by Magistrates in placing out Apprentices to suitable Persons, is frequently rendered of no avail:9 For Remedy whereof, be it enacted by The King’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the First Day of 0Sober in the Year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, before any Child shall be bound Apprentice by the Overseers of the Poor of any Parish, Township or Tlace, such Child shall be carried before Two Justices of the Peace of the County, Riding, Division or Place wherein such Parish, Township or Place shall be situate, who shall enquire into the Propriety of binding such Child Apprentice to the Person or Persons to whom it shall be proposed by such Overseers to bind such Child; and such Justices shall particularly esquire and consider whether such Person or Persons reside, or have his, her or their Place or Places of Business within a reasonable Distance from the Place to which such Child shall belong, having regard to the Means of Communication between such Praces, or whether any Circumstances shall make it fit, in the Judgement of such Justices, that such Child should be placed Apprentice at a greater Distance; and if the Father or Mother of such Child shall be living, and shall reside^in or near the Place to which such Child shall belong, such Justices shall (if they fee fit) examine such Father or Mother, or either of them, and shall particularly esquire as to the Distance of the Residence or Place of Business of the Person or Persons to whom it shall be proposed to place such Child, and the Means of Communication therewith; and such Justices shall also enquire into the Circumstances and Character of such Person or Persons; and if such Justices shall, upon such Examination and Enquiry, think it proper that such Child should be bound Apprentice to such Person or Persons, such Justices shall make an Order, declaring that such Person or Persons is or are fit Person or Persons to whom such Child may be properly bound as Apprentice, and shall thereupon order that the Overseer or Overseers of the Place to which such Child shall belong, shall be at liberty to bind such Child Apprentice accordingly; which Order shall be delivered to such Overseer or Overseers, as the Warrant for binding such Child Apprentice as aforesaid, and such Order shall be referred to by the Date thereof, and the Names of the said

to some Parish or Place which shall be more than Forty Miles from the City of London, in which case it shall be lawful for the Justices

who shall authorize the apprenticing of such Child to make a special

Order for that Purpose, in which Order such Justices shall distinctly specify the Grounds on which they shall think fit to allow

of the apprenticing of such Child to a Person or Persons refidingr

or having an Establishment in Trade, at a greater Distance than Forty Miles from the Parish or Place to which such Child shall belong.

II. And be it further enacted, That in all cases where the Refi- Indenture to be dence or Establishment of Business of the Person or Persons to whom allowed by Two any Child shall be bound, shall be within a different County or Jurisdiction of the Peace, from that within which the Place by the which Ay^ren-Officers whereof such Child shall be bound shall be situated, and tice is to be

V. And be it further enacted, That no Settlement shall be gained by any Child who shall be bound by the Officers of any Parish, Township or Place, by reason of such Apprenticeship, unless such Order shall be made, and such Allowances of such Indenture of Apprenticeship shall be signed, as hereinbefore directed.

VI. And be it enacted, That in case any Overseer or Overseers shall bind an Apprentice to any Person or Persons, without having obtained such Order and such Allowances as hereinbefore required, and in case any Person or Persons shall receive any such Apprentice as so bound, without such Order and Allowances having been first obtained, the said Overseer or Overseers, and the said Person or Persons, shall each respectively forfeit the Sum of Ten Pounds, for each Apprentice so bound, to be recovered as the Penalties herein after given are directed to be recovered.

VII.

VIII. And be it further enacted, That if any Person or Persons to whom any Child shall be bound Apprentice by the Overseers of the Poor of any Parish or Place, shall after the said First Day of 08ober remove his, her or their Residence or Establishment of Business, out of the same County or Forty Miles from the Parish or Place wherein the same was when such Child was bound Apprentice, such Person or Persons shall, at lead Fourteen Days previous to such Removal, give a written Notice thereof to the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor of the Place where such Apprentice shall then reside, unless such Person or Persons shall reside in such Place under Certificate; and in that case such Persons shall give the like Notice to the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor of the Place where such Apprentice shall then be legally settled, and which Churchwardens and Overseers, and also the Master or Masters, Mistress or Mistresses of such Apprentice, shall cause such Apprentice to appear before Two of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County or Distri& within which such Apprentice shall be then serving, who shall esquire whether it may be fit and proper that such Apprentice should continue in the Service of such Person or Persons, or be discharged therefrom, or bound or assigned over to any other Person or Persons, and shall thereupon make order, either for the Continuance of such Apprentice with such Person or Persons, or for the Discharge of such Apprentice, or for the binding or assigning of such Apprentice to any other Person, as to them in their Discretion shall seem meet, and if they shall see fit, shall also require the Person or Persons so giving Notice'of Removal, to pay the Amount of the Premium received with such Apprentice, or such Portion of it as to them shall seem meet, for the Expence of assigning or binding such Apprentice to any other Person, to be approved by the said Justices; and the person or Persons to whom

t

56° GEO. III. C. 139.

689

A.D. 1816.

such Apprentice shall be so bound or assigned, shall be subject to the same Rules and Regulations as the Person or Persons to whom such Apprentice shall be originally bound; and in case any such Matter or Matters, Mistress or Mistresses, shall remove as aforesaid, and shall take any such Apprentice to any other Place, without such Order as aforesaid, or shall wilfully abandon and leave any such Apprentice, without giving such Notice as aforesaid, every Person so offending shall forfeit the Sum of Ten Pounds for every such Apprentice, to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the Parish, Township or Place, wherein, at the time of such Removal or Taking, the Apprentice shall have been legally settled, for the Use of the Poor of the same Parish, Township or Place; provided an Information shall be exhibited for such Offence within Three Calendar Months next after the Commission of the same.

IX. And Whereas it may be expedient, that those to whom

Parish Apprentices are bound or assigned should be empowered to

place out or assign over such Apprentice to others, and it is pro-

per that such placing out or Assignments should in all Instances

be under the Inspection and Controul of the Magistrates; and it is

fit that the Person to whom such putting out or Assignment shall be made, and also the Apprentice, shall be made subject to the ordinary Jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, with respect to Matters and Parish Apprentices; and it is inexpedient that any Matter or € Mistress should in any way discharge or dismiss from his or her Ser-

vice, any Parish Apprentice without the Consent of such Justices ;* Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the First Day of October in the Year One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, it shall not be lawful for any Master or Mistress to put away or transfer any Parish Apprentice to any other, or in any way to discharge or dismiss from his or her Service any Parish Apprentice without such Consent of Justices, as is directed in an Act passed in the Thirty second Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for the further Regulation of Parish Apprentices; and that no Settlement shall be gained by any Service of such Apprentice, after such putting away or Transfer, unless such Service shall have been performed under the Sandlion of such Consent as aforesaid.

X. And be it further enacted, That any Person or Persons, who, after the First Day of October in the Year One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, shall put away or transfer any Parish Apprentice to another, or who shall in any way discharge or dismiss from his or her Service any Parish Apprentice without such Consent as aforesaid, shall forfeit a Sum not exceeding Ten Pounds, for every Apprentice so transferred.

c XI. And Whereas the salutary Provisions enacted by an Act passed in the Forty third Year of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, intituled An Act for the Relief of the Poor,

are frequently evaded in the binding out of Poor Children, and the Premium of Apprenticeship, or a Part thereof, is clandestinely

provided by Parish Officers, who are thus enabled to bind out

such Poor Children without the Sandlion of Justices of Peace Be it further enacted, That after the said First Day of October,no Indenture of Apprenticeship by reason of which any Expence whatever shall at any* time be incurred by the Public Parochial Funds, shall be valid and effectual, unless approved of by Two Justices of the

XIV. And be it further enacted, That in case of Nonpayment of any Penalty hereby imposed* the same shall be levied by Distress and Sale of the Offender’s Goods and Chattels, by Warrant under the Hands and Seals of the Justices before whom such Offender shall have been convicted, or of any other Two Justices of the Peace of the same County or District; and for want of such Distress, such Offender shall be committed to the Common Gaol or House of Correction for any Period not less than One, nor more than Six Months, to be appointed by the Justices before whom such Offender shall be convicted.

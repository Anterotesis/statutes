from the then low Price of Silver Bullion, owing to temporary

Circumstances, a small Quantity of Silver Bullion had been brought to the Mint to be coined, and that there was reason to suppose that a still further Quantity might be brought, and that it

XL And Whereas at various times heretofore the Coins of this Realm of Gold and Silver have been equally a legal Tender for

Payments to any Amount, and great Inconvenience has arisen from both those precious Metals being concurrently the Standard Mea-

sure of Value, and equivalent for Property; and it is expedient 1 that the Gold Coin made according to the Indentures of the Mint should henceforth be the foie Standard Measure of Value and legal Tender for Payment, without any Limitation of Amount, and that the Silver Coin should be a legal Tender to a limited Amount only,

XII. And Whereas it is expedient that the Silver Coin of the Realm should be a legal Tender by Tale, according to its Denomination, to any Amount not exceeding the Sum of Forty Shillings Be it therefore enacted, That from and after such Day as shall be for that Purpose named in any Proclamation, which at any time after the passing of this Act shall be made and issued, by or on behalf of His Majesty, with the Advice of His Majesty’s Privy Council, so much and such-Parts of the Act made in the Fourteenth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, intituled An Act to prohibit the Importation of Light Silver Coin of this Realm from Foreign Countries into Great Britain or Ireland, and to refrain the Tender thereof beyond a certain Sum> as enacts or provides or may be construed to enact or provide, that any Tender in Silver Coin of the Realm shall be legal to the Amount of Twenty five Pounds, or a Tender for any greater Sum, according to its Value by Weight, and also so much of any Act and Acts whereby the said last recited Act is continued, revived or made perpetual, shall be, and the same is and are hereby repealed accordingly: And that from and after such Day as shall be for that Purpose named in any such Proclamation to be made and issued as aforesaid, no Tender of Payment of Money made in the Silver Coin of this Realm, of any Sum exceeding the Sum of Forty Shillings at any one time, shall be reputed a Tender in Law, or allowed to be a legal Tender within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, either by Tale or Weight of such Silver Coin or otherwise howsoever; any thing in the said recited Act of the Fourteenth Year of His present Majesty’s Reign, or in any other Act or Acts in force immediately before the passing of this Act, or any Usage or Custom to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.

of July One thousand eight hundred and sixteen (a), and several

of such Duties have been and are further continued, but the Duty on Malt thereby imposed will cease and expire on the Fifth Day of

July One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, and Doubts may arise whether by the Continuance of such Duties as aforesaid, the

said Drawback in respect of the Exportation of Beer is also con-

tinued For the Prevention and Removal of such Doubts, be it declared and enacted by The King’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Drawback in respect of the Ex-

Ktion of Beer does and shall wholly cease and expire on the Day of July One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, and shall be no longer paid or payable, any thing in any other Act or Acts of Parliament in the present or any other Session of Parliament to the contrary notwithstanding.

« ^IT WHEREAS it is expedient to make certain Provisions for \\ regulating the imposing Fines in respect of illicit Distillation < of Spirits in Ireland;* Be it therefore enacted by The King’s hjoft Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful for any Person in Ireland, other than a Person duly licensed as a Distiller or Brewer, to have or keep in his or her Custody or Possession any Worts, Walh or Pot Ale (except for the Purpose of being made into Beer for the private Use of such Person, Proof of which shall lie on such Person), nor for any Person other than a licensed Distiller, to have or keep in his or her Custody or Possession any Low Wine9 or Singlings whatever; and that it shall not be lawful for any Person to be Owner or Proprietor, or Part Owner or Proprietor, of any Still, other than such Person as shall be a licensed Distiller or Partner of such licensed Distiller, or a Brazier duly licensed to make or repair Stills, or Person otherwise duly authorized by Law; and that it shall not be lawful, for. aDy Person to have,

receive or derive any Benefit, UTe, Profit or Advantage, of or from any Still, Still Head or Worm of a Still kept, used and worked in any Place not being the Distillery of a Distiller duly licensed, or of or from any Worts, Wash, Pot Ale, Low Wines, Singlings or Spirits, made, brewed, fermented or distilled in any Place not being the Distillery of a Distiller duly licensed; and if any Person shall at any time after the passing of this Act have or keep in his or her Custody or Possession any Worts, Wash, Low Wines or Singlings, or shall be Owner or Proprietor, or Part Owner or Proprietor of any Still, Still Head or Worm of a Still, or shall have, receive or derive any Benefit, Use, Profit or Advantage of or from any Still, Still Head or Worm of a Still, or of or from any Worts, Wash, Pot Ale, Low Wines, Singlings or Spirits contrary to the Provisions of this Act, every such Person shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of a Misdemeanor, and it shall and may be lawful for any Justice of the Peace within his Jurisdiction, on Information on Oath of any such Offence, to issue his Warrant for the Apprehension of such Person or Persons, and on Examination into the Complaint, to commit such Person to Gaol, there to remain until delivered by due Course of Law; and in case any Indictment shall be found against such Person or Persons, he, she or they shall plead thereto without having time to traverse the fame; and it shall be lawful for the Court before whom such Person or Persons shall be tried and convicted, to inflict such Punishment on such Person or Persons, for the first Offence, as may by Law be inflicted on Persons guilty of Misdemeanor, and for the Second Offence, to sentence such Person so convicted to be transported for the Term of Seven Years, or instead thereof it shall be lawful for the said Court to inflict either for the first or further Offence such Punishments as are respectively hereinafter provided.

II. And Whereas from the great Number of dissolute and dif- orderly Persons who have been convicted and imprisoned for the

Offence of carrying on illicit Distillation, many of the Gaols in

Ireland are so crowded as not only very much to endanger the

Health of the Prisoners, but also to increase the Depravity of their

Morals; and it is therefore expedient under certain Regulations

to provide other Places of Confinement for them: And Whereas € it will tend to avoid the crowding of Gaols, and also to the Re- formation of such Offenders, that they should be employed, under

certain Regulations, on Works for the’Benefit of the Rivers and € Harbpurs of Ireland Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the passing of this Act, whenever any Person shall be convicted of a Misdemeanor under this Act, or any other Act or Acts for the Suppression of illicit Distillation in Ireland, or shall be convicted of any Offence under this Act, or any of the said Acts, for which lie shall be liable to be transported, it shall and maybe lawful for the Court before whom any such Person shall be so convicted, if such Court shall think fit, in the Place of any other Punishment for such Misdemeanor, or in the Place of such Punishment by Transportation, to order and adjudge that such Offender, appearing to be of competent Age and free from any bodily Infirmity, shall be punished by being kept for such Term, not exceeding Two Years, in cases of any First Offence, and not exceeding Five Years in cases of any Second or further Offence, as such Court shall think fit, to

56° GEO. III.

C. 139.

A.D. 1816.

such Apprentice shall be so bound or assigned, shall be subject to the same Rules and Regulations as the Person or Persons to whom such Apprentice shall be originally bound; and in case any such Matter or Matters, Mistress or Mistresses, shall remove as aforesaid, and shall take any such Apprentice to any other Place, without such Order as aforesaid, or shall wilfully abandon and leave any such Apprentice, without giving such Notice as aforesaid, every Person so offending shall forfeit the Sum of Ten Pounds for every such Apprentice, to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the Parish, Township or Place, wherein, at the time of such Removal or Taking, the Apprentice shall have been legally settled, for the Use of the Poor of the same Parish, Township or Place; provided an Information shall be exhibited for such Offence within Three Calendar Months next after the Commission of the fame.

IX. And Whereas it may be expedient, that those to whom

Parish Apprentices are bound or assigned should be empowered to

place out or assign over such Apprentice to others, and it is pro-

per that such placing out or Assignments should in all Instances

be under the Inspection and Controul of the Magistrates; and it is

fit that the Person to whom such putting out or Assignment shall

be made, and also the Apprentice, shall be made subject to the ordinary Jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, with respect to Matters and Parish Apprentices; and it is inexpedient that any Matter or € Mistress should in any way discharge or dismiss from his or her Ser-

vice, any Parish Apprentice without the Consent of such Justices ;* Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the First Day of October in the Year One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, it shall not be lawful for any Master or Mistress to put away or transfer any Parish Apprentice to any other, or in any way to discharge or dismiss from his or her Service any Parish Apprentice without such Consent of Justices, as is directed in an Act passed in the Thirty second Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled An Act for the further Regulation of Parish Apprentices; and that no Settlement shall be gained by any Service of such Apprentice, after such putting away or Transfer, unless such Service shall have been performed under the Sandlion of such Consent as aforesaid.

X. And be it further enacted, That any Person or Persons, who, after the First Day of October in the Year One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, shall put away or transfer any Parish Apprentice to another, or who shall in any way discharge or dismiss from his or her Service any Parish Apprentice without such Consent as aforesaid, shall forfeit a Sum not exceeding Ten Pounds, for every Apprentice so transferred.

c XI. And Whereas 'the salutary Provisions enacted by an Act

passed in the Forty third Year of the Reign of Her Majesty

Queen Elizabeth, intituled An Act for the Relief of the Poor,

are frequently evaded in the binding out of Poor Children, and

the Premium of Apprenticeship, or a Part thereof, is clandestinely

provided by Parish Officers, who are thus enabled to bind out

such Poor Children without the Sandlion of Justices of Peace Be it further enacted, That after the said First Day of October,no Indenture of Apprenticeship by reason of which any Expence whatever shall at any* time be incurred by the Public Parochial Funds, shall be valid &nd effectual, unless approved of by Two Justices of the
